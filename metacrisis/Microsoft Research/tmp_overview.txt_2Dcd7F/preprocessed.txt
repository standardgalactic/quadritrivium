Checking Microsoft Research/The Thousand Brains Theory.txt
1. The discussion revolved around the complexity of implementing artificial neural networks that mimic the human brain's architecture and function. Traditional artificial neural networks are simplistic compared to biological brains, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) being somewhat inspired by biology but still missing most of the complexity found in the cortex.

2. Jeff Hawkins and Numenta have proposed a new theoretical framework for understanding how the brain processes information, which was presented at conferences and published in December 2018. This framework suggests that the brain's structure and function are more intricate than what current AI models, including CNNs, incorporate.

3. The Numenta paper outlines a model where each cortical column has many different types of synapses with various roles, such as time-based pattern recognition, memory, prediction, attention, and more. This model also includes hierarchical processing similar to how feature detectors work in CNNs but on a much more sophisticated level.

4. The researchers are seeking collaboration from the AI community to develop intelligent systems that better reflect the brain's architecture. They believe that this new understanding of the brain will lead to significant advancements in machine intelligence.

5. The attendees were encouraged to review Numenta's papers and consider the implications for their work, as well as to reach out to the researchers directly for further discussion and potential collaboration.

6. The conversation highlighted the importance of understanding neuroscience in depth to inform AI development and suggested that current AI systems are missing most of the biological inspiration that could lead to truly intelligent machines.

7. Numenta's work is relatively new and was received well at recent conferences, indicating a strong potential for impact in the field of AI research. The attendees were reminded that they can contact Numenta through the provided email addresses for further engagement with this groundbreaking research.
