Is that all of this paper you mentioned, one of the latest
in the talk?
It's the 2018 one.
Yeah, if you go to numenta.com, there's a paper section.
So they're all listed there.
That was in front of you in December, didn't it?
Yeah.
You probably have to run for lunch with Eric.
OK.
OK.
Eric, we don't have to leave.
OK.
Yeah.

Unfortunately, we'll have to extract this a little bit.
You got our emails, addresses there?
So please free to reach out and interact with them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
