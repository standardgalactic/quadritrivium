Checking 3Blue1Brown/Bayes theorem, the geometry of changing beliefs.txt
1. The Linda problem is an example that illustrates how human intuition about probability can be flawed. When asked if it's more likely for a woman named Linda who is active in the feminist movement to be a bank teller or a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement, most people incorrectly believe the latter is more likely. This error occurs because people tend to think in terms of sets rather than proportions.

2. The error can be mitigated by framing the question in terms of individuals within a known total number (e.g., out of 100 people, how many are bank tellers versus feminist bank tellers?). This approach makes it easier for people to correctly visualize and calculate probabilities based on proportions.

3. Probability, at its core, is the math of dealing with uncertainty, and it often involves calculating proportions. Bayes' theorem, a fundamental principle in probability theory, can be understood as a statement about how to update beliefs based on new evidence, considering the proportion of cases where both the hypothesis and the evidence are true.

4. The debate over Kahneman and Tversky's experiments often centers around the ambiguity of the context and the nature of the person (Steve) being referred to. Different assumptions about Steve can lead to different priors, which in turn affect the conclusions drawn from the experiments.

5. Understanding probability through visual and concrete examples, such as using geometric representations or real-world scenarios, can help clarify abstract concepts and improve intuition about how to update beliefs in light of new evidence.

In summary, human intuition about probability is often incorrect but can be improved by considering the problem in terms of proportions or areas and by understanding Bayes' theorem as a way to update beliefs based on evidence. The Linda problem and related thought experiments serve as valuable tools for illustrating these concepts and highlighting how our intuitive reasoning can deviate from rational probability calculations.

Checking 3Blue1Brown/Convolutions ｜ Why X+Y in probability is a beautiful mess.txt
1. **Convolution as a Graphical Representation**: We've discussed two ways to visualize the convolution of two functions f and g, which correspond to adding two random variables X and Y with the constraint that their sum x + y is fixed. The first visualization is the three-dimensional graph that encodes all probability densities for every possible outcome of X and Y. The second visualization is a diagonal slice over the line x + y = c, which represents all probability densities for outcomes subject to this constraint.

2. **Diagonal Slices as Convolution**: The diagonal slices we're looking at in the second visualization are equivalent to the product graph of f and g. This means that the shape of the convolution of f and g can be observed by looking at these slices. However, there is a scaling factor involved: due to the properties of the transformation, the actual areas under these slices that represent the convolution outputs need to be adjusted by a factor of 1/(√2) for accurate calculations.

3. **Symmetry in Convolution**: The convolution operation is symmetric; f convolved with g is the same as g convolved with f, which is made more visually apparent by the diagonal slice representation.

4. **Practical Application - Adding Two Normally Distributed Random Variables**: When adding two normally distributed random variables, especially when they have the same standard deviation, the properties of these distributions make it possible to use visualizations like the diagonal slices in a more active role in calculating the result, rather than just for understanding.

5. **The Central Limit Theorem**: The example of adding two normally distributed random variables ties into the broader concept of the central limit theorem, which states that the sum of many independent random variables tends toward a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution, provided it has a finite mean and variance. This is why convoluting two normal distributions results in another normal distribution with a mean equal to the sum of the means of the original distributions and a variance equal to the sum of the variances.

6. **Visualization as a Teaching Tool**: The visualizations used here, especially the diagonal slices, serve as powerful teaching tools that can help deepen our understanding of complex mathematical operations like convolution and their properties.

In summary, convolution as a mathematical operation for combining two functions or probability density functions has been illustrated using both conventional notation (integrals) and visual representations (3D graphs and diagonal slices). The diagonal slices offer a clear and symmetrical view of the convolution process, which can be particularly useful for understanding and visualizing the outcome of adding two normally distributed random variables.

Checking 3Blue1Brown/Exponential growth and epidemics.txt
1. The spread of an infectious disease like COVID-19 can be modeled using mathematical equations that account for factors such as exposure and the proportion of the population already infected.
2. In a random shuffling model, where individuals are exposed to a random subset of the world's population daily, the growth of new cases initially follows an exponential curve but eventually levels off as it approaches the total population size.
3. The inflection point on a logistic curve marks the transition from increasing growth to stable or decreasing growth in new cases. At this point, the growth factor (ratio between successive daily new cases) is approximately one.
4. A growth factor greater than one indicates that the disease is still spreading exponentially, while a growth factor near or just above one suggests that the spread is slowing down and nearing its peak.
5. Real-world scenarios are more complex due to clustering within local communities, but the underlying principles of exponential growth remain relevant when there's some level of travel or mixing between these clusters.
6. The spread of the disease can be mitigated by reducing exposure through limiting gatherings and travel, as well as by implementing measures like increased hand washing.
7. Exponential growth is highly sensitive to the growth rate; a decrease in the daily infection rate from 15% to 5% results in a drastic reduction in projected total cases.
8. The key to controlling an epidemic lies in reducing both the exposure and the infection rate, which can significantly alter the trajectory of the disease's spread.

Checking 3Blue1Brown/The medical test paradox, and redesigning Bayes' rule.txt
1. Bayes' rule has different representations, and understanding both the odds formulation and the probability formulation is important for a comprehensive grasp of its applications.
   2. The odds formulation clearly separates the impact of the prior probabilities from the test accuracy metrics (sensitivity, false positive rate), which can be particularly useful when dealing with multiple tests or evidence.
   3. The odds formulation also avoids potential misinterpretations that can arise from phrases like "9% false positive rate." Instead, a Bayes factor provides a clear measure to update beliefs based on test results.
   4. The probability formulation, on the other hand, combines both the prior probabilities and the test accuracy into a single expression, which can be more intuitive for some people when thinking about sample populations.
   5. Both formulations have their merits, and the choice between them can depend on the context of the problem and the user's preference for intuition versus clarity in separating prior beliefs from test results.
   6. It's important to recognize that Bayes' rule is a powerful tool for updating probabilities based on new evidence, and understanding it deeply can lead to better decision-making in various contexts.
   7. As an aside, the concept of paradoxes is fascinating and can be explored in depth through books like Matt Cook's "Paradox: The Trail of Pulses," where I contributed a chapter on whether math is invented or discovered. This book connects various paradoxical ideas across different fields.

Checking 3Blue1Brown/The quick proof of Bayes' theorem.txt
1. **Bayes' Theorem Explanation via AND Operation:**
   - The video explains Bayes' theorem by focusing on the logical operation "AND" in probability, particularly for two events A and B.
   - The question is posed: What is the probability that both A and B occur?
   - There are two approaches to consider this joint probability:
     - First, calculate the probability of A occurring and then find the proportion of those outcomes where B also occurs (P(B|A)).
     - Second, calculate the probability of B occurring and then find the proportion of those outcomes where A also occurs (P(A|B)).
   - Both approaches should yield the same result due to the commutative property of multiplication. This insight is a quick way to understand why Bayes' theorem works mathematically.

2. **Understanding vs. Application:**
   - Understanding Bayes' theorem as a mathematical identity can be more straightforward when it's framed in terms of updating beliefs with evidence, as it aids memorization and application.
   - The goal is to recognize when Bayes' theorem is the appropriate tool to use from a wide range of mathematical concepts.

3. **Misconception about Independence:**
   - A common misconception is that the probability of two events occurring (like both you and your brother dying of heart disease) can be calculated by multiplying their individual probabilities (P(A) × P(B)).
   - This misconception arises from the incorrect assumption that the events are independent, like flipping two coins or rolling two dice where each event is not influenced by the previous one.
   - In reality, if the events are correlated (as in the heart disease example), their joint probability must be calculated using conditional probabilities, which Bayes' theorem addresses.

4. **The Importance of Context:**
   - Many introductory probability examples involve independent events (dice rolls, coin flips), which can mislead people into thinking all event probabilities are calculated this way.
   - However, the most interesting and substantial applications of probability often involve dependent or correlated events, where Bayes' theorem is essential.

In summary, Bayes' theorem provides a framework for calculating the probability of one event occurring given that another event has already occurred, taking into account the dependencies between events. Understanding its relevance in scenarios where events are not independent is crucial, as it corrects the misconception that the joint probability of two correlated events can simply be found by multiplying their individual probabilities.

Checking 3Blue1Brown/Thinking outside the 10-dimensional box.txt
 The video explains how to visualize and understand higher-dimensional spaces using an analogy with sliders representing each coordinate dimension. In two dimensions, if you were to draw a square that bounds four equal circles (each sharing equally the space allocated to one dimension), the center of this square is twice as far from any corner of the square as any point on the circle is from its own corner. This relationship extends into higher dimensions.

In 10 dimensions, for example, if each dimension has an equal share of the space, the point that maximizes this sharing (where all sliders are set to '2') represents the center of the "real estate" available to a sphere in 10 dimensions. The radius of this hypersphere can be calculated and is approximately 2.16 times the distance from the origin. This is because each dimension contributes equally to the space occupied by the point, which is much further away from the center than one might intuitively expect.

The video uses this slider analogy to help viewers grasp the concept that in higher dimensions, shapes like spheres can grow extremely large relative to their bounding boxes, and the proportion of the shape contained within these boxes decreases exponentially as the number of dimensions increases. This visualization aids in understanding properties of high-dimensional shapes and makes it easier to discuss them in a more concrete way.

The slider analogy is a tangible representation of abstract mathematical concepts and helps bridge the gap between intuition and higher-dimensional reasoning. It demonstrates that while we may not be able to visualize higher dimensions directly, we can still think about them visually by using analogies that resonate with our spatial understanding. This approach can make the study of higher dimensions more accessible and less abstract, allowing for a deeper exploration of geometry in higher dimensions.
