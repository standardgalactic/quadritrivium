1. The question pertains to how we can measure the similarity between empirical observations and simulations, particularly in terms of learning words or concepts in the brain.
2. To address this, researchers often integrate a specific generative model with empirical data from electrophysiology, looking for well-established neural responses like mismatched negativities (MMN) or P300 that have been consistently observed in the literature.
3. In the presentation, a deep model of iconic reading was designed to elicit both MMN and P300 responses. The model predicted that unexpected changes at a lower level (like a font change) would evoke a quick, low-level surprise response, while changes at a higher level (like a semantic violation) would trigger a more protracted contextual update, associated with the P3b component of the P3 response.
4. An ideal test for this hypothesis would involve comparing the belief updating and neural dynamics in a simulated brain (in silico) with those of a real human brain performing the same task. This would allow researchers to look for correlations between the two systems.
5. In practice, techniques like dynamic causal modeling (DCM) can be used to measure effective connectivity over time during an EEG paradigm, allowing researchers to compare the types of learning observed in simulations with those observed in the brain. This way, we can determine if the changes in connectivity and belief updating in the model are consistent with what occurs in the human brain.
