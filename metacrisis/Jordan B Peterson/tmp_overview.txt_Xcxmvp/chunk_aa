Processing Overview for Jordan B Peterson
============================
Checking Jordan B Peterson/Perception： Chaos and Order ｜ Dr. Karl Friston ｜ EP 298.txt
 Throughout the conversation, Dr. Karl Friston and your host discussed the interplay between cognitive flexibility, creativity, and the structures of our mental models. Dr. Friston described how our higher-level beliefs act as barriers that can be made more permeable to allow for greater creativity and the exploration of new ideas. This concept is akin to reducing the height of barriers in a free energy landscape, which makes it easier for one's thought processes or prior beliefs to jump from one idea (or 'minima') to another, potentially leading to more functional outcomes.

The host pointed out that this approach aligns with the idea that we should maintain a state of openness to new information, thus allowing our narratives about ourselves and the world to evolve. The best narrative, according to this view, is one that remains open to ongoing exploration and adaptation.

Dr. Friston's work suggests that our brains are constantly updating their models of the world based on incoming sensory data and prior beliefs. This process can be seen as a way of navigating the border between chaos and order, which is fundamental to adaptive being.

The host expressed a desire to continue the conversation with Dr. Friston and even suggested reaching out to Robin Carhart-Harris for further discussion on related topics. The host also announced that they would continue their conversation with Dr. Friston on the DW plus site, where they plan to delve deeper into how individuals develop successful paths through life by examining the process behind their narrative unfolding.

In closing, the host invited the audience to follow along with this exploration of cognitive processes and their implications for personal growth and success. They encouraged everyone to stay tuned for the full conversation on dailywireplus.com.
