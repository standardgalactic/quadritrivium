say that that's a perfect example of a shared narrative and you crucially point out that you're
talking about theory of mind and one of the easiest ways to get to theory of mind is just to
commit to the hypothesis that you are very much like me so what I would feel if I sensed what
you sensed is going to be a very good proxy for my inference about your feelings and of course
making inferences about you just is theory of mind I also wonder whether you're going to
develop that argument sort of your almost pre stages of Piagetian development just to
know how a newborn infant starts to make sense of its world and the very emergence of selfhood
that self is distinct from mum or the rest of the world getting into notions of motor babbling
you know babies that will rattle their toys to say yes I caused that as opposed to mum causing
that yeah so you know I think that what you're talking about the the Newmont being the ability
to actually recognize oh you are another that is like me and if we can share the same narrative then
there is some not only a a deep connection and a communication but also very sophisticated theory
of mind that would be the Newmont but en route you've actually described a mechanism as say a
structure learning learning the structure of this this hierarchical world model or self model
that entails the emergence of selfhood in and of itself you know in order for me for us to take
turns we both have to have this fantasy that I am me and you are you and I have to recognize I am me
and you are you and we have to take turns so now it's your turn right so those are the axiomatic
preconditions of that game and the axiomatic preconditions some of them are you exist as a
separate entity and I exist as a separate entity but we can be joined together in a shared vision
and one of the just for those of you who are watching and listening to understand is well this is true
and we establish a shared two people establish a shared narrative and that shared narrative
simplifies the world and that simplification constrains entropy then that shared narrative
constrains terror and so you might say well why is it possible to be calm in the presence of
someone else given their infinite complexity and also their almost infinite capacity for mayhem
and the answer well it is well insofar as the two of you establish and inhabit a shared narrative
then all that entropic complexity is constrained by the desire let's say to keep the shared narrative
intact and then you might also point out that if you and I our shared narrative might be
it would be worthwhile to have an interesting conversation because both of us might learn
something and we might have the opportunity to bring a bunch of other people along for the ride
which seems like a good additional bonus and so we both come to this conversation with that
story in mind and then we can play the game as a consequence and even though we don't know each
other because we assume goodwill on each other's part not only are we not anxious in each other's
presence apart from whatever additional relevant features might have to do with being on a podcast
but we can also take some pleasure in joint movement towards the shared goal because
the dopamine system to me seems to indicate progress towards a shared to the instantiation
of a vision it's something like that and then if you're acting in a manner that makes the vision
appear to me making itself manifest then that's rewarding and that reward has a
an existential element a phenomenological element you can feel it feels good but then the dopamine
what it does neurochemically seems to be to track the neural systems that were activated
just prior to the manifestation of the success and make them grow
and so once you establish a shared narrative if you negotiate it successfully you also increase the
probability that the neural architecture manifesting that vision making that
manner vision manifest in skill and apprehension is more likely to dominate in the future more likely
to take priority in the future yeah you you no no go go ahead well no i'm just noting you've
you've now sort of brought in dopamine as an important neurochemical
part of the anatomy of sense making and and exchange so i just wanted to acknowledge that because
in my world the way that one might describe that and interpret all the empirical evidence
is very much along the line of this notion of pursuing a narrative and in this instance
a dyadic narrative or a narrative about how i should behave in a dyadic context and if everything
if i resolve my uncertainty and just to open brackets just to come back to your nice observation
about we might learn something from this exchange i think that speak to that to that novelty bonus
you were talking about a bonus and certainly in machine learning this information gain this
epistemic affordance that is part of the good narratives and the good paths into the future
would be seen exactly as this sort of novelty bonus so that is part of the reward so if in
this exchange we are both realising you use the word instantiating instantiating or realising
committing to the right narratives literally a narrative of verbal exchange or linguistic
exchange here and that secures a resolution of uncertainty about what you think or indeed about
what i think then that will be rewarding in the sense that it's minimising uncertainty minimising
expected surprise minimising if you like entropy in the sense that you originally introduced it
so i think that's an important if you like generic thing concept that you bring to the
table here that all these ways of looking at good narratives and good engagement with the world
i think are all very internally consistent especially when placed in terms of interpersonal
interactions and they also actually have biophysical correlates in our brains and you've
identified a really important one which which is dopamine and we could talk about and i suspect
you would want to talk about what's special about dopamine relative to all the other chemicals
are responsible for message passing and belief propagation and sort of getting the the hierarchical
fantasies aligned in order to explain what i'm sensing what i'm hearing and indeed what i'm saying
so so do you do you want to elaborate on the rule of dopamine i'd be more than happy to hear
what you have to say about that so because we talked about a surprise minimisation but this is
this is reward and reinforcement and so and and the and the propagation of growth and that can
happen artificially i mean if you dose yourself with cocaine you can produce a cocaine seeking
narrative that's instantiated in your brain and that's actually what constitutes the addiction
in some sense it's a cocaine seeking personality that's a unit dimensional monster that now comes
to dominate your neurophysiology in conditions of deprivation that's a very bad idea it's you
you've you've you've generated an internal parasite that's fed on this externally applied
chemical but so if you could elaborate on the role of dopamine i'd be more than happy to hear
what you what you have to say about that yeah absolutely um just picking up on that nice notion
of a cocaine addiction being sort of parasitic i i think that's absolutely right it's sort of
almost as if there's been a short circuit a hijacking of the normal mechanisms that we would
you know our brains would certainly bring bring to the fore to actually choose and register the
choice of the right paths forward so for me reward just is that minimisation or realisation
minimisation of expected surprise or uncertainty so it is intrinsically rewarding to resolve
uncertainty and to secure and seek out those novel things or avoid those unfamiliar and
characteristic obstacle like states that you know states that do not characterise me so i you know
dopamine i think um red light that just is the fact you have resolved uncertainty so if i get a
cue in the world um say a conditioned stimulus that tells me oh i now know exactly what i'm going
to do next i'm going to if i'm a little monkey in an experimental paradigm i'm going to receive a
drop of juice and i'm going to drink that um if i am um um somebody engaging in a social conversation
then i know exactly where this conversation is going that's great i know exactly what i want to say
so i think that's when you get the dopamine blush that resolution of uncertainty suddenly you see
the path forward clearly and it is exactly and i'm using path in your sense of the micro story
that the micro story that's responding to the affordances what's special about dopamine though
well it's a neuromodulator so it plays the role in the brain as not um of sending information from
this neuronal structure to this neuronal structure or this uh set of neurons to this set of neurons
but greasing the pathway by setting the excitability of the game by being the um the chemical mechanism
by which you will switch on this set of messages or that method set of messages another way of
saying that is it sensitises for example let's come back to your sort of hierarchical structure
that the the micro stories are informing or perhaps the mismatch um at the lowest level
the prediction is at the lowest level are inducing belief updates at the higher level
to get to these simpler more abstracted inferences you were talking about before
but how much does the high level listen to the low level and how much does the low level inherit
or um respond to top down constraints afforded by your simple high level abstractions
your which could of course be be the narrative so chemicals like dopamine and i and i wonder
whether you also want to talk about things like serotonin um in relation to things such as depression
and learn helplessness all of these neurochemicals have one thing in common their role in the brain
is just to sensitise one set of neuronal representations to messages from another
set of neural neural representations when placed in your hierarchical context that can have a
profound effect on the balance between how much you're attending to what's going on out there
so you're the micro uh the micro structure the low level sensory uh um um constructions that um um
or categorisations that say you might um think are being played out in the early visual cortex
or the primary auditory cortex relative to your um coherent deeply structured narratives about me
in a particular world so you know i would imagine that you know a lot your where you might want to
go with this is is just thinking well how might that go wrong and um what would that look like
if i had an abnormality of these neuromodulatory transmitter systems in the brain and of course
you've highlighted one of the key uh or a key abnormality that which is induced induced by
drugs of abuse or misuse nowadays um such as cocaine so that's a i think you know drug addiction
is a really good example of what tends to happen if you mess with these really important systems
mm-hmm yeah well cocaine addiction prioritizes the micro behaviors associated with cocaine
self administration prioritizes those over all other potential behavioral microstates
over all other stories and it does that neurologically on the serotonin front so
here's here's a pattern of depressive cognition and we you can think about it as the collapse of
a hierarchy so let's say you have a tiff with your wife and if you're operating let's say normally
in terms of your neurological hierarchy you might say well you know i'm just having an off day or
and having an off hour and it's only one little upset it's only one little anomaly it's only one
little surprise i can safely ignore it but that isn't what a depressive person will think a depressive
person will think oh my god i just had another fight with my wife i'm doing nothing but fighting
with my wife lately my marriage isn't going very well i've always fought with my wife too much in
the past and i'm fighting a lot with my friends i'm not a really good person to get along with
i mess up everything i do i've always messed up everything i do i'm going to keep messing up
everything i do in the present because that's what i'm like and there's no hope at all for
me to change in the future and you can see that an error that could have been bounded at a low
level which is well maybe i didn't have enough to eat in the last two hours and so i'm a little
irritable has cascaded through the entire hierarchy of self conceptualization and so imagine that
each level of the hierarchy has to be protected against the propagation of error messages from
a lower level and then imagine each level of the hierarchy has a resistance level that's set by
something like the tonic level of serotonin so the higher the serotonin level corresponding to
higher social status by the way the more error has to accrue at a given level of analysis before a
message will propagate up the hierarchical system and so one of the things my wife and i have worked
out in terms of modulating our reactivity to each other and to other people is well when should
you respond to a disruption in social communication when should you call someone on it and our answer
has been something like the rule of three that's fairly typical of narrative descriptions of such
things if it happens once you can ignore it it's just random fluctuation if it happens twice you
could mark it but still discount it but if it happens three times it establishes a pattern and
then something has to be called into question so i might say if if i'm interacting with my wife and
it doesn't go well three times in a row i might say to her i tried to be friendly three times in a
row and i've been rebuffed what that indicates to me is something else is going on here that's
like a Freudian slip in some sense it's like i think this is what's happening i want this to
be happening but it's not happening here's the evidence three instances thus we have to
reconfigure the narrative that we're using to structure the space and we have to say well what
actually is happening here what needs to be resolved and so that's a and then maybe and you
don't say well we were rude to each other three times today therefore our marriage is over and
we're both terrible people because that would be leaping too far up in the hierarchy you might say
well is there something else going on in the background that's disturbing you so that you're
more irritable in relationship to me that's part of a different conceptual structure and maybe the
other person will say well you know i i didn't have a very good day at work i was arguing with
my boss he's a bit tyrannical then you can go off on that narrative and try to resolve it but
but you can see depression as the collapse of that resistance of the hierarchy to the propagation
of errors upward and so when you give people serotonergic reuptake inhibitors what they seem
to do arguably is make each level of the hierarchy more resistant to the propagation of upward error
and the reason i tied that into social status is because we know that animals that have higher
social status and therefore occupy a more secure position in the social and environmental hierarchy
are more resistant to anomaly partly because they can rest comfortable in the supposition that their
superordinate status actually means that they're globally safer they have better social relations
they have better access to necessary environmental resources the world isn't as dangerous a place
and so you can imagine that your brain computes how likely an error message is to propagate upward
partly by looking at your social status which would be the value that other people have attributed
to you by their distributed computation and it does that with trait neuroticism which is your own
genetically mediated mostly partially at least genetically mediated initial propensity for those
error messages to propagate up the hierarchy you might say they're more likely to propagate up the
hierarchy the internal representational hierarchy of women and women are more sensitive to negative
emotion than men and i think the reason for that is is because they have to take care of infants
it makes sense for them to be more sensitive to smaller errors of prediction because the
consequences for someone who's truly vulnerable an infant can be cataclysmic and so anyways there's
a lot in that but that's that's a relation a theory of the relationship between hierarchical
processing of entropy and the proclivity for depression yeah there is a lot there
but it all makes perfect sense from the point of view of hierarchical inference in the brain
and particularly hierarchical predictive coding so if you indulge me i'm just going to say exactly
what you said but using slightly different words because i think that that notion that you've just
described and its implications for things like depression has a lot of construct validity in
relation to sort of more machine learning artificial intelligence formulations of this
hierarchical processing so one way of articulating that insight is to think of the the message passing
in a hierarchy that literally is our brain under the rubric or predictive coding so
in this in this sort of framework or scheme the idea is that each level of the hierarchy
it receives information from below and it tries to explain away the information
based upon top-down predictions and that which cannot be explained is in suing prediction
errors so these are the mismatches you were referring to before and then these prediction
errors are used to revise beliefs or representations sub-personal beliefs or
representations at the higher level at the more abstract level until the top-down predictions
are more apt to explain away what's going on below now the key thing about this architecture
well there are a number of key things and we've spoken in depth about about a number of them
but you know framing like this then the game of minimizing surprise the mate the game of
is just the game of minimizing prediction errors but how are you doing that well
you're explaining away what's going on down there based upon higher level hypotheses or
belief structures or expectations or representations in your hierarchy the key aspect of this sort of
message passing schemes predictive coding scheme is that it really matters how much weight you
afford to the prediction errors that are passed and ascend the hierarchy you use the word sort of
cascading up the hierarchy and this is exactly the image that a an engineer would have when building
a predictive coding machine and the degree to which they cascade up is exactly proportional
to the gain or the sensitivity that is set by the neuromodulators in this instance serotonin
so the resistance now is set by having entrenched if you like beliefs about this at this level of
