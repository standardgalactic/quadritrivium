level and it distracts me that this is you know very very similar to what you were talking about
before in terms of the you know a neuroticism and I presume this is sort of an inesync like
construct where you know you would have some people who are just truly confident that their
prior beliefs are the most apt explanation and they will ignore lots of evidence to the contrary
simply by suppressing the precision or the importance or turning down the gain on that kind of thing
but you can't do that if you get more than three errors that you can't explain so you know there
is an adaptability built into our brains that will actually say well no actually let's just
attend to these lower level ones and at that point you're going to have to relax the high level
and become more flexible and more adaptive well that okay so that ability to relax at that level
seems to be indexed by the personality trait openness and open people are more creative and so
creative people have more play in the higher order conceptualizations and one of the solid
empirical findings emerging out of the research on psilocybin is that a single mystical experience
induced by psilocybin produces something approximating a one standard deviation increase
in trait openness that's permanent it never goes away yeah yeah and so it doesn't look exactly like
it's a reduction in or say an increase in neuroticism so that error messages can propagate upward
it's it's something akin to that because if you're more open then there's more play in the system but
it doesn't seem to be tied exactly to error per se and negative emotion and I can't puzzle out the
distinction exactly right because if you're high in neuroticism you're going to propagate error
messages but then things are going to collapse if you're high in openness the error messages
propagate but you generate alternative theorems at a very rapid rate in order to re-contextualize the
anomaly I didn't know that that is very interesting so I think then it's the openness that I was
talking to and certainly that's the the aspiration or the motivation behind the use of these chemicals
in say end of life care or indeed in terms of yeah psilocybin assisted psychotherapy it's really to
open you up to new possibilities well maybe with with creative people what you see so imagine
category rigidity and category rigidity might be something like the probability that activation
of one category will activate adjacent categories so imagine that constraint is the constraint of
openness the more open you are the more flexible those boundaries the more when you activate one
category you're going to co-activate a network of associated categories so then imagine you dump
psilocybin into the system and what happens is the barriers between adjacent categories become
more permeable and so then as information propagates up there's more play in the systems
because the category boundaries have become wider and that would increase your probability of a
false certainty right which is on an idea derived from insight that's wrong but it would also increase
the probability that you'd get some true positives out of the deal which is really what creative
people are doing all the time a lot of creative ideas just aren't functional but some are crucial
and so it's a high risk high return cognitive strategy in some sense to generate to have looser
categories or more co-activation of categories at the higher levels and certainly that
is akin to what people report in psychedelic experiences that ideas flood in on them and
they see how things are connected in ways they couldn't perceive before and so that's different
than the flexibility that high neuroticism in some sense produces because that's more like the
probability that a conceptual system will collapse rather than it than it will expand
but your use of the word barriers I think is very nice and I'm just wondering and certainly
I think you'd enjoy speaking to Robin Kaha Harris who has described I think effectively what you've
just described but instead of casting it in terms of jumping through barriers he would describe it
really as a reduction in the height of a barrier so you if you can imagine and it's in my world it
would literally be a free energy landscape and our ideas are our prior beliefs are basically sitting
at the minima at the bottom of a well and sometimes we can get stuck in a rut I see yeah yeah for
example you say I was depressed or I had the hypothesis I am going to die and this is how
things that are going to die behave and this is how I'm going to behave and that may not be the
most functional way of that kind of end of life self-modelling then by making the barriers more
permeable simply by reducing the height you can you now enable a jumping from one minima to another
minima to explore more options exactly in the spirit that you meant in terms of creativity
but it could be creativity about other ways of being me in this situation and that flattening
of the landscape is just you know one way mathematically of writing down the reduction
in the precision or the rigidity of these high-level beliefs prior beliefs relative to the
lower ones so I think there's some beautiful conciliance there okay so so that would imply that
that would imply as those walls come down let's say that it would require less novelty
propagating up the system to produce a phase change exactly yeah yeah okay okay okay well
I'm afraid we have to bring this part of this conversation to a close even though I don't want
to there's there's other topics I would love to discuss with you I would very much appreciate it
if you would consider putting me in touch with is it carhart harris indeed yes I will do that yes
yes because I know some of the papers that you've written jointly and I would like to discuss those
further I would maybe I close with an observation if you don't mind is that one of the most functional
narratives as far as I can tell is predicated on the idea that you should conduct yourself in a manner
that leaves you open to exposing yourself to information that will allow you to update your
narratives right so it's a weird loop it's like well narrative itself is dependent on exploration
and so the best narrative in the most fundamental sense is one that leaves the option of exploration
continually open and that's something like a voluntary confrontation with the anomalies that
characterize existence as the central pattern of adaptive being it's something like that and that's
existence on that border between chaos and order in some fundamental sense so anyways I appreciated
the conversation very much it would be fun to meet in person sometime I think we could probably
talk for about 36 hours and I'll be in London again in January and so maybe maybe we could meet then
if you'd be amenable to that and in the meantime I would like to let everybody watching and listening
know that I'm going to continue my conversation with Dr. Friston for half an hour on the DW plus
site I'd like to go behind the scenes with people and to investigate the process by which
their narrative unfolded the process by which they made their path through life their successful
path through life because I think it's very useful for people to be provided with models of how that
occurs hello everyone I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my guest
