the hierarchy relative to this level the hierarchy that is mediated by decreasing your sensitivity
to the ascending prediction errors so if I if I read your your concept well let's take depression
I also like to talk about psychedelics because they act upon exactly the same neurotransmitter
systems but let's let's just take let's take depression which is a particularly pernicious I
think sort of set of narratives to find yourself in because I'll just cut to the doom onto this
argument there because you know in many senses this this predictive coding formulation when put
in the context of me discovering and learning and optimizing my models of the world is all
about accumulating evidence for my explanations that are updated in a way that minimize the
prediction errors but in accumulating evidence I have to expose myself I have to choose to expose
myself to the world I have to actively sense and go out there depression is pernicious because
of course a lot of the symptoms of depression prevent you going getting evidence that you're
not this kind of person or that you could have coped with this particular scenario so depression
I think a little bit like the cocaine using that it has a slightly self-subverting or self-maintaining
aspect that sort of hijacks the normal ways that we get out of it but just to come back to this sort
of I think quite fundamental notion of sort of inducing either through physiological setting
of that resistance or that what we call precision so we call it the precision it's the inverse
uncertainty it's the the reliability that you can afford these ascending prediction errors that
tell you you've got to change your mind you've got to find a new way of coping either in a marital
relationship or or just in terms of where you're actually looking you know from many many different
levels so this notion of precision translates into exactly what the neuromodulators control which is
the excitability of the neuronal cells that are broadcasting the prediction errors to the next
level and as such that looks very much like attention in in that you know we were talking
before about sort of change blindness and we just don't seem to be able to attend to things that are
irrelevant to the extent we don't even notice changes when they occur if then we don't we don't
assign them the right kind of informativeness or salience or precision that is necessary to
explain the narrative that's unfolding before us so one way of reading this sort of this state
this certain allergic state or continuum where these high level hierarchically high level beliefs
are recalcitrant or insensitive to the lower level information is the remarkable and important
capacity to ignore stuff that is irrelevant and what you're saying is when it happens three times
perhaps I shouldn't be ignoring it anymore and I now have to redeploy the precision the neuromot
refocus my neuromodulatory systems perhaps away from serotonin at the top and perhaps more to say
acetylcholine at the bottom just given the anatomy of these neurotransmitter systems
that would indeed render me in a state where I'm now much more attentive to what's actually going
on out there and what is actually going on out there will have will engender prediction errors
that will change my mind or indeed change my my gerative model that you know that entails this
hierarchical structure so I think everything you've said makes perfect sense from the perspective
of the mechanics of belief updating and structure learning and in the brain seen through the lens
of an engineer who thinks about the brain as a predictive processing or coding machine
so what does acetylcholine do what does acetylcholine do you you contrasted acetylcholine with serotonin
and you you associated acetylcholine with increased precision of attention focused outward
and and and that's at the lower levels of the hierarchy yeah so this is a vast simplification
but it I think it's a sort of a useful mnemonic so if you if you think about the hierarchy that
that you were describing before and you now want to discriminate between a situation where all my
high-level beliefs are insensitive to changes at the lower levels so this would be say the the
dominant alpha male very very self-confident has very precise what we sometimes in a Bayesian reading
of this predictive coding scheme called prior beliefs prior beliefs this is the way I behave
this is the way you behave and I am going to realize instantiate those those fantasies by
behaving in this way and indeed that's what normally happens so I'm very confident and that
translates into a high degree of prior precision which could be mediated by things like serotonin
the equivalent neurotransmitter at the lower level is often just looking at the neuro anatomy
and the neurochemistry and physiological experiments there's a similar role might be
played by acetylcholine so you can think of if you like too much prior precision as being mediated by
serotonergic neurotransmission and of course you know as well as I do that it's you know it's a
very complicated game with different receptor subtypes and sort of inverted u behavior so I'm
not saying it's more or less but certainly rests upon the way that you deploy your serotonergic
firing that will have a profound influence on the higher-level prior beliefs that exactly the same
kind of role may be ascribed for cholinergic neurotransmission from the nucleus basillus
of mineheart which is another neuromodulator so you've got dopamine you've got serotonin
you've got adrenaline or norepinephrine you have oxytocin there are lots of them and they may all
have particular roles in setting the precision or the recalcitrance or the sensitivity at different
hierarchical levels so it's generally in my world if you like if you think of serotonin doing one
thing then the complement of that is that the acetylcholine's doing it in the in the inverse
way so it's sort of like a yin yang so it because when I talk about attention at the periphery
it's likely that that does sorry at the low level of the hierarchy it's likely that that does rely
upon intact cholinergic neurotransmission with possibly a barren serotonergic neurotransmission
that may be due to psychopathology or it could be due to taking drugs that affect say 5H22a
receptors like like all the psychedelics you know psilocybins for example okay so I want to go in
I've got three directions to go in now the first question that's been lurking in the back of my
mind for a while is okay when you make progress towards a valued goal let's say we inhabit a
shared narrative and we're making progress towards our mutual stated goal and when we see ourselves
making progress we get a bit of a dopamine hit could you say that the fundamental reason
for the positively rewarding effect of that movement forward is that as I move forward
towards a goal I decrease the entropy that still remains between me and the goal and so is even
that reward is even that movement forward readable as an entropy reduction yeah absolutely because
I'm closer now so there's okay okay so I mean I didn't know I didn't understand that before okay okay
that I mean it's it's almost written into the the mathematical meaning of the word so if entropy
just is uncertainty and as I get close to resolving that uncertainty getting my fruit juice pleasing my
wife or you know being able to watch the news you know if it's an epistemic reward it is just
expected surprise just is the uncertainty and the closer you get the the more and the less
uncertain you are and all they have to suggest exactly because the well the closer you get
the fewer things you have to compute in order to get there so that's a good working definition
of entropy it's like I have to do less I have to handle less doubt between me and my eventual
destination so that okay so that's cool so that reduces dopaminergic reward to a subset of entropy
reduction right and we should point out you know living creatures are always fighting
entropy they're trying to violate the laws of thermodynamics in some not fundamentally but in
some local sense by insisting upon the maintenance of order in the face of this proclivity for things
to go every which way at once and so all right so movement towards movement forward towards
a shared goal that's also going to reduce the entropy between us say because it means if I can
rely on you to be to accompany me as I move forward that means I can predict you better it also means
that both of us are now in a situation that's less entropic because there's less variability between
you and me and the joint us and that shared goal and so I've fortified my belief in your
reliability and I've reduced my apprehension of your entropy yeah a physicist would love that
because of course the nice thing about entropy and free energy which you know we're here sort of
reading as surprise and prediction errors is an extensive quantity so your free energy and my
free energy or your entropy and my entropy we just have to add them together because they're
extensive and then our free energy is exactly the sum of our free energy so if we can both render our
mutual worlds more predictable and less surprising then our joint free energy will
will fall and this you know this is if you like it could be read as a
statement of imperatives but you could also read another one a much more deflationary way that
stuff societies through to cells that exist are just these free energy minimizing systems so
these conversations are just the kinds of conversations that can only be there simply
because they are free energy minimizing and if you like are what is left when you wanted to say
you know resisting the second law of thermodynamics the very fact that we are here having this low
free energy conversation and this exchange and rendering everything mutually predictable and
resolving uncertainty about ourselves means that this little dyadic exchange is in itself a free
energy minimizing free energy minimizing system you know free energy here again is this being used
as a proxy for uncertainty for unpredictability disorder so by minimizing free energy by we
are implicitly going to be minimizing the disorder and the entropy and the expected surprise so it's
all very consistent with the physics of self-organization what you're doing though I think is thinking
about what would these things look like in a social context in a dyadic context and just to
say also that one way of reading what you were saying about you know well if we can both shorten
the path to a state of orderly predictiveness and uncertainty resolution then if one thinks about
that in the you know in terms of interactions either between people or between between people
and their environment then you've got now a nice model for niche construction and cultural niche
construction that you know everything I do is in the service of making everything more predictable
and if that involves evolving to have a language and to teach my children language then there's
you know even that aspect of very very high level niche construction or in cultural acting upon the
world to make it in an encultured way more learnable and more predictable is all in the
service of minimizing this this entropy anxiety or free energy uncertainty sorry I slipped in
anxiety there I shouldn't do that anxiety I think it would be our remarkable capacity
to recognize that we haven't resolved our uncertainty in the way that we would normally
expect to and that would be the situation where the dopamine just goes away so how do you view the
role of GABA and so that's one question another question is I've I've spent a fair bit of time
thinking about hemispheric specialization and I'm wondering if is it is there any reason to
make the assumption that does the left hemisphere specialize in some sense for precision or does
it specialize for instantiating certainty at the lower levels of the hierarchy whereas the
right hemisphere is involved in play at the higher levels is that is there anything to any of those
concepts that you know of um yeah it's a very interesting question and now I'm sort of speaking
as a sort of an imaging neuroscientist about the functionality I mean first of all if we just go
back to what we're talking about before which is the other cybernetic view and the good regulator
theorem and the notion that we are or we entail good models of our lived world or at least our
sensed world then having two hemispheres tells me immediately that there is some lateral symmetry
in my lived world and of course that tells me because that is true in the sense I have two
arms and two legs you know if my world certainly as a newborn is basically you know 99% my body
I think the sort of having two hemispheres tells you something quite fundamental about
about the universe into which you are as a brain at least introduced just to generalize that what
that means is if you gave me the brain of a Martian I should be able to tell you a lot about
its lived world and its embodiment and its body and the kind of world that it lives in
just by looking at the structure the anatomy of the brain so I think that you know there's an
important aspect to that sort of lateralization issue um and more I think a sort of more um
scholarly and and put some more specific answer to your question is that there is certainly um
in neuropsychology um an asymmetry in the way we deploy attention so if you now read the
deployment of certain your neuromodulators such as say serotonin or acetylcholine or
indeed adrenaline um as um instantiating endogenous attention then its deficits will
correspond to certain kinds of neglect the you know a pathological inability to attend to i.e.
you're always going to ignore or just not be aware of this and of course there's a really
interesting work in terms of hemineglect systems and bilateral asymmetries between the right and
the left parietal cortex in these syndromes so I don't I don't know very much beyond that other
than to be able to say that um for for reasons that uh must have a principal explanation in terms
of the you know the high order causal structure of the world in which we operate there certainly is
some asymmetry in the way that we attend to things or the some benefit in terms of having that
factorization um that allows certain things to attend to that this you know just set the sensitivity
or the um the flexibility or inflexibility of a hierarchal construction um it must be the case
that there are certain domains and certain attributes that do show this um this lateralization
and just to point out also of course that the lateralization issue was quite hot in the days of
of gray at the at the mausoleum as an as a possible corridor of things like schizophrenia
yeah well I mean Goldberg who was a student of Luria's suggested that the right hemisphere was
specialized for processing in the domain of novelty and the left hemisphere was specialized
for processing in the domain of relative certainty and so it might be something like the more novel
it is the more likely the right is to attend to it and that sort of maps on to Gilchrist
McGilchrist conceptualization of hemispheric specialization with regards to both predation
and predator detection so the right hemisphere seems to be specialized for contextual evaluation
and the spotting of predators and the left for focused attention in the service of predation
so a bird for example will attend preferentially with the prey detection system well eating but
the right hemisphere and the other eye are scanning the environment for signs of context
dependent signs of predation on the bird okay I didn't know that I didn't know that that's very
interesting so I was just thinking of course the the obvious example of lateralization is language
and if you look at language as really predation for information so if you think of language as
the way of asking questions that is the tool that we use to predate for information so that makes
entire sense I didn't know that about the comparative ethology anatomy of predators but
yeah well if McGilchrist's new work McGilchrist's new work details that out in some at some length
the the relationship between attentional breadth and focus and hemispheric specialization
it's quite nice and it maps very nicely onto the concepts that we've been discussing today
so shall we take a brief foray into psychedelics and then we'll have to close this part of the
conversation unfortunately although there's about 50 other things I'd like to discuss with you
but well that's I guess we've covered a fair bit of territory for one day but I'd be I'm very
interested in your conception of the relationship between say psychedelic experience and its
antithesis in some sense if I've got this right with the action of antidepressants
yes well yeah I'm not sure it's an antithesis because you know there are in the past few
years and indeed months an increasing number of papers looking at sort of five h2a agonists
and partial agonists and and drugs that act upon the serotonergic system namely psychedelics and
their ability to remediate certain conditions that would have a you know a pronounced usually
pronounced effective state so the game is very complicated but what we certainly know at the
moment is that the actions of psychedelics from the point of view of their definitive
effects on the brain namely you know the you know the abnormal perception
and the characteristic way that you you can't attend from the sort of the microstructure
of your sensations we do now know that that is probably best explained when I say we know
we conjecture that it is nicely explained by exactly the same kind of mechanism that you were
talking about before which is a sort of changing the balance of recalcitrance or precision or
sensitivity away from these high level constructs deep in the hierarchy at the top of the hierarchy
and redo reinvesting that kind of precision or sensitivity under predictive coding models to
prediction errors much lower in the hierarchy so this would look basically like I'm now going to
ignore my prior beliefs about about the narrative that I'm currently committed to in terms of this
interaction and I'm just going to focus in on you know what can I sense so you're talking before
about sort of a mother's predisposition to be very sensitive to cues that could engage or could
represent really important affordances for responding like responding to a baby crying
so this would be you know one way of viewing the effects of psychedelics that you are forced to
by reducing or relaxing the precision of the high level beliefs in relation to the lower level
evidence or belief updating or evidence accumulation you are putting yourself in an
intentional set where everything is interesting you can't attend away from it at a very elemental
