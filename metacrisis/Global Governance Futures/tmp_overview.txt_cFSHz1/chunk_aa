Checking Global Governance Futures/Daniel Schmachtenberger – Existential Risk and Phase Shifting to a New World System.txt
1. **The Conversation Context:** In a discussion about the meaning of life and motivation, Daniel Rode asks what it means to live a meaningful life, considering beauty, love, and the planet's well-being.

2. **Mode of Being vs. Mode of Doing:** The conversation highlights two distinct modes of living: the mode of being, which is about appreciating and loving life as it is, and the mode of doing, which involves action to serve a purpose or contribute to something greater.

3. **Motivation and Meaning:** Daniel shares that his motivation comes from a place of already feeling fulfilled and wanting to protect the planet's beauty and ensure others can experience it. This intrinsic motivation is different from a self-centered one, as it is rooted in sacredness and courage.

4. **Service and Sacrifice:** Daniel emphasizes that service should arise naturally from seeing and loving the world as it is, rather than from a sense of obligation or fear of failure.

5. **Engagement and Contribution:** The discussion suggests that one should evaluate their actions and intentions daily to ensure they are in line with living meaningfully—enjoying life (mode of being), engaging in meaningful activities (mode of doing), and continuously developing one's ability to appreciate and understand the world around them (mode of becoming).

6. **Daniel Rode's Projects:** Daniel mentions his personal blog, Civilization Emerging, which includes podcasts and articles. He also introduces the Conciliants Project, an initiative aimed at decentralizing innovation and guiding exponential technology development, inviting listeners to engage with his work further through conciliantsproject.org.

7. **Engagement with Daniel's Work:** The conversation concludes with an invitation for listeners to visit Civilization Emerging and the Conciliants Project website to learn more and potentially contribute to these initiatives.

8. **Imperfect Utopias Recap:** The podcast Imperfect Utopias, focusing on global governance and related topics, encourages listeners to engage with their content, leave comments, subscribe for updates, and participate in future events. They look forward to continuing the conversation with the audience.
