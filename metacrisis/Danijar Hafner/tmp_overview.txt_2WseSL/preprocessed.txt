Checking Danijar Hafner/Action and Perception as Divergence Minimization.txt
 Certainly! Your presentation on "Action and Perception as Divergence Minimization" provides a comprehensive framework for understanding various objectives that intelligent agents can optimize. Here's a summary of the key points and concepts you discussed:

1. **Objective Function Space**: You map out the space of possible agent objectives, aiming to unify common objectives like representation learning, maximum entropy reinforcement learning, empowerment, skill discovery, information gain exploration, and surprise minimization.

2. **Unified Perspective**: The work suggests that representation learning and exploration are two sides of the same coin, and that world models can serve as objective functions for adaptive agents without reliance on rewards.

3. **Agent Setup**: An agent interacts with an environment, receiving a sequence of sensory inputs \(X\) and choosing actions or representations \(Z\). The agent's beliefs about these variables are represented by distributions that can be optimized to achieve certain objectives.

4. **Divergence Measures**: The framework focuses on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a means to connect different objectives through divergence minimization between the actual distribution of inputs and latents and a desired target distribution.

5. **Target Distributions**: There are two main types of target distributions: factorized targets, which assume independence between inputs and latents, and expressive targets, which capture dependencies. The choice between these targets determines the agent's objectives.

6. **Agent Objectives**: By selecting different latent variables and adjusting the target distribution factorizations and divergence measures, a wide range of agent objectives can be derived. For example:
   - Past actions are not considered in the past objective terms but can influence future inputs (empowerment).
   - Skills, which are temporally abstract actions, contribute no past mutual information but shape future input predictions (variational skill discovery).
   - Latent state estimates or model parameters aim for state estimation and system identification.
   - Information gain exploration seeks inputs that convey the most bits of information about the agent's beliefs.

7. **Marginal Likelihood**: The agent's objective is to find a niche in the environment where it can both inhabit and understand, which is measured by the marginal likelihood. Agents designed with world models as targets are more likely to explore effectively and converge to wider niches.

8. **Paper Invitation**: You invite the audience to read the full paper on your website (danijahr.com/apd) for a deeper understanding of the concepts and methodologies presented.

In essence, your work proposes a unifying theoretical framework that explains how various agent objectives can be understood as different manifestations of minimizing divergence between perceived realities and desired states. This approach can potentially lead to more adaptive and efficient learning in agents.
