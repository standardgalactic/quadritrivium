So until about two years ago it was a it was a secret the group kind of knew there was a reason why I had four big subgroups
But they didn't really know it was like four teams working together building odd things
I kind of kept the vision away from them maybe out of fear maybe out of control maybe just because I wasn't ready
Well we've spent lots of time and lots of money asking where the universe came from we have a pretty good idea where the universe came from
We even know how old it is yet we have no idea where life came from and no one is attempting to answer this question and I think I know the answer
What I'm going to try and do in the next 15 minutes or so is tell you about an idea of how we're going to make matter come alive
We're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps how we can transform inorganic dead matter into living matter
You believe you're going to be successful in this project? When?
We're proposing to do it in just a few hours once we've set up the right chemistry
And when do you think that will happen?
Hopefully within the next two years
That would be a big story
This is a very exciting day this is the first time that we get to start this and inorganica simulates the atmosphere on the world before there was any life
Before there was any biology it has a mixture of gases and some sparks and it produces molecules that might be important for life
Well it's the Miller Yuri reaction reloaded but obviously Lee doesn't like calling it that he wants to call it inorganica
What do you want to call it?
I'm more interested in whether a ship sinks or not as to what it's got written on the side
Inorganica is a fundamentally new approach to an experiment that was first done by two famous scientists in the 50s
We figured they missed out the earth's crust, the ground, the earth and the inorganic bits
So inorganica adds in his missing components to get life
All that remains is that we need to add the lightning
And we're probably going to run out of the room quite fast after we've turned it on because we're not sure what's going to happen
So we've got the UV on, laser, yeah?
Yes
Okay, and the algorithm's already?
As soon as it's switched to automatic it will work
Alright, cross check
Okay, I don't see any sparks
That's a low pressure, so what we do now to ensure that the sparks are running is you turn the light off
And there's nothing going on
And that's interesting
I think I'll turn this light off again rather properly
Check
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a spark up there
Alright, it's alive
I mean, if we can make life in the lab, we are not an impossibly remote fluke
We'd know that we're not alone in the universe
Life is not science fiction, we are here
Hang on, it's windy up here
Can you not see, look, can you not see, look, can you not see the wobble?
Look, it's buckled
Can you see?
Can you see the wobble?
Oh yeah, come
One of them used to think I flew aeroplanes because I was always travelling around the world
You know, my wife, say, my colleagues say that, you know, why are you killing yourself?
I don't know, I just really, I just want to solve the problem
To be honest, I'm really too busy to do very much
But I try here and there, try and encourage their interest
And also, you know, we try and discuss it
So what we're planning to do this today, play with this
And then, and I'm waiting to see if he understands why does it work, what does a battery do
They take a lot of these things for granted
When I was their age, I was taking everything apart and asking why it was going to work
But I guess if I judge them by my standards, then I'm always going to be unhappy
Yeah, just do that big, big thing
Yeah, this one needs replacing, I think, but it's good, it's still flying
Yeah, I remember when I had an ambition that I wanted to be a professor as quickly as possible
And I became a professor, I think it was 32
I don't feel like an overachiever, I feel like a distinct underachiever
And I feel like that most of my life
I was in the remedial, learning difficulties groups at primary school and secondary school
I guess this is one of the reasons why I'm looking for validation for what I do
Because I'm like, is this good enough? Am I good enough? Is a problem hard enough?
Of course I keep saying, Joshua, become a physicist
Daddy wasn't smart enough, become a physicist, it'd be great if you become a physicist
You find out why the universe is here, and I find out why life is here, and that'd be fine
How's it going, James? All right
So, the microfluidic stuff is now down here
And all the flow systems and everything's been set up down here
I was asked by the Engineering and Physical Research Council to mentor Lee
I don't get any coincidence that Lee's name came out of the hat
I think Lee is the most well-funded person within the chemistry area
Something very interesting happens to this one
You can see it's just given split into two
What happens now, we didn't expect it would happen in the same time scale
And then it joins back again
So what?
Oh, it's great, it's a massive leaf
It's a massive leaf
Okay, you're ahead of me
Yeah, yeah, of course I am
What you're doing is you're showing me things, but you're not explaining why it's happening
You're trying to break it down, you're trying...
Look, I realised last night when I was running when I was trying to make the evolutionary unit
I understand the reason for sex, and it comes from bacteria
All the anthropology is still talking about sex, but it's about binary fish and binary combination
You've come from your parents, from your parent
You can trace your information back down your family tree
But we get to a barrier where we have the first competent cell
And we need to go back beyond that
And this question is about how could this cell randomly appear
Can you sit down in the chair please?
Right, where do we come from?
From Scotland
Where do you come from?
From Mummy
Where did Mummy come from?
Granny
And where did Granny come from?
Good question
What about if we put them in there?
Remember, I used to talk to you about the big bang and dod
So where do we come from?
Big bang
Aidan, where do we come from?
Sit down, sit down
The big bang bang
The big bang bang
What appeared on Earth?
People
And how did they appear?
Good
Good, good doesn't even exist
You're mad
Daddy's trying to find out where people came from
No, I'm okay
The beginning Earth was dead
And then a few hundred million years in
Suddenly Earth was alive
And that life came from somewhere
My theory is that matter is brought alive
Through the process of evolution
It's the only way in this vast probability space
Of potential you could get anything out
Without evolution
Chemistry would stay dead
How do you get 400, 500 million years of chemistry
Into a laboratory experiment?
No one really thinks I'm going to do it
No one
So we know inorganica didn't work
Are you allowed to tell me?
No, I'm not going to tell you
But it all detracts
It's like detracts
It's a shameless drama
Okay, what happened?
What happened with inorganica?
So unfortunately life didn't come out
But to be honest we didn't expect life to come out
But something really interesting happened
Whilst we were creating inorganica
We came up with a completely new model
To make the experiment smaller
Secret, if this is ever going to work
Is we can't just have one inorganica
We need to do a trillion
We're going to take the inorganic experiment
And we do the reaction in lots and lots of little droplets
So we could literally do a trillion inorganicas
All at once
So we could increase the probability
Of us discovering the right chemistry
We need to go forward to create life
We needed the theory
We needed hardware
We needed the droplets
We needed inorganica
And now the teams are working together
The next leap is to go beyond my lab
And go worldwide
Go global
It's worth taking the risk
To lose the audience
Or lose the people watching the lecturers
For the risk that they might actually go up
They'll click and they'll understand
What we're trying to do
That works out, that'll be great
It's pretty tough though
I'm just looking at it now
I'm not sure what makes any sense
Organic molecules
And the engineering complex systems
So without any further ado
I'll hand over to Lee
Thanks very much
Life doesn't use
Well, I don't think it uses any intelligent design
It uses evolution
And I was really intrigued
And I've been intrigued for a long time
About how we can reconcile these two modes of thinking
All we're doing is saying
Can we do evolution in droplets?
And we weren't selecting for this
Now just imagine we made an entire population of these
And we can get them to split different chemistries
And get them to fuse
And then we can assess the fitness
I think this is the first kind of result
That shows that we're not totally barking mad
One thing that I was thinking about
If life is so easy to evolve
Why is there only one form?
Life on planet Earth is merely
An expression of the available chemistry set
For GTA
Einstein said
Scientists come in two forms
Scientists and technicians
Scientists actually make something new
Technicians just confirm what was going on
By the nature
And those scientists have to be in the second form
So at least Lee just finds to be in the first
Whether he is or not
I don't know
I think they weren't convinced
But that's good
But I don't think they think I was
Crazy wasting money
There is no difference between
Living in dead matter and nothing
The dead stuff is the same as living stuff
Except the living stuff does seem to be
Cooperating to grow
To continue
The process of science is really
When you're stepping out on your own
You could fail
And now people are beginning to follow my idea
And it's no longer my idea
It's science
So this part that I have to grow up
Is an ego kind of
Academic wants to work on my project
But I have to grow up
If I get people to cooperate
It will certainly give us a much bigger chance
To solve this problem
How can we make life in the lab from scratch
And that's the important thing now
It's also a backup plan
Of course I'm going to do it in like two weeks
Thank you
