For GTA
Einstein said
Scientists come in two forms
Scientists and technicians
Scientists actually make something new
Technicians just confirm what was going on
By the nature
And those scientists have to be in the second form
So at least Lee just finds to be in the first
Whether he is or not
I don't know
I think they weren't convinced
But that's good
But I don't think they think I was
Crazy wasting money
There is no difference between
Living in dead matter and nothing
The dead stuff is the same as living stuff
Except the living stuff does seem to be
Cooperating to grow
To continue
The process of science is really
When you're stepping out on your own
You could fail
And now people are beginning to follow my idea
And it's no longer my idea
It's science
So this part that I have to grow up
Is an ego kind of
Academic wants to work on my project
But I have to grow up
If I get people to cooperate
It will certainly give us a much bigger chance
To solve this problem
How can we make life in the lab from scratch
And that's the important thing now
It's also a backup plan
Of course I'm going to do it in like two weeks
Thank you
