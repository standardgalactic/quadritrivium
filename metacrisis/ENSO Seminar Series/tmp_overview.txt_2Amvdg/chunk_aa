Processing Overview for ENSO Seminar Series
============================
Checking ENSO Seminar Series/Dec 2020 -- Jelle Bruineberg -- Embodied cognition and the attention crisis.txt
1. Gela's presentation focused on the dynamics of interaction in digital spaces, particularly on social media platforms like Twitter. She highlighted how these platforms shape our sense of presence and immediacy, potentially fostering a more individualistic view of communication as opposed to a participatory one.
   
2. The discussion touched upon the temporal aspects of digital interactions, including the challenge of reviving old threads without appearing out of touch or like a troll, versus the excitement of engaging in real-time events that can lead to significant fundraising achievements (e.g., The Toy Show in Ireland).

3. Gela pointed out that written communication on platforms like Twitter lacks the flexibility of spoken language, which often allows for backtracking and rephrasing. This rigidity can lead to a more combative or less forgiving interaction, as participants are bound by their initial statements.

4. The session explored how different technologies can influence our participatory sense-making processes. For instance, the structure of Twitter encourages quick responses based on written text rather than the nuanced, evolving nature of face-to-face conversations.

5. Gela's insights provided a rich discussion that sparked further questions and reflections about the role of technology in shaping our interactions and how we can navigate these dynamics responsibly and effectively.

6. The seminar concluded with thanks to Gela for her presentation, and a look forward to future Encel seminars, hopefully to be held in person again soon. The next speaker scheduled for January 2021 was mentioned as Manuel Arras Escriva, assuming the series continues as planned.

1. **Gibson's Theory of Affordances**: James J. Gibson introduced the concept of affordances to describe the opportunities for action that the environment offers to an organism. Gibson believed that perception is directly of the environmental objects and their affordances rather than of sensory stimuli.

2. **Behavior Settings**: Ronald L. Baker developed the concept of behavior settings as a way to analyze environments in terms of the structured patterns of behavior they elicit. This includes both physical and social factors, and emphasizes that behavior is not just a product of individual psychological processes but also a result of the interaction with the environment.

3. **Ecological Psychology**: Ecological psychology, inspired by Gibson's work, focuses on the study of perception in relation to the environment and its ecological validity. It emphasizes the importance of situational context and how it shapes behavior.

4. **Activity Theory**: Originating from the Soviet Union with Vygotsky and later refined by Leont'ev, activity theory views human psychological processes as arising from social and material interactions within a historical context. This approach shares common ground with both Gibson's and Barker's perspectives in considering environmental structures as integral to understanding behavior.

5. **Integration of Theories**: While there is an overlap between the ideas of ecological psychology, particularly in relation to behavior settings, and activity theory, these connections have not been extensively explored or emphasized in psychological research. There is room for further interdisciplinary work that integrates these perspectives to provide a more holistic understanding of human behavior within its environmental context.

6. **Future Research**: The potential for integrating the ideas from Gibson, Barker, and activity theory could offer valuable insights into how environments influence behavior. This integration could lead to new models and methods that account for psychological experience in a more nuanced and comprehensive way.

7. **Current Status of Ecological Psychology**: Ecological psychology has evolved differently in different spheres, with some focusing on sensory-motor processes and others incorporating social-cultural factors. There is an ongoing need to bridge these gaps to fully appreciate the richness of human psychological experience within its environmental context.

The discussion highlighted the potential for interdisciplinary research that combines ecological psychology, particularly through the lens of behavior settings, with other theoretical frameworks like activity theory and Vygotsky's ideas on tool use and internalization of cultural artifacts. This could lead to a more integrated understanding of human behavior and its interaction with the environment.
