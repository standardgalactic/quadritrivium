planning the best way to experiment to disclose those data that resolve the most uncertainty
about your hypothesis. So this this notion of Bayes optimality in terms of the principle of best
experimental design is one way of reading the epistemic or the intrinsic motivation supplied
by the expected free energy and in that sense you can regard perception and active sensing active
perception in exactly the same way that people like Richard Gregory conceive of active sensing
perception as hypothesis testing that really our behavior our sentient behavior is in the
in the game of getting the right kind of information that resolves our uncertainty about
states and affairs beyond our sensory organs or outside of our skull. I'm going to give the
final word to Einstein just to remember that all of this rests upon this simple understanding
and realization that the evidence for our models of the world can always be split into
negative complexity or simplicity and accuracy which just means not only in science but also
in our sentience everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler and with that
all that remains is for me to thank all the people whose ideas I've been talking about and
to thank you for your attention and I look forward to discussing these these issues with you in the
near future. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you very much so now you have to imagine that
everyone is clapping it was a wonderful talk thank you very much. I would like to ask everyone who
has question to to put those in the chat and I take the opportunity to start with the first
question so you have this wonderful deep diachronic model would that also be a possibility to easily
model drift and changes in in in in the environment say if you have for example seasonal changes
and people or persons are very very very good at adapting to that so would you could you do that?
Yes that's a very interesting question in relation to modeling the current epidemic which is we've
actually applied these models to the coronavirus outbreak that's a very very pertinent question
yeah absolutely so I think what you're saying there is that there are there is a separation of
time scales at many many levels so it just keeps on going so what you would do in in this particular
example is just put another Markov decision process there was an order of magnitude slower on top of
the two levels that we already got and this would provide a much slower context so there will be
belief updating adaptation at a much much slower time scale. You know interesting aspect of your
question of course is what we were looking at there is the fast belief updating inferring latent
hidden states of the world the same expected free energy and free energy minimizing sorry
maximizing elbow maximizing dynamics and apply to the parameters of the model give you learning
so there's also inference and learning and the two of those go hand in hand as well
so that's another interesting aspect and then you can even take that further and say can you put
structure learning on top by using the time integral of the model evidence so now you can have a
picture of structure learning how many levels would you want that can be read as Bayesian model
selection or natural selection if you're in biology. Very interesting so we have one question in the
text from Pranav Mahayan I might summarize the first question so these are actually two first
would be whether you could also model something like Pavlovian fear and risk aversion principles
so how can this reward seeking and information gain seeking also account for risk aversion schemes.
I think it to articulate risk aversion and risk sensitivity within this framework is relatively
straightforward so all you do is you rewrite your cost function or your reward function as a log
probability so I was talking about sort of prior preferences so you just take the logarithm of that
and then you have a continuous variable that goes from plus to minus infinity that scores your
the value or the extrinsic value of a particular outcome once you've done that
then you get all these sort of natural behaviors that one would see in reinforcement learning
with the added benefit that now you can measure your reward or your utility in natural units because
now you've expressed your utility as a log probability so if you use natural logarithms you've
got natural units which interestingly have the same units as information so now you've got the
value of information you can either say well this bit of information is worth three dollars
or three dollars is worth this amount of information and the way that you balance the two
is effectively by ascribing a precision an inverse variance to to those belief distributions so
once you've written down your reward in terms of probabilistic preferences now you can make them
quantitatively bigger or smaller by making them more or less precise so if I'm very very confident
a very precise belief I like these things that I don't like those that will dominate the
pragmatic or the expected utility part of the expected free energy and that will
suppress possibly the risk aspect whereas if I have very very imprecise I don't have any
confident beliefs about what I find rewarding my subjective utility if you like then it's likely
that I might become more sensitized to the to you know to the the ambiguity term and I might
become more careful I want to resolve ambiguity and be less sensitive to the or act as if I was
less worried about the risks because I'm less confident about what I find rewarding so a
really interesting question you know in principle you should be able to fit the precisions in order
to make them match exactly with economic sort of forms of risk aversion and and the like
there's another question in the chat so this would be the question about your views on including
or how including emotional balance into the framework and so suggestion would be whether
first and second derivative of free energy would fit that or what would be your view on that
well that's a challenging question and certainly people have
have proposed for many years now that the sort of you know the rate of change of free energy
as a score in terms of how well you are engaging with your world is is a nice valenced measure
of that could predict your your emotional status and I think that's a useful heuristic
however I think that the you know the the more direct answer to this is
it's all in the uncertainty you know if you estimate and you predict that you are now in
a context of an environment in a situation where your uncertainty about what to do is irreducible
that's going to make you feel anxious and bad so you know the good feelings the aha moments the
realization oh yes I've won that lottery or it's it's it's dinner time or it's my favorite sitcom
all of these things when you feel good and happy all come along with this collapse of
uncertainty and the way forward becomes very very clear so in a sense that is in fact an
anticipation of a you're an improvement in the free energy but that has to be represented in the
generative model you know it has to be part of your belief structure in your belief system and
your representation of the world and it looks as if that is the closest thing in the generative
model to that kind of monitoring the fluctuations in how well I'm doing in terms of the free energy
seems to be the precision of beliefs about what I'm doing which is of course the dopamine
you know what we think it might be the thing that dopamine registers so the at a very simple
level of just valency or things being good and bad I would describe that to the precision
of beliefs about what I'm going to do so when things get better that basically means is I can
see the way ahead clearly thank you so I'm looking a bit at the time so I I I expect
although there would be more questions we have to stop here because the time is more or less
over and we expect the next speaker to be here in in like two minutes so thanks
from everyone attending the session for this excellent talk and discussion and we hope every
to be able to see everyone and you also in particular in the near future in person thank you
well thank you very much bye bye
