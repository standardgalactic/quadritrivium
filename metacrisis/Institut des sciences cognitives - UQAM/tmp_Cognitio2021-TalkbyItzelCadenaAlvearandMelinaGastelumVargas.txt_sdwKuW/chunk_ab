So in this sense, we propose not only this model for research, but also ethical and future
perspectives for cognitive sciences that involve psychology, psychiatry, pedagogy,
philosophy, data science. And in this sense, we first talk about the neurodivergence
emancipatory collective movement that is led by autistic people, first by Judy Singer,
who is also a female with autism or an autistic female. And also in this sense,
we should rethink our therapeutic applications. So here we put some examples in which we think
that they consider the autistic sense-making or the autistic own vote. That is the intensive
interaction therapy in which they depart from the sense-making in terms of communication and
interaction of autistic people in order to create a dialogical relationship between the,
for example, the psychologist and the autistic child, and then the floor time and the relationship
with the social materiality notion, because in the floor time therapy, they depart from the
horizontality between, for example, the caregiver and the autistic child in which they take into
account the autistic sense-making with the objects that surround them in order to play
and interact based in the own vote that the autistic child creates. Also another application
could be sensory-friendly spaces in which as considering autistic people as participants as
autonomous agents by themselves, we should create also spaces that are friendly for them because
they live with hyper hypersensitivities that mislead their actions or not in that sense that create
like a really bad place for them or an aversive kind of situation. And also instead of imposing
rules for interaction, we should understand their ways of engagement. And in this sense,
we also propose an engaged and anti-traded epistemologist, for example, from the feminist
standpoint from Donna Haraway, Dorothy Smith and Sandra Harding, in which we include and amplify
the voices of autistic people by taking them as experts by experience. And also for collective
action, we should research on communities and not isolated individuals. And also think on cognition
in an involved and participatory way for social understanding and collective action.
And also the critique interculturality. So Melina, thank you.
Yeah, in this sense, we also think that to treat interculturality in a horizontal way,
which is proposed by Catherine Welch, and she calls it critique interculturality,
because then we can acknowledge difference and we can acknowledge different kind of cultures. And
in this way, we are talking about an autistic disorder spectrum culture, and then be treated
like a horizontal with the normality or what is called normality. So it is also a political
standpoint to treat it in this way in critical interculturality and not as an abnormality.
So as drawing the conclusions, we say that affordances are co-created and maintained by joint
action, which form particular ecological niches or habitats and all their agencies. However,
the normative behavior settings exclude other ways of acting that differ from the
concentrated ones. So diverse ways of comprehension and action in the world
should be considered or sorry, are considered in this kind of thinking of the normative behavior
as impaired, pervasive or abnormal and can be misjudged ethically. So autistic people express
differences in participatory sense making, that is, they show different ways of acting,
emoting and communicating. So autistic people respond to the landscape of affordances,
the affordative space in such way that resonates with their sensory motor constitution.
So we're talking about different umbilts, not abnormal umbilts. So thank you very much. Here
are our emails, if you want to talk about it much more. And here also thank you for the
four recognition group that coordinates Melina. And yeah, that's all.
So whoever wants to ask questions can just get behind me in the line here and ask
Itzel and Melina their questions from the podium. Okay, so first, so I guess I have a question
about how one or maybe how how might I imagine creating spaces that both simultaneously I guess
engage sensory motor preferences or umbilts of autistic people while also allowing them an
exposure to other niches or other environments in which there are other modes of engagement,
right? Because maybe the concern I have is if you cater too much to that disposition,
there becomes no understanding or inclination to understand other mindsets or ways of interacting
with the world. And maybe it sounds clear, so help forgive me if that is.
Melina, I think I didn't understand the question. I'm sorry.
No worries. So maybe the context is
uh so you know the reframe of it is not being abnormal but different kind of umbelt, right?
I think resonates. The concern would be is only allowing them exposure into one environment
that naturally fits with their sensory motor experience does not allow them to be flexible,
right? And switch into a different niche that may not be as forgiving. Does that make sense?
So you know maybe they go to a job interview and because they've been in an environment
you know where like they didn't understand certain social norms and they started engaging
in behaviors, repetitive movements or things that that don't go well, right? Maybe it affects their
you know a chance of employment at that that firm or you know just as a random example.
Yeah, I think it resonates with our proposal. Like I think it's a good way of translating it
because they usually show these effectiveness charges of like for example their repetitive
and restricted behaviors that usually are called also like on flexibility towards the environment.
During certain situations in which they have for example anxiety crisis because the environment is
really aversive towards their sensory motor capabilities or coordinations.
For example in spaces like here in Mexico like in the center of the city that it's really really
full of hyper stimulation from all all over the place. Usually people with autism that I have
talked to because I work in a clinical space and also in a research space with autistic people.
They usually refer that it's a really aversive place in which they have to kind of like look for
something in order to calm themselves down but that is also impossible because they don't have
as we said for example in the part of the ethical and future perspectives they don't have
sensory-friendly spaces not even to calm themselves and maybe to calm the anxiety crisis.
So yeah I think it's a good way of translating what you did yeah of what you said.
And I guess just another item is you know I wonder if things like mindfulness meditation
or cognitive behavioral therapy right or certain behavioral right interventions
and cognitive methods might be helpful for facilitating and you know success in those
environments or at least not being necessarily overwhelmed. Just you know just some random ideas
and something that has a very personal aspect to it for me so thank you I want someone else to
know. Thank you Kevin. Hi there thanks for this really interesting talk. I don't study autism
but I have heard recently a lot about the phenomenon of masking where you can suppress sort of
stimming tendencies or other abnormal autistic behaviors and that the fact that masking exists
tells me that autistic individuals have maybe their usual mode of sensory motor coordination
with the world but also the capability of having neurotypical sensory motor engagements with the
world which would suggest that neurotypical folks are actually have this abnormal lack of
flexibility where the world has to be this normative way that where you've been taught
condition-interacted and can't accept other ways of interacting and so I'm wondering how would
what what is the explanation for
masking behavior and maybe like is there is there a characterization of sort of normative
behavior as actually being the abnormal inflexible behavior rather than you know good and what we
should strive for? Well I think that there is no explanation like formally speaking from
the inactive view like that there is a paper talking about how we explain the masking but
I think that we can infer based on what we are proposing and also based on for example Hannah
the Jagger's view which and also based on the lived experience referred by autistic people
and specifically autistic adolescents women and girls because they are the population that mostly
present the masking that is also referred as camouflaging
and in this sense is a cold mechanism that takes a lot of effort a lot of energy from them
and it's not something that is developed like instantly or spontaneously in the moment
is something that they shape along their history of living or sorry of coping with the normative
space for example I am thinking about a woman that I interviewed a few days ago she's an autistic
woman and she talks about how she developed a cold mechanism of masking her steaming and cold
mechanism to to hide the rocking that she does when she is really really excited and she says
that is not something that she spontaneously did like in the first time but it is much more like
an an aversive association because of the social stigma that is in the space you know so I think
that maybe we should talk about not normal or abnormal but different instances of behaving
or different instances instances of sense making and maybe also not to put like a moral imperative
on how we should behave you know like I don't know if this is making sense but yeah this was
this is really helpful context thank you I don't know if Medina also wants to say something
no for now it's okay I think you answered very well thank you very much Shannon thank you
all right hi thank you for your talk
so I would like to you elaborate a bit between the melange of concepts that you use
and especially the world what is why the world could be or similar or different or akin to affordances
of Gibson and to what extent that is similar to an action and to what extent also these three
concepts are similar to a structural coupling because these four concepts that I said have
something in common but also have substantial differences differences for example an action
if you see the chapter nine of Varela Thompson Roche the embody mind which I mean that's the
central book that they took forward for an action they make they make a substantial difference with
Gibson affordances while for Gibson affordances the reality is outside an action still believes that
or still argue that is a sense of motor in action so a sense making so is this still
there is no independent reality of the action of the organism so I would like you elaborate a bit
more between these four concepts not wealth affordances and action and structural coupling
and to what extent they relate or know to to to to active inference
yeah thank you very much for your question Sergio um yeah I mean there there's a lot of controversy
about the affordance concept so if you take it just like the Gibson's first book in 1979 in
the concept is not really clear so there have been several several approaches to it and we we skip
that part because we just took the affordances 2.0 approach from Chamero but let me expand a little
bit on this the idea is that if you see affordances as dispositions in the environment for agents to
interact with you are of course talking about an independent reality and that would contradict
an activism or or some of the basic standards of an activism but precisely what Chamero and Edward
Bax do in a paper in 2018 is to to split the idea of of the physical world which is Gibson's term
into two the habitat which is the set of affordances that are there for for the form of life which
would be for example for the species for human species and then the affordances that are there
for particular individuals that take them from the habitat so you have a difference in information
for and information about no so you have information for the species and that's the habitat that's the
the general affordances that are available for a particular form of life and then you have the
information about which is about the particular abilities of the individual which also is in
accordance with Gibson's first postulation that is to mix and and complete objectivity and subjectivity
neither one of them no which has this very famous quote that is a bit of a ambiguous no and and
everyone has talked about it so what we want to say talking about this is that umbelts
seen in this sense that is affordances for particular animals once they become in interaction with
with those affordances have two two constitutive parts and the and the and the word constitutive is
very important no there are the abilities and there are the features of the environment and the
abilities are made by sensory motor schemes so the abilities are what gets coupled or gets in
interaction with certain features of the environment and and so in that sense you can use the term
affordance in interaction with and with inactive approaches and I mean there are many inactive
theories that that support that idea in that sense no that that sensory motor interactions are
um autonomous are adaptive are um self self-defining but all the way through they have to interact
with the environment and when that interaction happens that is the structural coupling and
that's the affordance I hope I hope I made myself clear I don't yeah
yeah yes thank you indeed and right so uh the question is then and well they they in somehow
they are they are talking about the same thing um
um
you have basically I think so as far as I know you two two different approaches to how
how the the organisms acts on its environment one is a reactive paradigm which is based on
feedbacks only and feedbacks are just error counteracting behavior so the error has has to take
place in order to the organism correct that this is a very mechanistic explanation so
then you have watch what is quite a bit different in the sense that organisms are not anymore
reactive systems so that the organisms indeed anticipate and in this case make active inference
of the environment so based on uh either anticipative models of the environment
or uh generative models as as cal for instance uses to not to talk about so but roger rosen also
talks about anticipative models so how you can connect affordances and unwelled with
uh these uh these non-reactive uh behaviors of the organisms in the sense non-reactive
behaviors I am saying anticipative behavior so you are placing the organism as a passive
entity that only reacts or the organism can anticipate indeed things and can make active
inference of its environment uh and based on these active inference that the organism is doing
can change present behavior so uh how uh so far what what I got is that
there is some kind of of tension there in explanation regarding active inference so how do you place that
you go or I go okay um okay one thing is that um I hope I understood well your question but
one thing is that uh uh the prediction that you are talking about um is is is some of the things
that we are concerned about when we talk about active inference because exactly what what what
the inactive slash ecological in this sense that we just explained uh this mixture uh offers is is
more a sense of being uh of having habits uh much more in a pragmatic uh uh John Dewey's sense
than to be predicting every time we interact with the environment so the sensory motor schemes uh
become attuned with the environment and that's why we think that ecological resonance makes a good
point because it is the environment that is uh the uh leading the the way the behavioral body
reacts so there's no anticipation you have to be there to be um interacting with the affordances
and multiple affordances that are in that place so if they are not there uh you could um you couldn't
do it so even though you are predicting you wouldn't be interacting in in the in the way
you are doing in that precise time because um sometimes like like for example with depression
you can be in front of the same affordances and not being able to interact with them because
you have a particular uh state of mood or effective mood etc so what what we what we what we think is
that just talking about active inference in this sense um active inference can give us many many
answers to very interesting uh uh particularities but not to this to the trajectory of the particular
envelopes that the agent has i don't know if you want to add something itself thank you answer all
thanks i know that we are running on time yeah uh well i let the talk uh last a little bit longer
because the 430 talk is um has been canceled so we have a we do have a little more time uh
i think there was a question by Marco uh but uh it's there and Melina if you want to answer
it's fine or maybe you're tired or so it's up to you would you like would you like Marco to ask
this question yeah it's okay it's okay great i also saw that there is like a really good
discussion going on on the chat and i am really excited like it's so good yeah sorry go Marco
thank you um really interesting talk i'm a bit sleep deprived so sorry if if i'm not making
sense or if i miss something in your talk so in the chat i had just a clarification question
because there was this nice images you had with the nice loops of the bi-directional flows but
you had the n and the s within um what did they stand for uh nervous system oh okay fair enough um
and and and a more uh big picture question this is so so um i am very much empathized with many
of the points you make but but i can't um escape a kind of pessimism i think exactly um well
active inference but also ecological wrestlers i think because of the different way that we are
as in the distinctively different well as a beauty it's the diversity has a power but at the same
time i think it also means that that sometimes there is an inescapable uh unsurmountable bridge
between each other's uh lived experiences each other's let's say the reality and we see in terms
