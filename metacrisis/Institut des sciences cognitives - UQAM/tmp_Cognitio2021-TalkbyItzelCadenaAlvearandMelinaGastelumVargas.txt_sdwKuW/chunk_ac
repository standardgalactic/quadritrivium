of our own reality right and so that i think creates certain barriers for that participatory sense
make sometimes um and then that's the pessimistic parts and then my question to you is is more um
regardless if you agree or not what is the best way to still um make the most out of our neuro
diverse um society for the sake collective intelligence and if you really should encourage
or impose or force this this in my opinion over romanticized idea that everyone should
perfectly along with each other i think it's more kind of respect of each other's distinctively
different than unique umwelts and wherever it is possible to find a way to have this
mutually enriching participants make we should um because like you said you know we we just have
to understand the way we work but understanding how we work doesn't always immediately translate
into a smoother ideal mutual interaction right um yeah i have some questions about active
inference and prediction but i think that's maybe a different theoretical discussion so yeah i'd
love to hear thoughts about whatever i said well i think it's a great question i also used to have
that question before uh but for example hannah the jagger takes into account uh maria lugones
perspective she's uh the colony of epistemi epistemological feminist and she talks about
world traveling um in terms of creating a situated and engaged epistemology for science and humanities
and she says that from considering the diverse ways of in this sense for example
sense making the world we should like depart from the empathy and like understand that there are
diverse ways and we can differ as you said like we are able to differ in our way of sense making
of the reality uh but that doesn't mean that we should put as i said before with charon
that doesn't mean that we should uh put a hierarchy on the sense making so we shouldn't
like this is the concentrated or this is the adequate and the only adequate form of
comprehend comprehension of the world and she talks about word traveling because she says that we
should listen and read and take into account the voices of people in the minorities sir very briefly
because i'm confused with world traveling do you mean the physical world as in traveling around
or do you mean the live worlds the lived worlds like uh world traveling in in a sense of sense
making yeah because she says that maria lugones says that we create worlds in a individual and
collective way like in an abstract way i'm not saying like in a like we should travel around the
okay maybe one day yeah more in that sense so i like that way of thinking because i think that we
shouldn't put a hierarchy on how we should think or how we should behave um i don't know if i am
answering your question i think what would be useful is is to first of all to elaborate how we
achieve that and second of all though i though i agree there shouldn't be a universal hierarchy
i think it even though difficult and challenging especially in the modern social media culture
but i do think it's useful for the communities themselves to figure out a notion a normative
framework on how to engage a participatory sense making across different contexts um i mean one
example i like to use is is uh the civil rights movement right it's it's not about just homogeneity
we're all the same there is a utility in setting norms and uh giving special rules of leadership
given that there's a consensus that it aligns with the goals of the community as a whole right i
think the the danger of of hierarchy is othering and suppression and exclusion but i think it's
fine to have a commonly held notion of what ideals strive for and and and i'm wondering
how to do that for all the different communities for example autism maybe art is a very powerful way
for them to explore their own worlds given the difficulty doing so with the rigidity of normal
language but also what particular uh let's say microcosmos or micro cultures can be creates
not just for just autism and autism people but particular artistic people with other
particular autistic people and create a culture around that how do you see the role of your work
or your views um for that direction if that makes sense yeah i think that in a pragmatic sense um
on how to do that um i get the instance is also described by Hannah de Jagger and she says
to let it be um and i know that it's kind of a cliche um but she talks also departing from this
kind of situated and the colonial thinking in which i think that it involves to break some
um paradigms from the western world of organization you know and i know that it's kind of
um maybe it's like an utopia of thinking um to think on the transformation on our way of
organist of organized yeah of organized organized and um in a pragmatic sense for example in
psychology as you saw in the slides i was considering the intensive interaction um treatment
because in that one they i think uh depart from a way of thinking in which they don't put the
typical or normal kind of communication if not they what they do is to depart from the
sense making that the autistic people create so for example there are many like cases reported in
some papers and one of them um involves a girl an autistic girl that her way of interacting with
the world was by slapping with her hands the space she couldn't talk she couldn't like
um vocalize any kind of sentence or word and what the psychologist did was to first
visualize or observe the way of behaving and interacting of the girl instead of imposing
her own way of uh communicating like instead of going to her and saying like hi my name is la lola
what she did was to depart from the way of behaving and the way of interacting of the autistic girl
and i think that in that sense it could translate to the thing that i said of maria luganes of
world traveling like to listen to other voices to listen to the minorities and that doesn't
only involve to just say that they exist but it also involves to participate in in a situated and
engaged and active way uh i think that would be like the pragmatic answer for for your question but i
don't well i like that you said let's be because one other phrase i really love from the air is
letting in as knowing right and i think you know we talk a lot about participation but i think that
is something that should be explicitly mentioned sometimes because i personally sometimes worry
i don't know if it's justified that um the the toggle that includes the spaces is sometimes used
as a let's say a short a short cuts to avoid the more difficult job of actually letting in right
so the kind of almost robotic algorithmic action of i'll do this and that policy and then
will make people feel included um but not actually try to let people in to their own reality
even if they're very different from and i think that is a distinction that that i
personally very appreciate from the actor and it's become more of discussion than the question
but thank you that that's very interesting um replies thank you very much marco i we're gonna
take that one play it in it's a really it's a service but yeah it's a great it's a great discussion
maybe we can keep it going a little bit later on um well um thank you excel and melina
for a great talk very stimulating talk um
