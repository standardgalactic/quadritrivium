the problems are the platforms here so like the intents of the platforms that you are looking for
no so it's it's very difficult to i mean because the things behind the algorithms behind they have
another purpose so they are not they they facilitate use something but it's it's for me it's some
sort of illusion so because somebody was saying yeah it depends on the niche but maybe that's
exactly what they want you to think i mean that that's what we call audience curating no in in one
of the affordances so it's it's it that's the illusion that you have but because it's reinforcing
something no but i don't know i mean maybe there will be some different platform that will allow
different strategies and that doesn't have um economical purposes behind that's the whole
point here i think i don't know rolls away yeah exactly go ahead now okay so there are metrics
that we can easily i mean we've measured them i'm working on a project with Daphne
Demakis and Connor Heinz right now that's doing exactly that that's measuring the kind of metrics
which tell us what promotes an echo chamber and as i was discussing earlier echo chambers
produce brittle epistemic fields so what you want is an epistemic community which doesn't
produce this brittle field and my sense is that while we don't know what the goal would be we don't
we cannot tell right now what the best goal the best goal state would be there is a heuristic
that seems to lead in goal states which are generally seen right now looking back as more
positive and i believe those are those are uh more epistemically um accurate and a better
model basically just something that produces a better model and you can measure that on on on
social media platforms by simply seeing the interconnectivity of the network i.e. does it
produce clusters which are two separate from one another and then produce their own spheres of
knowledge which then are irreconcilable but also which socially um seem to be irreconcilable like
you literally do not assign any precision to someone from a group which seems to produce
something which is different from yours so it's not just semantically irreconcilable it's socially
irreconcilable so i believe that the answer to that is you as an individual have the power
to reflect on the kinds of things you're being shown and understand that while it may trigger
emotional responses which you do not want to be exposed to or that shows kinds of information
which you think are so ridiculous they're not worth being seen you should probably make yourself
see them just continue to keep that networking alive so that you um you can promote a better epistemic
field all right in that wonderful thought now um i think uh well we run out of time so we need to
wrap it up uh right here uh
