changes.
So the height of digital social affordances can lead us to the question, are individuals
becoming highly responsive to them?
So in this representation of digital social affordances, we aim to highlight that the
height is important because they are very salient and they are salient, correspond to
the affectivity as action readiness because the prediction error can be reduced in a very
fast rate.
So the richest opportunities for improving our grip come from affordances that are near
their too complex or not too simple.
Affective dynamics keep agents in contact with those spaces that have optimal complexity.
So in this same affective dynamics that are hijacked by addictive behaviors and substances
also includes the hyper-stimulating effects of many digital social platforms.
So digital patterns of attention, learning digital social platforms, may be placing into
risk a context-sensitive grip on a rich dynamic and varied field of relevant affordances.
Digital addiction is a similar story where pathological high precision on particular policies
can create an imbalance and indeed a collapse in the field of affordances.
Digital social platforms functions as a hyper-affordance, exploding how attention is manipulated by culture
as a tool to reduce metabolic costs but for marketing purposes.
So being sensible to prediction error dynamics makes digital social platforms a technological
tool highly attractive for users and they are built taking advantage of our natural tendency
to minimize prediction error in social contexts.
The task of minimizing prediction error is easy in the digital existence and it is felt
as pleasant as it tends to be reduced in a very fast rate.
So the takeaway message is that digital social platforms are trading with prediction error
minimization for our attention.
Having digital social affordances which allow an easy and fast rate or prediction error reduction
will keep our attention to generate more data and more and more value.
The field of digital social affordances is becoming more and more salient as attentional
manipulation increases.
Finally, we believe that in the digital way of life we are immersing it is worth to debate
and study further if and how the narrowing of the context sensitive field of relevant
affordances is occurring towards a biases anticipatory digital social affordances responsiveness
mediated by third parties' interests.
So special thanks to my co-authors Mahoud Elbaracin, Mark Miller and Bruno Lara and
to cognition organizers and well these are my information if you want to contact me it
will be a pleasure.
Alright thanks so much Alessandra it was really really cool.
Question with questions please come to the Q&A I think I see already Marco there we go
go for it.
Yeah actually I think I have a question still but I just wanted to say that was great and
I really believe that this is one of the most valuable applications for active inference
for the real world especially short and long term.
So one thing that I'm noticing is I think we need to accept that the institution is
that the industry is behind these maladaptive manipulations of how our attention is being
attention and values are being acted upon these there's a weird problem of they're arriving
at systematic methods without the systematic understanding which is kind of interesting
so you get the whole AP testing and focus groups and everything and they just do whatever
works and that's the scary part right they just do whatever works and that will continue
until the way of systematic understanding of why whatever works is also bad for us in
the long term right there is literally no incentive for them to make it in a long term
way healthy or sustainable and one thing I often like to say is that this is the modern day
analogy not actually a homology equivalent of the industrial revolution right so the
long term consequences are just really really complicated to understand and the moment
where we would see the impact negative impact of these kinds of practices if we wait until we
see them then it's going to be too late so again I'm just you know just saying this is really
great and important but so one thing that I find potentially of interest I'm not sure if you or
colleagues are already doing this is so the way that they can systematically and effectively
manipulates intention and valence for this you know the whole nasty loop of acting upon people
are there like tropes right so patterns like schemes right so I think game theory might be a
very very interesting lens for that so yeah I'm not sure if everything makes sense but this are the
like you know a way to create a framework of how these loopy ways of manipulating their users or
consumers will yeah it is done because I don't even think that if you're going to do the whole
the shady business in this company I don't think they will have a model that's a scary part you
can't just go in and wait for a whistleblower or something well you actually have to deconstruct
whatever they have found to be working so is that going to be possible for you yeah thank you for
all your comments Marco and it's very interesting what you were saying about gamification actually
there's a hypothesis for me it's very interesting hypothesis that
um make a voicing for example the importance of meta voicing can be seen as a meta voicing is
likes or yeah likes retweets all the hearts and like very tiny and a few types of communicating
with others giving feedback so quickly that's meta voicing okay and but what is important there
are metrics we can see the metrics how many likes how many hearts how many retweets or shares
and this is the game is this the theory behind this gamification of communication so users are
internalizing metrics as an evaluation of of how we communicate so it's not what is not
per se relevant is the content of what we are trying to communicate but the numbers the metrics
behind so prediction error it's um and the and the type of of information we want to share
like behind or underneath it it also with we are expecting metrics in the way we are communicating
so yeah um for me it's a very relevant point there Marco
there's a there's another way that we could parametrize what their strategies are by simply
looking at what kind of information pattern maximally reduces um you know free energy and
basically just gives you a very very strong reduction in uncertainty right so or or signals
that you're going to have a reduction in uncertainty on any given kind of field so for instance a very
known pattern is um these two people are the ugliest in the world uh check out who right and so
they're hinting at the fact that there is a very salient social information here and that
there's a very simple way for you to disambiguate this information which is socially salient and
this kind of pattern is is easy to parametrize right you could you can easily find um it create
an agent which um has an intentional process that is driven by the the prediction of reducing
some uncertainty and thus having a model that knows it's going to reduce its prediction error
over time um the problem with that model would be that if they used it it becomes an arms race
right we can identify what processes are most likely to lead to this which means they could also
identify them and potentially you know use it yeah i'm not sure if that's what moha was moha was uh
uh what that was about but but but if i should correct you so i think that's what i also mean
why i think game theory is important i'm not just saying gamification but like the the game that is
played between the user and these technologies so when when because because the game the implicit
language game or the game that is played is in itself a kind of belief right so when you reinforce
that these are the modes of interacting that these are the games that um with which you interface
with cyberspace or the world at large through cyberspace and that in itself is the issue because
when that becomes precise then there is very little means of escaping that because you're
very interfaced with with the world how you relate to the what your notion of what signifies
significance if that is already claimed by this that's a culture um then you had to escape it so
i think that's what i what what i mean to say and like moha was saying that becomes an arms race
and and it's an arm race between not the user and these companies but between the companies and
that's the scary parts so what should be the way that people and users can in a weird way also
engage in the arms race but not like you know doing it upon each other but what is the way to
these da symmetries or read even the playing fields right i'm not sure if that's because i
feel like this work is is really good at for now at a problem diagnosis and you know the ideal scenario
would be to leverage that to get to solutions problem solving um and how to design tools or
new practices and then you know i to be honest for now and i'm slightly pessimistic that i think the
most valuable part is actually re re-appreciate and re-emphasize the importance of lift practices
and i think that also and i think the people's intuition that that is the case also
is indicated by certain movements i think someone mentioned john raveki the meaning crisis
the the i think the pandemic has facilitated this whole community building movement as well
i think that is all in the meat space because i think that we have an historical foundation to
ask this question um i'm ramming a bit but i'm just also curious about your thoughts about
whether in the cyberspace itself there's also a way to counter these movements
yeah i i totally understand your your your point mark marco and and i'm i'm not sure
what could be like the outcome of what is happening right now and there is no regulation
that's that's a big issue there is no regulation and and if regulation starts um then um new ways
of communications can emerge and we are going to need new and new regulations um and i actually
don't think regulation yeah so so in my point of view um it's um it's it's in it's in the individual
level so each one of us has to like uh be aware of of our field of relevant affordances how many
time do we spend there so what what i have done and and this is in the personal domain i turned off
all the notifications i'm i'm i'm almost out of facebook really i'm i'm i'm really doing it um
it's difficult you know uh that's a problem um because these these things are i think it's my
point of view but um if i want to share something personal here i'm i'm feeling better you know
being out of of social media and um i'm just using whatsapp because of uh covid pandemic and this
is my social interactions but that's that's almost all so yeah it's a personal decision
and to be aware of this this strategy is behind of the manipulation of attention it's important
so you're not aware so the responsibility is in the user what i i think this is where um there
Ali and i kind of disagree um the problem statement in itself like i don't think per se the problem
is that our attention is being focused because the reason it's being focused is that we're
tuned to a hypostimulus the problem is that this tool is mostly only being used by one or two actors
which have a very specific intent in mind and so while we could repurpose their tool for
community building for an extension of knowledge which we have to some extent
unfortunately they have been mine to screw with our epistemic field to polarize us so
completely that eventually we're unable to continue sharing and we're we're becoming limited to a very
brittle um understanding of reality which is a problem in itself and then we don't have the
tools to keep moving forward um i think that's the issue we could effectively um turn ourselves
into hive minds and maybe that's not a bad thing maybe the the relevance of the field is only
a function of what we intend to do with it um so you know my answer is a bit different from
Alejandra at this point i guess i agree i disagree with everyone that um because and i fully encourage
people to take first responsibility in protecting themselves from the maladaptive influences but
at the same time i think we can't escape the fact that cyberspace is here to stay um and and i think
like like mo z there there's going to be you know opportunity for a lot of beneficial use cases um
but i think it's impossible almost impossible nowadays for most mortal souls to find a healthy
balance and how to integrate it in your life and i think that's that's where we need to go where
it i don't think it ever will be perfect but that it will be uh designed in such a way that it's
feasible to develop your own particular relation to cyberspace and just a very brief point because
because finally there's a another person wanted to ask the question so i also want to say that
regulation is not it's not the answer and the reason why is because um it's not the skill at
which regulation tends to occur won't suffice for a this fast-paced um industry and b for the level
at which the maladaptive mechanisms occur is is highly variable and it's highly specific to a
particular cyber particular context the user um equal platform interaction and so i think what's
crucial is is that the the the platforms that exist need to have the available mechanisms and
signals to know when something is maladaptive then maybe hopefully Kevin is also going to talk
about this i hope so give what he said before but but that's again why i earlier also mentioned
this whole thing about epistemic signals right this whole whole goddamn fucking industry is just
pragmatic it's just all reward driven and even when something is ostensibly uh epistemic that it's
still not you know it's not actually for the sake of understanding it just has to learn about being
epistemic so amount of shares and stuff right that is not actually because you want the user to
know how popular or how good it is or how worthy of reading no it's a measure of how many people
will view it so that you know how valuable ad space will be for that particular thing and so that's
the thing i think you know given that this is an active inference group that's a crucial thing
what is epistemic should be epistemic what's pragmatic should be pragmatic and it should be
in the healthy relation with each other and anyways i've been rhyming too much but again
great work and i hope to see this continue on further and go Kevin thank you so much
excellent um Kevin is next and this is unfortunately this is our very last question
right and maybe just like kind of a more proactive right kind of uh foray into the space
sorry words thanks to Marco and of course Alejandro and now but the uh you know because
the thing that i've been wondering about right this kind of is a personal side obsession is
well the agents who are using right these kind of attention attracting technologies right to kind
of advantage themselves or actually like you know maybe this couple will have like the maximum
influence in the space but also it's like it's too component right so it's both the agents also
the needs they're embedded in and what the niche is selecting for in terms of strategies
and that is like i guess maybe analog trying to draw the analogy of like
but yeah given a certain environment in a terrain it's like incredibly hot it's really
helpful for species to evolve and adapt to ready heat as much as possible it's very cold right
they adapt to uh to retain heat as much as possible and there is no like you know one size fits all
kind of depends on the uh the situation they're in and our own message uh directed at mal regarding
the idea of relevance at least comment on previous in the chat um whereas like well
you know i wonder if like even makes sense i'm still in this idea from John Ricky but
of like can you give it a national definition of what's relevant because you know it's it's like
well can you say what's fit well no it just depends on the nation the context ran and so
then maybe the question is is what do you guys uh suspect would be a better niche construction to
facilitate uh you know whether it's facebook or whether it's you know uh different corporations
using advertising techniques to kind of fracture or capture certain attention uh or really just
the attention economy right it's driven by a certain kind of uh and i don't really know right
what what the like i also i'm very always skeptical like is it just one problem or is like involved
two things kind of feeding back to each other and kind of feedback loops and reinforcing and
kind of creating these immersion effects that no one agent is actually responsible for and maybe
they don't even want which goes back to marco's point about like they're optimizing the short
term without the long term goal in mind but like there's no incentive right to want any for that
goal uh and maybe that's analogous to like how what incentive was there for like buys to uh
figure out that you know there should be like an answer anti like cancerous element if you
don't see that fact until like you know 60 70 years the ones lifespan and you've already effectively
you know reproduce offspring like is there a reason for for the the needs to select for a strategy
that's actually been visual long term um you know i guess what would that look like sorry that was a
long question i wonder do you want to start but i expect you and i will have different answers
so i just you go ahead go go go ahead runo no one can hear you do you want to take my spot
um no it's no one yeah no one in the okay just go to another screen i guess
that's uh that just very quick um the i think that one way to answer this is like um
