because the sense of information that's upcoming is so unknown, is that because we have nothing to
really rely on, we have to rely on the best thing we have. And in that thing, even even kind of
priors that are kind of very imprecise might still be more precise and have a stronger influence
than the even less precise sense we input that's incoming. I think it's very important to distinguish
the variation as something that is completely unrecognizable
and something that seems simply surprising in the variation within a certain state space or
dimension. And then I think that these kinds of nuances are important to make a difference for,
and I think the second question, because it should not be too long, but the second thing
that I want to point out is not everyone and not everything in the models would be equally
sensitive to the injected noise from psychedelic substances. And I think that is also an important
question, like what is differentially sensitive to the particular noise of the injected system?
But I see Mo already kind of... Yes, absolutely. Go ahead. I want to give Professor Marta Garido
her spot now as she is one of the keynote speakers of our conference. So thank you so much.
Jonas and George just was an amazing talk and very stimulating. If you want to continue the
discussion again, the chat is available and you can continue after the presentation outside the
conference room.
