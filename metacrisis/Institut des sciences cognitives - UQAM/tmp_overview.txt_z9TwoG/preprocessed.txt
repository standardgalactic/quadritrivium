1. The problem with social media platforms is that their primary focus might not align with the long-term health of epistemic communities or societal discourse. These platforms are optimizing for short-term engagement and profit rather than long-term stability and truth. This can lead to feedback loops that reinforce existing beliefs and create echo chambers, which can be detrimental to a well-rounded understanding of the world.

2. The incentive structures within these platforms do not inherently promote the discovery or implementation of solutions to problems like echo chambers unless there is a clear financial or engagement benefit. For example, it took decades for the scientific community to recognize and address the risks of asbestos, and similarly, platforms may not have an immediate incentive to solve issues like misinformation or polarization.

3. The solution might involve creating new platforms with different goals, which do not rely on engagement metrics that encourage echo chambers. However, this is challenging because new platforms must compete with established ones, which are optimized for user retention and ad revenue.

4. There is ongoing research to measure the metrics that contribute to echo chambers and to identify strategies that promote more robust epistemic communities. The goal is to create a network structure that fosters interconnectivity and exchange of ideas without leading to irreconcilable social or knowledge divides.

5. Individuals have the power to influence their online experience by being mindful of the content they consume and actively seeking out diverse perspectives, even if it challenges their own beliefs or seems initially unappealing. This personal commitment to maintaining an open mind can contribute to a healthier overall epistemic environment on social media platforms.

In essence, the discussion highlights the complex interplay between individual behavior, platform design, and societal impact, with a call for both responsible platform governance and proactive user engagement to foster better information ecosystems.

1. The speaker presented their work on bridging the gap between formalisms in active inference, particularly focusing on the origin of action spaces and their relation to transfer and earning within decision-making processes.
   
2. The speaker emphasized the importance of a meta space for building theories based on previous tasks or actions, which is a component of active inference that involves minimizing surprise from a set of possible actions.

3. The speaker discussed the order of constructing models, suggesting that one should start with an level where the surprise minimization or range of minimization is most feasible and then build up from there, leveraging feedback to facilitate learning across different levels.

4. The speaker highlighted that settling on a layer with zero deviance from expectations is not optimal; instead, the gain of information and learning should be considered at multiple levels simultaneously.

5. The speaker mentioned their interest in applying these concepts to both real-world systems (like human societies) and machine learning systems to understand how natural intelligence can inform machine intelligence.

6. The speaker expressed a desire to transition towards more practical applications, particularly in product development and engineering, to complete the feedback loop and test their theories in real-world scenarios.

7. The speaker clarified that when referring to "real world," they could mean either brains or applying the concepts to actual data analysis and machine learning systems.

8. The discussion touched upon transfer learning and how information gained at one level can be beneficial at another, as well as the importance of feedback from real-world interactions to refine and improve the models.

1. The discussion revolved around the verification of systems, particularly in the context of living systems (autopoietic systems) where one verifies whether the system maintains its boundaries and self-reproduction.

2. In mechanical modeling and functional explanation, one can both validate and falsify models based on predictions they make. Consistency with structure, mechanism, and terminology is key in this domain.

3. In pure formalism, the focus shifts from truth to the utility of mathematical structures. The question of what mathematics is useful for remains open, and different theories or formalisms compete for cognitive space among scientists.

4. The intrinsic versus extrinsic debate was touched upon, with a distinction between motivations (intrinsic) driven by internal processes like reward systems and informational considerations (extrinsic), and the structural aspects of agent models which are more formally defined.

5. The discussion also briefly touched on the challenges in defining 'knowing' and how extrinsic factors can influence what is considered knowledge, potentially leading to representationalist interpretations.

6. Serpa Andrade requested further intelligence on the math behind his ideas and offered a future PhD opportunity for anyone who could provide substantial insights or collaborate effectively.

7. The event will take a 10-minute break before resuming the discussion, with gratitude expressed for the engaging conversation and the opportunity to present his thoughts on these topics.

1. The question raised concerns about the potential for AI to provide unconditional empathy, which could reinforce negative behaviors or norms, such as those of murderers, misogynists, or Nazis. This poses an ethical dilemma that could lead to societal control over private thoughts and actions, reminiscent of a "1984" scenario.

2. Mark respondend by acknowledging the validity of the points raised. He mentioned that Rosalind Picard, an expert from MIT in affective computing, has addressed similar concerns in her talks. The potential for AI to be embedded within and perpetuate cultural norms is a significant issue.

3. Mark also pointed out the risk of these technologies falling into the hands of powerful entities that could use them to manipulate feelings and enforce specific norms or conventions, which could be detrimental to individual autonomy and societal freedom.

4. He emphasized the importance of considering the ethical implications and potential misuse of affective computing technologies. Mark acknowledged that he does not have a definitive answer to these complex problems but highlighted the need for careful thought and further discussion on the matter.

1. **Study Overview**: Dr. Marta Garido presented a study investigating how individuals with autism integrate sensory information compared to neurotypical individuals. The study focused on how people use prior knowledge (priors) and new sensory information (likelihood) to make decisions.

2. **Key Findings**: Individuals with autism were found to be more Bayesian in their decision-making, meaning they better combined sensory data with prior knowledge than neurotypical individuals. This suggests that the common belief that individuals with autism are less adaptive at integrating these two types of information might not hold true in all contexts.

3. **Sample Size and Diagnostic Criteria**: The study included approximately 20-something participants from both groups, with a relatively larger number of neurotypical individuals compared to those with autism. Participants were diagnosed through an adult interview conducted by a clinical psychologist, confirming the self-reported diagnosis of autism.

4. **Power Analysis**: The study did not perform a power analysis as there was no established benchmark for such research in autistic populations. Instead, they used sample sizes similar to those used in neurotypical studies.

5. **Follow-up Studies and Future Research**: Follow-up studies are being conducted to further explore the principles of Bayesian reasoning in neurotypical individuals. Additionally, researchers are examining why people, including those with autism, often make suboptimal decisions and how these computations are implemented in the brain. The focus is on understanding the neural mechanisms that underlie these behaviors and decision-making processes.

6. **Questions and Answers**: A participant asked about the sample size and whether a power analysis was conducted, to which Dr. Garido responded by explaining the challenges of working with clinical populations and the lack of a benchmark for such analyses. Another question concerned the diagnostic criteria used, which was clarified as a clinical psychologist-led adult interview based on self-reported diagnoses.

7. **Concluding Remarks**: The presentation concluded with Dr. Garido thanking Roshini Pinto for leading the study and emphasizing the importance of understanding how individuals with autism process information to improve interventions and support. Pierre, another presenter, was then invited to offer concluding remarks and to express gratitude towards Dr. Marta Garido for her insightful presentation that wrapped up the conference.

 Marco and participants engaged in a thoughtful conversation about participatory sense-making across different communities, using the Civil Rights Movement as an example of setting norms and leadership that align with community goals. The discussion touched upon the balance between having common ideals and the dangers of hierarchy, which can lead to othering and exclusion.

Marco highlighted the importance of creating microcultures that cater to specific groups, such as those within the autism spectrum. He mentioned the concept of "letting it be" as proposed by Hannah Arendt, emphasizing the need to break free from colonial and Western paradigms of organization and to transform our ways of interacting and organizing.

In the context of psychology, Marco referenced the Intensive Interaction approach, which departs from conventional communication methods and instead adapts to the unique ways individuals with autism interact with the world. This method involves observing and engaging with the individual's behaviors rather than imposing external norms of communication.

The conversation also touched upon the ideas of "letting in as knowing" and the importance of truly including diverse perspectives by actively listening and participating in a situated and engaged manner. Marco expressed concern that sometimes the act of including different spaces can be reduced to a mechanical process, which may not fully embrace and understand the realities of those communities.

Overall, the discussion emphasized the value of authentic participation, the dangers of tokenism, and the importance of adapting methods and approaches to genuinely engage with individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences. Marco's insights highlighted the need for a balance between common norms and individual expression within participatory sense-making processes.

1. The discussion revolved around the concept of how psychedelic experiences can lead to a sense of oneness or encountering God-like entities, which can be influenced by cultural backgrounds and personal beliefs. This is often described as an endogenous agentic experience where everything is perceived to be under a common cause, and the self or ego feels expanded or integrated with the universe.

2. The phenomenon of sensory blending occurs when there's less differentiation between perceptions, which can be amplified by psychedelics, leading to a cohesive experience where external stimuli (like music and plants) are perceived as moving in time together due to a shared underlying cause.

3. The discussion shifted towards the importance of understanding both the diversity and unity in experiences under psychedelics, especially in terms of therapeutic effects. The self-model or ego might be affected by these substances, which could have significant implications for therapy and mental health.

4. Priors, which are culturally influenced stored beliefs, play a role in how individuals interpret their experiences under psychedelics. Due to the heightened uncertainty and novelty of the experience, these priors might exert a stronger influence than usual.

5. The nuances between seemingly random or surprising sensory input versus variations within a state space are important to distinguish. Not all parts of a model are equally sensitive to the noise introduced by psychedelic substances, so it's crucial to identify what aspects of the experience are most affected by this altered state.

6. The conversation highlighted the importance of ongoing research in system neuroscience and the potential therapeutic applications of psychedelics. It also emphasized the need for further investigation into how these substances differently affect various aspects of human cognition and perception.

7. Finally, it was suggested that the discussion could continue in the chat or outside the conference room, emphasizing the interactive and collaborative nature of the event.

 The discussion revolved around the investigation of mental action, particularly through the lens of attentional agency in experienced meditators. The researchers are using a specific experimental setup that involves presenting musical patterns to participants while they are meditating. The goal is to measure the brain's entrainment to these patterns as a marker of conscious attention or awareness.

The conversation touched upon the possibility of entrainment occurring even during unconscious states, like sleep. However, the challenge lies in distinguishing whether the entrainment observed in meditators is a result of their trained awareness versus a normal physiological response.

A suggestion was made to enhance the contrast between the two groups by training non-meditating participants to associate a particular musical pattern with an increase in their awareness, thus making it a more conscious and deliberate process. This would potentially allow for clearer distinctions between the entrainment responses of trained meditators and those without meditation experience.

The researchers intend to include a third group in their study that would consist of participants who have no prior knowledge or training related to the musical patterns used in the experiment. This addition aims to provide a baseline for comparison and further clarify the effects of consciousness and mental training on entrainment.

In summary, the conversation was about refining an experimental approach to study how conscious intention affects brain entrainment to external stimuli, particularly in the context of meditation and attentional agency.

1. **System vs. Thing**: The distinction between a "thing" and a "system" lies in how they are described‚Äîa thing is often considered as a static entity, while a system is characterized by its dynamics or the process it realizes. A system's properties, such as being closed, are descriptions of the processes it undergoes rather than the physical object itself.

2. **Minimization Process**: The minimization of free energy or surprise level can be seen as a tool or a means to an end for systems, particularly for living organisms. It's not the fundamental imperative but a useful approach to achieve the system's primary goals, such as maintaining metabolism and ensuring survival.

3. **Metabolism**: In the context of life, metabolism is about maintaining a characteristic set of states necessary for the organism's existence, using the process of minimizing energy or surprise as a means to that end, not as an end in itself.

4. **Variations and Information**: Variations around a state of minimum free energy can provide information that systems use to perform functions beyond just returning to equilibrium. This suggests that processes like minimization are not always about reaching a stable state but can be more complex, involving the generation and utilization of information.

In conclusion, Kay's talk emphasized the importance of considering systems as processes rather than static entities and highlighted how principles like minimization of free energy or surprise can serve as useful tools for understanding the dynamics of living organisms and other systems within a metabolic framework.

1. Kelsey discussed a study where participants were shown two squares, one of which they controlled by moving a mouse, and the other was moved by the experimenter. The task was for the participants to predict and match the movement of the controlled square.
2. In the study, the movements of both squares were sometimes perturbed (made unpredictable) to different degrees in different blocks of trials. This allowed the researchers to investigate how uncertainty affected perception and action.
3. The results showed that when participants actively controlled a square, they were more sensitive to prediction errors and acted earlier compared to when they were just observers.
4. Kelsey mentioned that individuals with autism may have a higher learning rate or a higher expectation for volatility, which could lead to more frequent actions to confirm their model of the world.
5. Kelsey also noted that she enjoys art and has some training in it, which complements her work in academia and research.
6. If attendees have further questions for Kelsey, they can reach out to her via email or Twitter, or if she's still available, in person. The conference has concluded, but the opportunity for interaction with Kelsey remains open.

1. The ecological and inactive framework of active inference is appealing because it provides a translational account that can be understood by various fields without needing to fully grasp the formalism. It allows for the integration of relevant concepts that can then be unfolded into more detailed analyses when necessary.

2. Regarding the challenge of negative or destructive scripts and external actors who might manipulate the idea of gender fluidity, the argument is that diversity and difference naturally generate prediction errors. A world without error is epistemically weak and potentially brittle. The scripts emerged because people were not finding themselves in pre-existing scripts; they needed to create their own to accurately represent their reality and interactions with others.

3. The issue of performance, whether it's performing a gender identity that doesn't fit or masking in autism, highlights the difficulty and effort required to conform to social expectations that don't align with one's true self. This speaks to the importance of allowing for a variety of scripts that accurately reflect individual experiences and realities.

In summary, the inactive framework complements active inference by being accessible and translational across disciplines, and it emphasizes the value of diversity and individual difference in reducing prediction errors and fostering more accurate representations of self and social interactions.

1. The discussion began with a philosophical question from Alex about whether any form of modeling or scientific practice could capture the true generative process, to which Mel responded that by definition, if something were to fully capture all aspects of the process it's modeled after, it would no longer be a model‚Äîit would be the process itself.

2. Mel clarified that in order for something to be considered a model, it must involve abstraction or idealization, discarding some variables to focus on others.

3. Steven asked about the potential danger of enforcing scientific or mathematical authority onto machine learning methods due to their foundations in maths and science, which could lead to reification and misuse as a "good sales pitch." Mel acknowledged this concern but emphasized that treating ML as a scientific model also holds it to high standards, which is ultimately beneficial.

4. Mel pointed out that while machine learning methods are often linked with physics concepts, these links are not always grounded in the actual physics but are formal analogs. However, Mel believes that holding ML to scientific standards is more advantageous than the risk of misplaced epistemic authority.

5. The conversation highlighted the importance of critically evaluating the relationship between machine learning and scientific modeling, ensuring that the authority of science is not misapplied or misused in the context of ML. This reflects an ongoing debate in the philosophy of science about the role and interpretation of models and their relation to reality.

1. **Speciation as a Model for Cultural Innovation**: The slide suggests that the process of speciation in biology can serve as an analogy for how new beliefs or cultures emerge within societies. In this context, a "species" is considered distinct when its members cannot interbreed with those of another species due to significant genetic differences. Similarly, cultural "speciation" occurs when groups within a society diverge so much that their belief systems are incompatible, leading to the emergence of new cultural entities or religions.

2. **Christianity as an Example**: The example provided is the emergence of Christianity from Judaism. Early Christians and Jews had different interpretations of the concept of the Messiah. Over time, these divergent beliefs led to the formation of two distinct religious groups.

3. **Conditions for Cultural Speciation under Active Inference**: To simulate this process of cultural innovation (or cultural speciation) under the framework of active inference, three conditions are proposed:
   - **Isolation**: The population diverges due to a new belief state.
   - **Convergence**: Individuals within each group adopt beliefs that align with their group's interpretation, leading to collective free energy minimization.
   - **Novel Belief State**: A belief state emerges naturally from the dynamics of cultural transmission that is sufficiently different from the status quo but not so different that communication and understanding become impossible.

4. **The Goldilocks Zone**: The new belief state must be "just right" ‚Äì different enough to cause isolation between groups but similar enough for communication and understanding. This aligns with the assumption in active inference that agents need sufficiently similar generative models to achieve hermeneutic resolution (mutual understanding).

5. **Potential for Computational Simulation**: The slide posits that if we can create the right conditions computationally, we could observe how a novel belief state emerges from cumulative culture dynamics and how this leads to the spread of new cultural information through a population, thus closing the loop on the circular process of cultural dynamics.

6. **Conclusion**: The speaker invites the audience to consider how to computationally model these conditions to understand how cultural evolution occurs through the transmission of information, leading to divergent traits and the emergence of new cultures or belief systems within a population.

1. The discussion revolved around the ontological status of norms and their causal efficacy, particularly in the context where norms are codified in a book (like laws or religious texts). It was agreed that in such cases, changes to the book itself can have causal consequences due to its role as a causally efficient entity.

2. The question of whether collective-level causation or holism can stand as self-sufficient explanations was raised. There is a consensus that individual behavior is influenced by collective norms, but there is contention regarding the acceptability of holistic explanations as independent causes.

3. In cases where norms are explicitly codified and enforced, such as state laws or religious commandments, there is a clear causal mechanism at play (reading and applying the book, leading to sanctions and learning). This was accepted as an example of causally efficacious norms.

4. The speaker acknowledged that they have a holistic stance in the specific case where norms are codified in a book, but also mentioned that this position is contentious and not universally accepted.

5. There was no clear-cut knockdown argument provided for either side of the debate on whether norms at a collective level can be causally efficacious as self-standing explanations. The speaker indicated openness to both positions, suggesting that either could be acceptable depending on the context or one's philosophical stance.

6. The speaker expressed gratitude for the question and the opportunity to discuss these topics, emphasizing the complexity of the issue and the lack of a definitive resolution at present.

1. The speaker was asked if there are quantitative ways to measure correlation or differences in patterns, beyond qualitative observations from recurrence plots and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). They confirmed that RQA provides a numerical description of the patterns seen in the plots.

2. The discussion then shifted to whether the speaker had ideas on studying coordination in interactions where behaviors are complementary, organized around common goals in joint actions, rather than similar rhythms as in interpersonal coordination examples mentioned earlier.

3. The speaker referenced a paper by Ricardo Fusilieri titled "Dialogue as Interpersonal Synergy" to address this question. They highlighted that dialogue is a form of complementary interaction where turn-taking and rhythm may not be identical but still create a functional interpersonal synergy.

4. The speaker also suggested looking at sports teams as an example of such complementary coordination, where players coordinate their actions towards a shared goal without necessarily performing the same actions.

5. The speaker emphasized that in both dialogue and team sports, the concept of functional synergies can be applied to analyze and understand the dynamics of complementary behavior in pursuit of common goals.

1. The concept of flow, first described by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, is characterized by complete immersion and enjoyment in an activity. It occurs when individuals are fully focused on the task at hand, have clear goals, and experience a sense of control over their actions.

2. Flow can be achieved by knowledge workers, which include not just those in traditional office jobs but anyone who performs tasks that require concentration, creativity, and are non-routine. This includes musicians, architects, athletes, and more.

3. The clarity of the goals for a task is crucial because it allows the individual to allocate their attentional resources more effectively towards the immediate aspects of the task. Clear goals also help in minimizing distractions and external interruptions that could break the flow state.

4. Intention plays a significant role in flow. Those who enter a flow-like state do not focus on the outcomes or expectations but rather on how they engage with their work. The positive outcome is a byproduct of this focused engagement, not the intention itself.

5. Immediate feedback is another key component of flow. It helps maintain the individual's attention and performance in the task at hand, allowing for quick adjustments and sustained focus.

6. The model of flow is designed to be broad and applicable to various fields and activities beyond knowledge work, as long as they require deep concentration and creativity without interruptions.

7. The presenter emphasized that the intention is not to limit the concept of flow to a specific class of workers but to understand how it can be achieved across different domains to enhance performance and experience.
