relatively equal in size. Now in terms of taking a look at effort and attention across the different
knowledge work stages again this is results from the from the survey that we are going to be using
as priors frame the model. What we've noticed here is that looking at effort across the top this is
effort for group A, effort for group B, C and D across the top we see quickly that for groups C
and D they have more effort than groups A and B. Likewise for concentration which are the four
plots across the bottom we see again that groups C and D exhibit more attention or they report more
attention across the knowledge work stages. So in other words these high flow knowledge workers
claim to claim to perform more effortful and more attentive knowledge work than their low flow
counterparts. Another observation that we were looking for is when looking at effort
and attention within the groups we were looking to see if there's a situation where the attention
curve is going to be above the effort curve which is going to be synonymous with our
hypothesis of effort less attention but we but this data is inconclusive in regard to that
hypothesis so we will continue our investigation we will reformulate and take a different look.
Now in terms of looking at before agents or the four groups of agents performing
the knowledge work trials here we are seeing that for the situation where the target is present
which is this one across the across the trials we're seeing that there's a general increase
in response times as we go from a set size of zero across all the way up to set size of 100
response times are generally increasing for for the for group A which is the red curve
this is the random curve which kind of behaves a little different compared to all of the other
non-random groups which again are exhibiting that positive gradient as expected from the research.
In the situation where the target was absent we do not notice any significant gradient across
the set size but what is noticeable across both graphs when the target is absent and when the
target is present is that group D which is the orange curve always has lower response times compared
to the other agents and this is this is the we postulate is due to the fact that group D has a
belief base uncertainty reducing policy that it is using in order to perform these these
fixations these circuits and fixations across the visual scene and the last plot that we were
taking a look at is the uncertainty how does uncertainty change for these different groups
across the actual trail and here we can see that once we go over 100 circuits we're seeing that
again the group D which is denoted by the orange line the rate at which uncertainty
in the stimulus is decreasing is much faster than the other types of the other types of agents
and therefore we conclude from this one that group D type agent again is benefiting from
that belief update that allows it to reduce uncertainty in its in its belief over over time
so to conclude we found that active inference provides a toolkit that can be used to study
flow in a scientific manner where we can model different types of agents put them into different
contexts and observe the effects we also see that the conditions that cause free energy to fluctuate
during deep concentrated effort may become indicators of flow state transitions
and this is this is what we're going off in our broader research project which is seeking to enhance
the lives of knowledge workers if we can identify what causes transitions in flow state then we might
be able to design a choice architecture for these knowledge workers that can allow them to enhance
their cognitive well-being as well as to maximize the amount of time that they spend in the flow
state we also found that results from this simulated conjunction configuration visual
search tasks is the results are consistent with results from laboratory studies and this leads
us to the next point which is our future work you will be focusing on taking this particular
visual search tasks into the lab with real humans and collecting behavioral and neural
bio data to be able to verify and test the model that we've created so that concludes our
presentation I'd like to thank you for your attention and now I've opened the floor for any
questions that you may have. Hi thank you for the talk it's always an interesting topic so
I'm a bit distracted so sorry I just missed it but but I was curious like when you
at the the part we have a different strategies for the visual search was that was that just
you just decided that or how did that come to be is it was it already differentiated per strategy
or were you just giving them the strategies per group what was the rationale behind that
right thank you for your question so the strategies that we used for groups A, B, C and D
are compatible with the strategies that were identified with the visual search of the air traffic
controller at the beginning where we were where we were seeing that in in some prior research
air traffic controllers when they're performing an initial scan of their radar screens depending
on the complexity they would choose a specific scan path and those scan paths would either be linear
scan paths circular scan paths mixtures of those scan paths and what we decided to do was to create
a naive agent which was group A type agent which was just random goes all over the place
group B was a more linear type that forms linear traversals linear circuits group C
we endowed that agent with the ability to go around circular in quadrant style and then group D
this was the agent that we were using to model the active inference component which is why we
gave that one a belief map of the of the intervisual scene and and the and the task of that group D agent
was to update its belief in order to to minimize uncertainty as it covers the the algorithm
features were assigned to the assigned to the agents
um i'm just uh it's a bit confused but um so did you assign them based on like like like you said
you saw these flight patterns at the um what's it called flights attendant attendant jesus uh
what's it called the flight flight controller flight controller story yeah so so were the
particular strategies um also associated with for example high and low flow or or just complexity
because because the groups were organized based on their um flow propensity and flow
in motion right but um the flight flight visual search strategy for the flight controllers
that was related to complexity right or was that just random
yeah those strategies and it also depends on the the uh the experience level of the actual
air traffic controller in terms of the preference of scan strategy that they would use
but the the whole notion of it is that the the uh the participants who are going to be more likely
to get into flow they would have a more uh a more optimal or or rather a better they would have a
better scanning strategy than the the low flow uh agents and that's that's like a general concept
people who tend to experience flow uh in their work usually have some strategy uh some extra
knowledge um that allows them to do that and this is kind of how you were to differentiate
in the region oh okay all right thank you yes i still have the question uh Troy are you familiar
with Wuwei can you please repeat i'm a familiar familiar with the concept of Wuwei if workplace
action is in chinese at least in chinese no i'm not familiar with uh that concept
okay so there is a recent book by Slingoland that discusses that discusses it and the core idea
that apparently according to him the ancient chinese philosopher like Lao Tzu and Kung Fu
said is that uh basically you cannot be actually focused and efficient on something uh if your mind
is on the end result you can only work well if you detach yourself from the outcome and only
focus on the process and uh you have uh pretty well known uh accounts of master workers that
basically say uh it's um sculptor i would probably say in english uh it's people who have a cover
and they see the wood and they see the carving within the wood and they only enact
what what they see in the wood and there is at no point of the process something like
an intention or will that is enacted on the world do you see this interacting with
what you know of flow and acting in France
okay what i what i gather from from your point is that when a person is entering into the state
of flow they're limited attentional bandwidth uh part of it maybe maybe focused on the task
but another part of their attention maybe focus on maybe internal feelings maybe on the temperature
of the room other external things but but it's not on the task what happens is that as a person
goes into that state of flow uh their attention diverts from those other other sources and becomes
more focused on the task at hand and that to me is what allows the the person to be able to
let's say obtain more information about the task per unit time and therefore enter into that uh
that state of flow uh however when a person is in flow and some distraction occurs outside
in the external world or let's say inside of the body of of that person then they can
become interrupted they get the distraction they become interrupted and know their flow is broken
they have to recover and rebuild uh that flow so uh i don't know if that is close to what you
just said but to me that's the we will obtain more fluctuates in in flow
okay so what i meant to point out is the role of intention and actually the nature of intention
in uh flow a state of flow because what is critically entailed by the national food way
is that someone which is in a flow like state because they do not expect to make flow is someone
that is detached from the results they do not have the intention they just have a way of engaging
with the world and this way happens to have an outcome that is judge positive but the outcome is
entirely outside the mind of the agent is this something that uh you see reflecting in your work
right so what i what i can say is that uh remember when i put up the main components of flow
uh one of the first ones on that list was about the goals of the the goals of the work task being
very clear uh and to me if the goals of the task are clear from the inception what's going to happen
is that again the bandwidth that the person has to pay uh to that particular uh part of the task
which is to understand the goals their intention what their outcomes are that they're going after
once they have clear and proximal goals they can free up that bandwidth and allow allow more
focus to be had on these specifics in the immediate task so again i think it is all about how do we
how do we take our attentional resources and focus them not on extraneous or
alternate uh sources but to focus as much attention as possible on to the task and and the immediate
parts of the task that's where immediate feedback is also one of the central focuses here of flow
um so again i i don't know um how the long-term goals outcomes uh and intentions
can have an impact other than consuming attention okay thank you thank you um any more questions
any answer anyone moving uh no yes i had um a question you seem to mention knowledge workers
as though this was a very specific class and when listening to your notions it seemed that
one flow is a state which seems to arise in a variety of areas including just learning art
or any sort of job which requires being at the edge of potentiation slash epistemic
value being integrated into someone's model so i guess my question is does your model explicitly
only apply to what you call it as knowledge worker or is it actually a very broad model which you
chose to focus on knowledge worker just because it it allowed you to do um interesting solutions
yeah so my aim my aim with going for knowledge workers was to get that broad perspective
uh and and again when i when i defined knowledge workers early up i try to keep it broad but i
can define that as persons who have performed these these nor routine nor routine jobs jobs
that require concentration creativity and no interruptions okay so this now can mean that the
the musician who is composing the next piece he's he's definitely a not she or he or she's
definitely a knowledge worker just as much as the architect who is building a new mall so the idea
here with this with this model is to be able to even incorporate persons who we don't consider as
knowledge workers but who still experience flow considerably for example um athletes athletes
are other persons who interact with some pretty complex tasks but they but they usually report
or are a lot of them report entering into this data flow so the model that we have here is is
this is we're trying to make it as general as possible in order to be able to apply to
different types of knowledge workers and potentially different types of workers outside of
what i think she was satisfied with the question the answer um uh any more questions
um if there are none uh i will thank uh atroy and uh um uh for this presentation for a
