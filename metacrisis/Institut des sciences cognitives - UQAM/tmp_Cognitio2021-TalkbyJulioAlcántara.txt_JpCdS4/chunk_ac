attending the course?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I assume that they, they are on purpose being
Oh, and, and, and the correlation with the musical patterns would be a marker of exactly
that.
Yes.
Ah, okay, okay.
Okay.
But good.
No, thanks.
It's, it's good also these questions, because it allowed me the possibility to give me the
chance to, to describe in a more fine-grained grade than I don't feel better, but as to
the question, I feel better than if no one else still has the questions.
Then one other thing is just to point out, I mean, I'm not sure if you've considered
this, but there might be a bit of a mythological issue then, like, is it possible that you
get the entrainments of slowest sleep still to the musical signals?
Could you repeat it again?
Like, even when you're not conscious, the brain still has the ability to entrain to
external stimuli or external patterns.
Yes.
No, no, that's why there's this.
There's the smell and there's the sound.
Yeah, of course.
That's why we, or I designed the experiment based on, on sound, for instance.
Because that's a kind of survival tool that evolution gave us in order to, even while
asleep, we can wake up.
Yeah, but there's a possibility that even then you, you would get this entrainments
effect, even for the non-practitioners, regardless of whether they have the dreamless lucidity.
Maybe you could tweak it a little bit where you could have a trained, conditioned response
for the awareness of a particular musical pattern instead of simply the entrainments.
Because I'm not sure if you can disentangle the entrainment as a consequence of the consciousness
or phenomenology for versus normal entrainments.
So maybe if you just add one small thing, you could increase the contrast that you would
hope to find between the trained meditators entrainments and the non-trained meditators
entrainments.
And which could be?
I mean, it's just one suggestion.
You could, you know, just train literally in lucid, I mean, waking state, just train
them to have an associated response to those musical patterns.
For example, maybe you, to the opposite or something, like, like you try to increase
their awareness in the spaces between the notes, something like that.
Something that wouldn't happen if you wouldn't have no consciousness.
Yeah.
To emphasize that would be, I was thinking already to do some kind of thing like that
with a third group, because I would like that some of them come without knowing any
other way.
Yeah.
So that's a good point.
Thank you, Marco and Julio.
Yeah.
I'm going to thank you for your wonderful talk and thank you, Marco, for raising all
these questions.
We're going to take a five minute break.
So go ahead and have confidence.
Thank you.
