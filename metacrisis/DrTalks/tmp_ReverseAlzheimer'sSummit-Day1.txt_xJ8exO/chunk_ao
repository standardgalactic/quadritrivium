pardon me inflammatory blockade restores adult hippocampal neurogenesis so what i did in the
paper and the book really is broke that paper down and put it into layperson's language and i'll
just break the title down in front inflammatory blockade in other words you're stopping inflammation
that could be stopping the infection anti-inflammatory diet you know things of that nature restores
adult adult hippocampal brain neuro neuron genesis genesis the genesis of new neurons
your brain is like humans we don't send babies to war babies or stem cells your brain doesn't
activate stem cell activity when your brain is under an inflammatory assault so the only
pathway you have is degeneration so you know good nutrition identifying and stopping the
source the infection for example but then you've got it down regulate inflammation you know it's
just like in COVID they say the cytokine storm kills you it's a combination you know it's a
chicken and the egg but let's say the infection's gone if the cytokines are up at a certain level
you've gone over the hump and there's no there's no going back and in the brain it's the same thing
but it's not so dramatic as it is in say something like COVID-19 right so this is a very hopeful
message um i'm curious because there's a greater understanding and also it's very consistent you
know with what we hear from Dr. Bredesen that it's a multifactorial multifocal um landscape of i'm
starting to think of it as the dementia verse right this universe of dementia and and there's
a problem scape or there's a landscape where by which someone can come to dementia and come to
have dementia and how we unravel that is not going to be a one-size-fits-all here's a drug
whether it's an eye or a pill or what what have you it's not going to look like that it's going to
look like assessing in a much more holistic view what all is going on and then plugging the holes
or you know there's lots of different analogies that are used for this but basically making sure
that all of the things that are influencing poor health are addressed even if we've come to think
of them as being pretty removed from dementia things like dental work or like you've mentioned
eye health joint health all of these things are clues that there might be something out of balance
that's contributing to that dementia so i'm curious what in in your uh from your perspective what the
treatments look like for Alzheimer's i think i'm sort of alluding to what i'm hoping you'll say
and then why why so many have failed you know why they've failed if you look at farmer because
they've gone after the wrong target and you know the next big thing five or five or eight years ago
was the uh hyperphosphorylation of tau and uh but we wrote in our book in 2011 those are going to
fail and they did because you know it Alzheimer's is is really a hypoxic state lack of oxygen state
as you have learned to heather um in tissue in this case in the brain and it's interesting that
animals that hibernate hyperphosphorylate their tau and when they come out of hibernation they
dehyperphosphorylate it so hyperphosphorylated tau is obviously some sort of a hypoxic protective
mechanism that's why those have failed the amyloid antimicrobial peptide is elucidated by
harbing so there's an infectious process going on that's why those failed now i don't claim to
say that treating an Alzheimer's sufferer is an easy task when they're already in a
state of cognitive impairment because you know if you go to mass general and get an MRI with
mild cognitive impairment you already have 17% brain shrinkage the process is already ongoing
so you know what what we do is is you know dr bernison's wife's a functional doctor really that
his book is all about functional medicine extraordinarily important start with a mouth
i think it's overlooked oral DNA tests we do that cone beam looking for cavitations where you've
had wisdom teeth looking for pockets root canals have got to go you know i know it's an emotional
and structural issue but the oral DNA test or other tests for oral pathogens are extremely
important and there's things you can do in the oral cavity we blog on this all the time we're
fanatical about you know something as simple as do you clean your toothbrush after you pull
pathogens onto your toothbrush before you brush the next time and you reintroduce them
you know it gets that basic but you know i recommend you like put it in hydrogen peroxide
or like what do you do anything you know i'm i'm a lazy chemist and so i just have a a glass of
salt water and there's salt at the bottom that means the solution above is completely saturated
it's like the great salt lake or the dead sea nothing lives in it and i actually had one of my
participants is a ventilation engineer and he tested this and he found no pathogens so i just
throw my toothbrush back into um the salt water every night you know when it softens the toothbrush
so i'm not a brushing aggressively but i think water flossing is more important now you know you
you're here at tom levy talk about hydrogen peroxide and you have an oral microbiome so what
i do with the i actually use povidone iodine i i'll do an iodine water floss just once a week
you know just once a week to keep things down but gut so many people don't appreciate the gut
continuum they say oh a little constipation once in a while you know on the continuum
we're just symptoms emerge like in diabetes we have a little bit better understanding of
continuum than anyone see at 6.4 than at 6.5 you're diabetic well you're way up the continuum already
before conventional medicine diagnoses you with a condition i would argue that in gut
if you are not completely regular you are in the middle of that continuum and you have work to do
we we blogged a husband and wife team out of stanford showed very clearly that over generations
we've lost at least 50 of diversity of our microbiome and that's what's doing all the work
in our immune system breaking down foods um minerals are the hardest to absorb you've got to
have strong acids if you're ever on a tums or even have a even if you well i only have reflux
when i have a mexican food no you're up on the reflux continuum you are not optimal we need to
move you back down if you're talking about something as serious as a brain disease thyroid
things of things of that nature but sleep hygiene these are the basic things but at the end of the
day i i truly hard of hard and my research shows it that these subacute infections have taken hold
so now we have to get it aggressive with really strong supplementation you know the
oregano oils the biosidens the herbals the medicinals um when i when i did a study in a
corporation i had a hundred people that i had carte carte blanche to do any test that i want
and i showed that when they had they had every kind of condition their every age
from polychondritis to Parkinson's and when they had a chronic bacterial infection
they had comorbid virals so everybody should be on a viral protocol everybody and what does
the viral protocol look like to you so a viral viral protocol is periodically doing the tom
levy high dose vitamin c recommendations and other people's recommendations doing quercetin
and zinc if you don't do it every day all the time then you do a month long type protocol
vitamin d you need to be up at 55 80 nanograms per milliliter you know you need to get that up
as well i i recommend prophylactic and talk with um you know mark hyman's old partner back at
kenyer at ranch market with owners we heard at a round table we all agreed that we would do an
antiparasitic cleanse every five years or so and you know the herbals work but ivermectin is
is superior and now we know it's antiviral so prophylactically do some ivermectin um
you know and what i recommend is not the antiparasitic you know two doses you do five or six doses
and then every other week for a year and you know you you check your white blood cell counts though
and see if see if they're coming up to the right level um so that's really what we're doing medicinal
mushrooms dr austin on my team is an expert he goes out foraging for mushrooms fungi every weekend
and so he has a variety of medicinal concoctions of the mushroom ilk and ifm included that in their
list of of antiviral protocols but i tell you that the single thing that i'm bullish on and
dr carter and i created a very lengthy video on this is cod liver oil and i was on mccole and
mccole and i debated this a little bit but i'm not gonna you know i i hail to uh to joe so it's
like i let that slide but give you an example in 1848 in british hospitals it was an epidemic of
consumption which is tuberculosis so bad they're coughing up blood they're on death's door
and giving high-dose cod liver oil with the vitamin a the vitamin d and other fat soluble
nutrients that fish oil doesn't have and cruel oil doesn't have reduced mortality by 50 percent
and you know it's it's well it's it's well published and we have it on our on our youtube
channel a healthy viable partners so you know it's it's very profound what cod liver oil can do
and if you worry about cod liver oil what i do is i do a simple thing same thing i do at probiotics
i rotate them you know western a price foundation i think that the brand is rosita then there's
green pastures then there's carlson's then there's nordic naturals and there's um garden of life
so all i do is i i have one of each and i just rotate through them and my secret number
based on thomas prospels work in famous physician from um britain in the 1800s is 15 grams a day
that's 15 capsules and nobody wants to take 15 peltz so i take half a shot glass of cod liver oil
and just shoot it every evening me i eat a lot of fish so i don't i may be lying if i say i
do it every evening but you know i i mean i'll eat fish twice today so um you know i feel like
my my brain anti-inflammatory terrain is consistent as well established and consistently
refurbished and i think that's that's the thing you know chronic disease i say it's all about
knowledge and consistency and and my biggest problem is is denial when they when someone says
ah i just have a little of this no it's not a little it's real in the traditional medical world
it's just a little bit though write it off say you're paranoid or it's nothing but in the functional
world we need to we need to express to people that the mildest of symptoms if it wasn't a one off
even if it's monthly you are not optimal in today's toxic world you only have one choice
to stave off chronic disease and live to a hundred and fall off the cliff rather than sliding down
that slippery slope and that is you need to bring everything into optimal now i will i will tell you
that dr trump's protocol for glaucoma and olesheimers which we use now and dr carter on my team is
reticent to do this so he'll do a more fully functional approach but we use antibiotics
and i mentioned earlier that a lot of functional treatments don't work why even ken star i think
he's a brilliant doctor he has the highest pressure hyperbaric oxygen chamber in the country
but these organisms in their stealth phase are refractory to that so you have to treat these
organisms long term because yeah that may be 10 active the other 90 percent are hiding
and they're waiting to come out when they see an opportunistic moment so if you keep a pharmacologically
relevant dosage of whatever your anti-infective is that's what you must do so if you get on the
brettison protocol or our protocol or a functional protocol and after four months you're saying i'm
not seeing results you got to stick with it it's the only way to overcome these chronic things
a few things have come on quickly and if you don't die from they go away quickly chronic
things come on slowly and they hang in there i try to explain that in nature everything follows an
asymptote what i mean by that is we're hardwired to say if i do one thing i get results and i
could do this thing i get another result but in fact everything follows a bell curve so you
going into disease oh i feel pretty good i feel pretty good and then all of a sudden you hit
this inflection the bell curve and then you feel crappy but it matriculated for 10 years 20 years
getting out of it's the same thing oh i don't see any results doc i don't see any i don't see any
results you we find that the it's at least five months to a true health inflection okay and i see
so many people it's like oh that functional doc didn't work we now i'm trying this functional
doc no you didn't you gotta give them you gotta give chronic protocols a chance to take hold
that's what are the what are the big pathogens that you think i know you you mentioned chlamydia
pneumonia and periodontal pathogens this is like pijenta vallis are there others that really stand
out yeah well i think you know Lyme disease and all the co-infections uh Bartonella or Lickia
things of that nature babesia we we look at um you know there's so there's so many comorbidities
so we look at what i call the usual suspects of chlamydia pneumoniae mycoplasma pneumoniae
we look at age pylori in the blood not the stool because it will disrupt the gut which
then affects the brain the enteric nervous system we'll look at rickettsial disease rickettsial
typhi rickettsial rickettsia rickettsial cornei um rocky mountain spotted fever and much more
common than people think i was doing testing up at a company in um indiana i live in tennessee
and the tennessee department of health called me up because someone in indiana was positive
of rocky mountain spotted fever and you know but i i tried to explain to the health department
it's like the reason why you're not seeing a lot of rocky mountain spotted fever is who's testing for
it right i mean have you had a rocky mountain spotted fever test no i've never been tested
for that most people have not exactly exactly and then the other thing is everybody will
tell you you know you do a food sensitivity test it's i gg then when an i gg test for
chlamydia pneumoniae comes back elevated every doctor in the world will tell you that's a
historic infection no it's a stealth infection it's a it's a a reticulate body infection it's
inside the cell in a biofilm infection and you know ewald talks about this and you know there's
coax coax postulates for tech testing for pathogenicity but the chronic infections
do not comply with coax i mean he was back in the 1800s brilliant guy he was you know trend
setting in terms of this but you can't culture chlamydia pneumonia right so it right away coax
postulates have thrown off but when we treat and just test i gg and the i gg is up first of all why
is it considered elevated even by lab core okay then we treat it goes down if it was historic
why would treatment knock down the i gg tighter so let's talk a little bit about this because
there is an alternative explanation right that that it is a resolved infection and that this is
a representation of your immune memory this is like what might happen after a vaccination
that your i gg would be elevated i gm would be normal so what you're suggesting is that there's
a different explanation never that is not true i will stand on that like what we better say 98
percent just because i'm sure there are circumstances but if the median pneumoniae
we'll just pick on that organism was positive i gm at one point we probably won't catch that
just because of the crypticity of the timing when you were exposed all that stuff
stratens work is beyond reproach these just like the herpes zoster can reactivate they live
intracelulally they are like hobos holding up where they can undiscovered waiting for an opportunity
no and there's no question i would like to ask any doctor that has
posited this that has a patient with an elevated i gg and treats them and the i gm is negative
and they have symptoms and the symptoms get better and the i gg come down to explain that to me
right there there's only so many there's only so many explanations you know i'll give you an
example so dr. tremp years and years ago told me this and i re i corroborated the research
so ophthalmologists and optometrists can see a toxoplasma toxoplasma gandia i forgot to mention
that very important intracellular parasite you know kitty litter worry about pregnant women being
exposed to it because toxoplasma gandia in the placenta can affect fetal brain development
well it can also affect brain development in an immunocompromised individual looks like
Alzheimer's but getting into the i gg i gm discussion so a toxo scar can show up in the
eye very characteristic doesn't always so it's not truly diagnostic for toxoplasma gandia
infection in the eye but it does is a signature so you run the labs i gg positive
i gm negative you can extract surgically extract that scar and put it in the culture and guess
what it grows toxoplasmosis wow so you know i i think sneaky sneaky i think what i you know i
run this health ministry and i always start off every session with where did you learn that
and so some things become urban legend or or just become part of our culture and we're not
questioning and titrating back so in this paper that i really need to publish but i haven't figured
out how because it's like 25 000 words and the reason why it's 25 000 words usually they don't
accept the 5 000 10 000 max maybe even 4 000 is because i need to explain i gg i gm before i can
go into this so i i have reference after reference after reference explaining that an i gg titer is
real okay and dr. trempin 2000 said i don't run i gm anymore it's a waste of my my patient's money
because a lot of times i can't justify insurance for these tests in guacamole or macules these
so that's why i stand on it a whole new way of thinking about it or maybe i guess um
i like to think that the well-meaning instructors that i had or who are pointing to this uh
interpretation um that there's probably some places where they're right right where there
there are times when when i gg represents what we've been trained and i gm represents a current
infection um but certainly this alternative explanation for it opens up a window where
people who aren't getting the help they need can be treated right and and it's using
readily available relatively inexpensive tools to test and i think that's one of the themes of
your your talk here is that there are readily available relatively inexpensive tools and if
we interpret them in a way that's helpful then and we use that to make decisions and and to
start treatment then we can get really amazing outcomes you can and i have videos posted that
i kind of hold close to the vest because a lot of people do not want their all-time videos but we
