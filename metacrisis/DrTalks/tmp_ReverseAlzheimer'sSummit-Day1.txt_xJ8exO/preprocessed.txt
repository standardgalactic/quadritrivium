Hello and welcome to day one of the Reverse Alzheimer's Summit. I'm your host Dr. Heather
Sanderson and I'm so happy to have you here with me today. I created the summit because
I just couldn't wait any longer for someone else to do it. Back in 2017, I was trained
by Dr. Dale Bredesen on the Bredesen Protocol to prevent and reverse dementia. Soon after
that training, I had patients coming to me asking to get on the protocol, very enthusiastic
about doing everything that Dr. Bredesen had detailed. Well now, a handful of years later,
we know even more and I want to share that with you because these patients taught me
what I didn't know. I had been a bit of a skeptic. I thought I believed well-meaning
professors, other neurologists, other people who had told me that there really wasn't much
that we could do about dementia and that it was giving false hope to families if we said
we could do something about it. When I saw these patients reversing their dementia in
just a matter of weeks, I knew that I had to dedicate my life to telling anyone who will
listen that this is possible. There are too many people needlessly suffering. Now I was so
inspired by my patients that I really have dedicated my life to this. I applied for a
grant and was awarded it to study this approach to dementia in 25 participants. We're currently
collecting the data in my office and I'm looking forward to publishing a peer-reviewed article
next year in 2022. Stay tuned for that. And also, there's a lot of great new research that you're
going to hear about today on day one. So not only have I done this research trial, but I also
started Marama, the first residential care facility of its kind. I was being approached by
patients asking, where can I send my loved one? My dad or my uncle or my mom has dementia. And I
just I want them to get this the benefit of this lifestyle of these interventions, but I don't
have the capacity to do it at home. It's hard work. And for someone who's struggling with memory
issues, it can be next to impossible to implement. I saw that most of my patients were getting better,
but there were some that just didn't have the capacity to do everything that we were suggesting.
They wanted to. And so I created Marama as a place where they could go and trust that they would
get to implement the entire protocol with the help of well-trained caregivers and a non-toxic
environment with all the brain-stimulating activities all day long that you can imagine and
an organic ketoflex diet. So you'll learn much more about this and other things throughout the
summit. But I just wanted to share with you why I personally am so invested in this topic. I have
watched too many people suffer unnecessarily. I've heard too many times that they went to a doctor
and they were told there was nothing they could do when I know that that is factually inaccurate.
I have watched it with my own eyes and I continue to see it day after day. I hope you are as inspired
by my patients as I am. Before we dive in to everything there is to do, who do you know

Taking off today's summit is Daniel Schmattenberger, a dear friend and mentor of mine. Daniel is a
founding member of the Consilience Project, aimed at improving public sense-making and dialogue.
The through line of his interest has to do with the ways of improving the health and development
of individuals and society with the virtuous relationship between the two is a goal. He's
going to share a new model for how we can understand the root causes of dementia and why it's so
important to go after root causes rather than just memory loss. We get to reimagine what healthy living
healthy aging really can look like. This first talk sets the tone for the entire summit. So please
make sure to stick around for the full interview. Let's get started. Daniel, thank you so much
for joining us. I'm happy to be here with you, Heather. So we met six, seven, maybe even eight
years ago now because you introduced me to a patient who you were working with as sort of a
coach and a manager, a case manager, so to speak, on his very complex symptoms that no doctor could
really figure out. And you met me in an integrative office where I had really just started working
as a new doctor. And I think what you found in me was that I was curious and excited and young
and malleable that you could you saw someone who you could influence to to and turn on to these big
ideas that feel a bit overwhelming, but where we really can have an impact. And I have been so
inspired by the way you grapple with these really big problems, things like Alzheimer's disease,
and find manageable solutions. And it gives me so much hope about some of these big issues that
we're facing as a society these days. One of the big pieces of information that you related to me
will there while there's lots. One of the most important things was this concept of complex
system science and how just because something is complicated and complex doesn't mean that we
can't get really great outcomes, and that we can apply that to the human body in a very systematic
and organized way. And that led to you and I developing this framework or this model of medicine
where we apply that science to to getting people healthier and optimized.
I'd love to dive into it with you. So can you can you start to describe this framework in this model?
Sure, but I want to start with what I actually appreciated in you that had me want to collaborate.
I wouldn't say I was anything like a case manager for this friend. I was just a friend,
and it was a time in my life where I was putting a good bit of just my own private study in the
thinking about health and medicine and disease and aging because it's obviously relevant to
everybody. And most as my bio that seems to make no sense for a course like this would indicate
most of my interest has been with other complex systems like economies and ecologies and cultures
and governments and kind of global things. But how a society self-organizes, how it breaks down,
how it's healthy and how a body does is not that different. Complex system just means
lots of interacting parts where it's a little bit hard to model and you end up getting things like
self-organization and emergence and stuff like that. So I was working with people who were friends
who had health issues that didn't seem to be addressable in the current systems and trying
to think through how do we make sense of why the body self-organizes pretty well when we're young
and why the same genome starts to self-organize less well with age and stress and etc and why
some people seem to kind of age earlier than others based on various things and why there's
a distribution of people who get better with particular diseases and people who don't and
like what spontaneous remission actually is and you know just thinking through those things.
And you were one of quite a few doctors who I was interacting with during that time but
what you had that was pretty unique was the intersection of being very interested in novel
ways of thinking while also being very conservative to make sure that before you were implementing
something with a human person that you could actually see people who had been clinically
working with those ideas and getting good results. So you were neither the slow adopter that wouldn't
do something until it had been you know fully FDA approved but you also weren't the cowboy who was
like running the experiments on people and I thought it was a really right intuitive synthesis
and you just cared about your patients so much that you spend all of your free time
thinking about their cases and worrying about them and which is exactly the right psychology for
a doctor who really wants to care about people and I could see you were willing to put in the
time to think about each case really in a unique novel way not just here's the disease diagnosis
and this is how we treat it and so in terms of someone to be able to practice and think through
each person in an n equals one unique case situation and to be able to find things that were
reasonable to apply but that also might be able to offer results outside of what was currently
available you were a perfect partner have been since. Well thank you it's been really an honor
to get to work with you and a privilege to watch many people improve their health when you know
they were told maybe otherwise by another doctor was that a point where sorry I can't help you or
there's your tests look fine there's nothing wrong and seeing that story comes through my office
over and over again applying the model that we built together to those patients and really
developing a confidence over time that we would get results over and over again very predictably
on on challenging complex cases and that brought me to studying with Dr. Bredesen you turned me
on to him initially in his his model of Alzheimer's and how to approach Alzheimer's is basically a
complex system science adaptation to that particular disease process and I really had the
interest the curiosity around it and the desire to help these patients because no one else really
is doing it or was at that point thank god there are quite a few more doctors who have trained
with Dr. Bredesen are starting to understand these ideas but you and I talked through this early on
and I think it can be applied not only to Alzheimer's but to many many other complex
chronic diseases and so I want to dive into that framework and sort of this finite number of things
that can disrupt the complex system and the definition of balance and how in balance is
really what ultimately causes disease. Yeah one of the things that I found very interesting that I
was looking at with any chronic complex disease people who had MS or even just severe chronic
fatigue or things that didn't have a clear causal pathoediology that we knew how to define
and clear treatment there were doctors who were doing strange things in different parts of the
world that were having success better than the background of spontaneous remission and
one of them would be a Lyme doctor and like not everybody would get better but more than
people who were getting no treatment or just traditional treatment and one would be a mold
doctor and one would be working with endocrine balance and one would be working with methylation
and various things and so what I was interested in is why are they getting results at all
and then also why are they not getting more complete results those were like both equally
interesting questions and so my kind of default hypothesis was that maybe MS is not one thing
maybe Alzheimer's is not one thing maybe it is a dysregulation of a self-regulating system a
complex self-regulating system and that system can dysregulate in different ways and if it
dysregulates in a way where a similar set of tissues and biomarkers are affected we call it
the same disease so we call it MS if there's a similar set of symptoms or whatever but even
like within Alzheimer's we'll see there are people who have we diagnosed with Alzheimer's who have
beta amyloid plaque and some who don't and there are people who have beta amyloid that we don't
diagnose with Alzheimer's and some have apo E4 mutations and some don't and so it's not even
like there is a clear diagnostic so that kind of diagnostic marker is helpful for insurance
purposes but it's not that helpful to really understand what is going on and how to prevent it
or reverse it and so it made sense to me that if we're dealing with a very complex system that
its self-regulation could break down in multiple different ways that could lead to
similar kinds of pathologies similar kinds of expressions of symptoms or clusters of biomarkers
and so it was an interesting question to see are the doctors who are working on
Lyme getting some results because sometimes Lyme is one of the major factors and the ones who are
working on mold are getting some results because sometimes that's one of the factors and that
if we were to study all the things it seemed to be getting some results so this is kind of looking
at positive deviants on the side of success case study success let's take everything they got some
success and take that as a hypothesis that that is one thing that might sometimes be involved in
that disease let's also just look at the research literature that is looking for correlation and
causation and see what are all the things that show up as being sometimes statistically involved
so do we see that in autopsies of brains and nervous systems of Alzheimer's patients that we
see Borrelia more often than we do in background people so we would see a correlation that is
curious to be it is that a partial causation right things like that and then we start to say okay well
all those things that if when you treat them they get better more than spontaneous remission and all
the things that in the literature seem to be at least statistically correlated more than you
would expect for background rates let's take all of those as possible contributors to this type of
pathology and we'll create a phase space of all the things that we know that might contribute
and then say well what if we did diagnostics across all those things and we might expect
that we see different things for different people that 10 different people with MS have
10 different sets of things but that the question would be if we treated specifically the things
that we saw going on might we be able to help them with a higher success rate than just the one
working on Lyme or just the one working on mold or whatever it is and as it turned out
that ends up being pretty successful and so the question became how do we start to identify the
phase space of all the things that might be part of the causal factor we're thinking about
multifactorial causation and so that the complex chronic disease doesn't have one cause it might
have three or four ten causes they might not have all happened at the same time someone might have
have had a car accident that created a micro TBI 30 years ago that started to create stress in
the nervous system and make their system just slightly more sympathetic and less parasympathetic
that started to down regulate their immune function so that then 10 years later when they
traveled to Guatemala and got food poisoning they had an ongoing microbial issue in their gut and
then they got a subclinical dental infection right like that there's and in another case it was
mold in their house and a very stressful divorce and you know more genetic predispositions and
something else so we're not just looking at one factor but possibly quite a few factors
they might be delayed in time all the way up to like decades delayed in time and not just
that it's multifactorial but different factors and different people so also factoring different
kind of genetic predispositions that they're coming in with so how do we kind of put all
that together to be able to not treat MS or Alzheimer's or rheumatoid arthritis as if it's
one thing but to be able to actually treat what that person actually has going on and they're
presenting with in a more personalized way and that was kind of like the the beginning of starting
to then say how do we model all of the different areas and things that are worth looking at
and it's such an aha moment for so many people to go from being attached to the diagnosis like
what we name the problem or the symptomscape to going back and saying well maybe the better
question to ask is what's standing in the way of the complex system adapting and optimizing
and responding to the environment and being able to complete its functions on a day-to-day basis
for many many decades right and then maybe not only what's standing in the way but then on top
of that what can we do to enhance its ability to continue to adapt and be resilient to changes
whether it's seasons or aging or having children or working and contributing whatever the stressors
that come up in that person's life that they actually even have resilience and can optimize
their experience of the world. Yeah so this concept of resilience if we're going to define health
obviously health is the absence of disease. Symptomology is a very antiquated definition
I think everybody knows that because we all know stories of people who had a headache
went into the doctor and found out they had a brain tumor that was advanced they only had a
few weeks left to live and that thing had been growing for months or years asymptomatically.
By the time we actually get symptoms of a autoimmune disease we might have had
autoimmune markers and before that inflammatory markers for many many years asymptomatically and
also something that wouldn't even show up on normal blood labs so a system can be in sub-optimal
regulation that is starting to move into pathophysiology for a while before their symptoms or
the most common disease markers we would look for. So we say okay well how do we define health?
Health is about the robustness of the body's ability to maintain homeostasis or better term
friend Andrew Hill coined was homeodynamics and or at least that's where I heard it and then our
other friend Jun Yoon talked about not homeodynamics but homeodynamic capacity it's not is it staying
in range it's how quickly does it come back to range and how robustly does it come back when
a stressor moves it out so homeodynamic capacity or the resilience of the system to be able to
stay within healthy ranges as the system is stressed is really the definer of health right
which would be can someone be exposed to more viral particles of the flu and not get it can they be
exposed to more ranges in temperature and still be able to regulate their body can they be exposed to
more environmental toxin and be able to cleanse their body of it if they have a stronger liver
kidney etc they'll be able to and this is why we can see that kids recover way faster than older
people recover from the same thing their system has more resilience to it so there's something
about aging that even if someone does never disease there's less homeodynamic capacity
in the system right it can handle a less amount of stressor and still be able to come back without
symptomology so aging we wouldn't say is disease we would say it's an increased
susceptibility to disease of all kinds because the system just has less resilience
we can say that disease is not just about the decrease of the resilience of the system it's
the system actually having been not resilient and moved outside of the homeodynamics that a
healthy person is in now it's an altered homeodynamics or pathophysiology which we'll
call a disease state so the disease state means that some stressors were more than the body's
capacity to respond to and now there's an altered function of the physiology so there's a generalized
and a specific way we can deal with that the generalized way is how do we support the body's
resilience capacities that are general that are across the scope of everything and so most of the
like basics of health recommendation like exercise increases your you know if you're
exercising where you're increasing your mitochondrial density your mitochondrial quality you're
increasing your oxygen transport and your vasodilation that's going to decrease your likelihood
and susceptibility to disease of all kinds right the same with sleeping enough the same with stress
reduction the same with good diet and basic nutrition so it's how do we support health which
is how do we support the resilience of the system writ large in general and then how do we identify
the specific unique stressors that took this this system out of homeodynamics into altered
homeodynamics or disease state and how do we reverse those specifically so we use diagnostics
for the second part and we use general lifestyle work for the first part
and imbalance I love your your definition of balance and then also imbalance right that too
much too little in the wrong place and at the or at the wrong time is part of what leads to a
disease process so very simply we can think of diabetes right is too much sugar for too long
and of course scurvy is going to be too little vitamin C and these are kind of big examples
that are very obvious but there's going to be a gradation in between a spectrum in between where
you can have too little b12 or choline or magnesium or something else that is going to show up as a
as a small symptom at first but can later lead to a bigger disease process the kind of where our
interests intersect here right you this sort of imbalance you can apply to financial systems
education systems government systems if you have too much too little in the wrong place or at the
wrong time you're going to create imbalance and if we can focus on those things that really are
essential to maintaining balance and whether it's communication which is in in the body's in the
example of the body in the complex system that is the human body this communication system
is going to be the nervous system or the endocrine system with the hormones right where are we getting
those signals to tell our neurons to make more neurotransmitters or to connect create a synapse
and those things need to be in balance if they aren't that leads to disease
yeah so the topic you bring up right now is something that i would say naturopathic medicine
orthon molecular medicine functional medicine have started to popularize and pioneer but it's
so critical we should underscore it here is the idea of a um a subclinical imbalance and what we
mean by this is we know the level of vitamin c deficiency required to cause scurvy scurvy
meaning the formal disease definition that the person is now acutely dying of vitamin c deficiency
and it's actually pretty hard in the modern environment to get scurvy um you eat in orange
a couple times a year and you'll be fine right um so you've got scurvy down here but then we
can say what is the optimal vitamin c level for maximum health and it's pretty reasonable that
there's a pretty big difference between i'm acutely dying of vitamin c deficiency acutely dying
not chronically right not like it has just decreased general health maybe asymptomatically
that will have effects on lifespan but i'm now acutely dying of it there's a pretty big range
between that disease diagnosis and where optimum is and that if i'm anywhere within there i'm sub
optimal but not yet a definable disease so if i'm only looking at rickets and berry berry
and scurvy as signs of deficiency then i'll come up with the rda that we have and say that nobody
has nutrient deficiencies and it's just nonsense they don't have acute dying of nutrient deficiencies
but they might be very very far from optimal and that might make a pretty big difference to how
likely they are to get a autoimmune disease or cancer or a neurodegenerative disease or
psychiatric disease or just low grade energy or live less long and there are more areas where
that's starting to be recognized like metabolic syndrome you don't quite have diabetes yet
but you have a subclinical excess of glucose in the blood and maybe your baseline levels of
insulin have raised because of insulin resistance and so what we'd say is that and another classic
example is let's say we're talking about lead poisoning well there's a there's a level that
is basically the result of political lobbying legal lobbying of what do we consider the level
of lead poisoning to now get an insurance diagnosis where someone is going to have to pay workman's
comp or someone can be sued for negligence right like that we get into law criminal law
whatever lobbies are involved to say why did we set the parts per million here as opposed to here
and we can see that the parts per million of what was considered toxicity for mercury got
raised many times in the us because we kept creating industry that exposed people to more
levels and so long as it didn't cause immediate acute symptoms of poisoning then we could say okay
well it's not toxicity so the idea is that there's a level of deficiency that takes you into
instant disease but there's a level that doesn't take you into instant disease it might take you
into no signs of symptoms but to suboptimal resilience which means increased likelihood for
any number of diseases down the road but it's very hard to ever prove that because
that's going to be one of many factors that ends up affecting the nature of the disease you get so
you have very delayed causation which means very hard to prove causation right and so the same with
toxicity there might be a toxicity where you say okay here's the level of mercury or lead that is
in acute poisoning meaning you have symptoms your hair is falling out you're puking from the poisoning
what is the optimal level of lead or mercury exposure of those kinds in the body well it's
none right so how much higher is someone's exposure level if they're operating in industry or around
certain kind of chemicals then is ideal well it might be very far from what we would call acute
poisoning but it still might be a subclinical toxicity and then the same is also true with
infections and infections are kind of even more surprising because with infections there has been
this general kind of view in infectious disease that in infection means a pathogen enters the body
and you have immediate acute symptomology but we all know now that you can have an infection
that is say viral say HPV that increases your probability for cancer years or decades down the
road that is asymptomatic the entire time so is that that would we would call a chronic infection
that is statistically affecting the likelihood for certain types of disease the same with say
chronic subclinical H pylori increasing the likelihood for stomach cancer
and so as time goes on diseases we didn't think were correlated we start to find correlations
with some of those things but there's a lot of those that we have not found in medicine as a whole
yet but people at the cutting edge who are paying attention are starting to find these things so
subclinical infections subclinical deficiencies and subclinical toxicities are all really key
aspects of what take people out of optimal resilience increase their likelihood for disease of
various kinds are going to be multifactorial because they might have many different subclinical
deficiencies and toxicity simultaneously none of those would normally ever be assessed or treated
in a traditional allopathic framework and yet if i'm looking at why did this person come down with
chronic fatigue syndrome or autoimmune disease or cognitive decline these are probably where the
answers live you mentioned how industry influences so much of how we might interpret certain labs
and how and rda's or you know the cutoffs and thresholds where we consider it a disease process
or or significant there is quite a few ways in which society is structured that makes us sick
keeps us sick and really prevents us from getting the help we need at times and this is another
place where you inspire me because it can get very overwhelming and i think can feel paralyzing
to many people who are stuck in this trap however there are solutions i've seen it with my own eyes
i see it every day in my clinical practice and at marama and and we can work together to to solve
these problems but i also want to call them out so that people feel you know that they're not alone
you and i have worked together with patients who are trying to get life insurance and because
they've been proactive they've seen a chiropractor they've seen a therapist you know they've they've
gotten medications to prevent disease or to help to optimize their their physiological function
now they're being you know they're not they're either not getting disability insurance or they're
struggling to get life life insurance and this really i watch this i've told patients in my office
you know let's wait on the testing go ahead you have a new child get your life insurance
and then come back and we'll do all of this because your other doctor's telling you you're fine
you have symptoms so we need to treat them we need to figure out what's going on but we've
got to kind of go through this whole process that really is not designed to support healthy human
beings and so uh i just i want to i want to let people know that like they're not alone in that
that you know cheap food is not healthy for us but it's what's simple easy to grab and inexpensive
and healthy food it takes a little bit more effort it takes a little bit more money takes a little
bit more of that that you know you have to stick with it um takes a little more motivation but
it's so worth it and there are a handful of things including applying this model to complex
disease when you're not getting answers that really if you put in that effort extra effort
there are solutions well i mean this is kind of the um
the classic libertarian socialist dialogue of to what degree are we just self-determined and
can pull ourselves up by our bootstrap and to what degree are we influenced by the larger social
systems and environment we're in and it's obviously both and it's a reciprocal relationship between
both so i think everybody thinks that it's pretty clear that if you're born into an area into a
society where all of your water has malaria or guinea worm in it you're likely to have different
kinds of diseases and health issues as a result of where you're born um or lead i mean if there's
lead in the pipes and you're born there one point of lead in your blood starts to influence your IQ
so your potential what schools you get into what jobs you can get your earning potential
the rest of your life is influenced by that early lead exposure which is happening right here in the
u.s. today so i started with the malaria case because it's obvious and because it seems more
foreign to us we actually kind of really see it and the lead case is less obvious and because
you know we we don't necessarily have as big a reference for it but that it's the same thing so
let's say we take a more extreme example and look at flin michigan we're like okay we can see that
there's a thing there that is affecting the public health of everyone who lives there
so then we start to say well all right well if
as soon as uh commercial agriculture better living through chemistry started where we started using
ddt and then malathion parathion and now glyphosate whatever on almost all of the crops
is this going to have an effect on the human health of the people who live in that system at scale
yeah of course it is um and as soon as we start having a food system where the majority of the
food that people eat is processed and the processed food doesn't have anything similar in terms of its
macronutrient micronutrient profile is that going to start affecting health at scale of course
and it's important for people to understand that if i run a corporation in the u.s as a director
of the corporation i actually have a legal responsibility a fiduciary responsibility
to the shareholders to maximize the profit of that company it's a piece something i sign in
law that i'm breaking the law if i don't do it so if i'm the ceo or director of a major corporation
say nesli or hostess or mars or whatever it is right uh as a food company i have to work to
maximize its profit legally to be responsible to the shareholders money who's in it now to
maximize the profit i need to maximize the total number of customers buying the thing multiplied
by the total lifetime value of the customer lifetime value of the customer is how many
things they purchase how often there is nothing that maximizes lifetime value of a customer more
than addiction and particularly the younger the addiction can start the better so now you start
to look at the proliferation of uh soda and fast food and you know that type of thing and you're
like well this humans have an evolutionary weakness because we grew up in an we evolved
in an environment where famine was a real thing and so it was very hard to get enough fat or enough
salt or enough sugar in the evolutionary environment oftentimes it was always easy to get enough
cellulose right there was like green planty stuff pretty often but hunting is much harder
and and wild meat has lower body fat percentage and so we got we evolved a dopamine response
to things that have salt fat and sugar because that's where we would survive and have be able
to survive famine better well now post industrialization we created a world where we don't have a
deficiency of salt and fat and sugar we have excess of them and so then we get the but our
genetics haven't changed where we still get a hit you get a dopaminergic hit and so if you notice
all fast food is a combination of those three things just different combinations of salt fat
sugar with different types of palatability that are kind of split test optimized for addictive
maximization and we would hope that if there's multi-billion dollar organizations in the healthy
society that they have the vested interest of the well-being of the people in mind this is obviously
not the case they have the vested interest of extracting capital from those people which happens
through in this case optimizing for addiction and we can go through and look at that when it has to
do with the more that a company can externalize its cost to the commons as environmental pollution
the more profit it makes rather than spend the money it takes to actually process that waste
but then that equals public health issues for everybody and so we have a world where
nutrient deficiency and toxicity if not just the glyphosate that is put on the food it's the fact that
the paint in these buildings has volatile organic compounds that are all from petrol derived
chemicals that we have no evolutionary relationship in our genetics with and these volatile organic
compounds are mostly either carcinogens endocrine disruptors or neurotoxins and that it's
ubiquitous in the way we manufacture everything because it's an externalized cost nobody has
to pay for nobody's accountable for and so this is like all right well I have a hard time taking
responsibility for all those aspects of the world that I'm a part of right and so part of the answer
has to be systemic change right how do we actually change the nature of food manufacturing and
agriculture to have the well-being of the people in mind rather than not in the maintenance of the
soil the microbiome and the nutrients of the soil and how the food is processed and not having
addiction maximization associated with the profit structure and then materials manufacturing of how
we make homes and the nature of industries not having a financial incentive to externalize the
cost to the commons so not the whole so the whole solution is not simply what an individual can do
right a lot of it has to be systemic and if we dealt with that systemically just like
in our societies today western societies malaria is not really a thing even though it's totally
a killer in some places can we change the environment in a way that absolutes whole classes of
disease of course we can now in modern society do we have whole new classes of disease like
chronic fatigue and things that are pretty starting to become very ubiquitous that are totally uncommon
in other less developed environments yes that's because of different environmental factors
so of course right now most of the people on your call probably aren't working on how they're
empowered to do systems change for materials manufacturing but it's important to know that's
a part of the picture of what has to shift what you're trying to do with them now is within the
context of the world we're in how do we at least understand those factors so you know they might
be affecting you so you can take responsibility for it and if you're going to repaint your house
use non-boc paint maybe you run an air filter inside maybe you test for mold before you move
into an area maybe you pay attention to whether the food is organic and if you have a water filter
in those various things so other things that we can do you know just thinking about what do we
have the power to do right now while we wait for systemic change and one of the things is to be
well informed and part of that is getting a complete assessment and the next five days of the summit
are going to be deep dives into the different assessments we can do and so when we talk about
imbalance and complex chronic disease in particular Alzheimer's there's essentially five things that
can cause disease or imbalance and their toxins nutrients infections structure and stress and
so when I work with a patient we break it down and we want to get information about each and
every one of those pieces and so we'll be I'll be interviewing you know 39 other people this week
and talking about each of those pieces but Daniel you and I work to come up with that model to make
this very complex sort of overwhelming process of categorizing what are the things that are
going to inform our treatment and also inform the etiology how did this happen where did the
imbalances start yeah and I would say that is a very good clinical model to work with that
is kind of the applied side of some theoretical models that have a different number of categories
in them where it's not I'm saying this to simply say it's not an arbitrary taxonomy it is a useful
applied taxonomy resulting from some very non-arbitrary taxonomies of how do we understand
how a complex system self-organizes how the self-organization breaks down and can we create
models for looking at those factors that are necessary and hopefully sufficient something
like complete models and so what you were mentioning stress I think one of the things
that I was fascinated by earliest regarding human health was placebo trials and there are
some placebos where people feel better but they don't actually get better the underlying
pathophysiology doesn't change just their own sensorial process does so endogenous opioids or
whatever but there are some situations where the placebo actually makes people get better from
at a statistically higher rate from some underlying physiologic things going on meaning
we can see changes in objective biomarkers and this really fascinated me because I'm like
genetically the body has an imperative to survive that's its maximum imperative right
survive and reproduce but survive is fundamental to that there's nothing in the chemistry of that
sugar pill that should have empowered the body to heal better why is it if it's healing better
after giving the sugar pill with the belief that means it was not healing to its maximum
capacity before what is that like why would the body's genetic imperative to survive not be self
optimizing and there's a whole deep discussion of what's actually happening in placebo that's
very interesting but kind of the main thing that was the first interesting insight there for me was
that placebo is not equally effective across all audiences and placebo is not the only thing that
is effective of that kind so when someone has a placebo and it works they feel it works proportional
to them believing in it which is why we've seen that larger pills and more colored pills and if
the injection is actually more painful all those things actually increase the likelihood of the
placebo because the people are believing a real thing is happening if they believe they're going
to get better there's a hopefulness that increases that hopefulness replaces some of the worry that's
there worry is the projection of a negative future worry moves the person into a more sympathetic
nervous system state as they feel hopeful they go into a more parasympathetic nervous system
state well the parasympathetic system is key for regulating the immune system the digestive system
the detox systems the all the way down to genetic transcription and so it's not that the person
wasn't healing at maximum before it's that they were healing at maximum with the fact while being
in a sympathetic state which is dealing with the toxin of those kinds of stressful thought processes
that are keeping this body from going into the kinds of neurologic states that are necessary
for its own reparative systems to be optimized but then we got to see that you look at studies
like Norman Cousins where people just started laughing a lot watching comedy and their cancer
got better and they weren't believing they were going to get better but they were feeling better
so we get to see the belief they were going to get better was actually just one way to get to
the feeling better which was the more parasympathetic state and then we see spontaneous remission
stories where someone had cancer whatever they fell in love and got better and we're like oh
there's a there's a similar thing happening here which is the body can heal a lot better
when it is less sympathetic more parasympathetic overall well there's a lot of psychological
things that are keeping people in low-grade sympathetic overtone that are affecting the
system's regulatory capacities as a whole and so if we're not looking for that if we're not
paying attention to that we're just we're just missing whole categories of what's going on
and in the same way let's say that we're trying to help someone heal and we aren't trying to
figure out if their house has mold in it and maybe we see signs of inflammation in their body
and maybe we see signs of biotoxin maybe whatever and we're trying to deal with it but we aren't
looking at the environment they're in well they're just never going to get better
let's say that we're not looking at do they live in a household with weird codependent
relational dynamics associated with food where everybody in their household is obese
and nobody exercises and they actually don't have the willpower to change their behavioral
pattern inside of that relational environment so if you don't actually change their relationships
their relationships are a primary cause of their illness right so the physical environment can be
the social environment can be their own internal stressors can be psychological stressors including
ones that they aren't even aware of meaning unresolved trauma from the past that has just created
chronic hypervigilance right and heaps of different categories of physiologic things like
subclinical nutrient deficiency subclinical excess of toxicity or pathogenicity so if
we really want to be comprehensive in assessing what's going on for someone got to look at all of
that right we have to look at all the different categories of what might be subclinically imbalanced
in their physiology and in their psychology and in their social environment and in their physical
environment and that's kind of like a minimum taxonomy to start to make sense of these things
and in order to do that the doctor has to spend a real chunk of time the patient and this is the
tricky part is that we don't have enough doctors who have the training to do that and we just don't
have enough doctors period or a financial system where most people could pay for a doctor's time
to be able to do that and have it make any sense but like you just you can't run labs on all that
right like I can't run a quick lab on what the social environment that is embedding someone in
behavioral patterns or in stress patterns is like that takes time asking a lot of questions
you know I find and I know you do that by far the number one most important diagnostic tool in
the world is a comprehensive medical history and that takes in a very educated healthcare practitioner
spending a lot of time and you know what exposures did you get and what injuries and what
surgeries and when did your symptoms start and trying to really piece that whole thing together
and then running the labs and then contrasting the labs to that story and to their current
symptomologic presentation and what makes it better and what makes it worse and seeing does
this story make sense before we start treating another component of that is doing the right
things but in the right order as well so if we jump straight to treating Lyme disease or treating
an infection when we haven't supported the immune system by getting rid of toxins and reducing
stressors or balancing stressors we haven't supported nutrients then it's going to be
really challenging if not next to impossible to get actual disease resolution but to actually get
rid of those microbes to get rid of those bugs if we don't have the system working with our
antimicrobial agents whether they're pharmaceutical or supplemental or herbs or whatever it is and so
if we're jumping straight to our favorite diagnostic tool or favorite diagnosis as a
provider again like you mentioned we're just missing this entire problemscape right and that
being as comprehensive as possible we're doing a clinical trial on reversing Alzheimer's
currently in my practice and what we see over and over is that the more comprehensive we can be
the faster the easier we get real results so putting all of it together is so essential
and yet unfortunately although it's common sense it is not yet common practice
word of operations is important and you know like let's say the system let's say there's a
number of different factors going on maybe there's a couple heavy metals that are elevated maybe there's
a handful of volatile organic compounds and environmental toxins that are elevated maybe
there's a handful of infections there's some deficiencies there's some structural issues
we don't have to treat every single one for the person to get better sometimes you just start to
de-burden the system and as you de-burden the system the regulatory apparatus can handle the
rest of the burden better right and so oftentimes you look at the whole thing and you start to say
what are the things that make most sense to address first and as you address those you start to see
increase the other things start to get better before you even treat them right if if I like I
might be looking at eight of those things that all have to go through the same detox pathways
I start to address some of them and those detox pathways become unburdened they can deal with
other ones better absolutely and this is a great argument for prevention right if we can address
these things earlier then the system has more resilience and we get much more resolution
a lot quicker and so when we stop the focus being so much on the diagnosis and the symptoms and more
on the resilience of the system and that becomes our metric then we get the outcomes are just so
much better and it's hard to prove prevention right because you don't have a disease that you're
reversing um but my my greatest hope is that our contribution to this space is that if we can show
we can reverse Alzheimer's we can convince more people that what they can prevent it I
believe strongly that Alzheimer's is optional and if we can intervene when people are in their 30s
and 40s we can make that a rare disease yeah the thing I was going to say there about sequences
there are general rules of thumb of sequence but they're only general
principles they're never absolute and so one has to be careful to not try to get too
formulaic about it if you're looking at the GI system you can say as a general trend things
that are upstream of the GI system will affect things that are downstream more because there's
kind of a flow to it so if you have an infection in your mouth maybe it's more likely that it'll
create an infection in your stomach if your stomach's not working well you're going to have
undigested stuff going into the small intestine so in general the idea that you treat the front of
the one directional flow channel before treating the end that's a generally good principle but it's
not always true sometimes you have to treat something in the appendix before anything else
because it's really timely sometimes there is something that is acute enough in another part
of the system that de-burdening it de-burdens the whole system and similarly like it generally
makes sense to treat the mucosal immune system before trying to treat the blood because otherwise
you just if the mucosal immune system is in balance you have leaky tight junctions you'll
just keep getting stuff dumping into the blood but sometimes there's something in the blood that is
actually down regulating the immunocytes ability to produce secretory immunoglobulins in the mucosal
system and you actually have to deal with that first so it's valuable to have as practitioners
these general rules of thumb but really you have to take each case uniquely and then you have to
really pay attention to what is working and what's not and you have to not get married to your favorite
hypothesis where then even if the person isn't getting good results you just say it needs patience
or you explain the bad symptoms as a healing crisis maybe it's a healing crisis maybe you're
doing the wrong thing and so there there has to be like very much like Bruce Lee discussed with
Jeet Kune Do there's a formless form where you don't get attached to there's one particular form
it's like what is the right move next and that's what real mastery looks like is I don't know ahead
of time what the right move next is what I'm going to do is look at all the factors I'm
going to have a model that helps inform all the things I can consider but then it's the entirety
of clinical experience and judgment and discernment that is going to inform that and then really paying
attention and the thing that I would say is it's like damn that's kind of like difficult and hard
to automate and expensive right now for people and that's true and there's a lot of things that
we think of as incurable that are really only incurable because they're
hard like it just takes work and it takes a lot of assessment and
but I think the fact that we can see people getting better pretty regularly with a lot of
these things means it's not incurable and the people who are going through that work now are
helping to prove with enough statistic that these things aren't curable that that starts to motivate
economies of scale to catch up right to start to motivate changes in medical model and medical
research at large and better diagnostic methods that can bring the cost of diagnostics down
that can train more doctors up and change the nature of medical school so everybody who is
taking the time to work on it now one should feel really lucky that they're at a time where
there are any doctors that have better solutions because 10 years ago that wouldn't have been the
case or 20 years ago that wouldn't have been the case and should also feel like they are beyond
just helping themselves and their family member helping to contribute to a change of paradigm
that will make this easier and more accessible for a lot of people in the future it is an exciting
time because they I do believe that we are we are changing the paradigm and when you talk about the
cost and expense of this at a societal level we cannot afford for as many people to have Alzheimer's
as are about to and not just it's going to frankly bankrupt Medicare but also we're squandering this
extremely valuable resource by putting our seniors in assisted living facilities where they're parked
in front of TVs and fed cake and cookies and visited by loved ones you know the statistics
the average is once every six months it's not even every Sunday it's every six months
and of course with COVID it's been even worse however you know that is optional again like
this it doesn't we can do better than that society can be better we can bring these people back into
society where they can contribute if they want they can continue to work they can you know add value
to their families they can care for young children they can be engaged and they can pass on the
wisdom and experience that they have accumulated over a lifetime and give that back and the fact
that you know forget the dollars the fact that right now we're squandering that resource I think
that is more expensive than we can afford right and putting investing a little bit you know it ends
up being we're doing this in the clinic so for someone with diagnosed dementia it's about $25,000
to take them through this process we can put a number on it now and that will get you usually
some reversal and if if we can do that for at scale this will save Medicare money this will
save people the money they're going to pay to us you know a subpar memory care facility
it will save the heartbreak of this very long and awful disease called Alzheimer's and so I
am so grateful to you for inspiring me to take on these really challenging problems things like
Alzheimer's and brain degeneration and to find solutions not only for this but but for medicine
in general. Now Alzheimer's is so interesting at a societal level to just to just continue with
where you were going such a high percentage of people that are experiencing some form of cognitive
decline that is significant as a part of their aging right now and increasing to where most
young and middle-aged people can forecast cognitive decline to mention Alzheimer's as
the end of their life
and I think it's hard not to fall into nihilism if you actually think about that when people stop
having something to look forward to they have to go into disconnecting and numbing out and so then
then like the only response to nihilism other than suicide ends up being hedonism
right because there's nothing to look forward to then fucking go for it enjoy what you can
and then that ends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy that drives the addiction cycles and the
whatever that ended up leading to that happening later and I really do think it is not
a necessary outcome and so I think it's important that people can actually look forward to their
older years being good and meaningful and not lonely ones and not useless ones I think when
you look at the evolutionary history of humans the old people and the kids being in connection
was the center of a tribe that was about intergenerational knowledge and wisdom transfer
and the middle-aged people were really just supporting that process and right now our kids
are mostly lonely farmed out to day cares and schools where you have the least number of middle
aged people necessary one to 30 or whatever it is paid the least amount of money to tend to them
without actually really caring in the same way that an invested person would and then as soon
as the person is no longer a money generator again we want the least number of middle aged
people necessary to tend to them in the cheapest way possible and it's just a completely fucking
broken civilization values broken civilization it's so interesting how just reconnecting the
kids and the old people instantly increases the health of both and so much of childhood
psychiatric issues are gone if the kids just actually have someone who cares about them and so
much I mean Alzheimer's is not just a meaning issue there's other things going on but it's
amazing how much of it is affected by meaning and connection that when someone feels that they have
people that need them and something that counts on them how much more motivation to keep the system
capable and upregulated there is um so yeah I mean I just when you told me you wanted to start
focusing on this and prototyping a a type of clinic that could show a model that could start to
get replicated is just such a humongously important thing to do and the fact that the model is
starting to have the success that it is already so early is amazing it's important work and very
meaningful and you know I am looking forward to aging as your friend so that we can continue
to to do this work and I really my biggest goal is that if if I think if we can influence one family
and one family can avoid the catastrophe that is the development of Alzheimer's we've been successful
and if we can do that at scale then we're really making some progress and and I think that the
generations after us can can avoid this and and live more full more meaningful more connected
lives and I'm I'm looking forward to that I'm looking forward to seeing the benefits of this
information getting out and really excited to dive even deeper with our our next summit attendees
and and interviewees over the next few days Daniel thank you so so so much I I'd love to
hear some parting thoughts for our guests and also learn a little bit more about the
Consilience Project and where people can find out about your current work
there's just a psychological thing I'd like to say I'm sure this will be said other places
throughout the course but when we're learning how we might be able to influence things we didn't
think we could influence there's an empowerment that comes with that that's beautiful the unhealthy
psychological way to hold that is some kind of blame like if I have Alzheimer's I did wrong
things or if my family member has Alzheimer's the doctors didn't treat them properly or we
didn't do the right things for them or and but nobody knew these things right so it's important
to say like we're coming to understand stuff we didn't understand as a result new capacities are
starting to come online which is awesome if your family member died of Alzheimer's and you didn't
have access to these capacities and you're like fuck why didn't I know about this earlier why
didn't medicine get there like that's just sad there's no nothing else that really can be said
there's realistic grief to that but this is where like we are actually evolving in our knowledge
as a as a species as a people where certain kinds of suffering don't have to keep happening
and we're nowhere close to being able to say anyone with Alzheimer's at any stage it can be
cured that's not true we don't know it's very very early but it is promising that more can be done
than we thought and for people to have as much commitment and as much of an empowered perspective
as they can to be part of helping to advance to utilize the best of the knowledge that's there
and support the people who are doing the research to advance that knowledge is super important
so tell us more about the conciliants project
ah it's a big jump of topics but um well i know that you've inspired people you've educated
inspired people and a lot of everyone here who's listening i know if you've opened their minds
in a way that probably hasn't happened before or hasn't in a long time you are a thinker like
Leonardo da Vinci and i said you know like so many not not that many actually like a handful of
really big thinkers before you take these complex ideas and really can create change out of them
things that i i i imagine will change the world and i want i'm sure people are inspired to learn
more about your projects and what other places you are applying this idea these ideas to and the
conciliants project is the current one it's funny how if i'm thinking about it in the context of our
current conversation we can see how in Alzheimer's there's a decrease in the coherency of cognition
and that if we look at the collective body of humanity or even just the collective body of
say a nation like the us today there is a similar kind of decrease in the coherency of its collective
understanding of what the nature of reality is and how to move forward like to say that the
us has Alzheimer's is kind of an interesting way of thinking about it because is covid a hoax
is it man-made was it did it have zoonotic origin does hydroxychloroquine help is the
vaccine the right approach like you we can see that there is fervent disagreement on the most
fundamental and consequential base realities climate change systemic racism second amendment
anything right um do guns think people safer or less safe just write down the line fervent
disagreement on everything so how do those people self-organize to be able to make coordinated choices
together the idea of what a democracy is that we can make sense of the world we can identify what we
all value and make the coherent best choices in areas we infect each other well we can see that
we can't right like we're as a society we put all this energy into fighting every four years for
who gets in whoever gets in spends the time undoing whatever was done in the last four years nobody
works on anything that has a longer than four-year timeline because it won't get them reelected so
there's no long-term planning almost all the energy of the system is wasted as heat in just
terms of infighting meanwhile somewhere that doesn't have those coordination challenges that
doesn't have term limits and two parties competing against each other like china can put
together a hundred-year plan and build high-speed rail all around the world in the time that we
haven't built a single high-speed train even in our own country and so we're like oh
at the level of the collective there is a decoherence and a breakdown that is affecting
the environment social well-being everything so how do we create health at the level of the
societal body right how do we reverse the pathologies there and you can see a cancer or an
autoimmune disease autoimmune disease is where some of the cells in the body end up turning
against other ones because they get confused their immune differentiation to be able to recognize
foreign versus not foreign is off right and cancer similarly is where there is a base kind of genetic
change where some of the cells pursuing their own self-interest are doing it in a way that is
no longer aligned with the image of the well-being of a whole and what's so interesting is as the
cancer is proliferating it's also in the process of committing suicide because as soon as it kills
the host it all of it dies so it's pursuing short-term interest which is its own more rapid
proliferation at its own long-term expense those metaphors are actually pretty apt for what's
happening to civilization as coal and so how do we similarly do a multifactorial analysis of what
it is that's causing that how and how we reverse those things to create a healthier society that's
those are the topics where most of my attention is and the consilience project is
an attempt to see can we upgrade public sense making meaning that everybody can make sense of
base reality better on their own rather than just adopt whatever their in-group or the authority
they are used to deferring to says is true and can they come to understand their own values and
understand other people's values better to be able to say what are all the values that matter
can we create a proposition meets all these values as opposed to we'll pursue our values at the expense
of yours and stay stuck in cultural arms races so can we improve our collective individual
and collective sense making and meaning making enough that we can improve our choice making
enough that we can actually coordinate effectively to be able to apply the more powerful technologies
we have to rather than ruin the world actually create a desirable functional world that that's
roughly the topics that we're working on so somebody wants to go check it out it's in the very
very early stages beta stages but that's that's the gist thank you for sharing that you have
inspired me more than anyone else to take on these big hard challenging problems and
somebody needs to so I'm so grateful to you for being here and I am sure you have inspired more
people to do the hard work that it takes to create not only healthier individuals but a
healthier society whether that means contributing a little bit more with raising the young ones
or reading a little bit more about the conciliants project and potentially even donating so Daniel
thank you so so so much for your time you are very busy and I am so grateful to you for your
friendship and for being here today to share your insights thank you for having me here
wow what a truly powerful interview with my good friend Daniel Schmattenberger
we've learned why it's so important to treat the root cause of complex disease whether it's
dementia or something else we've better understood what healthy aging can look like and if there's
a science an art and most importantly there's a framework there's a structured way to go through
discovering and understanding the root cause of dementia in any individual
next up I'm so pleased to have Dr. Dale Bredesen he is a hero of mine he's a medical doctor who
trained at Duke University and the author of best-selling books the end of Alzheimer's and the
end of Alzheimer's the program Dr. Bredesen will share how to protect your brain against memory
loss as well as share the exciting and brand new clinical trial results where 84 percent of
participants reversed their symptoms of cognitive decline before we dive into that who do you know
who needs this information by sharing the summit with others you could change or even save someone's
life please click the share button below this video to help us spread the word now let's begin
with this exciting next interview with Dr. Dale Bredesen so one of the reasons I'm so excited
to be recording this now at this time is because you and your group have just published a trial
taking 25 participants through your basically your whole program so I'm thrilled that we can
finally share with the world what you guys are finding there's a study that we can point to
to not just the one patient here or there that is getting better in someone's clinic but that
there's robust science coming out so would you please just describe the the trial how it was
set up the protocol and then also what you found yeah great point so you know way back in 2011
we proposed the very first trial that would address all the different pieces the things that we have
identified in the laboratory over the years that were critical things like specific pathogens and
things like specific toxins and all the things that you deal with with your patients as well
and we were not allowed to do the trial back in 2011 because it was both multivariable and the IRBs
wanted this to be single variable so you just had you know drug or placebo and so of course we
objected and said hey wait a minute this is not a one variable disease so we wanted then to collect
anecdotes and as you know we published anecdotes 2014 2016 2018 we published 100 with improvement
that was documented so then we went back in 2018 after that publication and said okay can we do the
trial now and they said no and so I know still crazy so finally in 2019 we were allowed to do a
proof of concept trial it's only 25 patients but the idea was it would allow us then if we got good
results with that to go to a randomized controlled trial which is what we're now in the midst of
doing so really very fortunate to link up with Diana Merriam and the Four Winds Foundation that
supported this trial and we're just fantastic and then also three absolutely outstanding functional
medicine physicians Dr. Anne Hathaway, Dr. Cat Tubes and Dr. Deborah Gordon so really honored to
work with them and as you know we basically took this from the test tube straight to the people
and to say okay what are the things for each person instead of all previous trials which as you know
have predetermined what's going to be the treatment which makes no sense so they say ahead of time
everyone who comes in is going to be treated with drug x no matter what's causing the problem
which makes very little sense so the idea for this trial was to flip the script and say okay
for each of these people we're going to look at all the different determinants and there are about
150 different determinants from their various genetic things and we worked with Intelx DNA
and Dr. Sharon Hausman-Cohm whom you know to look at the genetics whether there were issues
with glutathione related with methylation related with thrombosis related on and on
and then also looking at the various biochemical parameters the various microbiological parameters
looking at gut status of course looking at all the different pieces and for those for then for
each person we were able to construct a fairly hopefully a fairly accurate map of what were
the contributors and as you know you virtually never see people with just one contributor
typically there are multiple things starting of course with the genetics with ApoE4 very commonly
and about half the people in the study turned out to be ApoE4 positive but we saw all sorts of
different things as you can imagine across the spectrum and then tried to guide the target
treatment to each of those things and of course it included a core so we had a mildly ketogenic plant
rich diet for people we wanted to look at their sleep we wanted to look at their nocturnal oximetry
we wanted to look at their stress levels we wanted to look at their hormonal levels
so all the things that you know well from functional medicine world that are critical
I think what the science has taught us is what the what the priorities are there are things that
have a fairly small input into cognitive decline and then there are things that have a huge input
into cognitive decline and so then we can look at each of these and target these and as you can
imagine the people who were able to comply and we had people working with health coaches so it was
really fantastic people working with nutritionists and people working with physical trainers
and then working with neurofeedback and things like that did very very well and so we were very
excited to see how much better the outcome was with these people than with a typical drug approach
to Alzheimer's disease so how long did it take how long were people in the trial when were you
getting the metric yeah great point so the each person was on for nine months and so the idea was
we typically see people improving within three to six months so we did there we looked at several
variables so we looked at their mocha scores we looked at their cns vital signs scores so we
could get a more sensitive indicator and also different domains we looked at their aq change
scores so in other words did their partner notice as you know some of the drugs just barely reached
statistical significance but the partners couldn't tell any difference at all so we wanted to know
did the partner also notice that these people were better yes or no and then we also looked at
their MRI volume metrics so we looked at what happened to their gray matter and what happened
to their hippocampal volumes and then we also looked at their brain hq so did they get better
with their brain training or were they failing on their brain training so that way we gave us a lot
of different complementary parameters that we could look at for these people and what do you find
so yeah so we looked it was interesting we looked at three months six months nine months and the
nine months was the end as I mentioned and what was interesting to see was at three months they
had improved somewhat but it was just reaching statistical significance at six months they had
clearly reached statistical significance and at nine months they were still better and at that time
it was less than p p less than 0.001 so really strikingly improved and we had people who went
from mochas of 19 to 30 perfect scores of 30 so we had some dramatic improvements and then we had
some less dramatic improvements and again we had and we had just a few people so 84 percent of the
people improved their scores improved their cns vital signs scores 76 percent of the people improved
their mocha scores and what was interesting is that their MRIs actually improved so you can look at
MRIs and there's a there's a great example of what actually happens with MRIs over time if you have
Alzheimer's or MCI you typically lose a significant amount of gray matter volume and hippocampal
volume each year and you can see that going down if you're aging normally with no no complaints
you actually still lose a little bit on average so these people who actually had MCI or Alzheimer's
and we had some with each actually did better in terms of their MRI volume metrics than normal
people who had no complaints so their gray matter volume actually increased slightly their hippocampal
volume was a slight decrease but as I say less decreased than just normal aging so they so for
all these parameters they did well and by the way their aq change scores their partners noticed that
they did well as well so by all these different criteria and actually a hundred percent of them
improved their brain hq scores so just practicing getting on this they actually they all did better
with that so I think again it really supports the idea that targeting the things that are driving the
decline really is the way to go now of course we didn't include people with mocha scores of zero
or five or ten and that's one of the reasons I'm very excited about your trial where you're looking
at people with mocha scores down to 12 ours was 19 through 30 and with cns vital signs that were
abnormal as well and so I think it's going to be very interesting and very important what you see in
your trial so one of the questions that I get asked most frequently in my office is if we do this if
we put the money and the effort and all of this energy if I you know go to part-time work so I
can help my mom or dad do this how likely is it that we're going to get benefit and that really
was what drove me to ask the question of you know who who's going to get benefit and how often so
that I can have a lot of confidence telling these families I think one of the big things I want to
come back to that you mentioned was the changes that the spouses saw right the Alzheimer's is
so devastating not only to that individual but to the entire family network that's affected and
sometimes it's not even just the family right they're out of the workforce and a caregiver can
come out of the workforce often to take care of that person doesn't just take down the patient
it affects many people around them and you measuring we failed to do that in the next
trials I think everyone should be doing that because how we define success is really important
here and that's what I want to draw attention to for our listeners is that the changes that a
caregiver notices can have that has more you know you start to get exponential impact
and when we compare this to what some of the drug makers are looking for in terms of success
I want to be really clear about the differences there what you're talking about is improvement
what they're talking about is a slowing of decline so I know you have a slide that really
represents this well yeah let me just show this that's a great point let me just show the
difference here so I think you're right the the semantics of success are very important so this
is just to illustrate that on average if you have someone who has Alzheimer's or MCI and this has been
this is in published literature then you lose on average about 3.4 points on a 30 point scale per
year so you lose uh whether you're talking about MMSC or or mocha you're losing a little bit each
year the best and so adecanumab which was just approved in June by the FDA so-called adu helm
this in its best trial and I should say in one trial it failed completely but in another trial
at one dose only the best it did was to slow the decline by 22 percent so it's not making people
have a better cognition it's just slowing the decline and unfortunately you know one of the
years ago one of the husbands to one of the patients said you know I know the drug makers
are trying to make drugs that slow the decline said but speaking as someone who's the spouse of
someone with relatively late stage Alzheimer's this is the last thing that I would want to see
so it's really tough and and you know we all want to get things earlier on get people like
that's one of the big goals to get people to come in earlier and I should say in the adecanumab
trial the range of cognitive scores that they took were very similar to what we did in our trial
so ours were 19 and above for the for the mocha scores and so you can see here in the trial in
in our trial on average there was a 3.89 point improvement so they actually had improved cognition
now as I said we had people going from 19 to 30 but but on average it was 3.9 and a lot of them
there was a bit of a ceiling effect because people would start at 26 well you can't go up too much
from 26 you can only go to 30 but this is what we saw on average so I think you're you're absolutely
right it's important to talk about the semantics of success so many people have asked me well I
should should I put my spouse on this drug because do you think it will help do you think it will
make them better well that's not what the drug is for it's simply to in the best case scenario
slow the decline and of course that's with 17 percent of them developing microbleeds in the
brain about 40 developing some form of edema swelling in the brain headaches you know all
sorts of issues and with the April before positives it was about 50 who had complications
so I think as as many neurologists have said this is not the drug we were looking for you know this
is a drug but it's it's not the goal so that's another point that I really want to drive home
here is the difference in side effect profiles right so this we're talking about a drug that can
cause micro hemorrhage so bleeding in the brain swelling in the brain high cost burden to Medicare
whoever's paying for it to make sure that these side effects are managed on the flip side what are
some of the side effects of your intervention that's a great point so the intervention that we use
the side effects have been better weight control improved lipid profile improved glycemic
profile improved insulin sensitivity improved microbiomes improved depression more joy you
know happiness now to be fair yes it's you know it's a complex approach you're you're hitting
various things and so you do you know it definitely helps to have a health coach but what people
found is that they have more energy they do better they feel better they sleep better they you know
their their whole lives are improved and again I think this comes back to this fundamental schism
in medicine when I was trained in medicine and I'm sure when you were as well there was a lot about
writing a prescription and a lot about kind of non physiologically relevant although I know you
were trained in a more physiologically relevant environment which is fantastic you know human
beings are complex organisms and I think we're now understanding that there is so much more that we
can do to address the physiological parameters that are driving the decline to begin with we are
unfortunately still laboring under this whole the flexner report of over a hundred years ago
that changed American medicine and said medicine should be more scientifically based great the
science has moved on by more than a century and the medicine really hasn't so it's now time to
increase our data set size to have more complex algorithms to have deeper dives into what's
actually causing these problems so I think that you know that is the future and I think that the
part of that future is going to be a future where we really pretty much end these complex
chronic illnesses from Alzheimer's to Parkinson's to Lewy body disease to you know on and on yeah
this is such a really great point is that the the science and the paradigm that we're using
they don't match anymore right and we have the ability we have the the intellect we have you
know we have the people we have the the technology to really start to match the complexity of the
human body with our intervention and there's there's nothing stopping us other than sort of these
social constructs right you know it's interesting to me that you know Google knows where you shop
they know you know how you're living your life they know a lot of things about you and they have
some very some very complex algorithms to use now why are we not using that same sort of technology
to identify people in their earliest changes and there's been discussion about using changes in
keystrokes for example or using changes in pickup when Alexa's listening to you Alexa can tell you
hey you know your voice is beginning to change in a way that suggests that you may be beginning
maybe at the earliest stages of cognitive change so I think for the future having the
earliest ability to get people to make sure that you now are going to reverse your cognitive
decline is absolutely feasible and will be the way of the future if we simply get people to come
in earlier either for prevention or earliest reversal we really can make neurodegenerative
diseases rare beginning with Alzheimer's but then including these others so let me just
make one other quick point here one of the biggest things that has held all of us back and I think
is actually hurt millions of patients is the term mild cognitive impairment so if you look at what
happens to all of us to people who are developing Alzheimer's there are these four stages so you
have you have a pre-symptomatic stage where you can already pick up changes on pet stands and spinal
fluid and things like that and so so you know we call this pre-symptomatic then we have SCI
subjective cognitive impairment which typically lasts about 10 years it's easy during that time
to reverse the decline but very rarely do people do anything about it then the third stage out of four
we call mild cognitive impairment at that point you're relatively late in the path
of physiological process so this is very much like saying oh don't worry you just have mildly
metastatic cancer it's really a late stage and so to me MCI should be called advanced stage
Alzheimer's it's the third of four stages and by the time you're actually told you have Alzheimer's
that is final stage Alzheimer's you're actually now losing activities of daily living typically
you've now had the underlying process for two decades so we're hurting the patients we're hurting
our practices and we hurt we're hurting the global burden of neurodegeneration by saying oh don't
worry it's just MCI we really want to get people in far before that hopefully for prevention or at
the latest for SCI SCI which really should be called early Alzheimer's disease that's when the
changes are actually there and they're already symptomatic the reason this is so important is
because this drives human behavior right there are so many people who are still told the old outdated
factually inaccurate narrative that there is nothing you can do by their neurologist who's
very well meaning but who doesn't realize that there are interventions that can work and so people
are driven to either hide it or go further into denial and they delay getting the care that could
help so changing the storyline so that people hear go soon go immediately when you start to
notice change that's when we can have the biggest impact that's when we can really prevent this
disease from from essentially torturing you and your family exactly right so a number of people
that were in the book that's coming up the first survivors of Alzheimer's they are worried about
their families so now the the idea is you're going to end it with this generation and none of the
future generations should have this problem Alzheimer's is optional there are things that
we can do especially if they're done early on that can prevent the progression of the
neurodegeneration so there's a lot we know a lot more certainly than even a handful of years ago
what are some of the intriguing things to you that we don't know what are some of the important
questions that are left unanswered great point I think there are you know there are a couple of
directions that are that things are happening so we looked initially in the laboratory at
what is the what is the fundamental nature of this problem and what came out of this
was surprising and interesting to me in that it really is if you look at the fundamental
nature of this problem it is a it is a network insufficiency so just as you would have a deficiency
of vitamin c giving you scurvy this simply is a more complex insufficiency it's an insufficiency
of a network so that now the network demand exceeds the network supply for years and then
ultimately you start you know bringing the network down very much by the way what it's very much
analogous to what happened with COVID-19 we had an insult SARS-CoV-2 everyone was told
shelter in place pull back go into a protective mode a downsizing protective mode and of course
we end up with a recession your brain is doing the same thing it's exposed to pathogens things
like P. gingivalis and things like you know various fungi herpes simplex Lyme disease toxins all these
sorts of things and your brain is saying okay I'm going to go into a protective downsizing mode
so we then simply have to address these things so we look at that and then there are kind of two
critical directions one is can we now adapt this and look at the specific neurochemistry
for other diseases so we're now starting what we call the ARC project ARK because the ARC was
two by two by two this is small numbers of patients and we're dealing with the first ones
who have macular degeneration so we're very excited it's a different chemistry
but there are some of the same sorts of things and then the next one is going to be
Parkinson's Lewy body and on and on so we're very interested to go in that direction and see if we
can adapt this approach to all other neurodegenerative diseases at the same time as you kind of applied
we're also looking at how do we now make this better what about people who come in with single
digit mocha scores who truly have very late stage Alzheimer's and so we're I'm very interested in
setting up another trial that we would call the seratrial severe Alzheimer's reversal attempt
so this is an attempt what do we need to add so for example what if you take these people now and
who we there are no question anecdotally there are a few people who will improve their mocha
scores we've seen people go from zero to six seven nine we've never seen anyone go from zero to 30
what are we missing what you know is there do you need a brain transplant do you need stem cells
do you need intranasal trophic factors do you need you know what is it that you need to to make
people do even better of course we hope that ultimately that won't be an issue because nobody
will wait that long but but we so we'd like to understand so all sorts of interesting new areas
as you know plasmalogens all really interesting work by the biochemist Dr. Day and Goodnow on
plasmalogens which are typically low in people how do we you know how do we improve those and is
that going to turn out to be critical I think the jury's still out we don't yet know but they
certainly look very promising what about stem cells and are there specific ones that are going to be
better than others and are you going to have to administer them in a better you know in a different
way do you want to open the blood brain barrier which is a common thing that's done when stem
cells are administered is that going to be more helpful I think there's a lot of promise for some
of the intranasal trophic factors so things like davunatide which failed unfortunately in the past
but of course it was it was used as a monotherapy so all of these things where they try to use it as
a monotherapy I do think the future is going to be to combine targeted drugs along with the the
protocols where we can target the things so that you're now going after what's causing the problem
but you also have very powerful drugs against specific molecular targets I do think it'll be
interesting to see when you take things that are anti-amyloid which I think are not a great
idea at the beginning the amyloid's there for a reason but now after you've addressed those things
is it going to be okay secondarily to begin to remove the amyloid and I think you know that is
going to be an important question the concern is are we going to cause cerebral hemorrhage so
we're still arguing about whether we should be trying to include this as a control in this next
trial my concern is it might be a bit dangerous I mean we don't want to cause cerebral hemorrhage
in people we don't want to cause edema and things like that however maybe very low doses
over time to help slowly remove that amyloid which you now no longer theoretically need
because you don't have the same insults of course there's a lot now on micro dosing of
various things like lsd and various thing the ayahuasca and psilocybin and all these sorts of
things so there's some promise there with with small doses of these as well you have to be a
little bit careful there's some interesting work on cannabinoid receptors and fairly direct roles
in in the process of amyloid and cognitive decline so I think that the what's really interesting to
me is we've been taught that the arsenal is zero there's nothing you can do to prevent or reverse
or delay the decline of Alzheimer's and therefore don't check your APOE status you know don't look
and I think the truth is just the opposite of that the arsenal is huge and the critical piece is
knowing when to use it how to use it what to target and knowing you know what the critical
species are now one thing we are finding and I'm sure you're seeing the same thing people will
improve and then plateau and there's something being missed and sometimes we'll say okay this turns out
and one example for for example is a person who did it very well then started to have a little
problem actually and turned out to have undiagnosed babesia and when that was addressed she then did
very well once again I mean other people it turns out to be things like leaky gut or it turns out to
be things like undiagnosed or unrecognized toxins that were present one recent one turned out to be
just a person who is now under additional stress and just removing that stress and I was you know as
a scientist I used to think that stress wasn't particularly important and I have to say you
know I have to say it's turning out to be very important and of course I can't argue with the
data so things like meditation which we never considered in a laboratory turn out for some
people to be absolutely crucial to getting best outcomes so I think we're all once we kind of have
the background we have the template we're now all seeing how we can make this better better better
better and so I'm really interested to see you know what you see now I should say we just look
at the data so we you know we published the data on the the preprint server med archive
we've now looked at what happens when you just don't do the trial but you just take large sums
of data for many many practitioners so we've had as you know over 2000 practitioners who's now who've
now been trained they're not no one's following them so that therefore it's that you don't have
the same level of compliance with the program and no surprise the data show that on average
people did a little better but it clearly wasn't as good as the trial so getting people to do the
right thing and optimizing things really turns out to be important and this is much more like surgery
than it is like medicine there are doctors who are getting almost everybody to get better and
there are doctors who are getting almost nobody to get better so it really does depend on because
you know you become good at this over time and working with people and getting your best outcomes
so one of the things that people can do right now that they could take away today is a
cognoscopy is what you call it so if someone is listening to this and they're saying this
makes a ton of sense what can I go do tomorrow can you describe what they would ask their doctor to
do essentially yeah that's a good point and so you know the idea was simply that we all know that
when we that when we turn 50 we should we should get a colonoscopy so that we know where we stand
and and you know we can we can make sure that we lower there are risks of dying from colorectal
cancer so our idea was okay don't forget the cognoscopy you want to you know if you're 45 or
older and certainly if there's Alzheimer's in your family you probably want to do this at 40
so at some point you you know you want to find out where do I stand and it's really
the four big groups of things that you want to know you want to know are there ongoing pathogens
are there ongoing toxins are and what's the status on trophic support so hormones and nutrients
and things like that and then what's the status on energetics which means you know it's going to mean
cerebral blood flow oxygenation especially people who have sleep apnea that's a huge issue
mitochondrial function and then your ketones are you getting combustible
substrates there and that's where you can even see on a PET scan that people who have Alzheimer's
and pre Alzheimer's are not doing well at with utilization of glucose in their temporal lobes
and parietal lobes so for a congnoscopy we look at that set of things we're looking at the various
nutrients and the various hormones and the various inflammatory you know metabolic and
inflammatory parameters and looking at that microbiome and that those sorts of things
which are critical to know and again it's so interesting to me that 100 years ago you know
we were all dying of acute illnesses like you know tb and all and pneumococcal pneumonia and dip
theory and things like this and now we're all dying of these complex chronic illnesses and the bad
news is you don't get the symptoms until relatively late in the disease just as we see with Alzheimer's
the good news is if you know what to look for of course you can see them coming 10 20 years ahead
of time so if you simply know what to look for then you can look at these and just as we all know
our cholesterol we all know our blood pressures we should all know these other parameters and what's
what's been really interesting i think the wearables are going to be so helpful as everyone's
now being able to follow themselves so you can see where your glucose stands you can even do a
day-to-day you can even do cgm continuous glucose monitoring which is so surprising to so many people
they find out that they have these huge you know peaks and valleys both of which are bad for your
brain so that they're developing their insulin resistance but then they're also crashing at night
and waking up in the middle of the night not realizing oh my glucose is 45 that's why i'm waking up
your heart rate variability i can i'm following my own and i can see you know when i'm under a
lot of stress it's going to get way low and then when you're just relaxing and you're doing some
deep breathing and things like that boom you know you're so much better um so that's a critical
variable um just simple things following your blood pressure looking at your nocturnal oximetry
making sure that you're you're getting enough oxygen while you're sleeping at night looking at
your sleep stages looking at your ketone levels these things and then looking even at your vascular
elasticity these are all things that we can all do fairly easily and monitor ourselves and at the
same time we can see you know are we are we getting too far um uh you can use things like a breathalyzer
so a couple of weeks ago i decided okay i'm going to try to my wife my daughter and i all said we're
going to try fasting mimicking diet and it was very interesting i mean my ketones went off the charts
high but actually it was too much too soon i actually had to back down a little bit because
i started feeling horrible it was like too much so i had to kind of ease into it a little bit
bit more uh and so for all of us we can now see these things which really gives us a leg up to see
okay i'm in a situation where i am at high risk for Alzheimer's and of course knowing your apoE
for status or apoE status and other uh genetics as well can be very very helpful for this as well
so we really have so much control over our own future as you just said earlier uh Alzheimer's is
now optional so the this can feel i know for a lot of patients or people listening if you're
new to this this can feel a bit overwhelming and if you would like a guide or a coach whether it's a
doctor or a health coach or someone to help you through this the Apollo website is a phenomenal
one so Dr. Bredesen and his team have developed the Apollo website and you can now access
practitioners so you can find practitioners who have been trained by Dr. Bredesen and the team there
to do this work so don't don't let this be discouraging this is a very very hopeful time
where there is a lot of access like you said there's over 2 000 doctors or providers who have been
trained and so the help is out there the work the word is getting out also your books are very very
informative so you can get started on your own i've seen lots of patients who they get better
they they follow the book they get a lot better just by doing the diet and lifestyle things they
can do on their own and then six or eight months later they come to me and say i think we're plateauing
as a husband and wife team i want to get more out of this and then we do all the lab work
so there's a lot of ways to to kind of interface with this and use this information at home
do you have anything else to add to that about how people can get those those really vital
resources uh no i think that you you get on all the critical things so you can go to Dr.
Bredesen.com i mean go on the Apollo health code website and you know this will give you
information we also put it in the second book of the end of Alzheimer's program a lot of specifics
on where to go to get additional information and as you said people will often get improvements
just on their own doing some of the basics and then we'll say okay now how do i have to keep
tweaking to get you know better and better outcomes and that's one thing i think that's
been very interesting to see it's not like classical medicine where you write a prescription and say
come back in two months you're continually improving improving improving because you are
dealing with a very complex system your brain synaptic connections and there are multiple
things that will impact this and so in fact you can continue to get better and the most
important thing of all interestingly something that you don't get just from the trials is the
sustaining so if you look at for example a drug like aerosept you get a little bump but then you
go right back to declining and in fact over the time course over several years what's actually
been published is that people who were on aerosept did slightly worse than people who weren't on
unfortunately because yes they got the initial bump but they went right back to declining
whereas when you do the right things and you're actually addressing the things that are causing
the decline when you get the improvement you sustain the improvement and if you continue to
optimize you can actually even enhance the improvement and we now have people who are on for over nine
years who have continued their improvement for this nine years wow so kind of taking this back
to a bigger more kind of global scale the population is aging right we have more and more of us are
older and we are going to need some solutions otherwise literally in this country Medicare
may go bankrupt and there are many people who you know and not to not to be too negative here
but I see it I have patients who show up in my office and they did they didn't have kids
they don't have close family or they're the youngest of their siblings and they're terrified
of getting older and not having either the financial resources or the network the social
network that's necessary to age gracefully and age in a way that they would look forward to
and so we really need to start reimagining as a society what aging looks like and how we
how we address these neurodegenerative disorders that are so common in in the senior population
so I'm curious you know if we were to take that step back and look at what what are the global
solutions look like what are what's your vision you know this is such a good point and I was just
talking to a professor yesterday who was talking about the the amount of money he was spending
over $200,000 per year for his poor wife who's in late stage also it was just it was so sad to
hear and this has been a burden it's been a burden in so many ways finances are one one way but
there's so many other things that torn families apart it's of course ruined the the finances of
the families the interactions with the with the children and the spouses and of course it's just
just the psychological psychological impacts are huge and so this is a problem as you indicated
and in fact as professor Christine Yaffe published a few years ago this is now the third leading cause
of death in the United States it's actually number two in the United Kingdom so this is a huge and
growing problem and so you're absolutely right we really need now to fashion what would it be
like a global program would be like a global vaccine program but in this case it's a global
program to prevent neurodegenerative disease and in cases where it hasn't been prevented to
make the earliest reversals possible and if you think about this you want to have a way that's
efficient that's the key you want to have a way that where you really get everybody without
you bankrupting Medicare and so the idea would be to have a layered program so it's a little bit
like a pyramid you're starting out with a simple set of things just as you talked about earlier
where people do some basic diet and lifestyle things everyone can can do some simple things
and even get evaluated for a couple of simple points like their genetics and very inexpensive
and do that so the vast majority of these people should never suffer cognitive decline
and then what you can do for essentially free is once a year you simply check to see where
they're where they're going again you can do it by CNS vital signs you can do it even by
the people are now looking at keystrokes and things like this so there are other ways to go
so you look to see where people say now what'll happen is most of these will not go on to starting
to have problems a small subset will those people now you have to take the next step so they'll
have a little more evaluation they'll have a little more it'll be a more extensive program
the majority of those will turn around and do very well a small number of those will go on
so what we have is you now have a graduated hierarchical approach where smaller and smaller
numbers of people so you'll only ultimately have a very few people that will actually break through
these different layers and actually have cognitive decline despite an evaluation and those people
ultimately they will have some time in the hospital you have to look very deeply at all the different
parameters why did they break through these relatively straightforward programs I think
you've done an absolutely fantastic job by setting up Marama where you're taking now that of course
the disadvantage is you're seeing people relatively later in the process ultimately what we like to
see is that the vast majority of people would never get that far along but for those who do
you have a fantastic program in the really the first of its time I think is a real role model
for so many other places around the world that will be looking instead of simply watching people
decline will be actively involved in improving them and sustaining some level of cognition so that
they now aren't lost to the family so I really congratulate you for such an outstanding job
for setting up Marama thank you one of you know one of my big goals is to I would feel
successful if we could shift that entire senior living industry a little bit in our direction
kind of like what you're saying like if we just got the food right what would be the change even
just if we looked at the numbers right the healthcare dollars that are spent in the people
living in kind of a conventional setting where there's you know cake cookies ice cream pasta
cereal versus what we know is a very brain healthy diet so what would what would all of
what would the financial impact just be at the healthcare level right not to mention all of the
other pieces I think I mean I think you and I can predict what that would look like but just
showing people how those relatively simple interventions with using information that we
already have can really shift the trajectory of someone's health and the quality of life
is another thing I'm sure you guys measured that we're measuring quality of life scores and our
study and you know you expect improvement because people feel generally healthier yeah it's such
an exciting time absolutely so as you and yeah absolutely and I would just add you know in addition
to all the things that we've been talking about there was a nice paper recently as you know by
Dr. Kara Fitzgerald who was looking at aging parameters looking at essentially methylated
regions of the DNA that are been assumed to be associated very closely with biological aging
and showing that doing some of these same sorts of things not only is it making your cognition
better but it's actually giving you a reversal of your biological aging so that she saw about 3.26
younger years on people who were on a protocol that again some of the same sorts of things
compared to the ones who weren't on that so as we're so we're going to be doing looking at
biological aging with her on this next study so it'll be very interesting to see can we see
cognitive improvement but can we also see improvement in biological aging so Brian Bradley
I mentioned to you earlier he's my co-PI and he my co-primary investigator on our trial and he
reported her as her co-PI on her trial so I'm very familiar because I know that crowd there
they're my naturopathic colleagues very familiar and I know the the metric they used the
gentleman at UCLA the professor there Dr. Horvath yeah Horvath has created that kind of that way
to test it so for people interested you can actually get a test is it true diagnostics I think is the
name of their their company I think it is yeah yeah and so her papers published so you can take
a look at what they use and they have a lifestyle intervention there's another one I think that
used DHA and something else they didn't get quite as good data as Dr. Fitzgerald did but there's a
few people looking at this and how do we reverse the aging clock so not just neurodegenerative
things but even taking that a step further and say how can everybody get benefit don't you know
we don't just have to focus on the brain but how do we get yeah how can we live better not just
longer lives but better lives one of the fun conversations I had recently was with a another
woman who was imagining and kind of placed a place like Marama on the east coast and we were
talking about how fun it would be if by the time we retire there's sort of this expectation that
maybe you you and your spouse or you and a friend go to sort of a retreat center for six to 12 months
and you basically learn okay it's that it's that shift in your your life right where you kind of
graduate into retirement and how you want to live it maybe you could go somewhere in the mountains
or at the beach whatever sounds nice and learn to live the healthiest lifestyle for aging and then
take those patterns back to you know your home and your family and start to incorporate that so
like a Marama but earlier on so that we can do that prevention and how fun I would sign up for that
yeah no and I think you're right I mean taking this to more like us what would people would
think of as a senior center where you don't wait for it for cognitive changes or other changes and
yeah you know I think we've all been taught that it's it's all about a drug just get a drug for
each problem and instead of the fact that in fact the as we understand more and more getting a
healthy setup and understanding what's driving a lack of health is so much more powerful than we
were taught in medical school and so you're right going to a place where you'd actually
learn essentially learning to live healthily which we kind of take for granted oh yeah I'm
just going to eat you know change this or that no there are a lot of things again there's so much
more biochemical manipulation that can be done in a very healthy way than we were taught so the
fundamental way we think about retirement and we think about medicine really needs to change
amazing Dr. Madison thank you so much for taking the time I know you you and I both are in hotel
rooms at conferences meeting with other people really doing the work of of changing this narrative
and I couldn't be more grateful to you for your support of Marama and of giving me the tools
so that we could have this impact on on the lives of those who are suffering essentially
unnecessarily at this point yeah yeah you're absolutely right and I think many places are
you know ignoring the wonderful data that are coming out from numerous places like yours
and therefore they're they're putting people unfortunately at risk and so I look forward
to a day when we really can make these problems rare and congratulations once again on all the
great work I really look forward to reading about your exciting results in your trial thank you again
wow what an inspirational conversation with Dr.
Bredesen can you believe that today with what we know right now 84 percent of people who
do a protocol like his can reverse their cognitive decline I'm so grateful to Dr.
Depp Bredesen that he took the time to compare Atacanamab to his approach the future of aging
can look so different than it does right now there's a hopeful future ahead
our next speaker is Dr. Patrick Porter he's a renowned expert in meditation and self-help

for years to come now let's begin the interview with my friend Dr. Patrick Porter
Dr. Porter thank you so much for joining us welcome to the show
well it's great to be here thank you for having me so we were chatting a minute ago about neuroplasticity
would you tell us what that means well it used to be 20 years ago they were told you your brain
was fixed something were to happen you damaged your brain nothing could happen but what we now
know is the brain is changing and can grow all the time through something called neurogenesis
but that means is we grow new we can grow a new brain with the if we get the right stimulus
which usually is blood flow circulation back to those areas the brain and the intelligence
to the body can reorganize and the brain they now know is holographic in nature that can read
other parts of the brain can do parts that we didn't think it could but with neuroplasticity
we can take a snapshot now of these neuron connections so think of it like a computer
when we upgrade our computer we want a faster computer the more neuron connections we have
more we can more computing power our brain has as we unfortunately people think we grow our brain
and we connect it as we get older the reality is that we unplug our brain when we're born it's
fully connected that's why we can learn languages we can learn our whole basic our whole universe
and before seven years old you know if you take a little child you go wow and then what happens
is we unplug and because the brain is so much of an energy hog it's going to keep unplugging
just one example for the listeners if you speak more than one language for instance you have a
brain circuit that never shuts down for your whole life as long as you learn that language before
the age of seven so I always encourage people to have their children learn more than one language
because if you don't you'll be like me in college and you have to learn Spanish and the only thing
you take away is banyos and cerveza you know so you know and and kachino so you can go get your
beer you know all these things it's harder to learn you know when we're children we're in a state of
theta brainwave really mostly and we absorb a language and just to give an example just to
put in perspective our science officer he speaks six languages wow he was traveling through India
with me we were doing a university tour speaking to different universities and by the time we left
in three weeks he's speaking Hindi and I said Francisco when did you learn Hindi he goes
why we're here and I said what do you mean he goes if I'm around it he goes I've learned
so many languages that all I have to do is be around him and I'll start doing it because
the way our brain think about it we have a super computer in our head and if we don't use it we lose
it so because it's beginning again because it's an energy hog it's going to keep conserving energy
conserving energy to our detriment so that's why brain fitness is so important in this day
and age and what we do so you have a pilot program a six a six week program that you've been doing
that shows that basically guides people how to get that neuroplastic change at any age right
yes we did the study with women 55 65 they were all diagnosed by their medical doctor to have
dementia we had them take the Cambridge science testing which is a cognitive skills test they
all scored that they had dementia the the unique thing that we found and we find this with ADD
as well is the brain was out of synchronization so it was it was not coherent right the right and
left brain the left hemisphere was actually moving slower than the right and this is just the mechanical
the electrical functions of the brain we can measure and so we put them on a protocol that was
three times a day morning we have a morning session we call digital coffee it's about 10 minutes
and there's a brainwave that most people think but as we get older that we lose our balance
but really what we lose is a brainwave called smr it's it's between alpha and beta it's a very
small brainwave feature but it has to do with cognitive thinking and balance so we actually
did a balance score test with them too without doing any exercises just the brain tap and when
we when we ended the study after they did that three times a day the afternoon we did a reboot
because they we lose energy all we all do anyway but if we haven't trained our brain it's even more
every day at two o'clock our brain drops i mean our body drops in temperature two degrees so
are these bodies are designed for the serengeti so we're supposed to be taking a nap like the
lions and the zebras but we what do we do we we drink coffee tea eat chocolate whatever it is to
stimulate ourselves and we have this great electrical system so we wanted to train them
we told them if you really need coffee do it after your brain tap session but try to do it
without it uh just to to regulate within our own innate system and then we have a program
that we had them do to put them to sleep what we find unfortunately is most people are running
around with their brain trying to go to sleep when they're awake and that means they have high
degree of delta activity which is deep sleep but at the end of that six week study to shorten the
conversation here they went back to their doctor before we tested them we had them go back to their
doctor their doctor said wow if you came here like this six weeks ago we would not have diagnosed
you with dementia wow we had them sit down and do the cognitive skills test they scored that they
were inside the normal range for their age group this is 55 65 females and then we had the we measured
their brain with a product called the wavi which measures brain synchronization and things of that
nature we found out that their brain was now synchronized because it was it was coherent in
other words and so their their doctors you know of course they're not going to take away the
diagnosis but they had no symptoms so that gave us we took that to duke duke university is one of
our research partners and we said what do you think of this research they said i don't believe it
and i and i said well here's the research they said let's do a bigger study so we're in the middle
right now we have seminal college and valencia college in florida that have partnered with us
to get a hundred people in florida women and men we're going to do both we're going to try to get
50 of each to do the study down there and see what we can do and i think i mean we see this in
our clinics we're lucky that we have 2300 clinics across the country and they give us feedback all
the time and wavi had already told us this because they put all their information up into a cloud
and the people at wavi contacted us and said what are you doing over their brain tap these people
are getting so much better faster and and i had to explain you know everyone knows how lasers work
at least in the field of medicine right and but through vasodilation blood flow and circulation
the innate intelligence of the body can take over and i think uh any brain at any age can heal we
we actually showed significant change she wasn't part of the study but she was 102 years old
and we have the documents that show what happened after six months of using brain tap
she improved her brain function by 30 percent that is incredible this is so exciting oh so
we're doing a clinical trial in my office and we're using both Cambridge brain sciences to
track the data and then also wavi so it sounds like there's a there's a lot of synergy and and
overlap in what we're doing now we're using kind of a reticent style approach but i can't believe
we haven't been also using brain tap because i can only imagine when we start to marry those
and we start to combine things that we get even more potential benefit for our patients right
but we tell people especially in the because a lot of our doctors are neurological doctors and
chiropractors is we say after you're done with all of that work most people don't know that even
when you're meditating or sleeping you're still your brain is still using 20 to 25 of the energy
of the body so it's a workout you know when you're getting that therapy whatever that therapy is
your brain is getting a workout so we want them to restore that restore the brain function before
they leave the office we we do this also with chemotherapy centers and things like that because
people get radiation or chemotherapy they need to rebuild that really for those familiar with
the term ATP production we need to get the brain producing more energy for rejuvenation
more fuel so just to go back to the the six week pilot program you had how many women
in the trial and then how many days or how many times per day were they doing a session
and how long were those sessions this pilot was only six people and that's why we have to do more
you know yeah it was significantly when we did this numbers it was significant but we couldn't
publish you know it's right you need more so we figured actually we need 35 people to get
the significant number that we need so we figure we'll get a hundred you know and then we'll get
that number because you know just the more the more you have the better we've done some just
case studies before that but because we didn't do the exact same thing we couldn't put them into
the study and we we actually designed a program for brain tap that's only available to our professionals
because it actually speeds up the left hemisphere and slows down the right so we designed that just
for the study and once we once we prove it out we'll make it available to everybody not not the
general populace because you need to measure the brain before you do that we don't want to
speed somebody's left hemisphere up when they don't need it yeah don't want to have new problems
most of our most of the problems people have is the hemispheres are out of sync so the first
four minutes of every brain tap session is a synchronizing session and that has to do with
just right down to even heart rate coherency I mean we're trying to get every the whole body
just coherence so the communication between the systems is happening the way it was designed
that's incredible so but those women that did that they were doing three sessions a day yes
they were doing a morning afternoon and evening session and they're about how long each well the
morning session is 10 minutes the afternoon session is 20 and the evening session can be between 25
and 30 but you we had them do it with just the earbuds in so they could just fall asleep because
the evening sessions although 90 percent of our users use it at night we didn't want to have the
interference of the light sometimes the light at night for especially blue-eyed people and
they are more sensitive to light so we don't recommend they use it at night after six o'clock
because it can over psych the nervous system interesting but there's a potential that for
under an hour a day doing something that probably feels good and helps you sleep better and helps
you feel better day to day anyways can improve your memory can improve your cognitive function
yeah that is amazing yeah we see because we do a lot with a concussion care and with the sports
teams and we have a lot of different sports teams that put in 10 20 chair stations where after
their training ritual though they'll go in with compression pants you know to get the bad blood
out especially soccer teams and hockey teams they seem to be the biggest users and they'll
they'll do this afterwards because they don't realize the fatigue a lot of that is mental
these are people that are running the whole time running in balance takes a lot of energy
you know even if you're just standing you know you're using a lot of energy to keep that keep
your position in space and you know especially if you're out of balance you know it's going to be
hard well then i'm sure at the professional level or even collegiate level they there's a lot of
mental energy that goes into the strategy into executing into thinking ahead into into playing
the game yeah yeah the biggest thing we find for professional athletes in their brain is
how to disengage you know and then that's when they get in trouble they start looking at substances
that are not really healthy for your body like alcohol or drugs to because they're so high you
know they're they're they're buzzing up here and then they have to go back to regular life you know
they're not in front of 100,000 people or 30,000 people and now they've got to go home and you
know make their own popcorn or whatever you can balance so tell us about the role and you mentioned
it a little bit but i want to go more into depth about the role in brain waves in reversing Alzheimer's
so like we think when we think about Alzheimer's i think a lot of people go to beta amyloid plaques
and tal proteins and you know maybe the neurons and the synapses but what you're talking about
are brain waves so tell me how those how how those create memory how they keep us from making memories
how they contribute to this this world of dementia yeah well if you get stuck into
chronic low-level stress if you just under stress all the time that means let's say you have a
traumatic event in the morning maybe you get a text or a phone call and in the evening you're still
ruminating about it you probably have a nervous system that isn't able to disengage
that chronic low-level stress is going to influence your gut which we all know
in the field that that's really important too because your gut makes all the neural
transmissions so if your gut's out of balance and there's a lot more to it i'm sure you have some
experts that are going to be talking about that the gut brain connection but if we don't
organize so that we can digest so i tell people that we've got to calm down that beta brain
and you can do that a few ways of course brain tap is one way but you can do it through breathing
through you know just body scans prayer is a way when somebody says why would we pray before we
eat well obviously it's a religious ritual but really it's so we digest our food and we've had
a study done in provo utah where we showed that when we put people on a session to got them into
alpha and theta they actually digest and metabolized more than 30 percent of the nutrients through an
IV than they did when they were just doing it on their own texting and looking at their phone
so when you're that's when we did that to prove out when you're doing other therapies at your
clinic you should be using you know the technology but the the reality is that alpha and theta alpha
has to do with creative thinking and that creative thinking the reason you have to close your eyes
usually to get into visualizing and meditating and doing those things is it takes a lot of power
to do that but what happens is in that state of alpha most people shut down their frontal
the frontal cortex right the the frontal lobe so basically all reasoning goes out the window
and they fall asleep they go i i've tried to meditate all i do is fall asleep but when you
introduce light into the equation and that light frequency is at whatever hurts frequency you
want the brain to be because they through entrainment the the like a tuning fork in other words
the brain is going to follow that frequency you know and so we're imitating nature so for
instance alpha is like going to the ocean when you're sitting by the ocean you're relaxing
even if you didn't want to be there you might have been irritable but by the time you get there
you look out at the ocean you're there for a little bit you start feeling good because your
your body will actually entrain to its environment so in the ocean you're going to get alpha alpha
produces acetylcholine or instructs the gut to produce acetylcholine you can't do you can't be
stressed and produce that amount of acetylcholine you know your body will try to do it but what it
will do is it'll rob peter to pay paul so something's got to give so when you get if you get time in
that brainwave now we're designed to take naps in the middle of the day our bodies are and to
sleep you know longer than we are you know a hundred years ago we used to sleep 12 hours a day
you know i haven't seen that since i was a kid you know so but the in the process of doing that
at night we're going through these cycles and the cycles all represent different brainwaves
so when we get into alpha we're creating that acetylcholine when we get into theta we're producing
GABA GABA is the most researched drug on the market before COVID COVID kind of pushed it out
but the reality is that most people are missing theta it's a very small brainwave right before
sleep everyone out there has been in that state before consciously because it's it's when you
wake up in the morning at some point you hear a song maybe you don't really like it but that
stonk sticks in your head all day theta is known for it's it's called hypernesia super memory state
so like the great inventors when you read about them they take these cat naps in their labs and
these solutions would come flying into their subconscious out of their subconscious to their
conscious mind that was the theta state and so that's really important to be basically to make
the jump from being in the waking state to the sleeping state then there's delta delta is really
important now we should have very little delta while we're awake it should be less than 10 percent
of our overall brain when you look at we call it a full spectrum brainwave because all these
brainwaves are going at one time it's just where is the prevailing awareness is a proper brainwave
when we're awake is 45 percent of your brain should be operating in beta 30 percent should
be operating in alpha if we have too much alpha for instance and not enough beta we become attention
deficit because we have too much energy and activity if we have too much beta and too much
alpha i mean too little of both we become just attention deficit we're just not there because
theta arises now to put it in perspective too for people wondering about autism we have a lot of
luck really good results with autism because we can encourage alpha activity alpha i always tell
people think of brainwaves like wi-fi networks but are healthy you know so they're they're basically
through electrical signals and also through light signals in the body through something called
bio-photetic exchange we're actually light beings so our body at the cellular level emits light
pulses every 40 seconds and that that's part of it so there we have redundant systems we're not just
electrical we're we're light sounding vibration we're we're information packets running around
you know living our life and what happens to an autistic child that we found now we don't work
we work with doctors that have a lot more it's not just brain tap so i don't want anybody to think
hey just get the brain tap and all this happens we have clinicians like yourself that are doing
other things but what we found was when we can encourage when we can after six weeks most of
our studies are about six weeks so we did a study with 34 autistic children in orange county california
with joquita handy dr handy and what we showed is we could improve their alpha by 23 percent
as soon as they went over the 23 mark from where they were which was almost zero they were speaking
we had about a 90 speaking rate and she's a speech pathologist so it worked for her so
she was doing all of her work and she asked me why did i think that was i said well you're doing the
exercises and then we're relaxing the brain so it can accept them you know if the brain is
stressed out too because i believe all stress is brain stress so if we can relax the brain you've
just taught them some maybe they're doing the metronome or they're doing other exercises
and they're all stressed out and then the next day that all gets washed out but we want to take
short-term memories and make them long-term memories as fast as possible so the brain can
recall and actually feed it back into the system and so what we found too in that study where people
are wondering six months later we checked it they still had 23 percent alpha activity so once the
brain learns it and it's normal that's a normal in uh you had mentioned the amyloid plaque studies
we went and saw lutei because our ceo was friends with the guy who runs the brain lab at mit so we
got to meet with her and she's they had that they had to all the press about blue light and
gamma and all of that so we we went there and we showed her our she has a brain tap now by the way
and she's using it in the uh but we showed her that with our device we can encourage 23 percent
or more gamma activity now we can only we up we found that it doesn't matter how many times you
do it you can only get so much advance it's kind of like weightlifting it doesn't matter how many
times you go to the gym you can only get so much muscle growth you can only get so much brainwave
change so what we find is that gamma on the other side gamma is kind of like a high frequency theta
and people have really like when I've interviewed our scanned doctors like I have a brother-in-law
that's a pretty famous maxillofacial surgeon and he does just this intricate work and and I said
Carl I want to measure your brain while you're doing that and what we found is when he's in his
zone he's in he's actually in gamma would this be like a flow state yes yes and we're we're finding
that true with athletes too they they and creative artists healers like when we when we meet healers
people that they don't even think they're healers just people come to them and they heal people
they they resonate this and now their studies that actually show our gut biome actually attracts
people to us or repels them because it's a field we're creating this field of energy through the
electromagnetic field even though the brain is very low the heart is like six times more and the
gut is actually 12 times more than that so you're actually projecting this information out when
people say I got a gut feeling about that person or they're really it's a gut brain so all of this
is kind of interconnected but the the real thing for what we found is the the biggest secret weapon
to helping with Alzheimer's to kind of bring it back to the summit is that we need to get people
sleeping and we need to get them to have more level four or paralytic sleep they call it
because that's the only time the leog lymphoma system which is a new thing that the medical
community found in 2016 which always been there but we didn't they didn't know it because they
never looked at it while people were sleeping but that's when it engages and that's when you
detox the brain so just everyday use we have it's like driving your car you're going to have exhaust
you know our every cell has exhaust system right and it's all trapped in the brain all day long
until you go to sleep so if you're not sleeping because your brain is dysregulated
then you're not detoxing so once we once we can now they're coming up with a lot of different
medicines if you will or vitamins and nutrients that actually can they do the pairing or they
they bind the toxins and get them out of the system they didn't have those before so now
now now we can measure it and we can actually see the results so there's always a combination with
what we do with some kind of nutrition or therapy and brain to have to get the best results but the
study I was talking about we we wanted to just do the brain tap just to see so I think if somebody
were to put other modalities in with it we just get even better results I would imagine yeah
so what is photobiomodulation can you explain that mouthful of a word well what they found out was
in our you know they mapped the genome right in in 2002 they made this big fuss hey we mapped the
genome but they didn't they mapped one percent of it you know could you imagine passing your
boards and you go I answered one percent of the questions give me my certificate but what
they found out was that other 99 percent is always in a state of flux and it emits a light pulse
every cell of your body including the mitochondria emits light pulses that's why I can see you and
you can see me we're sharing our light in other words and so what happens at the DNA level they
now know the name that pulse happens it happens across the whole system of your body and actually
rebraid your DNA and that that changes based on the words you use the people you're with the food
you consume for instance if they're running they now know they they've tracked 2,300 different
gene expressions that change by the words we use foods can do it environment emf you know that's why
some people who are sensitive now they also know the more fear you have the more you shut
those down so people who are optimistic and more open-minded they seem to tolerate things better
because the body adapts we are very adapted in nature so this and then the dura in the fascia
in the body now science is showing that that's like fiber optic cabling that's what carries
these bio-photonic information in each now they they also know just as a side note that
they can only store so much information in silicon right so we've kind of run to the end of our
silicon how fast can we make a computer they're now storing it in two things water they can now
structure water and they can hold all the information we in the history of time and one and they have
a lot of room left over in one drop of water that structure now they're also storing data in light
so guess what we are we're light and water you know so all that information is there and it's
redundant but if in part of that i used to uh when dr emoto was still alive he wrote a book
called the secret life of water and he would come out to quantum university and speak and it just
was amazing what the what you can do they actually know that when how you communicate it shows up in
the cellular memory of the water that you will carry in your body so if you're loving to yourself
if you're caring about yourself now some people as they get Alzheimer's what happens when the brain
gets dysregulated let's imagine you're trying to remember your son's name they just walked in the room
well eat that simple for us if our brain's working right boom it happens but if not there's eight
places or more in the brain where you have to go collect all that data the brain like it stores it
all over the place and then it represents at one time but it happens at the speed of light
not at the speed of thought thought is even slower than light i mean it happens but let's
say that one side of the brain is just even a millisecond off the brain will stop the program
because it says that's too much work so it says let's that data is not there let's write it off
because we're used to uh we only truly remember the very good times like our first kiss our wedding
maybe you know different things like that the first time we rode a bike you know our awards
whatever those are and then we remember the very bad times right in depending upon which one we
focus on that's how we feel today so we want to focus on those positives but the brain is writing
off most things and kind of put in perspective for the listeners our brain just as we're talking here
our ears are processing 25 000 pieces of information while we're talking now that 25
000 pieces of information we only act on 40 of them so our brain has a really good way of sorting
out information and if you you and I were at a restaurant it was your favorite restaurant we're
sitting there eating you told me about this meal it's perfect revenue it's great conversation
then somebody two tables over says Alzheimer's we're going to hear it even though we didn't
hear anything else they said because this reticular activating system or our default
mode network is always looking around is this safe for me what's going on and so when when people
wonder what's going on when they get older that sorting system has been compromised and so it says
that's not that those aren't the 40 pieces I want to deal with I want to know the name the person
you know but it's not keeping that that information it's lost its hierarchy of needs
as far as information goes that's why when you start doing the practice like what we're talking
about and keeping the frontal lobe engaged I should finish that thought I guess the reason we have
light in the eyes when people are their eyes are closed but the light pulses are actually triggering
cranial nerve too so it doesn't matter if you can even see as long as you have that nerve your brain
is going to synchronize but when we introduce light into the brain we actually keep the brain awake
when you when you close your eyes the first thing's going to happen is your frontal lobe's
going to start shutting down this is evident when we watch a movie right we're watching a
scary movie and we go oh it's just a movie right we close our eyes and we remind ourselves we're
not really there because our mirror neurons are going crazy we're either freddy krueger or we're
being chased by him you know so we have to decide and then we have to say wow that's just a movie
that's not really happening and but in our when we do when people go to meditate or relax they think
that when they close their eyes the brain goes oh it's time for sleep we want to keep them in that
if you can keep them in that alpha theta brain wave now they can really produce those neurotransmitters
that our brain needs we produce I like to tell people the world's greatest pharmacy is not on the
corner it's not in Walgreens or Walmart it's in your brain it's between your ears it can create
30 000 different neurochemicals with the right thoughts some of those are good and some bad so
if we can keep it going then you know the brain will do its work for us and it can
reregulate it regulates because of uh like like a tuning fork like I used earlier the
the body just knows how to do that it's not something you can't really train the brain to
come together it's got to have the right stimulus that's why like people do neurofeedback different
things like that to get the brain engaged you know I want to share with our listeners some of my
clinical experience with brain tap as I was telling you Dr Neil Nathan also a guest on the summit
is a big fan of yours and he's a formal mentor of mine so I have recommended brain tap to a
number of my patients and clinically I haven't used it yet to its potential with Alzheimer's
and dementia but I have been using it with the patients you were describing who are highly
sensitive they don't they don't tolerate a lot and many of them have mole toxicity they find me you
know uh because we focus on that at my clinic as well and what I have noticed is that many of them
have experienced early childhood trauma and so what you're describing makes so much sense for
why it really really helps them this regulation of the nervous system maybe because it's been
maladapted early on when we can regulate that they become more tolerant to whatever the stressor
is whether it is a mole toxic environment or a relationship or you know even like non-organic
foods or flying you know travel is a little stressful all of these things that we should
be able to tolerate a little bit of um some of us some some people many of my patients
are unable to and then brain tap helps so I want you to like tell I'm so excited to have you here
like tell me exactly what's going on and why well what happens is when if you think about in the
hopefully you remember these days but in you might be before you but in in houses when I was
growing up we had fuses so if we were running the dryer and the toaster was going then my sister
would turn on the hairdryer we'd blow a fuse right so but nowadays we have a we just have a flip we
just go flip the switch well our body doesn't have a fuse or a flip switch it basically just
resets keeps resetting so the nerve that's what they call stimming like when you when you have a
child with on the severe is the autistic child that has stimming you know they're trying to
they're really trying to get rid of the energy that's built up in the system they don't know
how to regulate the energy if we have all those brain waves going in the right order then we
regulate energy that's what really what we're about we're our body takes in energy even music
energy like if you're at a if you're at a party you don't really want to be there but they start
playing your favorite songs from your high school days pretty soon you're tapping your toes you're
smiling you're having a good time because our body converts that to energy and we've got to use
that energy so what's happening is if their brain is dysregulated all the information comes into
the central cortex at the same time there's no space this is a this is a phobic reaction
so what we have to do they call it a synesthesia actually in psychology which means overlapping
sensory systems so what we what we do is we're going to slow that down time in the brain or in
the mind however you want to think about that at the states of alpha and theta is not relevant
you know everybody's had a dream where it felt like it lasted forever then you finally wake up
and go do you know how long the average dream lasts no seven seconds you know so but there's no time
there so it's kind of like those star trek movies where somebody goes into a dream and has a whole
lifetime while they get an hour long massage and it feels like it's been 10 minutes yeah exactly
so there's no time when you get into those that place but what we can do is we can teach the
brain to reorganize as an example professional athletes like baseball players when we when we
interviewed them and they do something called modeling we want to find out how does these
the best hitters in the world in baseball how do they do it well when they're in the batter's box
they're not thinking oh no that guy's going to throw the ball at 90 miles an hour across the plate
what they're thinking is i'm going to slow down that ball so i can see how it's spinning now if you
don't have the experience or the brain capacity you get freaked out but they stand in the box they
literally see it leave the fingers of the pitcher in slow motion they see the rotation of the ball
they know if it's a curve a screwball or a fastball and they make the adjustment now those are experts
right those are the now we all do that to some degree you know like we call it anticipatory
stress you know we some people actually don't get out of bed till they have enough stress you know
they thought of enough catastrophes that it's time to get up right so we want to change that
in what happens as you're sharing this about the baseball players like i've watched my daughter fall
and i see her falling in slow motion right is that the same kind of yes going on in my brain
right it happens when people get in car accidents too they'll say everything just slowed down
because you went into a hyper state it wasn't the everyday normal conscious state of reality
because you're thinking what am i going to do and i i tell me the worst thing that happened
like i have two grandchildren and now they're a little older they're eight and eleven but when
they were little i didn't care if my kids hit their heads everywhere but every time they hit
their head now that i know about brain health i'm going oh my god what am i going to do i got to
get them on the brain helmet you know do something to fix their brain but i mean everybody has fallen
down anywhere between 3000 to 5000 times growing up so we all have some traumatic traumatic injuries
it's just how did our brain remodel around it some people tried to do a shortcut and then
they start getting anxiety and what happens is they then start to use affirmations like anxiety
runs in the family anxiety doesn't run in the family the propensity does but the reality doesn't
you know you that's why there's always that person in the family that doesn't have it because they
don't buy into the family belief you know so but the the now what we know about epigenetics
only 20 percent of who you are is your parents responsibility 80 percent is your environment
in your everything that you've done since that time so what happens with these with this fear
factor that's happening in the brain is under stress the brain dysregulates that's why we're
told never like if we get a divorce we lose a job we have to move across country you know
we don't they tell you don't make any real life changing decisions don't don't do that you know
take some time because we don't make good decisions when we're stressed out right so we have to go to
we have to go to an altered state to relax and do that and most of it is that we are not trained to
process our day and if you remember back to some of my brain tap sessions I always have people do
a review of their day and when you train your brain to review your day you're not leaving
anything on the table you're sorting it out so that basically it's like if you worked at IBM
during the 70s you couldn't leave your office until there was no papers on your desk it actually
looked like nobody worked there because that's the way they knew that you had finished up the
task for the day well we should consider that for our own brain every night now what happens is if we
don't or a better way to say that would be let's imagine watching your favorite tv show or movie
and the actors and actresses never rehearsed that would be ridiculous right we would never see that
but people get up every morning and do that in their own life they never rehearse how to talk to
their children they never rehearse how to talk to their spouse they never rehearse how to drive
across town they never rehearse how to do anything different and then when while they're doing it
they get all upset about they're not doing it right well you your time to practice is before
you do it that's where the visualization comes in and the mental practice so part of the process is
just teaching them how to prepare because life happens quickly I love what Deepak Chopra said
years ago I was at a training of his and he said 90 percent of what's going to happen to you tomorrow
you know about today so what are you pretending not to know there's a lot of people running around
pretending now if that happens long enough let's say that they do it over seven years 10 years 20
years that damage is being it's accumulative damage like the amnesia the amnesia like people
pretend that that's not happening they pretend that that's not going on well the brain starts
thinking that's a pretty good program that amnesia program you're running why don't we start forgetting
names and addresses and phone numbers and it's it doesn't you know so that's why you have to
rehearse you have to play with my grandmother who lived to be 93 and had a great memory up to the
day she died I was for lack of a better word babysitting for her so my aunt could go on a
cruise and I could go golfing during the day in in in albuquerque new mexico and I came back from
golf and I hear her talking out loud I thought she was on the telephone she was in there for
almost an hour and when she came out she says why didn't you tell me you were here and I said well
you were on the telephone she goes I wasn't on the telephone I said well what were you doing
she says I was reviewing all of my favorite vacations oh that's great I bet she was a happy
woman too because yeah she spent her time thinking about her wonderful vacations your family history
is really fascinating this is how you got into the brain space and the relaxation space and
mindfulness and meditation was you have eight brothers and sisters is that right yes and then
your dad was the one who introduced you and I mean this would be before meditation was cool
before it was something that people knew about in most families that would be talked about so
can you just describe what that was like yeah well part of what I tell people is you have to
reframe your past so I always tell people I was blessed to be the son of an alcoholic you know
at the time when I was 12 years old I didn't think that but looking back because the the the sister
and the priest we were Catholic they came over sister Mary and father Fitzpatrick said Michael
we're going to teach you to do technology during meditation it was something called the silver
method and it's still in practice right now people do it he he he went there and he couldn't
relax so he was using alcohol as his prescribed his own personal prescription to de-stress and he
didn't work very well I mean he drank to the point of yeah we see this a lot in families right when
people are are addicted to any sort of substance whether it's pills or alcohol or heroin they're
really looking for an out they're looking to be more comfortable and that helps us create some more
compassion around substance abuse exactly there's a really good book called Finding Your Perfect High
by John Marshall and he talked about brain balance this was back in the 80s you know so and I and we
all had to read that book my dad was really big on everybody reading which was really good you know
I read books that you know people going through midlife crisis were reading but I read them in
high school because we would have family discussions around them you know we would have we had reading
assignments and because he thought the reason that in in his mother was a nurse but she was
addicted to prescription drugs because at that time the nurses could prescribe for themselves
she was actually at the around the same time she was sent home from the hospital to die
and she lived to be 90 like I said but and they took her off all her medicine and she lived they
told her she was too toxic she was going to die just in her home and and then she began to live so
we got we went from being really pharmaceutical driven family to a health because my dad when my
dad got the help my mother got into nutrition so we we had kind of the double whammy you know we
we got all the sugar out of our house all the dyes everything I mean I don't know if you remember
Yule Gibbons but I was voted to be the next Yule Gibbons by my high school class you know so you
know they're because I ate weird you know I didn't eat what they served I brought my own food ate
healthy not as healthy as I can eat now because we didn't know that much back then but it was
healthier than most and my dad my dad had made a really big effort to say you know the reason
he got in trouble was he didn't know and he want to make sure all of his kids knew and out of all
of our kid all of my brothers and sisters we only have one brother that for about 20 years
decided to go against the grain you know and not follow the meditation not not eat healthy
and he paid for it with gout and he's he's still alive but he's not in really good health
now he's trying to get healthy you know it's it's a lot easier to keep your body healthy than
try to repair it once it's broken down but I think that that really changed and my dad
it helped him so much he decided to go back to school got his degree in psychology and
started working with people and then that's how we began I really wasn't going to do what he did
I didn't really think that way but I went to school for electronics first that's why we have
electronics so my undergraduates in electronics then I went to school to get my degree in psychology
oh that's great and this is a brain tap is really this like magical combination of the two
this very creative combination I want to go back to sleep you know I've you talked a bit about how
important that is for detoxing the brain but there's a lot of people who struggle with getting
good sleep so what are the brain waves and what would be kind of what's going on with the use of
brain tap when you are trying to get sleep and hoping to improve it well one thing is they need
to have a sleep hygiene program if they're having trouble that means about two hours before sleep
they need to start preparing turn off any broadcast news anything that's going to be over exciting
maybe watch some comedies or something like that if you're going to watch tv there's a lot of
different ways start turning off lights in your home because what what happens if they're having
trouble sleeping is the body doesn't know it's sleep time you know what used to happen and this
is how we I've always thought about what is an ancient technology or an ancient tradition and
how can we make it modern technology if you and I were in the Serengeti again and it was nighttime
and we were out hunting and gathering or whatever we were doing we come back to the tribal village
we're going to have a fire and that fire is going to be crackling at a certain rhythm and cadence
that fire is actually a 10 hertz frequency when we when we built our first light and
sound machine we've measured the frequency of a candle because there's a meditation called the
jayote meditation and you look at it and what you do is you'd breathe and try to move the candle
and the flickering of the candle would put you into a deeper state of relaxation and meditation
then when they got leds we could imitate that so we could take people from a beta state
and disengage what's happening when they're laying in bed and they do it most people too
that are having trouble sleeping think you're supposed to go to sleep close your eyes and
you're dead to the world that's not really good the best way to go to sleep is to go to sleep
lay there process your day do some breathing exercises I usually teach them two different
breathing exercises now of course they're going to do breathing exercise when they do the brain
tap but let's say they don't have it because some of the listeners here might not have it
you lay in bed and there's something called box breathing which is pretty simple breathe into the
counter four hold to the counter four breathe out to the counter four then hold it to the counter
four and you just keep doing that box breathing while you're doing that you you scan your body
and you don't you basically focus when you focus on a part of the body energy follows
thoughts so as you think of that part of the body blood flows to that area circulation increases
and with basal dilation and blood flow relaxation follows so you're going to move up through the
body doing that the other one that a lot of more more people like this one than the other
it's the same process with the body but you breathe into the kind of four you're when you breathe in
you engage the sympathetic system so that's your survivor brain and that's that's probably already
activated but you want to activate it just to make sure that your brain knows and then when
you breathe out you breathe out to the kind of eight this engages the parasympathetic so that's
your thriving brain so we and as you do it what I tell people at the end of it just really try to
get it all out what happens then is we've all been in an experience where we're over frustrated and
we finally went I'm just tired of it well that's your body shaking it off and if you notice pets
your pets like especially dogs when they get nervous they'll shake they're doing the same thing
they're trying to shake off that energy and so with our bodies if we do that at night what'll
happen is eventually you won't make it up to your hips relax and you'll be out but you've trained
your body to unwind our body for those that know what a capacitor is uh like Elon Musk batteries
are capacitors they hold a charge and they discharge slowly our bodies are like a capacitor
they hold a charge and then we have to discharge them now hopefully we discharge them by walking
10 000 steps a day drinking half our bodies waiting water eating healthy foods all the thing you know
if we lived on the island with Gilligan and Mary Ann you know it would all be great but because we
don't our body keeps getting interrupted these natural patterns keep getting interrupted interrupted
so at night we can at least bring balance back to our bodies and what will happen is even though
we're asleep your body will continue the process of relaxing so when you wake up the morning you
don't have clenched teeth you don't have a we work with people that they wake up in a ball like a
fetal position they don't understand it and they're telling me they've been doing it for years and
that's because they're going through trauma while they're sleeping because the kinetic energy that
is built up throughout their life has never been discharged so you that's why exercise we all know
people that were really negative or having a bad time in their life they started an exercise protocol
and pretty soon they're all smiles and happy because your your physiology does affect your
psychology and vice versa so it's best to do both that's great yes a couple other people on the
summit here have been talking about sleep apnea and oxygen at night and i think the combination of
both of these things cleanups are really relaxed get into the right state at night and then keep
your airway open you're going to get you know we don't think of sleep as a very productive time
but if you can really harness the potential of the detox and of the that resetting for the next day
your brain is going to be in a much better place in the morning yeah and i think too
unfortunately over time especially during the 70s and 80s and 90s people would brag about how much
sleep they didn't get like i only slept five hours i only slept six hours i mean in college we
can get away with that as we get better looking more intelligent with age we have to sleep more
you know that's you know that's and so like myself it's not always eight hours we we just
finished a study in australia that's going to we're writing it up to be published but it was with
mind workers who work in coal mines and when we were doing our baseline studies we're using
something called the bio strap we partnered with them in the study and during that most of the people
were sleeping seven to nine hours a night but still scoring on the insomnia scale so in that that
proved us something i already knew it's not time in bed it's depth of sleep so you need one hour
of deep sleep over time it's not all at one time it's over time and then two hours minimum
REM sleep and now you're producing enough of those neurotransmitters to have the
to the mood regulation we all it's normal to be depressed it's not normal to stay depressed
you know it's kind of like we flow in and out of these states of consciousness and if we can do that
usually it's measured by something called heart rate variability for those that are listening you
if you're able to get stressed and then relax that's great if you're not able to do that then
you don't have that regularity that you need that ability to adapt to the environment in front of you
dr porter this is so helpful really fascinating work that you're doing and so beneficial i mean
i have walked brain tap transform lives in my clinical practice and so it's really an honor
and a privilege to have you here today thank you so much for taking the time well it's great to be
here and we have a mission of bettering a billion brains so we need to at any age we need to better
their brains spread the word i want our listeners to know where they can find more about you and
about brain tap well they can go anywhere online at dr dr patrick porter dr porter they can check
out my website they can also if they want they can go get a free book and a 15-day trial on our app
for 99 cents and they get to keep the book no matter what they they can download it that's over at
brain tap dot pr o they can they can head over there and get a free copy and we're pretty much
if they just do hashtag brain tap they're going to see thousands of reviews out there and people
that are using it that's awesome that's so great thank you so much again for creating this for
doing the work you're doing to better brains and uh for being here with us today well thank you for
allowing me to i just can't believe all we're learning today wasn't dr porter wonderful he just
shared some incredible takeaways on how to improve your cognitive function in just six weeks how to
heal your brain at any age how to use light and sound to heal your brain how stress affects the
brain and what to do about it our next guest is dr greg echo he's a naturopathic colleague of mine
and has deeply personal reasons for dedicating his career to refining solutions for neurodegenerative
diseases dr echo will reveal why there should be lots of hope in reversing dementia and how it might
be possible to regenerate your brain using your own stem cells let us know in the comments below
what you've been most inspired by today what's moved you or helped you to see things in a new
light we'd love to hear from you and how this empowering information is supporting you as a
caregiver health professional or a patient let's begin the next interview with dr echo
dr echo it is such a pleasure to have you oh thank you so much so you were an obvious
you know a list of on people to invite because our i think our interests are so aligned you know
both being naturopathic doctors both really really inspired and and um deeply passionate about
neurodegenerative disorders and getting people the solutions that they need i think one of the
things that i'm talking to all of our guests with is how you know we see it every day we almost take
for granted that there are solutions whereas many of our listeners haven't heard that that this hope
that there's hope before so i'm just really thrilled to dive in uh to the depths with you on
everything that you're seeing clinically and all of the new and exciting things that you're helping
people with oh i love it you know it is so important i i know firsthand you know you
in my bio you uh shared some of my story there and you know being in medicine for 20 plus years
i i saw that the system was broke but when you go through it with a loved one you really feel it
and it hits you hard of like oh we this is really so fractionated and there isn't a lot of hope you
know i'm now talking to patients around the globe and you know you kind of get a diagnosis and you
get parked especially in this neurodegeneration realm and there's no people get really isolated
and overwhelmed and depressed right uh because there aren't there's no solution in western medicine
and really i swung for the fence and unfortunately what i discovered did not help saraya but it is
helping thousands of patients now and so i love that you have the summit and we're going to talk
about my fancy approach to neurodegeneration and brain health and really provide a lot of options
things to pursue consider and and hope you know i like to say i treat heart-centered beings moving
through time and space so it's not disease pieces and parts and when you treat a heart-centered being
because that's who people are as a heart-centered being that is really where the magic happens that's
where there's so much synergy and intuition that can come into play but also by listening deeply
you can really figure out what's the exact path for this person sitting in front of me great it's
so individualized what is best for that particular person and that so it requires understanding
their history really listening and hearing that story i'm curious about your approach
you call it the fan c approach to neuro and brain regeneration can you break that down for us how do
you yeah so f stands for functional and that's that component of helping heart-centered dynamic
beings like deep listening and really individualizing a program for them now the framework gets set up
in the a that's for assessment n is for nerve health that's different information that we put
into the body to help the nerves and then it's a dash c and c is for cellular regeneration so
we'll unpack each one of those as we go forward here but i really do you know everybody wants to
know what can i take what is the pill what you know what's going to make this go away doctor and
you know we're seeing that system doesn't work it doesn't work for chronic illness and disease
so that functional approach really it's the naturopathic chinese medicine functional medicine
integrated medicine whatever the moniker or label du jour i call it naturopathic medicine
which is treating whole dynamic heart-centered beings moving through time and space and that
aspect is really it brings the heart back into medicine and you really you get to sit you or
you're empathetic you're listening and you're understanding what's going on not you know we
could have 10 people in the room and develop 12 different treatment regimes for them because they're
so unique they've got their heritage they've got their genetics they've got the epigenetics
they have the environment they have their early childhood components they have their
adolescence they have their adulthood you know so there's i kind of give the analogy is how full
is your cup you know all of the and then they have their diet they have their mindset they have
their exercise they have certain traumas throughout their life that all pours water into the cup
and when your cup is full it runneth over and that's where the symptoms come in so we want to
address well what's in that cup for them so that's the assessment and in the assessment in particular
for neurodegeneration people are just not getting worked up you know in Alzheimer's mild cognitive
impairment dementia Alzheimer's you know some of the background stuff that really needs to get
discovered are you know lime is the great masquerader mold toxicity are big things chronic viral
issues so that would be in assessment now the three main pillars that i look at for everybody with
a brain are heavy metals the microbiome and hormones now these are the three legs of the stool
in the fancy approach now those first ones that i mentioned those are things to consider if it's in
the history not everybody we don't need to do a seven to ten thousand dollar work up on everybody
coming in to see us so you know a lot of folks in the functional realm and allopathic realm will
just say well we're going to throw the kitchen sink at it at them and basically them is treated as it
right as a product in the machine and so i really stress like we want to make a program for you
so it is individualized but the three starting spots heavy metals when i learned in environmental
medicine in the n hanes data in north america that the levels of toxicity of metals are through the
roof and when i graduated i tested everybody and i had to stop doing that because i discovered
oh we all have metals in our system and i always get patients to ask me well where did they come
from doctor you know and it is so ubiquitous wait we've got mercury in our amalgam so you know if
you're in your 50s or older and you have any fillings you have mercury fillings in there from
your childhood um we have mercury in the fish we have mercury gets burnt in coal fired plants and
put up in the plumes and then rains down in acid rain so it is on the west coast where i am we get
a big plume of dust every summer from china and we have coal fired plants in the midwest that
rains down on the northeast in the united states so we have ubiquitous kind of in our environment
metals the top four that i see that is in most of my patients it's not everybody but when it is there
it's cadmium mercury arsenic and lead those four are the top four now we do test for 13
but it is it's a stone to turn over you got to turn that stone over because if you don't
look at that then you're basically building on quicksand so you know things like glutathione
acupuncture chinese botanicals all of the great new tropics those aren't going to be as effective
if you've got basically this big bucket hole in the bottom of your bucket you're trying to fill up
so it's not they're not as effective so metals we see this we've seen this at marama actually
at the residential care facility where we've had we had a couple come in and they did they did great
they did very well they were improving but they didn't have a trained doctor like you and so sure
enough we encourage their family members to get them seen by by a well trained doctor and there
were heavy metals there that we didn't know about and so now it's so exciting to see all right as we
put all the pieces together but the lifestyle and the really good medicine what's their potential
yeah so it is amazing yeah once you get those cleared out of the way then we look at the microbiome
so it's still in the assessment because i know everybody wants to get to what to do right but
you got to start with a strong assessment because the microbiome we've all heard the gut is the
second brain and there's so much research coming out on this uh and you know i just saw there's
research on a probiotic that was decreasing Parkinson's symptoms in patients and definitely for
we're seeing certain probiotics associated with different neurodegenerative states so looking at
it the gut is the second brain why i have the walls yellow in my clinic is i come from the spleen
and the stomach camp in chinese medicine it's also the overlay with naturopathic medicine is treat
the gut healing starts with the gut right we dig our graves with our fork right you run the the
bredison protocol out of your clinics and you know one of those sub types of the Alzheimer's is
diabetes of the brain so looking at sugar imbalances along those lines so we want to see though
do you have inflammation in the gut do you have any pathogenic bacteria do you have any
opportunistic bacteria are your beneficial gut bugs in proper balance so there's a whole
slew of information we get from a microbiome test and so it's very important again for
foundational work because if you have inflammation in the gut you have imbalances in the gut
you have worms or parasites in your gut we need to clear that stuff because that is a total
drain on your vital force and your vitality you know i like to say i do a lot of nothing all day
i give basically we hold the space it's your body and it's the information coming into the
body that creates the healing potential but we have to remove obstacles to cure and so the
microbiome is a crucial kind of frontline assessment especially with mild cognitive impairment
dementia Alzheimer's these are huge imbalances if you have leaky gut guess what you have a leaky
brain the blood brain barrier is not working as well and so the integrity of your vessel and your
innate ability to heal is compromised if that's off right so that's the second leg of the stool
the third one is hormone testing and you know some will say well that's funny why for my brain
health do i need to look at my hormones right and we do know all of the information of our body
comes in through the periphery in our nervous system and we are set up with some amazing sensors for
you know vision and sound and taste and light and sensitivity pain and so what we're looking at
all of that information comes into your central nervous system comes up to the brain stem and
then goes to a small i call it a tiny little operation called the hypothalamus and in there
i imagine this little switchboard operator connecting the signals to the right region of the
brain well sometimes that operator gets really confused if you have brain fog confusion memory
issues they're just not connecting the signals in the right spot well what else comes in there
your hormones also come into the hypothalamus and so you've got your nervous system your sympathetic
your fight or flight like the saber tooth cat coming to eat you and then the parasympathetic
which is your rest and digest and heal that that's your nervous system autonomic nervous system and
then you have your hormones that get organized in there as well and so there's a lot we can do if
your hormones are out of balance and i see you know it's amazing what environmental toxicity is
doing to our hormones with kind of the plastics that are estrogenating our bodies creating a lot of
estrogen response in our bodies for men in particular but also for women men's testosterone
levels are dropping after the age of 35 so much so that they just changed the the reference range
on the labs you know it used to be total top end of 1200 for an average now it's down to 900 so
that's you know you see these reference ranges and they change and they're not normal ranges so
people you know here's a like a little kind of asterisk pro tip your reference range it's a
reference range on your lab it's not a normal number so a lot of times you don't understand that
and your providers don't understand that and that oh well look you're on the reference range you must
be fine but we have some optimal levels that we're looking at there for you in particular i call them
the healthy levels because it's much tighter controlled on the labs i'm going to get back
to the hormones so the hormones in particular you know we're looking at um progesterone estrogen
the breakdown products of estrogen we get to see what your liver is doing with them because
that is a big part of hormone metabolism and regulation is in your liver we look at some
of your snips the single nucleopeptide snips of your genetic snips to see well what's the
platform that your body's playing on with a big asterisk around that just because you have the
snip doesn't mean you're expressing it so that's a whole component on those three now i know that
is a ton of info so let me just pause there and see what comes up well you know i think it's really
exciting for me to hear that you also don't take those ranges as this is the bible of what's good
or healthy ready for comparing ourselves to a sick population that doesn't mean that we're healthy if
we are the same as them right so what we really want is this optimal level and assessing like doing
this assessment with a well-trained provider is so important because you're not going to get those
pro tips you're not going to get that added benefit if if you're seen just some run-of-the-mill
doctor that's not getting you answers if you ever hear get used to it you're getting old or oh that's
a senior moment please run the other way i will call absolute bs on that um because that is not
healthy aging i aged i saw what healthy aging was was in austria i lived in vienna austria as an
undergraduate student and i was hiking mountains with 80 and 90 year olds the only difference between
me and them was i got to the mountain top faster they were hiking with poles and it just took them a
little bit longer to get to the summit to have a pint of beer with me so that is the type of aging
that i want to promote in fact i've said i want to live to be 150 years old um because i've had the
privilege of sitting with my 90 year old patient saying you know doc had i known i was going to
live this long i would have taken a lot better care of myself you know and i'm humbled and honored
that they're sharing their you know trusting me with their health and but to have that it's a
responsibility if you hear that from a 90 year old you better wake up and start listening right and so
the folks on the on the all-time or summit my guess is either you have it or a loved one has it or
you see your loved ones going through it and you're looking at what can you do to prevent it and
all of the things that we're talking about that i will share in this interview are the things it's
the treatment it's also the prevention of how to live to 150 so with your brain and with your brawn
and with community so because we don't want to age like the typical american because you're so
right dr heather they are sick and diseased i mean the the average life expectancy in the us
has gone down the last two years right um i was talking to another physician and she was telling
me on the blue cross bruce shield their actuarial data showing for mild cognitive impairment the
average age you'll never guess is 47 years old this is the data in 2019 average age of beginning
mild cognitive impairment so you know this is not just 65 and older this is really affecting
all of us and that assessment that i laid out that's the beginning part but that is a big
piece of the puzzle um to really get an adequate and proper next step and then also what is the
right program for you to be on right i love it when someone comes in excited about prevention
right because we you and i know that we can prevent it in fact we know we can reverse it
but it's so much easier to prevent it's so much less expensive to prevent it's so and you get
not only do you get the benefits of cognitive function but you are stronger you are
you're healthier in general right when we treat the brain it's not separate from the rest of the
body and our approach is very much something that enhances cellular function and i know you're going
in that direction so tell me well nerve health first so let's talk about nerve health nutrients
so nerve health so you have heard all of these but you start with the b vitamins right b12 you
know i had a patient come in from new york city um after getting discharged from the hospital uh he
had hepatitis b and hepatitis c and basically was really wiped out in his 80s and really had
accelerated into dementia after this episode and you know wasn't dying so got checked out of the
hospital and they didn't really have much more for him so his son brought him out to the clinic here
and we did uh multivitamin mineral nutrient drips for him and we did four of them in a week
and at the end of the week in addition to other therapies but these big ibs it was like you know
people will call them a meyer's cocktail but i don't like that term because there wasn't really a lot
of nutrients in a meyer's cocktail so i call them a multivitamin mineral drip because it is a lot
of information coming in as far as a multivitamin mineral now and this is not what you get down
at the you know the id bar this is really medical grade um physician-derived uh medicine and in full
in that week um he came back he knew what time his flight was he was sharp he got his mind back
and his stamina when they got back to new york city they were able to walk four blocks without
any pause before that he didn't know where he was he didn't know what time it was what year
it was who the president was none of that and that was just a simple nutrient deficiency in
particular we had b5 b6 b12 b complex magnesium potassium calcium selenium multiple trace elements
vitamin c you know a typical multivitamin mineral drip in a naturopathic office but it was those
nutrients are specific for brain health um of course the mushrooms are i love mushrooms so you
got the shaga mushroom but uh you've got boswellia is another great nutrient and herb um you know i
can laundry list them i think a big component that a lot of people don't look and was not even
known about when i was in medical school was the end of cannabinoid system and professor musulam
out of israel who uh really named a lot of these molecules is one of my heroes and so i like to
mention him as many times as i can on the internet um we have him to thank for this discovery of the
endocannabinoid system and that underlies there are more receptors for endocannabinoid so this would
be like cbd uh black pepper is in that family i like the cbd and i'll stick with that there are
other endocannabinoid uh substances but in particular cbd is a great one for decreasing
neuro inflammation and um helping underlay the all of the hormones that we were talking about
those imbalances so that one oftentimes goes overlooked and not really considered a neurotropic
either yeah there are so many fun ones there um and how do you decide which patient should get
which one when we go into these neuro nutrients or no tropics as you mentioned do you use a
combo product or do you kind of individualize it how how do you not overlook something as great as
cbd yeah yeah so we really we do i call it the jung of the formula or direction and so you know
it's not the me too movement on uh extra supplements right um it's on you know it's concentrated meaning
there are high concentrations which is the general and then there's some
assistance and then micro assistance everybody moves you in a direction so that you know i'll
see people don't come in on 30 different supplements and they're super well researched and thought out
and there's some great research behind it but i kind of give the analogy of like you're treading
water you're keeping your head above the water which is important you're not drowning but you're
not really moving anywhere if you were doing like the freestyle moving in a direction and so that's
the jung of the formula so you want all of the therapeutics to be in the right order at the
right time and what's the next step and so then you take them long enough to get to a point where
you can reassess uh oftentimes people will abandon ship like i didn't notice anything different after
two days it's like well mrs jones it took you six decades to get to the state what was the expectation
after two days of use you know so sometimes it does take a little while to kind of backfill
those patterns that we've made over time and so you know will the the big guns vitamin d is a
big one that i use for brain health so a lot of folks don't really utilize it that way i don't
think about it that way but it is a great one you know it's misnamed it really is a
neuromodulator and hormone precursor in addition to all of the other benefits that vitamin d does
for our immune system our mood etc uh i developed a nasal spray called clearmind and this one was
specific where you know my expertise really out of bare necessity um with uh critsfield
jake of disease uh this condition is a rare condition this is what my wife passed of and
how i really just went deep in this topic and developed this fancy approach and really i'm
talking to people around the globe now is um cjd it's a prionic activity it's prions and prions
are misfolded proteins um and people there when you read about them they all say that well they're
infectious prionic activity it's like well why do they call it infectious it's not a bacteria
it's not a virus these proteins get misfolded and then they start signaling other proteins
to misfold well cjd is what it looks like is rapidly progressing dementia uh and it's nasty
i mean within it was like within two months saraya lost the ability to communicate and i mean i was
an 18 month run that we had with her and it's just not fun it's not a fun condition and it's rare
one in a million so you know you really don't get the diagnosis until the your loved one dies and
then they give you a brain biopsy to make sure it was that um and lo and behold that's what she had
i mean you're going to go through the differential and you wind up with some ominous ones at the
end of the road and you're like oh i hope it's not that well it was that um so i was looking at and i
had very high suspicion because i had never seen anything the way that she progressed she was very
high functioning super dynamic being on the planet and just for that much of a rapid decline
it wasn't like a psychotic break it wasn't hormones it wasn't mold you know these wasn't a hormone
imbalance like those are the starting spots in a dementia realm that you do that's what i put into
my assessment then it started getting into this like well you know maybe it's an auto immune
condition that rapidly progresses like that or it's prionic activity in cjd so i went like okay well
i've got everything going for auto immune with her so i better make sure i've got my basis covered
with the prionic activity and i put together and i have a patent pending on the nasal spray now
which is called clear mind it helps with brain fog focus memory issues speech for i have my
patients with Parkinson's are using it and their speech is improving so i knew i know it's it's
taking care of these prions in the brain now for psorias unfortunately it was just too late
um and it may have never worked for her but we're getting really great clinical results
with my patients now so that has a dmso and hocl and i've put some uh essential oil blends in
there too um but the dmso is dimethyl sulfoxide and it's a carrying agent it's called a shamp
chaperone molecule and then hocl is what our own immune system uh surrounds bacteria and viruses to
disassemble um but it's also shown to deactivate prionic activity so there's over two million
dollars of nih research on that molecule there for prion so it's you know prions are really um
they're ubiquitous in our environment you know if you've heard of mad cow syndrome that's what this
is in people it's also called sharpie um yeah sharpie in um goats and sheep no in sheep scrappy
sorry scrappy in sheep and then um you know there were some tribes in new guinea they don't do this
anymore but they used to eat the brains of the elders that passed and that was they were just
eating prion prions in that from their loved ones and then getting the critsfield jacob disease
from that um so that's a big addition and it was an amazing find um you know i was asking every day
for intuitive hits on what can i do for saraya and how can we help more people with this and
you know the whole event um the loss and i mean you know it was pretty it's a tragic story and i
didn't want my tragedy to be um for naught so i i'm really putting it to good use and uh want to
serve as many people as i can so that that new nutrient um the brain spray or the clear mind
nasal spray is what we call it um is really unique to our practice but i really want to help get
get the word out so get that out that's really exciting and so beautiful you know you see these
horrible things happen to people certainly as a doctor i'm hearing stories of people losing
loved ones or diagnoses of cancer or dementia and really what you model here is that there's a choice
right you can choose to make it the worst thing that ever happens to you or you can choose to
make it the inspiration to do to show up in the world in a way that serves others and and really
make it part of the best thing that happened to you not not that i would ever suggest or wish that
on anyone but i think you understand right like that there's there's this choice in them in any
horrible situation that we're we're given or dealt um that we we can choose to make it something
positive and make an impact on the world so i just want to acknowledge and thank you for for
showing up that way thank you yeah in such the odd way it really cracked me open as a human being
and uh you know reinstated my faith in such a beautiful way so you know i'm forever grateful
for that yeah yeah so you also get excited about some of these like techie uh nerdy i don't know
how you want to describe it but like the lasers and i do too you know the lasers and the stem cells
and oh yeah fun um kind of things we can start to add you talked a lot about the fan the foundations
is kind of how i'm going to think about it with the fancy approach like we got to go through the
fundamentals yeah then when when we've gotten that what can we do to even optimize a little
bit more or what is the research telling us about the latest so this is so exciting and we live at
such an amazing time so we um what just came out in december was this discovery about these cells
which are very small embryonic like stem cells and these were i i did not know about these as a
student or graduate in 2001 when i graduated from medical school they were discovered in 2005 by
dr rattachak in the university of kentucky and these v cells are what we were created in mama's
belly in utero of how the fetus and how the baby develops are these very small embryonic like stem
cells so they can turn into any tissue in the body and they lie dormant we thought in our
kind of uh arrogance in medicine and science was oh those are just dormant cells they're garbage we
could just get rid of them what was discovered that you can actually turn them back on they lie
dormant and they're ready to go to work but you just have to get them turned back on so
how do they turn back on naturally is if like you have a heart attack or some damage to the heart
they will get activated in that sense and but then they go back to dormancy so what we have discovered
is you can turn them back on with a laser and we all have these v cells in our body lying dormant
but then you you turn them back on and then you can direct them with the laser for where you want
them to go so it's a laser activated and guided stem cell procedure and it is phenomenal we're
seeing really great results now i want to be clear we are not treating any diagnosis is or conditions
so i treat people and i give their body the information and then the body and it's innate
innate wisdom heals itself with the information so because it's a big deal i want to be really
clear on semantics and on my language around that um that said we are seeing amazing things we have a
not in the neurodegenerative front now one uh had a Parkinson's patient 30 minutes after the
procedure went from full-on tremors and advanced Parkinsonism to smooth gate face came back amazing
no tremor you couldn't even tell like he was just stunned on the video that we have on that
on my brain regeneration program so i also do an full body IVs and hyperbaric oxygen and photo
biomodulation which are pulsed electromagnetic frequency and low level lasers PEMF and LLT
it's a mouthful but lights you know really the future of medicine is in sound and light
and we're seeing it clinically really accelerating response time where things that
should have taken months or years are we're seeing some results in 30 minutes to four hours now
it's really phenomenal so incredible so the laser i think when you started mentioning laser
guided stem cells i in my mind i was thinking of photo biomodulation so using like red lights to
help with mitochondrial function and the psycho oxygenase enzymes yes but wait so what color light
is the laser i have no any question yeah it is a red light it is a red light laser but it is um
Dr. Todd is the inventor of this and it's a whole patented patented process and just big kudos to
Dr. Todd because he is sharing this with the world and discovered this so he created a laser that has
a coherence factor so a filter that creates a specific wavelength that we think is breaking a
ligand bond assault bond that frees up the V cell that activates it and so it's the frequency of that
laser so the red lights like a juve or red light therapy those are really important as well you
know Weber technology makes a helmet that's really awesome for folks you can do you know laser guided
in IV therapy and beam different colored lights in the body that way as well and all of those are
very effective just in this fancy approach this is what we've got in our kind of cutting edge
methodology how exciting i was actually reading a paper it was a review paper by
Mike Hamplin who's at Harvard who writes a lot about photobiomodulation and he I didn't read the
full russian paper because i think it's in russian but he refers to it and what they did was pretty
invasive they took through the femoral artery they took a light in there were 96 patients i think
and they cut them in half they controlled it and in half the patients they took a light through the
femoral artery and shown a red light in the brain and then on the other half they they did the same
surgery but didn't shine the light and sure enough in a hundred percent of the treated
patients there was a reversal of their cognitive decline that lasted for one to seven years wow
just phenomenal and you think this is just light like it's pretty and it's kind of seems crazy in
russian and invasive but it also is like wow like the potential of light especially when
i'm sure a lot of your patients are like mine their guts are kind of sensitive
so i can't throw a bunch of supplements at them but we can shine light yeah and it can be really
really really powerful yeah you know we truly are light beings you know we that we now can measure
light emitting diodes off of our dna like out of ourselves so you know it makes total sense to put
it back in for healing and that we would get these signals and of course we're diurnal right so
there's light that comes up with the sunrise and then down with the sunset and that a lot of that
is that those reds and oranges and that there would be benefit to being exposed to it it's
so exciting yeah so you know when when someone comes to your clinic what they call and talk to
your staff where or get a chance to talk to you um where do you point them to start because this
can feel overwhelming you know we do we offer consults for our patient base you know i really
try to produce a lot of online offerings too for like brain foundations and kind of just like the
basics foundational stuff to do at home environmental components we do a lot of education as well
so you know at at my website and you know even just calling the office so we i have a full team
here so it's not just me so i have a lot of heart center practitioners showing up and helping me
to get the word out and carry on these therapies because it is you know there are so many people
suffering with these conditions and need a lot of support and i don't want people to feel isolated
or alone now that said not everybody can come to portland oregon now one of the lovely things is
we do a lot of remote consulting now for folks so um you know coming to our website uh is okay if we
mention that here or yeah so that's nature cures clinic dot com um nature singular cures with an
s clinic dot com and we do have a book of call we do a 30 minute consult for folks so you know you
got to qualify for care we only want to work with folks that really want to make a difference so um
you know we do offer that too that's incredible that's wonderful and you know
i'm so curious about the clear my nasal spray like could i use it can i use it can it help me
feel a little clearer and a little more present every day so where do we get that you know that
one currently we we're building the store online um so currently that's through the office so you can
send an email to info at nature cures clinic dot com and um in the subject line put clear clear
mind nasal spray and just inquire right there yeah fantastic that i'm so excited to learn about a
few of these other things that that i hope i'll be able to share with my patients now you are also
the host of a neuro region summit and i'm curious you know i'm having so much fun talking to people
like you but i'm just so curious what was a standout what did you learn from interviewing
the experts that were on your summit you know this so this is a relaunch and i really um on my
second year running i really wanted to focus in on this frequency and light healing and also the
components of environmental toxicity so we really brought in a lot around emfs uh mounting mounting
evidence that it is not good for us as beings and our brains etc now that doesn't mean i'm a lewdite
but we do um provide a lot of great solutions on you know minimizing your risk turning it off getting
your wi-fi off at night time like you don't need to bathe in it all the time um you know putting
your phone on only checking at certain times and putting it on airplane mode because you know you
don't need to be reachable 24 hours a day even though you feel like it but i am before the internet
times here people and you do not need it all the time i will tell you that um we also one of the
big things just in in that vein um i got to speak with uh a neurologist dr chaudry um and she got to
go in uh to the ancient texts the vedic textbooks in india and she pulled out some of the oldest
mantras that are sound healing for all of our seven chakras and she actually has a great um
iTunes uh recording of it that you can sing along with her and you don't even need to have a good
singing voice you can just tone with the sound it's not religious at all and it's the sounds that
help balance the chakras and it's one of the oldest mantras on the planet and it's such a gift to us all
yeah wow thank you for telling us on to that so much value uh thank you for sharing your wisdom
your expertise your experience it's been an absolute pleasure getting to learn more about
you and your practice and all you have to offer thank you dr echo oh you are welcome i'm humbled
and honored that you had me on and i just want to you know last words of encouragement just know
there are tons of heart centered practitioners looking for solutions for you all out there
and just you know connect connect with us you know i'm really grateful uh for this summit
and the opportunity to uh reach you in your living room so thanks for listening gosh what an eye
opening interview with dr greg echo we learned why there should be lots of hope and reversing
alzheimer's disease what a gem next up we have another friend of mine dr chip whitney dr whitney
is a medical doctor who's also been trained by dr redison on the recode protocol after discovering
firsthand is in his clinic the impact of oral health on the whole body he's dedicated his work
to reminding people that health starts in the mouth dr whitney is going to share with us how things
such as sleep apnea oral health affect cognitive decline you'll discover the most important questions
to ask your dentist to help support your brain health and reduce or eliminate the little known
but very serious contributors to alzheimer's disease in case you feel you might miss any
of these incredible interviews during the summit don't worry you can pick up your vip all access
pass at a special discount right now you can have a lifetime access to the entire summit and all of
its bonuses now without further ado let's begin the interview with dr chip whitney so dr whitney
thank you so much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to be here to educate our attendees
on just this this super super important topic i i have my pleasure heather that i mean it's just
everybody needs to know the mouth matters the vet's got it a long time ago and now physicians and
late people need to understand too i think it's one of these things that comes up so often i've
read as people are aging and they're they're juggling like where do i spend my limited resources
i'm on a fixed income dental work is in is expensive it can be out of pocket if you don't
have the right insurance not everything gets covered by insurances so how i just briefly how
do you coach patients when do you say you know make this a priority this is really important
everybody because it really is as you'll hear as we talk further that it really has a big impact
on a lot of disease process i mean we're talking about Alzheimer's in this series but it impacts
cardiovascular disease cancer risk preterm labor complications of pregnancies not just an old person
i mean it impacts potentially everybody so the mouth really does matter it's the gateway to a
lot of diseases so here i am talking to a family physician and you are a key opinion leader in
dentistry so how did that happen some things get dumped in your lap and this was dumped into my lap
so i mean i've done preventive medicine for my whole career back to my Air Force days about
10 years ago i found and implemented a cardiovascular heart attack and stroke prevention program where
you can actually prevent that first heart attack and implemented in my practice well it looked at
things like biomarkers blood tests that really reflect as the Cleveland Clinic talks about a lot
inflammation in the arteries and there's two really important inflammatory markers one of
them is called plaque 2 basically it's if it's up you've got activated plaque in your arteries
and back at the beginning i was doing everybody was doing i was putting on drugs i was having
an exercise they were losing weight and nobody this number wasn't budgeting but the second i
pulled out those few slides during the about oral health in the training certification program for
for me and i started simply having people use a sonic brush use a couple of mouth rinses and
see their hygienists that number was plummeting left and right i mean it was barely budging even
with statin use which is kind of what at the time the treatment was but in lifestyles but it was
plummeting 10 times that amount with oral health so i was preaching the gospel for a year about
oral health and a consensus statement came out between american academy of periodontology the
gum dentist and american heart association trying to tell everybody that there is important connection
between the two confused everyone so i i ended up um writing an editorial that got published in
the dental organization that kind of led towards that but what i really recognize i had my aha
moment when i say i watched these numbers dropping i was like wait a minute why is this
occurring i mean i always have to ask the question why you do i do that's what dr reddison's
practices all our methods all about is why is this happening well i can't you know what i've known
for almost 30 years that if you get bacteria in the mouth from the mouth whenever you have
bite an apple or get the hygiene cleaning done bacteria launch into your bloodstream
and they can infect a diseased valve so that's why we give antibiotics when people have diseased
valves so i sat back and well what else do those bacteria do in health and that's where the whole
connection of the the gum brain the gum cardiovascular the gum cancer the gum preterm
complications of labor all that that's it when those bacteria that are causing inflammation
that you can see in your gums your hygienists can see your gums the bacteria it's an infectious
cause of those those bleeding gums that when they land in those end organs like the brain the
arteries in the organs they drive that same inflammation in those end organs it's so simple
but so important so you um you talked about a marker so this feels really actionable somebody
today could go to their doctor and say can you run this test for me so what is it again is it the
LP PLA2 it is it's the LP PLA2 admittedly people need to recognize most physicians aren't going to
know that test places like the Cleveland Clinic talk about it but it's a measure of inflammation
that almost always comes from activated plaque in the arteries that they can get that doesn't just
have to be done at Cleveland Clinic but it can be done in Quest lab core they run it also but
but again most physicians don't know what don't know what exists and don't know what to do about it
because frankly almost everybody in the 10 years I've been looking at this almost about 80 90% come
from the mouth and frankly I think the rest of them come from leaky gut I've had a handful of people
over the years where that member just won't bud despite great gums I really think that the other
end of the gut got being leaky causes this to conduit to also health starts in the mouth or
in the gut and the gut starts in the mouth right so there's another quick test that I think people
could do today at home and that's brush your teeth vigorously floss and then spit in the
sink and see if there's blood you know you have implored patients doctors dentists everyone involved
in your training module with Dr. Bettison not to tolerate blood in the sink tell us why
blood in the sink by definition there's a connection of whatever's in the mouth with
the bloodstream so whatever organisms there and there's thought to be about a trillion micro
organisms in the mouth alone that they're getting into your bloodstream they're spraying everywhere
and causing disease so whatever's there is getting in your bloodstream if it's there and
unfortunately way too many health professionals and patients don't understand the importance of that
so some people might think well if I'm vigorously brushing and I'm poking something around in my
gums of course I'm going to have blood and no actually that's not true I saw many people over
the years oh yeah I if I stop brushing and if I stop flossing usually the brushing doesn't do it
but if I stop the flossing for a while then I start getting some blood in the sink well that's
because you're allowing the infection to percolate and and and the infection causes inflammation
inflammation is what leads to the bleeding if you do your homeoral health whatever regimen is
recommended by the dentist or your dental team is you're not going to get bleeding when you do
those things so I I've seen it myself I get lazy for a bit and I start doing things I start to see
a little bit of blood in the sink and it's like oops there's my there's my barometer that's your
clue yeah that's such a simple test to know that something is going on and that you need to kind
of pick up that oral hygiene practice and actually just to talk about that for just a second too is
that the reason this is important from an Alzheimer's standpoint is they've actually found these
bacteria from the mouth in the brain of Alzheimer's patients I mean it's tough to get what's called
causation level evidence meaning cause effect in health most of what you and I recommend aren't
based on that there's causation level evidence for the back bacteria doing that and and also
people have to remember you can't just rely on your dental team doing it too that because those
back the when what happens is is that when they do their thing with their hygiene cleaning in the
office and you do your brushing flossing and maintenance at home you're breaking up that bio
film those those organisms want to hide behind in a foxhole I like to call it going back to my
military days they hide in a foxhole we have to break them out and and let them be exposed to death
otherwise they can cause problems well that biofilm starts to reconstitute itself within 24 to 48
hours of your hygiene cleaning it's correct back to baseline four weeks after your hygiene cleaning
so you cannot just rely on the hygiene team to do their job you've really got to do your job at home
too and some people think that there's well there is there's normal flora in the gut and in the mouth
so that normal flora should be there is that normal flora like say peach and devalus is the one that
we find in autopsy brains that have you know dementia is that normal flora or is that getting
overgrown or is it really just this this breakdown in the gum that makes it a problem it's
peach and devalus is probably present in just about everybody it is the bad boy of bad boys I
mean it's the of all the different bacteria we can look at and we do testing for that and in the way
I do the recode program that it's the one that drives all three of the above heart disease cancer
and dementia but anyway it's is it there in everybody probably but you want to keep it in
healthy gums where this biofilm is constantly disrupted it's not going to kind of grow so if
we just kind of keep it down to a dull roar and and keep those keep that fort knocks of a of a barrier
strong between letting those bacteria into the bloodstream then it's not going to wreak havoc
on you it's all it's all relative but yeah now so it's it's the and it's the peach and devalus
and the other what we call anaerobic the oxygen-hating bacteria they live deep in those pockets you
hear about people getting the dentists are measuring they live deep in those products
pockets they hate oxygen and and they're going to grow more and that's what causes the inflammation
so it's these bad bacteria colonization that drives the inflammation that drives disease so I
mean everything in life is good versus evil it's balanced so you really want to kill the bad and
promote the growth of the good so are there certain products I know Dr. Bedeson really likes
the dental side and toothpaste I also recommend that in my clinic is there are there a couple
things that are quick and easy to find that you would recommend your patients use so I have gotten
my education from my my dental advisors over the years as you can imagine I'm not a dentist I didn't
didn't say in the holiday and express either so but but I got my recommendation from so
I actually asked several dentists that told me the most important intervention they can do
for the health of their math is a sonic toothbrush because what the sonic toothbrush is it vibrates
it doesn't spin so when you brush or you use the spinning type of of disruption you're getting as
far as the bristles will go when you get that sonic vibration what it does is to break up the
biofilm two to three millimeters past the tips of the bristles so they say if there's any one thing
a person can do is just using a sonic toothbrush and what will be makes it sonic philips sonic here
those kind of things you may have heard of and the toothpaste there's a lot of debate on that in
turn I mean I'm not going to comment as a physician too much about that there's so many schools of
thought but basically one that causes the least irritation is kind of what I've kind of go by
just kind of a plain plain one whatever variety and then and then mouth rinses there's definitely
a role for mouth rinses there's a little bit of a there's a little bit of a debate on that but in
my world is watching it for 10 years now people in these very specific cardiovascular markers
getting better with the use of mouth rinses they will kill the bacteria and then so they'll kill a
lot of the bad guys they will kill some of the good good guys and there is some pretty good
consensus they should use kind mouth rinses without alcohol frankly I recommend alcohol
free listerine and another one called the closest CLOS they actually get a and I'm not sponsored by
them they they they they together get the floor the bad guys the best combination I think where I
have people use listerine after brushing in the morning and closest after brushing in the evening
and then this is where the dental team can come in is to consider the use of probiotics
so so there's all kinds of regimens out there and on the bottom line disclaimer is I don't know
your situation talk to your dental team and if it's a complete health dental team that knows that
mouth body combination real well that they they'll they'll advise you well on on what to do because
probiotics if you're going to kill the enemy you want to replace it with good bacteria so there
is a role for probiotic specific oral product the ones you take for your gut don't work for
their well it's not they don't work there's a different mix of good bacteria in the mouth than
there is in the lower gut and is there a role for oil pulling I would love to be sponsored by coconut
oil if anybody out there has a connection so I've never done it myself disclaimer uh people who do
it love it they're committed to it but I've had Dennis tell me that it does work it it does help
to kill the bad bacteria makes no doubt about it and but it can be cumbersome and complicated so
if people are motivated to do it it definitely is a valuable um intervention great great now
we've talked about the gums and that being an avenue for these bacteria to get into the blood
stream there's another then there's some controversy around this but it's a role of root canals versus
maybe implants or or even fillings how else can bacteria get into the blood stream so root canals
is a good good topic to talk about so that's exactly the same way so what we've been talking about
is gum bacteria the gap between your gum and your tooth so we have not yet even talked about a
tooth problem we've been talking about a gum problem back bad bacteria the gums so what happens
with the root canal as you get an infection within the tooth usually there's like a little crack in
the tooth where the bacteria make their way down and get at the base down into the root of the tooth
and drive an infection so again it's a bacterial infection typically it's an infectious process
that pulls infection at the base of the tooth and can get into the blood stream and if it gets bad
enough that's when people get pain and need the root canal so the the the what to do about it there's
definitely debate in there but the how to treat it whether it's with doing a root canal whether it's
doing a tooth removal including an implant in as a physician i'm not going to talk about that that's
for the dentist too and there's a lot of debate within what they should do but bottom line is you
don't want infection one way or the other you want to get that infection out because there was actually
a very intriguing study back in 2013 that really linked tightly with we're talking cardiovascular
disease for a moment but they they looked at 101 heart attacks and this was actually an american
heart association journal circulation probably heard of that it's their top journal american
heart associate so it wasn't a dental journal but they looked at 101 heart attacks they sucked the
clot out of the heart attack what happens is an artery and heart um a clot forms in it and they
sucked that clot out of the heart and they analyzed it for oral bacteria and the bottom line outcome
of it was that up to half of those 101 heart attacks and this is a medical journal were driven by
an event from the mouth it was either and and they looked at both gum infection and they looked root
canal infection and so they were both contributing to that the interesting part in this discussion
is that they they did a scan called a cone beam cat scan so it's a very detailed look at the base
of the tooth and they found infections at the base of teeth of these people at heart attack
in 30 of those 101 people every single uh every single one of them were asymptomatic they didn't
they weren't having any symptoms of of of teeth problems that they noticed so a lot of people can
have um tooth infections that don't really bother them but they can cause problems so that's why it
really is when your dentist is telling you you really do need to get this this this problem
that's not causing pain because a lot of people go ahead just fix my pain well what you don't
know will hurt you that those bacteria can't get into your bloodstream it's a good motivation to
brush and floss every day the you know the old oil filter card you can pay me now or you can pay me
later absolutely that's a that comes with it with the mouth you either pay with your health or pay
with your your wallet and they this cardiovascular connection right of course heart we don't want
anybody to have a heart attack a cardiac event uh but the cerebral vascular connection so when
we're talking about cardiovascular issues you know this gets connected to cognitive issues
very quickly because if you don't get blood flow to your brain because your your uh the interest
like the inner layer of your vessels is inflamed that's going to affect cognitive function very
quickly yeah and as uh as the whole recode method teaches that so the bacteria we're talking about
toxicity the bacteria getting into the brain and we're talking about cardiovascular type four
and and so basically it's it's disease of the pipes leading to it so if you have a I mean they're
all the same mechanism if somebody has a heart attack it's because you get a clot forming in
the artery in the heart a stroke is when a clot forms in the artery breaks open and ruptures and
caught and the clot floats up to the brain because it's a high pressure vessel well if it happens
hundreds or thousands of times in the itty bitty arteries that supply oxygen to the brain that's
cardiovascular dementia so it's all the same process just different a location wow so so important
so another really important piece of maintaining cognitive function is getting enough oxygen to
your brain particularly at night so sleep apnea is a known major contributor to cognitive decline
for several reasons um and you call it airway disease so it's not just sleep apnea it's not
just you know the absence of a c-pap tell me a little bit more about kind of the comprehensive
view of getting oxygen to your brain yeah so it and and also how it doesn't necessarily have to
have to see so c-pap is like putting a band-aid on a wound you're shoving oxygen down the throat
and you're going to get you're going to bypass an obstruction which you just saw shoving oxygen so
certainly it is an important measure and some people if they've got severe apnea until they get
it fixed but it's not treating the problem at all so the problem with the uh with sleep apnea is that
you don't get oxygen to the brain from a couple different reasons so I call it an airway disease
because the problem is not a lack of c-pap like you said it's a obstruction either where the tone
falls back into the airway and blocks it off or they get an upper airway obstruction it's usually
a more subtle one harder to find it's not as raging the abnormal results on testing but
it can cause a lot of disease coming from from the blockages in the nose so what they it's been
doing speaking in dentistry I've been paired up with a lot of airway conferences and I got to see
a lot of very I've been taught tremendously by my dental colleagues about airway disease because
the you can you can actually and as you saw in the training there's physical exam features
that you can see on people where who have sleep apnea whether it's scallop look on the sides of
your tongue from gritting your teeth whether it's a TMJ because you're gritting your teeth and you're
not breathing there there can be really skinny people and most people think of a sleep apnea as
that of the obese and certainly losing weight will be very helpful but now that I know what to
look for and I'm looking for it through physical exam features and symptoms I'm finding a lot of
very thin people sleep apnea and interesting it starts very early in life I mean it starts in the
pediatric population when those bones are all malleable and forming that people are are left
with a narrow narrow palate high arch where they're there they're very narrow face the the the jaw
gets pulled back for various reasons and basically shoves the tongue in the way so that what the
dentists are able to do with various techniques are to open up the airway so they they will they
guess they can make an appliance most people know about that so if somebody has an appliance and they
keep spitting it out just a side note it's probably coming from the nose so if the if I've
heard dentists say you're going to make a person's CPAP worse if the problem's coming from the nose
but you give them an appliance but they have different ways whether it's Invisalign or other
techniques called vivos where it actually both opens the airway and restructures the mouth but if
you can restructure and create more space to breathe you can cure your sleep apnea and put
your CPAP on on the shelf for memories so it's always actually the dentist team can actually
cure the problem in some people. I've had a handful of patients do really well with just
mouth tape which when I initially heard about it I was like that's weird that sounds awful
but people swear by it just putting and again a very practical intervention very inexpensive
something to just try the other thing is that those strips that you can the breathe right strips
so both of those things are treating that upper airway resistance syndrome the CPAP
that's not coming from the tongue falling in the throat it's coming from obstruction in this area
and people who are mouth breathers so for various reasons some people are mouth breathers and we
should be healthy breathing at nighttime is breathing through our nose so but I'm putting
the tape on there forces you to breathe through your nose now that's a problem if you've got a lot
of nasal congestion so interestingly and kind of another a note treating the toxicity of like
say mold toxicity that people that's the root cause of it they can that year-round congestion
their nose goes away and that's a way that they can actually improve their sleep apnea so they
cure their mold and they fix their sleep apnea in some cases but yeah so any intervention whether
it's a a whatever treatment to reduce the swelling at nighttime can be beneficial so that's kind of
in the treatment regimen is for people have upper airway resistance is to whatever non
non-surgical ways you can to treat the problem that's coming from the nasal passage and for
anyone here who's listening that has more questions about the mold toxicity chronic sinusitis and how
that might be contributing to cognitive decline both Dr. Jill Krista and Dr. Neil Nathan dive deep
into these subjects so I invite you to go over there listen to those interviews because there
will be lots and lots there to help you find solutions for cognitive decline that can be
coming from those chronic sinus infections or mold toxicity and Dr. Whitney and I are both
those are our colleagues and mentors and we've learned a lot from them and incorporating that
into a comprehensive approach to combating cognitive decline is so important. Another piece
of the puzzle when it comes to dentistry is the role of potentially mercury in amalgams
so tell me a little bit about what's known what isn't and when someone might consider an intervention
there. So mercury it's a known neurotoxin it's going to it is it is a root cause of Alzheimer's
disease so I and anyone who understands that concept says that nobody should ever have mercury
put in their mouth again. There are dentists out there who do it still because it is supported by
the American Dental Association so there's a lot of controversy in dentistry so I'm not going to
get into the details of that but I as a physician don't think anybody should get more mercury put
in their mouth because because when you put the mercury in the mouth it you get a lot of mercury
exposure so the question is is that do you have to have if you've like many of us have do you have
to have your mercury fillings removed and the answer is maybe well one reason is it so I always
tell my patients if I see mercury in their mouth I say go to your dentist have them take a look at
the the mercury is the filling is in good repair you might not have to have it taken out if it's
breaking down you're getting mercury in your system and it should come out and and if it's
done it has to be done in a safe way there are safe techniques for removing it to minimize your
exposure because the the other time you get the most exposure is when you take out the fillings
so when you put them in when you take them out you get your most mercury exposure so if you've
got a filling that's not broken down and it's not leaking into your system and no harm no foul don't
don't let's leave it alone don't have the fillings taken out and there are ways that we can test for
mercury toxicity and and even help to sort out is it coming from inorganic sources like the
fillings or is it coming from eating a lot of fish over the years and just not getting there's
ways you can distinguish that and we can test you for that so if if somebody comes back and the
dentist says yeah they look like they're in pretty good shape then what I'll do and the dentist could
do also is to test to see is it getting into the system and does it need to be taken out because
it is leaking I had a patient who had a significantly elevated we had done the test that you're
referring to and she had both that were significantly elevated and she refused to take any supplements
so she wouldn't do any binders she didn't want to do any sort of cullation in our IV she's like
I'm just going to be honest I'm not going to swallow it so we um we I did advise her to have
them removed because those levels were elevated and she came back a year later so full 12 months
later and we tested again it had decreased by more than half so no intervention other than
getting them all out and both the inorganic and methyl mercury had both shifted significantly so
she was kind of a control if you will almost because there was no other the imd powder that we
hadn't done any edta or or dmps or dmsa so it was just an interesting kind of end of one
yeah yeah no and that makes sense because it clearly whatever dentist took the fillings out
did a good job yes it was a biological dentist yeah so that clearly they did a good job on it and
there's there's there's definitely evidence that if it's you're you're going to have a lot
better outcome if you do it in ways that are safe do you tend to refer to biological dentists or do
you think that there is another way to choose a good dentist in your area so the I don't like to
pigeonhole dentists into titles so I mean a biological dentist is kind of like I'm a functional
integrative physician I mean I'm a physician and I just have an emphasis on root causes
understanding things like toxicity so those who are are kind of branding themselves as a biological
dentist certainly know especially from a toxicity standpoint the concept of mercury and and certainly
if people are that they they are the ones who are most likely to be trained in that but I'm
really more interested in a dentist who just understands the mouth body connection because
there's a ton out there that's not necessarily the like we talked about like the oral bacteria the
airway there's a whole lot so there's actually kind of a term complete health dentist where
they're kind of branding themselves and setting their practice up in terms of complete health
where they understand and they they talk to people along these fronts about the connection
of the mouth and the body and why they should do this and that and it makes a big difference I mean
the root canal example is a perfect one where it's like a lot of dentists if there's no pain they
leave it alone but what you don't know is going to be hurting you so but yeah I mean that's a if
people are looking for a dental I mean number one dentists can get certified in the whole
reticent recode method through Apollo health they're kind of in the very early stages there's
not lots of them out there right now doing it but I would that would be a certainly a great place to
start if they happen to have somebody in their area who's been certified in recode and then
basically kind of looking around to find out if they can see somebody who kind of I mean branding
themselves or if you look at their websites and say that they understand the mouth body connection
or call themselves complete health dentists or or a biologic dentist then that's a good starting
point and frankly I the lowest level triage I have for that is that does the dentist tolerate
blood in the sink because honestly there's been many times I as a vision I say do you bleed when
you brush or you floss and if they say yes and they it's all my questionnaire and if they say yes
I say so what's the dentist say about your gums oh they say they're great okay there's there's a
mismatch right there and the other thing is that people can look for is does your dentist do testing
for your pockets so where they they usually there's one or two people they're often I'm a hygienist
and assistant where they'll kind of go through and they'll measure your pockets between your
tooth and your gum and they'll call out numbers like one three five things like that if they're
doing that and they at least understand the basics that that's an important thing to keep control of
and and they're doing it so and so if the practice isn't doing the it's called periotrading that and
that's kind of another indicator that that it's not so much a complete health type practice great
good to know I don't want to be I don't want to because there's a lot of great dentists that if you
if you need a root canal they do a great job at or a crown or whatever but it's just it's the it's
the acceptance of disease that to no fault of their own they just don't understand our world
and how much problems it can cause even if they don't even if it's not bothering the patient
yeah we want to get proactive particularly if someone already has symptoms of cognitive decline
or maybe even when they have genetics that can predispose them or family history that can predispose
them and as you've made a really phenomenal point that same thing with heart disease if you have a
family history or genetic or labs that might indicate that there's some sort of cardiac risk
making the dentist a priority making dental hygiene a priority doing whatever the dentist is
recommending getting that done it starts to be really high on the list of places to put your
resources and put your time so that's that's where we kind of bring us right back to the beginning
where it is a significant the mouth those three areas the bacteria from root canals and gum
problems the airway problems and toxicities like amalgams there are root cause of a lot of things
and the big three I mean three biggies of cardiovascular disease dementia and even cancer
there's a lot especially that P. gingivalis's pancreatic cancer esophageal cancer are definitely
a connection between the mouth and those cancers and I would imagine mental health as well
certainly with the mercury so yeah lots of connections here well two out of two doctors
recommend you go see your dentist absolutely
dentists who are watching out there I encourage you to learn more about this
and consider getting certified in in the whole process too because it's honestly it's so much
fun collaborating with dentists to understand and the dentists who are looking to collaborate with
physicians there are lots of us out there who want to work with you so I really do encourage the
dentists who are watching to to really go learn more about it and Dr. Bredesen's Apollo health
site there's you can find out how to learn more about it I feel so fortunate to have a few really
phenomenal dentists who are thinking this way in San Diego and so we chat frequently about
patients and collaborate and it is it is a lot of fun I know several in San Diego we may know
probably know the same ones yeah I really feel fortunate to be in a community that has that
resource because I don't have to skip a beat saying this is the dentist go see them they're
close to you I trust them they're going to give you good advice and that that's just so reassuring
Dr. Wendy thank you so much for being with us I want to make sure that everyone knows
where they can find out more about you particularly our east coast patients but also online so
share with our listeners and how they can get a hold of you yeah by practices revolutionary
health services again I'm just outside of Philly and it's rhslivewell.com
rha like revolutionary health services livewell.com so kind of the whole approach is it's a
preventive at the core with the with the recode at the as the really gratifying opportunities that
we have and just to be clear I because I know you outside of just this conversation you do whole
health medicine yourself and not just focusing on oral health but in in this context oh yeah
I'm a physician you are a physician who can help I just got rocket-shipped into the dental
industry but no I'm I'm a family physician uh practice so yeah no I'm a physician at the core
and then people have asked me did you did you wish you went to dental school because I talks
it's like no I just never had any idea how important it was and I want to tell the world
because it's really important our dental colleagues are critical so you are making that
connection and you have the the full suite of medical care available so Dr. Whitney thank you
again my pleasure my pleasure what a great interview that was with Dr. Whitney he does such a great
job describing the connection between the health in our mouth and gums and the health of our brain
our final speaker today is Dr. Thomas Lewis Dr. Lewis is a medical scientist with advanced
degrees from MIT in the Harvard School of Public Health the key area of Dr. Lewis's work is in
chronic infection and it's relevance to chronic diseases like Alzheimer's Dr. Lewis reveals some
surprising early warning signs for Alzheimer's which organ is the window to your brain health
plus he'll talk about a specific type of oil that can help prevent cognitive decline
additionally please make sure to share this by clicking the button below the video

Dr. Thomas Lewis welcome to the show thank you so much Heather pleasure to be here
I am so thrilled to get into this with you because I have a patient who's been seeing you
and is getting really great results so I'm um that is why I've invited you is because I think
everyone should know about the role of infections and also some very cutting-edge testing so that
we can understand these a little bit better and also go ahead and treat it and get those
results that we're looking for that we so desperately need so how did you become interested in
dementia and Alzheimer's what's your personal story that's a great question I was interested
in Alzheimer's about 30 years ago and then coincidentally my dad came down with it shortly
thereafter he was doing some very bizarre things you wouldn't have wouldn't have expected him to do
but when we realized he had something going on in his brain he actually died of disease 19 years ago
but 18 years ago I met a gentleman at Harvard an ophthalmologist of all things who really
really illuminated what goes on in Alzheimer's to me because he was reversing this disease
in people and I mean reversing it 20 30 years ago and very profoundly but he had to do it very
quietly because his wife Xena would tell me you know Clem is 40 years ahead of his time
unfortunately I think he's even more ahead of his time than that so when I when I saw what he could do
it was life changing for me and I knew I had to take on that mission because he was just working
as a humble clinician of ophthalmology at Harvard and I knew it had to go beyond that
wow and so the eye tell me a little bit more about how the eye is directly related to Alzheimer's
and neurodegeneration well you know I have a couple props for you and you know I think the
key one is by a chair professor at Harvard if you know you know you as an assistant professor
associate a full professor than a chair professor the fancy one so this is John Dowling and he wrote
this book called the it's really a textbook the retina the approachable part of the brain but really
the the retina is an outcropping of the brain it is part of the brain and so very often what's
going on in your eye portends or is exactly the same as what's going on in your brain and what
you can see when you look at good studies something like glaucoma which some researchers
call glaucoma is Alzheimer's of the eye and Alzheimer's is glaucoma the brain they're the
exact same pathology and physiological under antecedents that lead to this disease but see
glaucoma will show up 10 or 20 years earlier and that was my dad's case he had glaucoma first
before we even had any clue or even the mildest cognitive impairment and the beautiful thing
about the eye is that you know you don't have to cut a hole in your skull to see what's going on the
instrumentation that optometrists and ophthalmologists have to analyze disease is so superior
to whatever anybody else is doing I'll give you a simple example OCT optical coherence tomography
tomography is the key word it's an instrument that makes three-dimensional imaging sort of like
an ultrasound or an MRI but OCT has much better resolution than MRI so when a neurologist looks
at the brain with MRI and they say yeah a little loss of mass but really can't see anything probably
not much going on OCT can measure thickness and volume of your retinal ganglial cells which again
are a surrogate for your brain down to the microns and we can we can see the changes very
accurately with this technique and it's not invasive and it's low you know very low cost I mean
pennies compared to an MRI and so could a patient who's curious or wondering maybe even someone
who's pre-symptomatic doesn't have symptoms of dementia yet but curious if there are changes
in the brain happening could they just go in to an ophthalmologist and get this test so I actually
recommend an optometrist and I have a network of optometrists they don't work with four me but
there's groups that do higher level training in optometry and the reason why I stare you towards
optometry rather than ophthalmology ophthalmologists are actually even though they're MDs they're
actually following the surgery so they tend to want to do aggressive treatments and I don't want
them to do that I want to just do an analysis so I'm probably one of the I might be the only person
in the world that's regularly doing eye evaluations I have a very simple thing you
you order an eye eye to brain test with me and I give you a link to a couple of the optometry
associations I send you there with a form and I do the following do not tell your optometrist
you're going to get evaluated for Alzheimer's all I want them to do is do a complete eye exam
looking at very well known um disease dates and pathologies cataracts you know cataract is the
number one surgeon in the world a certain type of cataract portends Alzheimer's and that's not me
that's Rudy Dr. Rudy Tansy chaired professor of neurology at Harvard who's higher than him
wrote a paper in 2003 how super nuclear or cortical cataracts are the exact same pathology
as the 142 beta amyloid plaque in the brain of Alzheimer's patients now optometrist and even
ophthalmologist general generally ignore cortical cataracts because they don't affect central vision
so they're just observed in the standard of care and the next test is macular degeneration
very common test fundus camera looking for something that uh Don Anderson at a UC
center barber has been studying most of his life called drusen drusen a little yellow globules that
show right up in a fundus camera view and these little yellow globules contain the same path same
protein they call it a misfolded protein but that's a misnomer it's actually all these amyloids are
actually part of your innate immune system that's trying to protect you against something
underlying that's causing deterioration mainly to your vascular the vascular term it's you know
a little known is that you have to have a capillary within three cell diameters of any living cell
so think about a little teeny vessel and it starts getting diseased and now your four
cell diameters away from that capillary well that retinal ganglial cell four cells away
is struggling if not dying so you know macular degeneration is a vascular disease but it will
affect the nervous tissue and then the last one is really just looking for a glaucoma screening
they'll do pressure and that's mainly what ophthalmology and optometry does it's a disease of
pressure quote unquote it really isn't it's a disease of inflammation pressure goes up with
inflammation but really what we see in this tomography system similar to MRI but much more
precise is we can measure the thickness and volume of the retinal ganglial cell tissue called your
retinal nerve fibro layer with great great precision and the beautiful thing about that test if I take
a 20 year old and an 80 year old that the test is normalized to your age so you're really seeing
how you compare to your your age cohorts and I think we're we should have published a paper a
while ago but I'm not really a researcher I'm more a translator I help I like working with people but
we we show that we can actually restore nervous tissue okay we can rebuild that tissue and it's
not a guess OCT is so precise we can measure it accurately imagine if you had you know a set of
calipers and you could see this tissue it's here now it's here and and this is the kind of thing
that's really profound in terms of neurodegeneration can you rebuild tissue and that is that's the
that's the challenge we all face and really I look at it as a three-legged stool to accomplish that
yeah so go into that what is that three-legged school stool how do we
rebuild neurodegenerate to degenerate in tissue and do you see clinical results so do people's
symptoms track the changes that you're measuring oh yeah we you know because it's easy to do we run
the mini mental test it's a very simple test everybody should score 30 one of my most recent
patients we retested them very recently went from the 17 to 25 and his retina is showing a 2%
increase in thickness as he's aging normally you'd expect a 2% decline so that's that's really
critical so you know we can we can definitely see these things I know the Bredesen protocol
uses CNS vital signs a much more accurate characterization of brain and brain function
cognitive function motor function from the brain all that stuff but at the end of the day
what myself and my partner in crime and this functional doctor Dr. Michael Carter and I do
is we look at disease particularly chronic diseases you know in the healthcare system
is the code book for the doctors right it's the ICD-10 69,000 diagnostic codes for diseases
in our world there are four mechanisms okay and they apply equally as well to diabetes
cataract Alzheimer's autism it doesn't matter and the first one is poor repair and recovery
if you're eating if you're not eating well or more importantly if you're not digesting well
because you are what you absorb not what you eat that's the first that's the first place to start
I was in line this morning at a store and there was a gentleman in front of me and I was coming
it was rail thin and I just made conversation because he had a really dark tan he said well
my skin is like onion paper and if I press on it I bruise easily
he doesn't it's not the bruising it's the fact that over time his repair and recovery pathways
are in the toilet so yeah you know his all his tissue is on the edge of of giving in
and the brain and the eye are really good it's a really good place to study because
your brain is 10 times more metabolic than any other tissue Dr. Sennhoff talks about this but
it's well published you know 25 percent of the oxygenated blood that leaves your heart
is going to your brain yet your brain is only two and a half percent the mass of your body
so it's 10 times it's using 10 times more oxygen that means it's working 10 times harder
now if you did this with a weight all day long and work that bicep all day long that bicep would get
tired your brain's the same thing now the only thing that's more metabolically active than your
brain guess what is your eye the eye is teeny but in terms of vessel density there's nothing denser
so if your repair and recovery pathways are are not good these highly metabolic tissues
retina eye brain are going to suffer so that's the first place to start and that's easy the next
thing is food sensitivities or sensitivities in general the third is you know are you always in
a fight or flight mode if you're out your cortisol is always up you're always stressed you're not
sleeping well guess what it's going to affect your repair and recovery pathways and you sleep for
your brain and your eyes once again your biceps not tired most people's biceps not tired but your
brain and your eyes never shut off okay so you've got to rest for them and then the fourth thing is
what I call chronic toxicity but chronic infection is the biggest part of that because
you can you can identify you've been exposed to lead or something like that and you can detoxify
and you can chelate out the lead but when an infection takes hold two important things it can
replicate and grow inside you without further exposure and and secondly it it can wind up in
tissue in very localized tissue rather than being systemic so it can be in the campus it can be in
the retina it can be in the joint for arthritis so this is where the science and art of diagnostic
comes in because you look at all the blood you have in your body yet you only have this small
piece of tissue that's infected that your immune system is chasing down and so your labs may not
go up but by a pittance yet you have a very severe infectious insidious infectious process going on
in a very small amount of tissue that can have a profound effect on your health eyesight cognitive
function things of that nature so this is this is where testing really becomes well I like to
think we've made it very scientific do I dare go into that now well and I it sounds like it so
say what you mean by that what do you mean by you like to think you've made it very scientific
so if you look at lab tests online and you and you see what the normal reference ranges or
reference intervals you'll get from lab core and quest ranges like this and they're really
looking for acute disease are you sick do you need to see a doctor or specialist right now
so it's unscientific and I was just in doctor Trump's office this had to be 15 years ago and he
goes tom the only thing that really matters is mortality and more specifically early mortality
okay and there's a lot of misinformation about longevity where national geographic did a great
study in 2013 the title of the article is called 100 candles people live to 100 and what they showed
is if you live to 100 you have nine years of declining health and everything is an asymptote
it's like this so you actually the nine years you know a lot of those years are still pretty good
if you live to 80 you have 19 years of declining health so what we did is it okay
mortality or early mortality is an endpoint published in many medical scientific papers
so what we did is we looked at things like C-reactive protein white blood cell counts
nucleophilic lymphocyte ratio fibrinogen erythrocyte sedimentation rate and looked at where
good studies could show that these markers showed the first increase in mortality and the simplest
one is white blood cell counts a white blood cell count is so inexpensive now this is a Harvard
study just to give you an example Harvard study they oversaw the women's health initiative 138
thousand women that they studied prospectively what that means is they measured these women very
accurately in many many many centers and then follow them and see what happened to them and you
know they measured who died and whatnot their ages and all that but what they showed when they
started extracting the data is if you have two groups of women one with a white blood cell count
are 4700 and another group with 6700 now keep in mind the reference interval for white blood cells
are like 3500 to 10800 so we're talking two sets of women very very much normal the doctor would
look at them say labs are fine so they followed them for six years and the women at 6700 died at
twice the rate as the women at 4700 so why wouldn't you tell someone at 6700 that you have greater risk
why wait till 10800 so we built an entire scale on this early mortality and since every marker we
use titrates the exact same endpoint early mortality we amalgamate this and we use 21 markers
it's applicable to Alzheimer's or arthritis or whatever but it's all inflammatory immune health
markers clotting markers things like that that all you know we're all connected and so we create a
risk score we call your chronic disease temperature based on these 21 markers so we're able to really
tell if someone's getting better by not looking at a plethora of individual labs we can look at a
single score to tell whether someone's heading in the right direction physiologically or not
and then of course we do dive down into each marker and help them understand what the risk factors
for each marker is but you know Heather you're not a I know you very little right now we just met
but there's a story behind you and we say there's the same thing about your labs it's not oh
your your a1c is this and and then your lipids are this no what we try to do is we try to build a
story around all the labs to help you really understand your health now how infection comes
into this is that the difference between someone with a 4700 and a 6700 which in the standard of
care is no difference is almost always some type of chronic infectious process and how we glean what
it is is with another test that comes out of a complete blood count with differential once again
one of the most expensive inexpensive tests you can order and it's a neutrophil to lymphocyte
ratio so neutrophil is a type of white blood cell usually goes up with bacteria and lymphocyte is a
type of white blood cell it either goes up or down with viruses and so when the neutrophil
to lymphocyte ratio goes up we can kind of tell what kind of pathogen may be affecting that individual
and then of course we test for them and have treatment protocols for a specific pathogen but
it's not it's not a whole lot unlike Lyme you know chris christophus and was diagnosed with
Alzheimer's like eight years ago and headlines chris christophus and has Alzheimer's unlike two
years later he came out no no these are the headlines and you know popular media no he
doesn't have Alzheimer's he has Lyme disease what's the difference the pathology is unmistakably
Alzheimer's but they actually found the cause in this case Borrelia bordophora infection or maybe
colon factions that go along with Lyme disease so this is incredible that it sounds like you're
saying the you know the eyes of the window to disease and so if you can find these markers in
the eye a very simply relatively affordably you can also find markers in of cbc or a complete
blood count that's again very affordable very simple so if we find these markers for disease
then what how do we so you know when you look at we we believe and don't believe everybody lies on
a health disease continuum and that's your overall continuum but there are continuance
underneath that so the eye helps us understand where you stand on the pathology continuum
that's closest to disease because it's actual tissue changes then backing up a little bit
to earlier in life you have a physiological continuum that's our chronic disease temperature
at the end of the day it's all about risk factors what are those risk factors you know
do you have GERD do you have a thyroid issue you have energy issues do you have poor sleep
this is where you really get into coming up with some basic protocols but I will tell you
when someone has a subacute or chronic infection then we have to get much more aggressive
at treatment supplements lifestyle changes intermittent fasting helps in repair and recovery
but we even go so far as going into pharmaceutical treatments what we do what we generally do with
an individual let's say we have an Alzheimer's sufferer what we'll generally do is do a complete
work up very detailed risk assessment we've digitized our risk assessment and give a score
very detailed physiological assessment the eye test to corroborate there's some neurodegeneration
process going on and then we're going to really dive into dive into those risk factors and start
ameliorating the low hanging the fruit the simple risk factors so what we're going to do is we're
going to do at least six months of pre-treatment going to be coaching nutritional guidance
supplementation things of that nature working on improving their physiological score
then if we've done the testing already or if we decide to do the infectious testing
then it's when we're going to we're going to pull out the guns to do
some more aggressive treatments unfortunately a lot of the functional treatments
aren't that effective and it's very very explainable there's a MD research out of Vanderbilt
Charles Stratton who's written some papers and patents that explains that these organisms that
are stealth and chronic not like you have staff or the flu you know you feel sick they're insidious
that they can live in three different forms a couple of which are completely hidden from the
immune system and their quasi dormant you know like everybody knows chickenpox you can get shingles
later in life that is not the only organism that can go stealth and come back to play opportunistically
but see the problem is and what what dr. Ewald pull up another prop but anybody's really interested
in this topic can read this book plague time it's all about really the modern germ theory
is that the biggest problem with with subacute or chronic infections is what's called crypticity
and what that means is you know someone at covid you were with them you get covid
you know you got you got covid but with chronic diseases and chronic infections that often cause
this you have no clue as to when you might have been exposed and you might have been exposed
pre-birth might be a congenital infection a lot of times that happens epsi you know
chickenpox that's a congenital infection there are many other congenital infections myself I had
a fib I titrated it back to Lyme disease a bit by ticks many many times I had a perfect storm of
of health issues in my 40s you know stress and over exercising and then getting sick and this
perfect storm and Lyme disease came back out to play and it almost always affects the vessels
we say it's arthritis but it's really the vessels in the joint we say it's Alzheimer's but it's
really the vessels in the brain we say it's glaucoma or macular disease but it's really the
microvessel the capillaries in that tissue that's causing this disease and these infectious
species are like vampires with your blood yeah this is a great theme you know making sure there's
enough circulation for anyone who's listening that's really curious about circulation and
making sure you're getting enough oxygen nutrients delivery of everything that's necessary for a cell
to to function not just optimally but to function at all Dr. Mark's or excuse me Mark's with
his conversation with me as it goes into a lot of detail about that but I want to come back Dr.
Lewis to what you mentioned about the white blood cell count so this is a very common marker and I
had imagined many of our listeners are going to go back to their labs and say what was my white blood
cell count am I going to die soon and as from a clinical perspective what I see a lot of are
low white blood cell counts and those I have come to think of as a marker for a chronic infection
so can you help me kind of square that circle because you're telling me that it is a high white
blood cell count no it can be low on you know if you you know for COVID mass general the Chinese
a lot of others have caught on to this they're looking for lymphocytopenia so low lymphocyte
counts and if your neutrophils are normal because you don't have a bacterial thing going on everything's
copacetic there then when your lymphocytes are lowered by the virus then your white blood cell
total comes comes down there's no question about it I think the IFM and others are very good with
the antiviral protocol with quercetin zinc vitamin D you know the usual NAC the usual suspects high
dose vitamin C dr. Levy all those things and ivermectin is now shown to be extraordinarily
antiviral at first it was thought to be just an antiparasitic but you know frontline critical
care doctors are leveraging that information that was published really I'm not sure how far it goes
back but the papers I were I was reading when COVID came out on ivermectin we're like 20 years ago
we're showing its broad spectrum antiviral properties so yeah if you're below our range you
know the standard of care of 3500 to 10800 or 900 and they change they usually get broader not now
or unless they want to you know prescribe you a drug then they'll narrow that range you can prescribe
it more but really your optimal range for a white blood cell count is 4 000 to 5800 okay
but then then you got to look at the ratios because if lymphocytes go down and neutrophils go up
your total white blood cell count still looks normal but your lymphocytes are low okay that's why
I use the neutrophil the lymphocyte ratio so when a white blood cell count is normal but I know there's
something going on because the person tells me this they have arthritis they have brain fog
they have whatever then I look at the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and then look at the individual
like if your neutrophil percent is above 58 percent something's going on if your lymphocytes
are below a thousand something's going on and it's not and it's usually you know a low grade
but the thing is Heather I do this for my participants this is the standard of care
I take this pen and I stab the back of my hand and it's bloody bruised and it's nasty that's like
my labs won't weigh up okay but in chronic disease all I'm doing is just rubbing gently
so how does this look in two months it looks healed if I'm rubbing 24 seven for two months
this is going to be raw and bloody and I'm probably to the bone this is what chronic disease is all
about but see the pressure I put on is sort of a reflection of how high the labs go I don't have to
go very high to keep building like I'm not putting more pressure on at the end of two months a
matter of fact I'm putting less pressure on yet it's still a nasty wound so in kind of bringing
this back to dementia I appreciate that analogy because I think that really well illustrates
the difference between chronic versus acute disease and conventional medicine and really our
society is set up as a whole to think about acute disease really pretty well you know I think they
do a good job but when it comes to chronic infections we only have soaring rates of incidence
and so many people suffering without a ton of hope so I'm excited to you know have you continue
sharing with our our listeners what kinds of things they can be looking at so what states of health
and particular pathogens make people most vulnerable to early Alzheimer's well you know I think
Dr. Trump and I wrote a my mentor wrote a paper that was published in Frontier's Neuroscience
Aging called it's never too early and it's never too late to end the epidemic of Alzheimer's
starting at pre-birth to you know when you actually have a disease depression is an early
wanting sign for Alzheimer's people think that you know Alzheimer's patients get depressed actually
that's really not the case it's that they had depression first and then they migrate into
Alzheimer's any inflammatory markers a risk factor for future Alzheimer's so you know you're
going to be really you got to look at the brain as not being separate from the rest of the body
and then any ill health that you have if it stays consistent even low grade will can eventually
manifest in the brain because the brain is so um you know it's so vascular so it's it's it's
breaking down and building up all the time let me just go over the three legs of the stool so the
first one's repair and recovery we talked about that a little bit um nutrients and good absorption
the second one is really the inflammation which inflammation is a treasure if you have
inflammation something's causing it okay and that's where we get to look at the chronic infection
and you know the work of tansy saying that you know these cortical cataracts which are the
Alzheimer's cataracts that protein that is the cataract is actually an antimicrobial peptide
he published that information in PLOS in 2010 so the amyloid which has been the target of the
pharmaceutical industry in Alzheimer's for 30 years is actually trying to protect you as part of
your native immune response but the brain is a little bit different than other parts of the
body in this respect and i'm a hockey player so i follow hockey players that had concussions and
some of them they get concussed and they can't get back into the game you know so what i like to
say is like you slam into the boards with your elbow and your head and about the same force
well your elbow is probably okay to go in in a in a couple weeks or a month but sometimes your
brain's not good to go for a year and and the issue is this brilliant paper by two Australians
published in 2017 i'll read the title just for he has but it's called the the meteorology of cytokine
storms and the clinical usefulness of this knowledge and then the key part of this paper that really
helps understand it is how persistent cytokine storms with just inflammatory markers elevated
white blood cells elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio elevated uric acid suppressed white blood
cell counts to your point as well c-reactive protein homocysteine fibrinogen usual suspects
but persistent cytokine storms in the ill brain so there's something special like
someone gets traumatic brain injury and they're a vegetable but if they if they bang their hip
their hip's going to recover there's something unique about it and i was just on a call with an
md one hour ago we were just musing over this because she's worried about her mother and all
this good stuff and i think that we're just set up we're more vulnerable today for brain
inflammation because we are eating an inflammatory diet most of our population the omega six the
bad fats too many carbs we're afraid of fish because of mercury but i'm i'm convinced that it's
the omega threes and other in fish and other anti-inflammatory foods that you have to have
present all the time so when an event like a traumatic brain event occurs or something like
Alzheimer's you're there to quell the inflammatory storm in your brain and then the other paper i'm
just looking off to my other screen but it's really important we wrote dr. tremp and i wrote
this in our Alzheimer's book at the title of the paper by two Stanford researchers three of them
pardon me inflammatory blockade restores adult hippocampal neurogenesis so what i did in the
paper and the book really is broke that paper down and put it into layperson's language and i'll
just break the title down in front inflammatory blockade in other words you're stopping inflammation
that could be stopping the infection anti-inflammatory diet you know things of that nature restores
adult adult hippocampal brain neuro neuron genesis genesis the genesis of new neurons
your brain is like humans we don't send babies to war babies or stem cells your brain doesn't
activate stem cell activity when your brain is under an inflammatory assault so the only
pathway you have is degeneration so you know good nutrition identifying and stopping the
source the infection for example but then you've got it down regulate inflammation you know it's
just like in COVID they say the cytokine storm kills you it's a combination you know it's a
chicken and the egg but let's say the infection's gone if the cytokines are up at a certain level
you've gone over the hump and there's no there's no going back and in the brain it's the same thing
but it's not so dramatic as it is in say something like COVID-19 right so this is a very hopeful
message um i'm curious because there's a greater understanding and also it's very consistent you
know with what we hear from Dr. Bredesen that it's a multifactorial multifocal um landscape of i'm
starting to think of it as the dementia verse right this universe of dementia and and there's
a problem scape or there's a landscape where by which someone can come to dementia and come to
have dementia and how we unravel that is not going to be a one-size-fits-all here's a drug
whether it's an eye or a pill or what what have you it's not going to look like that it's going to
look like assessing in a much more holistic view what all is going on and then plugging the holes
or you know there's lots of different analogies that are used for this but basically making sure
that all of the things that are influencing poor health are addressed even if we've come to think
of them as being pretty removed from dementia things like dental work or like you've mentioned
eye health joint health all of these things are clues that there might be something out of balance
that's contributing to that dementia so i'm curious what in in your uh from your perspective what the
treatments look like for Alzheimer's i think i'm sort of alluding to what i'm hoping you'll say
and then why why so many have failed you know why they've failed if you look at farmer because
they've gone after the wrong target and you know the next big thing five or five or eight years ago
was the uh hyperphosphorylation of tau and uh but we wrote in our book in 2011 those are going to
fail and they did because you know it Alzheimer's is is really a hypoxic state lack of oxygen state
as you have learned to heather um in tissue in this case in the brain and it's interesting that
animals that hibernate hyperphosphorylate their tau and when they come out of hibernation they
dehyperphosphorylate it so hyperphosphorylated tau is obviously some sort of a hypoxic protective
mechanism that's why those have failed the amyloid antimicrobial peptide is elucidated by
harbing so there's an infectious process going on that's why those failed now i don't claim to
say that treating an Alzheimer's sufferer is an easy task when they're already in a
state of cognitive impairment because you know if you go to mass general and get an MRI with
mild cognitive impairment you already have 17% brain shrinkage the process is already ongoing
so you know what what we do is is you know dr bernison's wife's a functional doctor really that
his book is all about functional medicine extraordinarily important start with a mouth
i think it's overlooked oral DNA tests we do that cone beam looking for cavitations where you've
had wisdom teeth looking for pockets root canals have got to go you know i know it's an emotional
and structural issue but the oral DNA test or other tests for oral pathogens are extremely
important and there's things you can do in the oral cavity we blog on this all the time we're
fanatical about you know something as simple as do you clean your toothbrush after you pull
pathogens onto your toothbrush before you brush the next time and you reintroduce them
you know it gets that basic but you know i recommend you like put it in hydrogen peroxide
or like what do you do anything you know i'm i'm a lazy chemist and so i just have a a glass of
salt water and there's salt at the bottom that means the solution above is completely saturated
it's like the great salt lake or the dead sea nothing lives in it and i actually had one of my
participants is a ventilation engineer and he tested this and he found no pathogens so i just
throw my toothbrush back into um the salt water every night you know when it softens the toothbrush
so i'm not a brushing aggressively but i think water flossing is more important now you know you
you're here at tom levy talk about hydrogen peroxide and you have an oral microbiome so what
i do with the i actually use povidone iodine i i'll do an iodine water floss just once a week
you know just once a week to keep things down but gut so many people don't appreciate the gut
continuum they say oh a little constipation once in a while you know on the continuum
we're just symptoms emerge like in diabetes we have a little bit better understanding of
continuum than anyone see at 6.4 than at 6.5 you're diabetic well you're way up the continuum already
before conventional medicine diagnoses you with a condition i would argue that in gut
if you are not completely regular you are in the middle of that continuum and you have work to do
we we blogged a husband and wife team out of stanford showed very clearly that over generations
we've lost at least 50 of diversity of our microbiome and that's what's doing all the work
in our immune system breaking down foods um minerals are the hardest to absorb you've got to
have strong acids if you're ever on a tums or even have a even if you well i only have reflux
when i have a mexican food no you're up on the reflux continuum you are not optimal we need to
move you back down if you're talking about something as serious as a brain disease thyroid
things of things of that nature but sleep hygiene these are the basic things but at the end of the
day i i truly hard of hard and my research shows it that these subacute infections have taken hold
so now we have to get it aggressive with really strong supplementation you know the
oregano oils the biosidens the herbals the medicinals um when i when i did a study in a
corporation i had a hundred people that i had carte carte blanche to do any test that i want
and i showed that when they had they had every kind of condition their every age
from polychondritis to Parkinson's and when they had a chronic bacterial infection
they had comorbid virals so everybody should be on a viral protocol everybody and what does
the viral protocol look like to you so a viral viral protocol is periodically doing the tom
levy high dose vitamin c recommendations and other people's recommendations doing quercetin
and zinc if you don't do it every day all the time then you do a month long type protocol
vitamin d you need to be up at 55 80 nanograms per milliliter you know you need to get that up
as well i i recommend prophylactic and talk with um you know mark hyman's old partner back at
kenyer at ranch market with owners we heard at a round table we all agreed that we would do an
antiparasitic cleanse every five years or so and you know the herbals work but ivermectin is
is superior and now we know it's antiviral so prophylactically do some ivermectin um
you know and what i recommend is not the antiparasitic you know two doses you do five or six doses
and then every other week for a year and you know you you check your white blood cell counts though
and see if see if they're coming up to the right level um so that's really what we're doing medicinal
mushrooms dr austin on my team is an expert he goes out foraging for mushrooms fungi every weekend
and so he has a variety of medicinal concoctions of the mushroom ilk and ifm included that in their
list of of antiviral protocols but i tell you that the single thing that i'm bullish on and
dr carter and i created a very lengthy video on this is cod liver oil and i was on mccole and
mccole and i debated this a little bit but i'm not gonna you know i i hail to uh to joe so it's
like i let that slide but give you an example in 1848 in british hospitals it was an epidemic of
consumption which is tuberculosis so bad they're coughing up blood they're on death's door
and giving high-dose cod liver oil with the vitamin a the vitamin d and other fat soluble
nutrients that fish oil doesn't have and cruel oil doesn't have reduced mortality by 50 percent
and you know it's it's well it's it's well published and we have it on our on our youtube
channel a healthy viable partners so you know it's it's very profound what cod liver oil can do
and if you worry about cod liver oil what i do is i do a simple thing same thing i do at probiotics
i rotate them you know western a price foundation i think that the brand is rosita then there's
green pastures then there's carlson's then there's nordic naturals and there's um garden of life
so all i do is i i have one of each and i just rotate through them and my secret number
based on thomas prospels work in famous physician from um britain in the 1800s is 15 grams a day
that's 15 capsules and nobody wants to take 15 peltz so i take half a shot glass of cod liver oil
and just shoot it every evening me i eat a lot of fish so i don't i may be lying if i say i
do it every evening but you know i i mean i'll eat fish twice today so um you know i feel like
my my brain anti-inflammatory terrain is consistent as well established and consistently
refurbished and i think that's that's the thing you know chronic disease i say it's all about
knowledge and consistency and and my biggest problem is is denial when they when someone says
ah i just have a little of this no it's not a little it's real in the traditional medical world
it's just a little bit though write it off say you're paranoid or it's nothing but in the functional
world we need to we need to express to people that the mildest of symptoms if it wasn't a one off
even if it's monthly you are not optimal in today's toxic world you only have one choice
to stave off chronic disease and live to a hundred and fall off the cliff rather than sliding down
that slippery slope and that is you need to bring everything into optimal now i will i will tell you
that dr trump's protocol for glaucoma and olesheimers which we use now and dr carter on my team is
reticent to do this so he'll do a more fully functional approach but we use antibiotics
and i mentioned earlier that a lot of functional treatments don't work why even ken star i think
he's a brilliant doctor he has the highest pressure hyperbaric oxygen chamber in the country
but these organisms in their stealth phase are refractory to that so you have to treat these
organisms long term because yeah that may be 10 active the other 90 percent are hiding
and they're waiting to come out when they see an opportunistic moment so if you keep a pharmacologically
relevant dosage of whatever your anti-infective is that's what you must do so if you get on the
brettison protocol or our protocol or a functional protocol and after four months you're saying i'm
not seeing results you got to stick with it it's the only way to overcome these chronic things
a few things have come on quickly and if you don't die from they go away quickly chronic
things come on slowly and they hang in there i try to explain that in nature everything follows an
asymptote what i mean by that is we're hardwired to say if i do one thing i get results and i
could do this thing i get another result but in fact everything follows a bell curve so you
going into disease oh i feel pretty good i feel pretty good and then all of a sudden you hit
this inflection the bell curve and then you feel crappy but it matriculated for 10 years 20 years
getting out of it's the same thing oh i don't see any results doc i don't see any i don't see any
results you we find that the it's at least five months to a true health inflection okay and i see
so many people it's like oh that functional doc didn't work we now i'm trying this functional
doc no you didn't you gotta give them you gotta give chronic protocols a chance to take hold
that's what are the what are the big pathogens that you think i know you you mentioned chlamydia
pneumonia and periodontal pathogens this is like pijenta vallis are there others that really stand
out yeah well i think you know Lyme disease and all the co-infections uh Bartonella or Lickia
things of that nature babesia we we look at um you know there's so there's so many comorbidities
so we look at what i call the usual suspects of chlamydia pneumoniae mycoplasma pneumoniae
we look at age pylori in the blood not the stool because it will disrupt the gut which
then affects the brain the enteric nervous system we'll look at rickettsial disease rickettsial
typhi rickettsial rickettsia rickettsial cornei um rocky mountain spotted fever and much more
common than people think i was doing testing up at a company in um indiana i live in tennessee
and the tennessee department of health called me up because someone in indiana was positive
of rocky mountain spotted fever and you know but i i tried to explain to the health department
it's like the reason why you're not seeing a lot of rocky mountain spotted fever is who's testing for
it right i mean have you had a rocky mountain spotted fever test no i've never been tested
for that most people have not exactly exactly and then the other thing is everybody will
tell you you know you do a food sensitivity test it's i gg then when an i gg test for
chlamydia pneumoniae comes back elevated every doctor in the world will tell you that's a
historic infection no it's a stealth infection it's a it's a a reticulate body infection it's
inside the cell in a biofilm infection and you know ewald talks about this and you know there's
coax coax postulates for tech testing for pathogenicity but the chronic infections
do not comply with coax i mean he was back in the 1800s brilliant guy he was you know trend
setting in terms of this but you can't culture chlamydia pneumonia right so it right away coax
postulates have thrown off but when we treat and just test i gg and the i gg is up first of all why
is it considered elevated even by lab core okay then we treat it goes down if it was historic
why would treatment knock down the i gg tighter so let's talk a little bit about this because
there is an alternative explanation right that that it is a resolved infection and that this is
a representation of your immune memory this is like what might happen after a vaccination
that your i gg would be elevated i gm would be normal so what you're suggesting is that there's
a different explanation never that is not true i will stand on that like what we better say 98
percent just because i'm sure there are circumstances but if the median pneumoniae
we'll just pick on that organism was positive i gm at one point we probably won't catch that
just because of the crypticity of the timing when you were exposed all that stuff
stratens work is beyond reproach these just like the herpes zoster can reactivate they live
intracelulally they are like hobos holding up where they can undiscovered waiting for an opportunity
no and there's no question i would like to ask any doctor that has
posited this that has a patient with an elevated i gg and treats them and the i gm is negative
and they have symptoms and the symptoms get better and the i gg come down to explain that to me
right there there's only so many there's only so many explanations you know i'll give you an
example so dr. tremp years and years ago told me this and i re i corroborated the research
so ophthalmologists and optometrists can see a toxoplasma toxoplasma gandia i forgot to mention
that very important intracellular parasite you know kitty litter worry about pregnant women being
exposed to it because toxoplasma gandia in the placenta can affect fetal brain development
well it can also affect brain development in an immunocompromised individual looks like
Alzheimer's but getting into the i gg i gm discussion so a toxo scar can show up in the
eye very characteristic doesn't always so it's not truly diagnostic for toxoplasma gandia
infection in the eye but it does is a signature so you run the labs i gg positive
i gm negative you can extract surgically extract that scar and put it in the culture and guess
what it grows toxoplasmosis wow so you know i i think sneaky sneaky i think what i you know i
run this health ministry and i always start off every session with where did you learn that
and so some things become urban legend or or just become part of our culture and we're not
questioning and titrating back so in this paper that i really need to publish but i haven't figured
out how because it's like 25 000 words and the reason why it's 25 000 words usually they don't
accept the 5 000 10 000 max maybe even 4 000 is because i need to explain i gg i gm before i can
go into this so i i have reference after reference after reference explaining that an i gg titer is
real okay and dr. trempin 2000 said i don't run i gm anymore it's a waste of my my patient's money
because a lot of times i can't justify insurance for these tests in guacamole or macules these
so that's why i stand on it a whole new way of thinking about it or maybe i guess um
i like to think that the well-meaning instructors that i had or who are pointing to this uh
interpretation um that there's probably some places where they're right right where there
there are times when when i gg represents what we've been trained and i gm represents a current
infection um but certainly this alternative explanation for it opens up a window where
people who aren't getting the help they need can be treated right and and it's using
readily available relatively inexpensive tools to test and i think that's one of the themes of
your your talk here is that there are readily available relatively inexpensive tools and if
we interpret them in a way that's helpful then and we use that to make decisions and and to
start treatment then we can get really amazing outcomes you can and i have videos posted that
i kind of hold close to the vest because a lot of people do not want their all-time videos but we
had an 84 gentleman there 84 year old gentleman there was nothing short of the vegetable that
we reversed so you know these are not these are not common things but once again a lot of people
don't have the staying power particularly older folks but let me give you one other food for thought
in terms of this whole i gg i gm thing when you die you are no longer exposed to the environments
so you no longer have exposure yet you start decomposing from within and what ewald says very
clearly in his book is they're already there he was making a different reference he's talking
about plagues and we've been exposed to everything so that's why he says this he didn't really say
this but i can you can infer from what he said that this sars-cov-2 is novel very novel because
we've been exposed to everything but the world is global but his points well taken they're already
within and so the difference between you decomposing when you die and you not now is that when you die
your immune system is zero so everything lying in weight now has nobody nothing holding them back
you know it's no different than the gut when you start losing stomach acid
all the pathogenic organisms start proliferating and the beneficial organisms
you know are flagging because they've adapted to strong acid right acid is certainly a line of
defense right necessary very necessary one dr. lewis it has been so insightful so wonderful to
have you i know you have so much more to share um but i do have to wrap up and i want to make
sure that everyone who is listening um and watching knows how to find out more from you
because there is you just have a wealth of information to share and again these alternative
kind of interpretations that they may have not seen elsewhere that i i think
something that will prevent suffering for many people so i'm really excited to get this information
out and want to make sure that uh i stop babbling in time for you to tell everyone where they can
learn more so we we run two websites but i really want people just to come to one we run two so
people don't get confused it's like oh i have Alzheimer's why am i going to work on a disease
site but our real site is health revival partners with an s healthy viable partners
and that's where you know you want to work with us and what i'd suggest is if you've been through
treatment with Alzheimer's and you haven't got the results you want i think i think we can
add some intel into that and the other thing is most importantly i want people to get pre-treated
before they have symptoms and that's where eye testing might be just the right thing to convince
them that there's a neurodegenerative process going on so once again this all happens on
healthrevivalpartners.com thank you so much super important especially not even maybe
pre-symptomatic but early symptoms right instead of oh yeah the earlier the better
yeah the earlier the better so if if there is a family history if there's any reason to think
that you might be predisposed towards dementia get this information sooner rather than later so
we can start acting now it is so much easier to prevent than to treat and certainly so much
easier to treat when it's early than when it's late stage so get the help that you need your
loved one needs visit dr lewis's website and quick look at the show notes it's also you'll be linked
and thank you so much for joining us thank you very much Anna what an incredible interview that
was with dr lewis we've learned that the eyes are the window to our brain health how important
cod liver oil is and some of the most important early warning signs of dementia so there you have
it that wraps up day one of the reverse Alzheimer's summit you've heard from visionary daniel schmartenberger
the brilliant dr dale brettison inspirational dr greg eckel and the intriguing science of
dr lewis and of course from my co-host dr patrick porter make sure that you tune in tomorrow because
we have another set of just as amazing speakers ready to share their expert insights and breakthroughs
with you on preventing and healing Alzheimer's if for any reason you feel you might miss any of
these inspirational and potentially life-saving interviews during the summit i do encourage
you to secure the lifetime access to the summit by purchasing the vip all access pass today that
way you won't miss anything and you can watch and listen to these interviews again and again at your
own pace i know i had to take out notes doing some of these interviews so that i could digest
and really have this information sink in you can order your vip all access pass by clicking the
button below this video before we wrap up don't forget to leave me your comments in the section
below and let me know what's inspired you the most about today's interviews your feedback is so
important to making this a successful event and also so that each year we can get you the best
information that's available and exactly what you want to hear thank you once again for joining us
in the reverse Alzheimer's summit please share this with your friends and family so we can all
work together in this pandemic once and for all we're all in this together let's learn and grow
and get better and better information out to those people who deserve it and need it so that
they don't have to suffer unnecessarily with dementia
