clue yeah that's such a simple test to know that something is going on and that you need to kind
of pick up that oral hygiene practice and actually just to talk about that for just a second too is
that the reason this is important from an Alzheimer's standpoint is they've actually found these
bacteria from the mouth in the brain of Alzheimer's patients I mean it's tough to get what's called
causation level evidence meaning cause effect in health most of what you and I recommend aren't
based on that there's causation level evidence for the back bacteria doing that and and also
people have to remember you can't just rely on your dental team doing it too that because those
back the when what happens is is that when they do their thing with their hygiene cleaning in the
office and you do your brushing flossing and maintenance at home you're breaking up that bio
film those those organisms want to hide behind in a foxhole I like to call it going back to my
military days they hide in a foxhole we have to break them out and and let them be exposed to death
otherwise they can cause problems well that biofilm starts to reconstitute itself within 24 to 48
hours of your hygiene cleaning it's correct back to baseline four weeks after your hygiene cleaning
so you cannot just rely on the hygiene team to do their job you've really got to do your job at home
too and some people think that there's well there is there's normal flora in the gut and in the mouth
so that normal flora should be there is that normal flora like say peach and devalus is the one that
we find in autopsy brains that have you know dementia is that normal flora or is that getting
overgrown or is it really just this this breakdown in the gum that makes it a problem it's
peach and devalus is probably present in just about everybody it is the bad boy of bad boys I
mean it's the of all the different bacteria we can look at and we do testing for that and in the way
I do the recode program that it's the one that drives all three of the above heart disease cancer
and dementia but anyway it's is it there in everybody probably but you want to keep it in
healthy gums where this biofilm is constantly disrupted it's not going to kind of grow so if
we just kind of keep it down to a dull roar and and keep those keep that fort knocks of a of a barrier
strong between letting those bacteria into the bloodstream then it's not going to wreak havoc
on you it's all it's all relative but yeah now so it's it's the and it's the peach and devalus
and the other what we call anaerobic the oxygen-hating bacteria they live deep in those pockets you
hear about people getting the dentists are measuring they live deep in those products
pockets they hate oxygen and and they're going to grow more and that's what causes the inflammation
so it's these bad bacteria colonization that drives the inflammation that drives disease so I
mean everything in life is good versus evil it's balanced so you really want to kill the bad and
promote the growth of the good so are there certain products I know Dr. Bedeson really likes
the dental side and toothpaste I also recommend that in my clinic is there are there a couple
things that are quick and easy to find that you would recommend your patients use so I have gotten
my education from my my dental advisors over the years as you can imagine I'm not a dentist I didn't
didn't say in the holiday and express either so but but I got my recommendation from so
I actually asked several dentists that told me the most important intervention they can do
for the health of their math is a sonic toothbrush because what the sonic toothbrush is it vibrates
it doesn't spin so when you brush or you use the spinning type of of disruption you're getting as
far as the bristles will go when you get that sonic vibration what it does is to break up the
biofilm two to three millimeters past the tips of the bristles so they say if there's any one thing
a person can do is just using a sonic toothbrush and what will be makes it sonic philips sonic here
those kind of things you may have heard of and the toothpaste there's a lot of debate on that in
turn I mean I'm not going to comment as a physician too much about that there's so many schools of
thought but basically one that causes the least irritation is kind of what I've kind of go by
just kind of a plain plain one whatever variety and then and then mouth rinses there's definitely
a role for mouth rinses there's a little bit of a there's a little bit of a debate on that but in
my world is watching it for 10 years now people in these very specific cardiovascular markers
getting better with the use of mouth rinses they will kill the bacteria and then so they'll kill a
lot of the bad guys they will kill some of the good good guys and there is some pretty good
consensus they should use kind mouth rinses without alcohol frankly I recommend alcohol
free listerine and another one called the closest CLOS they actually get a and I'm not sponsored by
them they they they they together get the floor the bad guys the best combination I think where I
have people use listerine after brushing in the morning and closest after brushing in the evening
and then this is where the dental team can come in is to consider the use of probiotics
so so there's all kinds of regimens out there and on the bottom line disclaimer is I don't know
your situation talk to your dental team and if it's a complete health dental team that knows that
mouth body combination real well that they they'll they'll advise you well on on what to do because
probiotics if you're going to kill the enemy you want to replace it with good bacteria so there
is a role for probiotic specific oral product the ones you take for your gut don't work for
their well it's not they don't work there's a different mix of good bacteria in the mouth than
there is in the lower gut and is there a role for oil pulling I would love to be sponsored by coconut
oil if anybody out there has a connection so I've never done it myself disclaimer uh people who do
it love it they're committed to it but I've had Dennis tell me that it does work it it does help
to kill the bad bacteria makes no doubt about it and but it can be cumbersome and complicated so
if people are motivated to do it it definitely is a valuable um intervention great great now
we've talked about the gums and that being an avenue for these bacteria to get into the blood
stream there's another then there's some controversy around this but it's a role of root canals versus
maybe implants or or even fillings how else can bacteria get into the blood stream so root canals
is a good good topic to talk about so that's exactly the same way so what we've been talking about
is gum bacteria the gap between your gum and your tooth so we have not yet even talked about a
tooth problem we've been talking about a gum problem back bad bacteria the gums so what happens
with the root canal as you get an infection within the tooth usually there's like a little crack in
the tooth where the bacteria make their way down and get at the base down into the root of the tooth
and drive an infection so again it's a bacterial infection typically it's an infectious process
that pulls infection at the base of the tooth and can get into the blood stream and if it gets bad
enough that's when people get pain and need the root canal so the the the what to do about it there's
definitely debate in there but the how to treat it whether it's with doing a root canal whether it's
doing a tooth removal including an implant in as a physician i'm not going to talk about that that's
for the dentist too and there's a lot of debate within what they should do but bottom line is you
don't want infection one way or the other you want to get that infection out because there was actually
a very intriguing study back in 2013 that really linked tightly with we're talking cardiovascular
disease for a moment but they they looked at 101 heart attacks and this was actually an american
heart association journal circulation probably heard of that it's their top journal american
heart associate so it wasn't a dental journal but they looked at 101 heart attacks they sucked the
clot out of the heart attack what happens is an artery and heart um a clot forms in it and they
sucked that clot out of the heart and they analyzed it for oral bacteria and the bottom line outcome
of it was that up to half of those 101 heart attacks and this is a medical journal were driven by
an event from the mouth it was either and and they looked at both gum infection and they looked root
canal infection and so they were both contributing to that the interesting part in this discussion
is that they they did a scan called a cone beam cat scan so it's a very detailed look at the base
of the tooth and they found infections at the base of teeth of these people at heart attack
in 30 of those 101 people every single uh every single one of them were asymptomatic they didn't
they weren't having any symptoms of of of teeth problems that they noticed so a lot of people can
have um tooth infections that don't really bother them but they can cause problems so that's why it
really is when your dentist is telling you you really do need to get this this this problem
that's not causing pain because a lot of people go ahead just fix my pain well what you don't
know will hurt you that those bacteria can't get into your bloodstream it's a good motivation to
brush and floss every day the you know the old oil filter card you can pay me now or you can pay me
later absolutely that's a that comes with it with the mouth you either pay with your health or pay
with your your wallet and they this cardiovascular connection right of course heart we don't want
anybody to have a heart attack a cardiac event uh but the cerebral vascular connection so when
we're talking about cardiovascular issues you know this gets connected to cognitive issues
very quickly because if you don't get blood flow to your brain because your your uh the interest
like the inner layer of your vessels is inflamed that's going to affect cognitive function very
quickly yeah and as uh as the whole recode method teaches that so the bacteria we're talking about
toxicity the bacteria getting into the brain and we're talking about cardiovascular type four
and and so basically it's it's disease of the pipes leading to it so if you have a I mean they're
all the same mechanism if somebody has a heart attack it's because you get a clot forming in
the artery in the heart a stroke is when a clot forms in the artery breaks open and ruptures and
caught and the clot floats up to the brain because it's a high pressure vessel well if it happens
hundreds or thousands of times in the itty bitty arteries that supply oxygen to the brain that's
cardiovascular dementia so it's all the same process just different a location wow so so important
so another really important piece of maintaining cognitive function is getting enough oxygen to
your brain particularly at night so sleep apnea is a known major contributor to cognitive decline
for several reasons um and you call it airway disease so it's not just sleep apnea it's not
just you know the absence of a c-pap tell me a little bit more about kind of the comprehensive
view of getting oxygen to your brain yeah so it and and also how it doesn't necessarily have to
have to see so c-pap is like putting a band-aid on a wound you're shoving oxygen down the throat
and you're going to get you're going to bypass an obstruction which you just saw shoving oxygen so
certainly it is an important measure and some people if they've got severe apnea until they get
it fixed but it's not treating the problem at all so the problem with the uh with sleep apnea is that
you don't get oxygen to the brain from a couple different reasons so I call it an airway disease
because the problem is not a lack of c-pap like you said it's a obstruction either where the tone
falls back into the airway and blocks it off or they get an upper airway obstruction it's usually
a more subtle one harder to find it's not as raging the abnormal results on testing but
it can cause a lot of disease coming from from the blockages in the nose so what they it's been
doing speaking in dentistry I've been paired up with a lot of airway conferences and I got to see
a lot of very I've been taught tremendously by my dental colleagues about airway disease because
the you can you can actually and as you saw in the training there's physical exam features
that you can see on people where who have sleep apnea whether it's scallop look on the sides of
your tongue from gritting your teeth whether it's a TMJ because you're gritting your teeth and you're
not breathing there there can be really skinny people and most people think of a sleep apnea as
that of the obese and certainly losing weight will be very helpful but now that I know what to
look for and I'm looking for it through physical exam features and symptoms I'm finding a lot of
very thin people sleep apnea and interesting it starts very early in life I mean it starts in the
pediatric population when those bones are all malleable and forming that people are are left
with a narrow narrow palate high arch where they're there they're very narrow face the the the jaw
gets pulled back for various reasons and basically shoves the tongue in the way so that what the
dentists are able to do with various techniques are to open up the airway so they they will they
guess they can make an appliance most people know about that so if somebody has an appliance and they
keep spitting it out just a side note it's probably coming from the nose so if the if I've
heard dentists say you're going to make a person's CPAP worse if the problem's coming from the nose
but you give them an appliance but they have different ways whether it's Invisalign or other
techniques called vivos where it actually both opens the airway and restructures the mouth but if
you can restructure and create more space to breathe you can cure your sleep apnea and put
your CPAP on on the shelf for memories so it's always actually the dentist team can actually
cure the problem in some people. I've had a handful of patients do really well with just
mouth tape which when I initially heard about it I was like that's weird that sounds awful
but people swear by it just putting and again a very practical intervention very inexpensive
something to just try the other thing is that those strips that you can the breathe right strips
so both of those things are treating that upper airway resistance syndrome the CPAP
that's not coming from the tongue falling in the throat it's coming from obstruction in this area
and people who are mouth breathers so for various reasons some people are mouth breathers and we
should be healthy breathing at nighttime is breathing through our nose so but I'm putting
the tape on there forces you to breathe through your nose now that's a problem if you've got a lot
of nasal congestion so interestingly and kind of another a note treating the toxicity of like
say mold toxicity that people that's the root cause of it they can that year-round congestion
their nose goes away and that's a way that they can actually improve their sleep apnea so they
cure their mold and they fix their sleep apnea in some cases but yeah so any intervention whether
it's a a whatever treatment to reduce the swelling at nighttime can be beneficial so that's kind of
in the treatment regimen is for people have upper airway resistance is to whatever non
non-surgical ways you can to treat the problem that's coming from the nasal passage and for
anyone here who's listening that has more questions about the mold toxicity chronic sinusitis and how
that might be contributing to cognitive decline both Dr. Jill Krista and Dr. Neil Nathan dive deep
into these subjects so I invite you to go over there listen to those interviews because there
will be lots and lots there to help you find solutions for cognitive decline that can be
coming from those chronic sinus infections or mold toxicity and Dr. Whitney and I are both
those are our colleagues and mentors and we've learned a lot from them and incorporating that
into a comprehensive approach to combating cognitive decline is so important. Another piece
of the puzzle when it comes to dentistry is the role of potentially mercury in amalgams
so tell me a little bit about what's known what isn't and when someone might consider an intervention
there. So mercury it's a known neurotoxin it's going to it is it is a root cause of Alzheimer's
disease so I and anyone who understands that concept says that nobody should ever have mercury
put in their mouth again. There are dentists out there who do it still because it is supported by
the American Dental Association so there's a lot of controversy in dentistry so I'm not going to
get into the details of that but I as a physician don't think anybody should get more mercury put
in their mouth because because when you put the mercury in the mouth it you get a lot of mercury
exposure so the question is is that do you have to have if you've like many of us have do you have
to have your mercury fillings removed and the answer is maybe well one reason is it so I always
tell my patients if I see mercury in their mouth I say go to your dentist have them take a look at
the the mercury is the filling is in good repair you might not have to have it taken out if it's
breaking down you're getting mercury in your system and it should come out and and if it's
done it has to be done in a safe way there are safe techniques for removing it to minimize your
exposure because the the other time you get the most exposure is when you take out the fillings
so when you put them in when you take them out you get your most mercury exposure so if you've
got a filling that's not broken down and it's not leaking into your system and no harm no foul don't
don't let's leave it alone don't have the fillings taken out and there are ways that we can test for
mercury toxicity and and even help to sort out is it coming from inorganic sources like the
fillings or is it coming from eating a lot of fish over the years and just not getting there's
ways you can distinguish that and we can test you for that so if if somebody comes back and the
dentist says yeah they look like they're in pretty good shape then what I'll do and the dentist could
do also is to test to see is it getting into the system and does it need to be taken out because
it is leaking I had a patient who had a significantly elevated we had done the test that you're
referring to and she had both that were significantly elevated and she refused to take any supplements
so she wouldn't do any binders she didn't want to do any sort of cullation in our IV she's like
I'm just going to be honest I'm not going to swallow it so we um we I did advise her to have
them removed because those levels were elevated and she came back a year later so full 12 months
later and we tested again it had decreased by more than half so no intervention other than
getting them all out and both the inorganic and methyl mercury had both shifted significantly so
