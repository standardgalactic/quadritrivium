she was kind of a control if you will almost because there was no other the imd powder that we
hadn't done any edta or or dmps or dmsa so it was just an interesting kind of end of one
yeah yeah no and that makes sense because it clearly whatever dentist took the fillings out
did a good job yes it was a biological dentist yeah so that clearly they did a good job on it and
there's there's there's definitely evidence that if it's you're you're going to have a lot
better outcome if you do it in ways that are safe do you tend to refer to biological dentists or do
you think that there is another way to choose a good dentist in your area so the I don't like to
pigeonhole dentists into titles so I mean a biological dentist is kind of like I'm a functional
integrative physician I mean I'm a physician and I just have an emphasis on root causes
understanding things like toxicity so those who are are kind of branding themselves as a biological
dentist certainly know especially from a toxicity standpoint the concept of mercury and and certainly
if people are that they they are the ones who are most likely to be trained in that but I'm
really more interested in a dentist who just understands the mouth body connection because
there's a ton out there that's not necessarily the like we talked about like the oral bacteria the
airway there's a whole lot so there's actually kind of a term complete health dentist where
they're kind of branding themselves and setting their practice up in terms of complete health
where they understand and they they talk to people along these fronts about the connection
of the mouth and the body and why they should do this and that and it makes a big difference I mean
the root canal example is a perfect one where it's like a lot of dentists if there's no pain they
leave it alone but what you don't know is going to be hurting you so but yeah I mean that's a if
people are looking for a dental I mean number one dentists can get certified in the whole
reticent recode method through Apollo health they're kind of in the very early stages there's
not lots of them out there right now doing it but I would that would be a certainly a great place to
start if they happen to have somebody in their area who's been certified in recode and then
basically kind of looking around to find out if they can see somebody who kind of I mean branding
themselves or if you look at their websites and say that they understand the mouth body connection
or call themselves complete health dentists or or a biologic dentist then that's a good starting
point and frankly I the lowest level triage I have for that is that does the dentist tolerate
blood in the sink because honestly there's been many times I as a vision I say do you bleed when
you brush or you floss and if they say yes and they it's all my questionnaire and if they say yes
I say so what's the dentist say about your gums oh they say they're great okay there's there's a
mismatch right there and the other thing is that people can look for is does your dentist do testing
for your pockets so where they they usually there's one or two people they're often I'm a hygienist
and assistant where they'll kind of go through and they'll measure your pockets between your
tooth and your gum and they'll call out numbers like one three five things like that if they're
doing that and they at least understand the basics that that's an important thing to keep control of
and and they're doing it so and so if the practice isn't doing the it's called periotrading that and
that's kind of another indicator that that it's not so much a complete health type practice great
good to know I don't want to be I don't want to because there's a lot of great dentists that if you
if you need a root canal they do a great job at or a crown or whatever but it's just it's the it's
the acceptance of disease that to no fault of their own they just don't understand our world
and how much problems it can cause even if they don't even if it's not bothering the patient
yeah we want to get proactive particularly if someone already has symptoms of cognitive decline
or maybe even when they have genetics that can predispose them or family history that can predispose
them and as you've made a really phenomenal point that same thing with heart disease if you have a
family history or genetic or labs that might indicate that there's some sort of cardiac risk
making the dentist a priority making dental hygiene a priority doing whatever the dentist is
recommending getting that done it starts to be really high on the list of places to put your
resources and put your time so that's that's where we kind of bring us right back to the beginning
where it is a significant the mouth those three areas the bacteria from root canals and gum
problems the airway problems and toxicities like amalgams there are root cause of a lot of things
and the big three I mean three biggies of cardiovascular disease dementia and even cancer
there's a lot especially that P. gingivalis's pancreatic cancer esophageal cancer are definitely
a connection between the mouth and those cancers and I would imagine mental health as well
certainly with the mercury so yeah lots of connections here well two out of two doctors
recommend you go see your dentist absolutely
dentists who are watching out there I encourage you to learn more about this
and consider getting certified in in the whole process too because it's honestly it's so much
fun collaborating with dentists to understand and the dentists who are looking to collaborate with
physicians there are lots of us out there who want to work with you so I really do encourage the
dentists who are watching to to really go learn more about it and Dr. Bredesen's Apollo health
site there's you can find out how to learn more about it I feel so fortunate to have a few really
phenomenal dentists who are thinking this way in San Diego and so we chat frequently about
patients and collaborate and it is it is a lot of fun I know several in San Diego we may know
probably know the same ones yeah I really feel fortunate to be in a community that has that
resource because I don't have to skip a beat saying this is the dentist go see them they're
close to you I trust them they're going to give you good advice and that that's just so reassuring
Dr. Wendy thank you so much for being with us I want to make sure that everyone knows
where they can find out more about you particularly our east coast patients but also online so
share with our listeners and how they can get a hold of you yeah by practices revolutionary
health services again I'm just outside of Philly and it's rhslivewell.com
rha like revolutionary health services livewell.com so kind of the whole approach is it's a
preventive at the core with the with the recode at the as the really gratifying opportunities that
we have and just to be clear I because I know you outside of just this conversation you do whole
health medicine yourself and not just focusing on oral health but in in this context oh yeah
I'm a physician you are a physician who can help I just got rocket-shipped into the dental
industry but no I'm I'm a family physician uh practice so yeah no I'm a physician at the core
and then people have asked me did you did you wish you went to dental school because I talks
it's like no I just never had any idea how important it was and I want to tell the world
because it's really important our dental colleagues are critical so you are making that
connection and you have the the full suite of medical care available so Dr. Whitney thank you
again my pleasure my pleasure what a great interview that was with Dr. Whitney he does such a great
job describing the connection between the health in our mouth and gums and the health of our brain
our final speaker today is Dr. Thomas Lewis Dr. Lewis is a medical scientist with advanced
degrees from MIT in the Harvard School of Public Health the key area of Dr. Lewis's work is in
chronic infection and it's relevance to chronic diseases like Alzheimer's Dr. Lewis reveals some
surprising early warning signs for Alzheimer's which organ is the window to your brain health
plus he'll talk about a specific type of oil that can help prevent cognitive decline
additionally please make sure to share this by clicking the button below the video
to help get this information to the people who need it the most
Dr. Thomas Lewis welcome to the show thank you so much Heather pleasure to be here
I am so thrilled to get into this with you because I have a patient who's been seeing you
and is getting really great results so I'm um that is why I've invited you is because I think
everyone should know about the role of infections and also some very cutting-edge testing so that
we can understand these a little bit better and also go ahead and treat it and get those
results that we're looking for that we so desperately need so how did you become interested in
dementia and Alzheimer's what's your personal story that's a great question I was interested
in Alzheimer's about 30 years ago and then coincidentally my dad came down with it shortly
thereafter he was doing some very bizarre things you wouldn't have wouldn't have expected him to do
but when we realized he had something going on in his brain he actually died of disease 19 years ago
but 18 years ago I met a gentleman at Harvard an ophthalmologist of all things who really
really illuminated what goes on in Alzheimer's to me because he was reversing this disease
in people and I mean reversing it 20 30 years ago and very profoundly but he had to do it very
quietly because his wife Xena would tell me you know Clem is 40 years ahead of his time
unfortunately I think he's even more ahead of his time than that so when I when I saw what he could do
it was life changing for me and I knew I had to take on that mission because he was just working
as a humble clinician of ophthalmology at Harvard and I knew it had to go beyond that
wow and so the eye tell me a little bit more about how the eye is directly related to Alzheimer's
and neurodegeneration well you know I have a couple props for you and you know I think the
key one is by a chair professor at Harvard if you know you know you as an assistant professor
associate a full professor than a chair professor the fancy one so this is John Dowling and he wrote
this book called the it's really a textbook the retina the approachable part of the brain but really
the the retina is an outcropping of the brain it is part of the brain and so very often what's
going on in your eye portends or is exactly the same as what's going on in your brain and what
you can see when you look at good studies something like glaucoma which some researchers
call glaucoma is Alzheimer's of the eye and Alzheimer's is glaucoma the brain they're the
exact same pathology and physiological under antecedents that lead to this disease but see
glaucoma will show up 10 or 20 years earlier and that was my dad's case he had glaucoma first
before we even had any clue or even the mildest cognitive impairment and the beautiful thing
about the eye is that you know you don't have to cut a hole in your skull to see what's going on the
instrumentation that optometrists and ophthalmologists have to analyze disease is so superior
to whatever anybody else is doing I'll give you a simple example OCT optical coherence tomography
tomography is the key word it's an instrument that makes three-dimensional imaging sort of like
an ultrasound or an MRI but OCT has much better resolution than MRI so when a neurologist looks
at the brain with MRI and they say yeah a little loss of mass but really can't see anything probably
not much going on OCT can measure thickness and volume of your retinal ganglial cells which again
are a surrogate for your brain down to the microns and we can we can see the changes very
accurately with this technique and it's not invasive and it's low you know very low cost I mean
pennies compared to an MRI and so could a patient who's curious or wondering maybe even someone
who's pre-symptomatic doesn't have symptoms of dementia yet but curious if there are changes
in the brain happening could they just go in to an ophthalmologist and get this test so I actually
recommend an optometrist and I have a network of optometrists they don't work with four me but
there's groups that do higher level training in optometry and the reason why I stare you towards
optometry rather than ophthalmology ophthalmologists are actually even though they're MDs they're
actually following the surgery so they tend to want to do aggressive treatments and I don't want
them to do that I want to just do an analysis so I'm probably one of the I might be the only person
in the world that's regularly doing eye evaluations I have a very simple thing you
you order an eye eye to brain test with me and I give you a link to a couple of the optometry
associations I send you there with a form and I do the following do not tell your optometrist
you're going to get evaluated for Alzheimer's all I want them to do is do a complete eye exam
looking at very well known um disease dates and pathologies cataracts you know cataract is the
number one surgeon in the world a certain type of cataract portends Alzheimer's and that's not me
that's Rudy Dr. Rudy Tansy chaired professor of neurology at Harvard who's higher than him
wrote a paper in 2003 how super nuclear or cortical cataracts are the exact same pathology
as the 142 beta amyloid plaque in the brain of Alzheimer's patients now optometrist and even
ophthalmologist general generally ignore cortical cataracts because they don't affect central vision
so they're just observed in the standard of care and the next test is macular degeneration
very common test fundus camera looking for something that uh Don Anderson at a UC
center barber has been studying most of his life called drusen drusen a little yellow globules that
show right up in a fundus camera view and these little yellow globules contain the same path same
protein they call it a misfolded protein but that's a misnomer it's actually all these amyloids are
actually part of your innate immune system that's trying to protect you against something
underlying that's causing deterioration mainly to your vascular the vascular term it's you know
a little known is that you have to have a capillary within three cell diameters of any living cell
so think about a little teeny vessel and it starts getting diseased and now your four
cell diameters away from that capillary well that retinal ganglial cell four cells away
is struggling if not dying so you know macular degeneration is a vascular disease but it will
affect the nervous tissue and then the last one is really just looking for a glaucoma screening
they'll do pressure and that's mainly what ophthalmology and optometry does it's a disease of
pressure quote unquote it really isn't it's a disease of inflammation pressure goes up with
inflammation but really what we see in this tomography system similar to MRI but much more
precise is we can measure the thickness and volume of the retinal ganglial cell tissue called your
retinal nerve fibro layer with great great precision and the beautiful thing about that test if I take
a 20 year old and an 80 year old that the test is normalized to your age so you're really seeing
how you compare to your your age cohorts and I think we're we should have published a paper a
while ago but I'm not really a researcher I'm more a translator I help I like working with people but
we we show that we can actually restore nervous tissue okay we can rebuild that tissue and it's
not a guess OCT is so precise we can measure it accurately imagine if you had you know a set of
calipers and you could see this tissue it's here now it's here and and this is the kind of thing
that's really profound in terms of neurodegeneration can you rebuild tissue and that is that's the
that's the challenge we all face and really I look at it as a three-legged stool to accomplish that
yeah so go into that what is that three-legged school stool how do we
rebuild neurodegenerate to degenerate in tissue and do you see clinical results so do people's
symptoms track the changes that you're measuring oh yeah we you know because it's easy to do we run
the mini mental test it's a very simple test everybody should score 30 one of my most recent
patients we retested them very recently went from the 17 to 25 and his retina is showing a 2%
increase in thickness as he's aging normally you'd expect a 2% decline so that's that's really
critical so you know we can we can definitely see these things I know the Bredesen protocol
uses CNS vital signs a much more accurate characterization of brain and brain function
cognitive function motor function from the brain all that stuff but at the end of the day
what myself and my partner in crime and this functional doctor Dr. Michael Carter and I do
is we look at disease particularly chronic diseases you know in the healthcare system
is the code book for the doctors right it's the ICD-10 69,000 diagnostic codes for diseases
in our world there are four mechanisms okay and they apply equally as well to diabetes
cataract Alzheimer's autism it doesn't matter and the first one is poor repair and recovery
if you're eating if you're not eating well or more importantly if you're not digesting well
because you are what you absorb not what you eat that's the first that's the first place to start
I was in line this morning at a store and there was a gentleman in front of me and I was coming
it was rail thin and I just made conversation because he had a really dark tan he said well
my skin is like onion paper and if I press on it I bruise easily
he doesn't it's not the bruising it's the fact that over time his repair and recovery pathways
are in the toilet so yeah you know his all his tissue is on the edge of of giving in
and the brain and the eye are really good it's a really good place to study because
your brain is 10 times more metabolic than any other tissue Dr. Sennhoff talks about this but
it's well published you know 25 percent of the oxygenated blood that leaves your heart
is going to your brain yet your brain is only two and a half percent the mass of your body
so it's 10 times it's using 10 times more oxygen that means it's working 10 times harder
now if you did this with a weight all day long and work that bicep all day long that bicep would get
tired your brain's the same thing now the only thing that's more metabolically active than your
brain guess what is your eye the eye is teeny but in terms of vessel density there's nothing denser
