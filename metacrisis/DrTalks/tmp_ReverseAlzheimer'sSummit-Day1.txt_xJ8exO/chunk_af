which are critical to know and again it's so interesting to me that 100 years ago you know
we were all dying of acute illnesses like you know tb and all and pneumococcal pneumonia and dip
theory and things like this and now we're all dying of these complex chronic illnesses and the bad
news is you don't get the symptoms until relatively late in the disease just as we see with Alzheimer's
the good news is if you know what to look for of course you can see them coming 10 20 years ahead
of time so if you simply know what to look for then you can look at these and just as we all know
our cholesterol we all know our blood pressures we should all know these other parameters and what's
what's been really interesting i think the wearables are going to be so helpful as everyone's
now being able to follow themselves so you can see where your glucose stands you can even do a
day-to-day you can even do cgm continuous glucose monitoring which is so surprising to so many people
they find out that they have these huge you know peaks and valleys both of which are bad for your
brain so that they're developing their insulin resistance but then they're also crashing at night
and waking up in the middle of the night not realizing oh my glucose is 45 that's why i'm waking up
your heart rate variability i can i'm following my own and i can see you know when i'm under a
lot of stress it's going to get way low and then when you're just relaxing and you're doing some
deep breathing and things like that boom you know you're so much better um so that's a critical
variable um just simple things following your blood pressure looking at your nocturnal oximetry
making sure that you're you're getting enough oxygen while you're sleeping at night looking at
your sleep stages looking at your ketone levels these things and then looking even at your vascular
elasticity these are all things that we can all do fairly easily and monitor ourselves and at the
same time we can see you know are we are we getting too far um uh you can use things like a breathalyzer
so a couple of weeks ago i decided okay i'm going to try to my wife my daughter and i all said we're
going to try fasting mimicking diet and it was very interesting i mean my ketones went off the charts
high but actually it was too much too soon i actually had to back down a little bit because
i started feeling horrible it was like too much so i had to kind of ease into it a little bit
bit more uh and so for all of us we can now see these things which really gives us a leg up to see
okay i'm in a situation where i am at high risk for Alzheimer's and of course knowing your apoE
for status or apoE status and other uh genetics as well can be very very helpful for this as well
so we really have so much control over our own future as you just said earlier uh Alzheimer's is
now optional so the this can feel i know for a lot of patients or people listening if you're
new to this this can feel a bit overwhelming and if you would like a guide or a coach whether it's a
doctor or a health coach or someone to help you through this the Apollo website is a phenomenal
one so Dr. Bredesen and his team have developed the Apollo website and you can now access
practitioners so you can find practitioners who have been trained by Dr. Bredesen and the team there
to do this work so don't don't let this be discouraging this is a very very hopeful time
where there is a lot of access like you said there's over 2 000 doctors or providers who have been
trained and so the help is out there the work the word is getting out also your books are very very
informative so you can get started on your own i've seen lots of patients who they get better
they they follow the book they get a lot better just by doing the diet and lifestyle things they
can do on their own and then six or eight months later they come to me and say i think we're plateauing
as a husband and wife team i want to get more out of this and then we do all the lab work
so there's a lot of ways to to kind of interface with this and use this information at home
do you have anything else to add to that about how people can get those those really vital
resources uh no i think that you you get on all the critical things so you can go to Dr.
Bredesen.com i mean go on the Apollo health code website and you know this will give you
information we also put it in the second book of the end of Alzheimer's program a lot of specifics
on where to go to get additional information and as you said people will often get improvements
just on their own doing some of the basics and then we'll say okay now how do i have to keep
tweaking to get you know better and better outcomes and that's one thing i think that's
been very interesting to see it's not like classical medicine where you write a prescription and say
come back in two months you're continually improving improving improving because you are
dealing with a very complex system your brain synaptic connections and there are multiple
things that will impact this and so in fact you can continue to get better and the most
important thing of all interestingly something that you don't get just from the trials is the
sustaining so if you look at for example a drug like aerosept you get a little bump but then you
go right back to declining and in fact over the time course over several years what's actually
been published is that people who were on aerosept did slightly worse than people who weren't on
unfortunately because yes they got the initial bump but they went right back to declining
whereas when you do the right things and you're actually addressing the things that are causing
the decline when you get the improvement you sustain the improvement and if you continue to
optimize you can actually even enhance the improvement and we now have people who are on for over nine
years who have continued their improvement for this nine years wow so kind of taking this back
to a bigger more kind of global scale the population is aging right we have more and more of us are
older and we are going to need some solutions otherwise literally in this country Medicare
may go bankrupt and there are many people who you know and not to not to be too negative here
but I see it I have patients who show up in my office and they did they didn't have kids
they don't have close family or they're the youngest of their siblings and they're terrified
of getting older and not having either the financial resources or the network the social
network that's necessary to age gracefully and age in a way that they would look forward to
and so we really need to start reimagining as a society what aging looks like and how we
how we address these neurodegenerative disorders that are so common in in the senior population
so I'm curious you know if we were to take that step back and look at what what are the global
solutions look like what are what's your vision you know this is such a good point and I was just
talking to a professor yesterday who was talking about the the amount of money he was spending
over $200,000 per year for his poor wife who's in late stage also it was just it was so sad to
hear and this has been a burden it's been a burden in so many ways finances are one one way but
there's so many other things that torn families apart it's of course ruined the the finances of
the families the interactions with the with the children and the spouses and of course it's just
just the psychological psychological impacts are huge and so this is a problem as you indicated
and in fact as professor Christine Yaffe published a few years ago this is now the third leading cause
of death in the United States it's actually number two in the United Kingdom so this is a huge and
growing problem and so you're absolutely right we really need now to fashion what would it be
like a global program would be like a global vaccine program but in this case it's a global
program to prevent neurodegenerative disease and in cases where it hasn't been prevented to
make the earliest reversals possible and if you think about this you want to have a way that's
efficient that's the key you want to have a way that where you really get everybody without
you bankrupting Medicare and so the idea would be to have a layered program so it's a little bit
like a pyramid you're starting out with a simple set of things just as you talked about earlier
where people do some basic diet and lifestyle things everyone can can do some simple things
and even get evaluated for a couple of simple points like their genetics and very inexpensive
and do that so the vast majority of these people should never suffer cognitive decline
and then what you can do for essentially free is once a year you simply check to see where
they're where they're going again you can do it by CNS vital signs you can do it even by
the people are now looking at keystrokes and things like this so there are other ways to go
so you look to see where people say now what'll happen is most of these will not go on to starting
to have problems a small subset will those people now you have to take the next step so they'll
have a little more evaluation they'll have a little more it'll be a more extensive program
the majority of those will turn around and do very well a small number of those will go on
so what we have is you now have a graduated hierarchical approach where smaller and smaller
numbers of people so you'll only ultimately have a very few people that will actually break through
these different layers and actually have cognitive decline despite an evaluation and those people
ultimately they will have some time in the hospital you have to look very deeply at all the different
parameters why did they break through these relatively straightforward programs I think
you've done an absolutely fantastic job by setting up Marama where you're taking now that of course
the disadvantage is you're seeing people relatively later in the process ultimately what we like to
see is that the vast majority of people would never get that far along but for those who do
you have a fantastic program in the really the first of its time I think is a real role model
for so many other places around the world that will be looking instead of simply watching people
decline will be actively involved in improving them and sustaining some level of cognition so that
they now aren't lost to the family so I really congratulate you for such an outstanding job
for setting up Marama thank you one of you know one of my big goals is to I would feel
successful if we could shift that entire senior living industry a little bit in our direction
kind of like what you're saying like if we just got the food right what would be the change even
just if we looked at the numbers right the healthcare dollars that are spent in the people
living in kind of a conventional setting where there's you know cake cookies ice cream pasta
cereal versus what we know is a very brain healthy diet so what would what would all of
what would the financial impact just be at the healthcare level right not to mention all of the
other pieces I think I mean I think you and I can predict what that would look like but just
showing people how those relatively simple interventions with using information that we
already have can really shift the trajectory of someone's health and the quality of life
is another thing I'm sure you guys measured that we're measuring quality of life scores and our
study and you know you expect improvement because people feel generally healthier yeah it's such
an exciting time absolutely so as you and yeah absolutely and I would just add you know in addition
to all the things that we've been talking about there was a nice paper recently as you know by
Dr. Kara Fitzgerald who was looking at aging parameters looking at essentially methylated
regions of the DNA that are been assumed to be associated very closely with biological aging
and showing that doing some of these same sorts of things not only is it making your cognition
better but it's actually giving you a reversal of your biological aging so that she saw about 3.26
younger years on people who were on a protocol that again some of the same sorts of things
compared to the ones who weren't on that so as we're so we're going to be doing looking at
biological aging with her on this next study so it'll be very interesting to see can we see
cognitive improvement but can we also see improvement in biological aging so Brian Bradley
I mentioned to you earlier he's my co-PI and he my co-primary investigator on our trial and he
reported her as her co-PI on her trial so I'm very familiar because I know that crowd there
they're my naturopathic colleagues very familiar and I know the the metric they used the
gentleman at UCLA the professor there Dr. Horvath yeah Horvath has created that kind of that way
to test it so for people interested you can actually get a test is it true diagnostics I think is the
name of their their company I think it is yeah yeah and so her papers published so you can take
a look at what they use and they have a lifestyle intervention there's another one I think that
used DHA and something else they didn't get quite as good data as Dr. Fitzgerald did but there's a
few people looking at this and how do we reverse the aging clock so not just neurodegenerative
things but even taking that a step further and say how can everybody get benefit don't you know
we don't just have to focus on the brain but how do we get yeah how can we live better not just
longer lives but better lives one of the fun conversations I had recently was with a another
woman who was imagining and kind of placed a place like Marama on the east coast and we were
talking about how fun it would be if by the time we retire there's sort of this expectation that
maybe you you and your spouse or you and a friend go to sort of a retreat center for six to 12 months
and you basically learn okay it's that it's that shift in your your life right where you kind of
graduate into retirement and how you want to live it maybe you could go somewhere in the mountains
or at the beach whatever sounds nice and learn to live the healthiest lifestyle for aging and then
take those patterns back to you know your home and your family and start to incorporate that so
like a Marama but earlier on so that we can do that prevention and how fun I would sign up for that
yeah no and I think you're right I mean taking this to more like us what would people would
think of as a senior center where you don't wait for it for cognitive changes or other changes and
yeah you know I think we've all been taught that it's it's all about a drug just get a drug for
each problem and instead of the fact that in fact the as we understand more and more getting a
healthy setup and understanding what's driving a lack of health is so much more powerful than we
were taught in medical school and so you're right going to a place where you'd actually
learn essentially learning to live healthily which we kind of take for granted oh yeah I'm
just going to eat you know change this or that no there are a lot of things again there's so much
more biochemical manipulation that can be done in a very healthy way than we were taught so the
fundamental way we think about retirement and we think about medicine really needs to change
amazing Dr. Madison thank you so much for taking the time I know you you and I both are in hotel
rooms at conferences meeting with other people really doing the work of of changing this narrative
and I couldn't be more grateful to you for your support of Marama and of giving me the tools
so that we could have this impact on on the lives of those who are suffering essentially
unnecessarily at this point yeah yeah you're absolutely right and I think many places are
you know ignoring the wonderful data that are coming out from numerous places like yours
and therefore they're they're putting people unfortunately at risk and so I look forward
to a day when we really can make these problems rare and congratulations once again on all the
great work I really look forward to reading about your exciting results in your trial thank you again
wow what an inspirational conversation with Dr.
Bredesen can you believe that today with what we know right now 84 percent of people who
do a protocol like his can reverse their cognitive decline I'm so grateful to Dr.
Depp Bredesen that he took the time to compare Atacanamab to his approach the future of aging
can look so different than it does right now there's a hopeful future ahead
our next speaker is Dr. Patrick Porter he's a renowned expert in meditation and self-help

for years to come now let's begin the interview with my friend Dr. Patrick Porter
Dr. Porter thank you so much for joining us welcome to the show
well it's great to be here thank you for having me so we were chatting a minute ago about neuroplasticity
would you tell us what that means well it used to be 20 years ago they were told you your brain
was fixed something were to happen you damaged your brain nothing could happen but what we now
know is the brain is changing and can grow all the time through something called neurogenesis
but that means is we grow new we can grow a new brain with the if we get the right stimulus
which usually is blood flow circulation back to those areas the brain and the intelligence
to the body can reorganize and the brain they now know is holographic in nature that can read
other parts of the brain can do parts that we didn't think it could but with neuroplasticity
we can take a snapshot now of these neuron connections so think of it like a computer
when we upgrade our computer we want a faster computer the more neuron connections we have
more we can more computing power our brain has as we unfortunately people think we grow our brain
and we connect it as we get older the reality is that we unplug our brain when we're born it's
fully connected that's why we can learn languages we can learn our whole basic our whole universe
and before seven years old you know if you take a little child you go wow and then what happens
