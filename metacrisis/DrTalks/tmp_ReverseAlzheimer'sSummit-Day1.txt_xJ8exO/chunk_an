so if your repair and recovery pathways are are not good these highly metabolic tissues
retina eye brain are going to suffer so that's the first place to start and that's easy the next
thing is food sensitivities or sensitivities in general the third is you know are you always in
a fight or flight mode if you're out your cortisol is always up you're always stressed you're not
sleeping well guess what it's going to affect your repair and recovery pathways and you sleep for
your brain and your eyes once again your biceps not tired most people's biceps not tired but your
brain and your eyes never shut off okay so you've got to rest for them and then the fourth thing is
what I call chronic toxicity but chronic infection is the biggest part of that because
you can you can identify you've been exposed to lead or something like that and you can detoxify
and you can chelate out the lead but when an infection takes hold two important things it can
replicate and grow inside you without further exposure and and secondly it it can wind up in
tissue in very localized tissue rather than being systemic so it can be in the campus it can be in
the retina it can be in the joint for arthritis so this is where the science and art of diagnostic
comes in because you look at all the blood you have in your body yet you only have this small
piece of tissue that's infected that your immune system is chasing down and so your labs may not
go up but by a pittance yet you have a very severe infectious insidious infectious process going on
in a very small amount of tissue that can have a profound effect on your health eyesight cognitive
function things of that nature so this is this is where testing really becomes well I like to
think we've made it very scientific do I dare go into that now well and I it sounds like it so
say what you mean by that what do you mean by you like to think you've made it very scientific
so if you look at lab tests online and you and you see what the normal reference ranges or
reference intervals you'll get from lab core and quest ranges like this and they're really
looking for acute disease are you sick do you need to see a doctor or specialist right now
so it's unscientific and I was just in doctor Trump's office this had to be 15 years ago and he
goes tom the only thing that really matters is mortality and more specifically early mortality
okay and there's a lot of misinformation about longevity where national geographic did a great
study in 2013 the title of the article is called 100 candles people live to 100 and what they showed
is if you live to 100 you have nine years of declining health and everything is an asymptote
it's like this so you actually the nine years you know a lot of those years are still pretty good
if you live to 80 you have 19 years of declining health so what we did is it okay
mortality or early mortality is an endpoint published in many medical scientific papers
so what we did is we looked at things like C-reactive protein white blood cell counts
nucleophilic lymphocyte ratio fibrinogen erythrocyte sedimentation rate and looked at where
good studies could show that these markers showed the first increase in mortality and the simplest
one is white blood cell counts a white blood cell count is so inexpensive now this is a Harvard
study just to give you an example Harvard study they oversaw the women's health initiative 138
thousand women that they studied prospectively what that means is they measured these women very
accurately in many many many centers and then follow them and see what happened to them and you
know they measured who died and whatnot their ages and all that but what they showed when they
started extracting the data is if you have two groups of women one with a white blood cell count
are 4700 and another group with 6700 now keep in mind the reference interval for white blood cells
are like 3500 to 10800 so we're talking two sets of women very very much normal the doctor would
look at them say labs are fine so they followed them for six years and the women at 6700 died at
twice the rate as the women at 4700 so why wouldn't you tell someone at 6700 that you have greater risk
why wait till 10800 so we built an entire scale on this early mortality and since every marker we
use titrates the exact same endpoint early mortality we amalgamate this and we use 21 markers
it's applicable to Alzheimer's or arthritis or whatever but it's all inflammatory immune health
markers clotting markers things like that that all you know we're all connected and so we create a
risk score we call your chronic disease temperature based on these 21 markers so we're able to really
tell if someone's getting better by not looking at a plethora of individual labs we can look at a
single score to tell whether someone's heading in the right direction physiologically or not
and then of course we do dive down into each marker and help them understand what the risk factors
for each marker is but you know Heather you're not a I know you very little right now we just met
but there's a story behind you and we say there's the same thing about your labs it's not oh
your your a1c is this and and then your lipids are this no what we try to do is we try to build a
story around all the labs to help you really understand your health now how infection comes
into this is that the difference between someone with a 4700 and a 6700 which in the standard of
care is no difference is almost always some type of chronic infectious process and how we glean what
it is is with another test that comes out of a complete blood count with differential once again
one of the most expensive inexpensive tests you can order and it's a neutrophil to lymphocyte
ratio so neutrophil is a type of white blood cell usually goes up with bacteria and lymphocyte is a
type of white blood cell it either goes up or down with viruses and so when the neutrophil
to lymphocyte ratio goes up we can kind of tell what kind of pathogen may be affecting that individual
and then of course we test for them and have treatment protocols for a specific pathogen but
it's not it's not a whole lot unlike Lyme you know chris christophus and was diagnosed with
Alzheimer's like eight years ago and headlines chris christophus and has Alzheimer's unlike two
years later he came out no no these are the headlines and you know popular media no he
doesn't have Alzheimer's he has Lyme disease what's the difference the pathology is unmistakably
Alzheimer's but they actually found the cause in this case Borrelia bordophora infection or maybe
colon factions that go along with Lyme disease so this is incredible that it sounds like you're
saying the you know the eyes of the window to disease and so if you can find these markers in
the eye a very simply relatively affordably you can also find markers in of cbc or a complete
blood count that's again very affordable very simple so if we find these markers for disease
then what how do we so you know when you look at we we believe and don't believe everybody lies on
a health disease continuum and that's your overall continuum but there are continuance
underneath that so the eye helps us understand where you stand on the pathology continuum
that's closest to disease because it's actual tissue changes then backing up a little bit
to earlier in life you have a physiological continuum that's our chronic disease temperature
at the end of the day it's all about risk factors what are those risk factors you know
do you have GERD do you have a thyroid issue you have energy issues do you have poor sleep
this is where you really get into coming up with some basic protocols but I will tell you
when someone has a subacute or chronic infection then we have to get much more aggressive
at treatment supplements lifestyle changes intermittent fasting helps in repair and recovery
but we even go so far as going into pharmaceutical treatments what we do what we generally do with
an individual let's say we have an Alzheimer's sufferer what we'll generally do is do a complete
work up very detailed risk assessment we've digitized our risk assessment and give a score
very detailed physiological assessment the eye test to corroborate there's some neurodegeneration
process going on and then we're going to really dive into dive into those risk factors and start
ameliorating the low hanging the fruit the simple risk factors so what we're going to do is we're
going to do at least six months of pre-treatment going to be coaching nutritional guidance
supplementation things of that nature working on improving their physiological score
then if we've done the testing already or if we decide to do the infectious testing
then it's when we're going to we're going to pull out the guns to do
some more aggressive treatments unfortunately a lot of the functional treatments
aren't that effective and it's very very explainable there's a MD research out of Vanderbilt
Charles Stratton who's written some papers and patents that explains that these organisms that
are stealth and chronic not like you have staff or the flu you know you feel sick they're insidious
that they can live in three different forms a couple of which are completely hidden from the
immune system and their quasi dormant you know like everybody knows chickenpox you can get shingles
later in life that is not the only organism that can go stealth and come back to play opportunistically
but see the problem is and what what dr. Ewald pull up another prop but anybody's really interested
in this topic can read this book plague time it's all about really the modern germ theory
is that the biggest problem with with subacute or chronic infections is what's called crypticity
and what that means is you know someone at covid you were with them you get covid
you know you got you got covid but with chronic diseases and chronic infections that often cause
this you have no clue as to when you might have been exposed and you might have been exposed
pre-birth might be a congenital infection a lot of times that happens epsi you know
chickenpox that's a congenital infection there are many other congenital infections myself I had
a fib I titrated it back to Lyme disease a bit by ticks many many times I had a perfect storm of
of health issues in my 40s you know stress and over exercising and then getting sick and this
perfect storm and Lyme disease came back out to play and it almost always affects the vessels
we say it's arthritis but it's really the vessels in the joint we say it's Alzheimer's but it's
really the vessels in the brain we say it's glaucoma or macular disease but it's really the
microvessel the capillaries in that tissue that's causing this disease and these infectious
species are like vampires with your blood yeah this is a great theme you know making sure there's
enough circulation for anyone who's listening that's really curious about circulation and
making sure you're getting enough oxygen nutrients delivery of everything that's necessary for a cell
to to function not just optimally but to function at all Dr. Mark's or excuse me Mark's with
his conversation with me as it goes into a lot of detail about that but I want to come back Dr.
Lewis to what you mentioned about the white blood cell count so this is a very common marker and I
had imagined many of our listeners are going to go back to their labs and say what was my white blood
cell count am I going to die soon and as from a clinical perspective what I see a lot of are
low white blood cell counts and those I have come to think of as a marker for a chronic infection
so can you help me kind of square that circle because you're telling me that it is a high white
blood cell count no it can be low on you know if you you know for COVID mass general the Chinese
a lot of others have caught on to this they're looking for lymphocytopenia so low lymphocyte
counts and if your neutrophils are normal because you don't have a bacterial thing going on everything's
copacetic there then when your lymphocytes are lowered by the virus then your white blood cell
total comes comes down there's no question about it I think the IFM and others are very good with
the antiviral protocol with quercetin zinc vitamin D you know the usual NAC the usual suspects high
dose vitamin C dr. Levy all those things and ivermectin is now shown to be extraordinarily
antiviral at first it was thought to be just an antiparasitic but you know frontline critical
care doctors are leveraging that information that was published really I'm not sure how far it goes
back but the papers I were I was reading when COVID came out on ivermectin we're like 20 years ago
we're showing its broad spectrum antiviral properties so yeah if you're below our range you
know the standard of care of 3500 to 10800 or 900 and they change they usually get broader not now
or unless they want to you know prescribe you a drug then they'll narrow that range you can prescribe
it more but really your optimal range for a white blood cell count is 4 000 to 5800 okay
but then then you got to look at the ratios because if lymphocytes go down and neutrophils go up
your total white blood cell count still looks normal but your lymphocytes are low okay that's why
I use the neutrophil the lymphocyte ratio so when a white blood cell count is normal but I know there's
something going on because the person tells me this they have arthritis they have brain fog
they have whatever then I look at the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and then look at the individual
like if your neutrophil percent is above 58 percent something's going on if your lymphocytes
are below a thousand something's going on and it's not and it's usually you know a low grade
but the thing is Heather I do this for my participants this is the standard of care
I take this pen and I stab the back of my hand and it's bloody bruised and it's nasty that's like
my labs won't weigh up okay but in chronic disease all I'm doing is just rubbing gently
so how does this look in two months it looks healed if I'm rubbing 24 seven for two months
this is going to be raw and bloody and I'm probably to the bone this is what chronic disease is all
about but see the pressure I put on is sort of a reflection of how high the labs go I don't have to
go very high to keep building like I'm not putting more pressure on at the end of two months a
matter of fact I'm putting less pressure on yet it's still a nasty wound so in kind of bringing
this back to dementia I appreciate that analogy because I think that really well illustrates
the difference between chronic versus acute disease and conventional medicine and really our
society is set up as a whole to think about acute disease really pretty well you know I think they
do a good job but when it comes to chronic infections we only have soaring rates of incidence
and so many people suffering without a ton of hope so I'm excited to you know have you continue
sharing with our our listeners what kinds of things they can be looking at so what states of health
and particular pathogens make people most vulnerable to early Alzheimer's well you know I think
Dr. Trump and I wrote a my mentor wrote a paper that was published in Frontier's Neuroscience
Aging called it's never too early and it's never too late to end the epidemic of Alzheimer's
starting at pre-birth to you know when you actually have a disease depression is an early
wanting sign for Alzheimer's people think that you know Alzheimer's patients get depressed actually
that's really not the case it's that they had depression first and then they migrate into
Alzheimer's any inflammatory markers a risk factor for future Alzheimer's so you know you're
going to be really you got to look at the brain as not being separate from the rest of the body
and then any ill health that you have if it stays consistent even low grade will can eventually
manifest in the brain because the brain is so um you know it's so vascular so it's it's it's
breaking down and building up all the time let me just go over the three legs of the stool so the
first one's repair and recovery we talked about that a little bit um nutrients and good absorption
the second one is really the inflammation which inflammation is a treasure if you have
inflammation something's causing it okay and that's where we get to look at the chronic infection
and you know the work of tansy saying that you know these cortical cataracts which are the
Alzheimer's cataracts that protein that is the cataract is actually an antimicrobial peptide
he published that information in PLOS in 2010 so the amyloid which has been the target of the
pharmaceutical industry in Alzheimer's for 30 years is actually trying to protect you as part of
your native immune response but the brain is a little bit different than other parts of the
body in this respect and i'm a hockey player so i follow hockey players that had concussions and
some of them they get concussed and they can't get back into the game you know so what i like to
say is like you slam into the boards with your elbow and your head and about the same force
well your elbow is probably okay to go in in a in a couple weeks or a month but sometimes your
brain's not good to go for a year and and the issue is this brilliant paper by two Australians
published in 2017 i'll read the title just for he has but it's called the the meteorology of cytokine
storms and the clinical usefulness of this knowledge and then the key part of this paper that really
helps understand it is how persistent cytokine storms with just inflammatory markers elevated
white blood cells elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio elevated uric acid suppressed white blood
cell counts to your point as well c-reactive protein homocysteine fibrinogen usual suspects
but persistent cytokine storms in the ill brain so there's something special like
someone gets traumatic brain injury and they're a vegetable but if they if they bang their hip
their hip's going to recover there's something unique about it and i was just on a call with an
md one hour ago we were just musing over this because she's worried about her mother and all
this good stuff and i think that we're just set up we're more vulnerable today for brain
inflammation because we are eating an inflammatory diet most of our population the omega six the
bad fats too many carbs we're afraid of fish because of mercury but i'm i'm convinced that it's
the omega threes and other in fish and other anti-inflammatory foods that you have to have
present all the time so when an event like a traumatic brain event occurs or something like
Alzheimer's you're there to quell the inflammatory storm in your brain and then the other paper i'm
just looking off to my other screen but it's really important we wrote dr. tremp and i wrote
this in our Alzheimer's book at the title of the paper by two Stanford researchers three of them
