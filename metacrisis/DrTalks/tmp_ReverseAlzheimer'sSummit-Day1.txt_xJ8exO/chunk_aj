roof and when i graduated i tested everybody and i had to stop doing that because i discovered
oh we all have metals in our system and i always get patients to ask me well where did they come
from doctor you know and it is so ubiquitous wait we've got mercury in our amalgam so you know if
you're in your 50s or older and you have any fillings you have mercury fillings in there from
your childhood um we have mercury in the fish we have mercury gets burnt in coal fired plants and
put up in the plumes and then rains down in acid rain so it is on the west coast where i am we get
a big plume of dust every summer from china and we have coal fired plants in the midwest that
rains down on the northeast in the united states so we have ubiquitous kind of in our environment
metals the top four that i see that is in most of my patients it's not everybody but when it is there
it's cadmium mercury arsenic and lead those four are the top four now we do test for 13
but it is it's a stone to turn over you got to turn that stone over because if you don't
look at that then you're basically building on quicksand so you know things like glutathione
acupuncture chinese botanicals all of the great new tropics those aren't going to be as effective
if you've got basically this big bucket hole in the bottom of your bucket you're trying to fill up
so it's not they're not as effective so metals we see this we've seen this at marama actually
at the residential care facility where we've had we had a couple come in and they did they did great
they did very well they were improving but they didn't have a trained doctor like you and so sure
enough we encourage their family members to get them seen by by a well trained doctor and there
were heavy metals there that we didn't know about and so now it's so exciting to see all right as we
put all the pieces together but the lifestyle and the really good medicine what's their potential
yeah so it is amazing yeah once you get those cleared out of the way then we look at the microbiome
so it's still in the assessment because i know everybody wants to get to what to do right but
you got to start with a strong assessment because the microbiome we've all heard the gut is the
second brain and there's so much research coming out on this uh and you know i just saw there's
research on a probiotic that was decreasing Parkinson's symptoms in patients and definitely for
we're seeing certain probiotics associated with different neurodegenerative states so looking at
it the gut is the second brain why i have the walls yellow in my clinic is i come from the spleen
and the stomach camp in chinese medicine it's also the overlay with naturopathic medicine is treat
the gut healing starts with the gut right we dig our graves with our fork right you run the the
bredison protocol out of your clinics and you know one of those sub types of the Alzheimer's is
diabetes of the brain so looking at sugar imbalances along those lines so we want to see though
do you have inflammation in the gut do you have any pathogenic bacteria do you have any
opportunistic bacteria are your beneficial gut bugs in proper balance so there's a whole
slew of information we get from a microbiome test and so it's very important again for
foundational work because if you have inflammation in the gut you have imbalances in the gut
you have worms or parasites in your gut we need to clear that stuff because that is a total
drain on your vital force and your vitality you know i like to say i do a lot of nothing all day
i give basically we hold the space it's your body and it's the information coming into the
body that creates the healing potential but we have to remove obstacles to cure and so the
microbiome is a crucial kind of frontline assessment especially with mild cognitive impairment
dementia Alzheimer's these are huge imbalances if you have leaky gut guess what you have a leaky
brain the blood brain barrier is not working as well and so the integrity of your vessel and your
innate ability to heal is compromised if that's off right so that's the second leg of the stool
the third one is hormone testing and you know some will say well that's funny why for my brain
health do i need to look at my hormones right and we do know all of the information of our body
comes in through the periphery in our nervous system and we are set up with some amazing sensors for
you know vision and sound and taste and light and sensitivity pain and so what we're looking at
all of that information comes into your central nervous system comes up to the brain stem and
then goes to a small i call it a tiny little operation called the hypothalamus and in there
i imagine this little switchboard operator connecting the signals to the right region of the
brain well sometimes that operator gets really confused if you have brain fog confusion memory
issues they're just not connecting the signals in the right spot well what else comes in there
your hormones also come into the hypothalamus and so you've got your nervous system your sympathetic
your fight or flight like the saber tooth cat coming to eat you and then the parasympathetic
which is your rest and digest and heal that that's your nervous system autonomic nervous system and
then you have your hormones that get organized in there as well and so there's a lot we can do if
your hormones are out of balance and i see you know it's amazing what environmental toxicity is
doing to our hormones with kind of the plastics that are estrogenating our bodies creating a lot of
estrogen response in our bodies for men in particular but also for women men's testosterone
levels are dropping after the age of 35 so much so that they just changed the the reference range
on the labs you know it used to be total top end of 1200 for an average now it's down to 900 so
that's you know you see these reference ranges and they change and they're not normal ranges so
people you know here's a like a little kind of asterisk pro tip your reference range it's a
reference range on your lab it's not a normal number so a lot of times you don't understand that
and your providers don't understand that and that oh well look you're on the reference range you must
be fine but we have some optimal levels that we're looking at there for you in particular i call them
the healthy levels because it's much tighter controlled on the labs i'm going to get back
to the hormones so the hormones in particular you know we're looking at um progesterone estrogen
the breakdown products of estrogen we get to see what your liver is doing with them because
that is a big part of hormone metabolism and regulation is in your liver we look at some
of your snips the single nucleopeptide snips of your genetic snips to see well what's the
platform that your body's playing on with a big asterisk around that just because you have the
snip doesn't mean you're expressing it so that's a whole component on those three now i know that
is a ton of info so let me just pause there and see what comes up well you know i think it's really
exciting for me to hear that you also don't take those ranges as this is the bible of what's good
or healthy ready for comparing ourselves to a sick population that doesn't mean that we're healthy if
we are the same as them right so what we really want is this optimal level and assessing like doing
this assessment with a well-trained provider is so important because you're not going to get those
pro tips you're not going to get that added benefit if if you're seen just some run-of-the-mill
doctor that's not getting you answers if you ever hear get used to it you're getting old or oh that's
a senior moment please run the other way i will call absolute bs on that um because that is not
healthy aging i aged i saw what healthy aging was was in austria i lived in vienna austria as an
undergraduate student and i was hiking mountains with 80 and 90 year olds the only difference between
me and them was i got to the mountain top faster they were hiking with poles and it just took them a
little bit longer to get to the summit to have a pint of beer with me so that is the type of aging
that i want to promote in fact i've said i want to live to be 150 years old um because i've had the
privilege of sitting with my 90 year old patient saying you know doc had i known i was going to
live this long i would have taken a lot better care of myself you know and i'm humbled and honored
that they're sharing their you know trusting me with their health and but to have that it's a
responsibility if you hear that from a 90 year old you better wake up and start listening right and so
the folks on the on the all-time or summit my guess is either you have it or a loved one has it or
you see your loved ones going through it and you're looking at what can you do to prevent it and
all of the things that we're talking about that i will share in this interview are the things it's
the treatment it's also the prevention of how to live to 150 so with your brain and with your brawn
and with community so because we don't want to age like the typical american because you're so
right dr heather they are sick and diseased i mean the the average life expectancy in the us
has gone down the last two years right um i was talking to another physician and she was telling
me on the blue cross bruce shield their actuarial data showing for mild cognitive impairment the
average age you'll never guess is 47 years old this is the data in 2019 average age of beginning
mild cognitive impairment so you know this is not just 65 and older this is really affecting
all of us and that assessment that i laid out that's the beginning part but that is a big
piece of the puzzle um to really get an adequate and proper next step and then also what is the
right program for you to be on right i love it when someone comes in excited about prevention
right because we you and i know that we can prevent it in fact we know we can reverse it
but it's so much easier to prevent it's so much less expensive to prevent it's so and you get
not only do you get the benefits of cognitive function but you are stronger you are
you're healthier in general right when we treat the brain it's not separate from the rest of the
body and our approach is very much something that enhances cellular function and i know you're going
in that direction so tell me well nerve health first so let's talk about nerve health nutrients
so nerve health so you have heard all of these but you start with the b vitamins right b12 you
know i had a patient come in from new york city um after getting discharged from the hospital uh he
had hepatitis b and hepatitis c and basically was really wiped out in his 80s and really had
accelerated into dementia after this episode and you know wasn't dying so got checked out of the
hospital and they didn't really have much more for him so his son brought him out to the clinic here
and we did uh multivitamin mineral nutrient drips for him and we did four of them in a week
and at the end of the week in addition to other therapies but these big ibs it was like you know
people will call them a meyer's cocktail but i don't like that term because there wasn't really a lot
of nutrients in a meyer's cocktail so i call them a multivitamin mineral drip because it is a lot
of information coming in as far as a multivitamin mineral now and this is not what you get down
at the you know the id bar this is really medical grade um physician-derived uh medicine and in full
in that week um he came back he knew what time his flight was he was sharp he got his mind back
and his stamina when they got back to new york city they were able to walk four blocks without
any pause before that he didn't know where he was he didn't know what time it was what year
it was who the president was none of that and that was just a simple nutrient deficiency in
particular we had b5 b6 b12 b complex magnesium potassium calcium selenium multiple trace elements
vitamin c you know a typical multivitamin mineral drip in a naturopathic office but it was those
nutrients are specific for brain health um of course the mushrooms are i love mushrooms so you
got the shaga mushroom but uh you've got boswellia is another great nutrient and herb um you know i
can laundry list them i think a big component that a lot of people don't look and was not even
known about when i was in medical school was the end of cannabinoid system and professor musulam
out of israel who uh really named a lot of these molecules is one of my heroes and so i like to
mention him as many times as i can on the internet um we have him to thank for this discovery of the
endocannabinoid system and that underlies there are more receptors for endocannabinoid so this would
be like cbd uh black pepper is in that family i like the cbd and i'll stick with that there are
other endocannabinoid uh substances but in particular cbd is a great one for decreasing
neuro inflammation and um helping underlay the all of the hormones that we were talking about
those imbalances so that one oftentimes goes overlooked and not really considered a neurotropic
either yeah there are so many fun ones there um and how do you decide which patient should get
which one when we go into these neuro nutrients or no tropics as you mentioned do you use a
combo product or do you kind of individualize it how how do you not overlook something as great as
cbd yeah yeah so we really we do i call it the jung of the formula or direction and so you know
it's not the me too movement on uh extra supplements right um it's on you know it's concentrated meaning
there are high concentrations which is the general and then there's some
assistance and then micro assistance everybody moves you in a direction so that you know i'll
see people don't come in on 30 different supplements and they're super well researched and thought out
and there's some great research behind it but i kind of give the analogy of like you're treading
water you're keeping your head above the water which is important you're not drowning but you're
not really moving anywhere if you were doing like the freestyle moving in a direction and so that's
the jung of the formula so you want all of the therapeutics to be in the right order at the
right time and what's the next step and so then you take them long enough to get to a point where
you can reassess uh oftentimes people will abandon ship like i didn't notice anything different after
two days it's like well mrs jones it took you six decades to get to the state what was the expectation
after two days of use you know so sometimes it does take a little while to kind of backfill
those patterns that we've made over time and so you know will the the big guns vitamin d is a
big one that i use for brain health so a lot of folks don't really utilize it that way i don't
think about it that way but it is a great one you know it's misnamed it really is a
neuromodulator and hormone precursor in addition to all of the other benefits that vitamin d does
for our immune system our mood etc uh i developed a nasal spray called clearmind and this one was
specific where you know my expertise really out of bare necessity um with uh critsfield
jake of disease uh this condition is a rare condition this is what my wife passed of and
how i really just went deep in this topic and developed this fancy approach and really i'm
talking to people around the globe now is um cjd it's a prionic activity it's prions and prions
are misfolded proteins um and people there when you read about them they all say that well they're
infectious prionic activity it's like well why do they call it infectious it's not a bacteria
it's not a virus these proteins get misfolded and then they start signaling other proteins
to misfold well cjd is what it looks like is rapidly progressing dementia uh and it's nasty
i mean within it was like within two months saraya lost the ability to communicate and i mean i was
an 18 month run that we had with her and it's just not fun it's not a fun condition and it's rare
one in a million so you know you really don't get the diagnosis until the your loved one dies and
then they give you a brain biopsy to make sure it was that um and lo and behold that's what she had
i mean you're going to go through the differential and you wind up with some ominous ones at the
end of the road and you're like oh i hope it's not that well it was that um so i was looking at and i
had very high suspicion because i had never seen anything the way that she progressed she was very
high functioning super dynamic being on the planet and just for that much of a rapid decline
it wasn't like a psychotic break it wasn't hormones it wasn't mold you know these wasn't a hormone
imbalance like those are the starting spots in a dementia realm that you do that's what i put into
my assessment then it started getting into this like well you know maybe it's an auto immune
condition that rapidly progresses like that or it's prionic activity in cjd so i went like okay well
i've got everything going for auto immune with her so i better make sure i've got my basis covered
with the prionic activity and i put together and i have a patent pending on the nasal spray now
which is called clear mind it helps with brain fog focus memory issues speech for i have my
patients with Parkinson's are using it and their speech is improving so i knew i know it's it's
taking care of these prions in the brain now for psorias unfortunately it was just too late
um and it may have never worked for her but we're getting really great clinical results
with my patients now so that has a dmso and hocl and i've put some uh essential oil blends in
there too um but the dmso is dimethyl sulfoxide and it's a carrying agent it's called a shamp
chaperone molecule and then hocl is what our own immune system uh surrounds bacteria and viruses to
disassemble um but it's also shown to deactivate prionic activity so there's over two million
dollars of nih research on that molecule there for prion so it's you know prions are really um
they're ubiquitous in our environment you know if you've heard of mad cow syndrome that's what this
is in people it's also called sharpie um yeah sharpie in um goats and sheep no in sheep scrappy
sorry scrappy in sheep and then um you know there were some tribes in new guinea they don't do this
anymore but they used to eat the brains of the elders that passed and that was they were just
eating prion prions in that from their loved ones and then getting the critsfield jacob disease
from that um so that's a big addition and it was an amazing find um you know i was asking every day
for intuitive hits on what can i do for saraya and how can we help more people with this and
you know the whole event um the loss and i mean you know it was pretty it's a tragic story and i
didn't want my tragedy to be um for naught so i i'm really putting it to good use and uh want to
serve as many people as i can so that that new nutrient um the brain spray or the clear mind
nasal spray is what we call it um is really unique to our practice but i really want to help get
