get the word out so get that out that's really exciting and so beautiful you know you see these
horrible things happen to people certainly as a doctor i'm hearing stories of people losing
loved ones or diagnoses of cancer or dementia and really what you model here is that there's a choice
right you can choose to make it the worst thing that ever happens to you or you can choose to
make it the inspiration to do to show up in the world in a way that serves others and and really
make it part of the best thing that happened to you not not that i would ever suggest or wish that
on anyone but i think you understand right like that there's there's this choice in them in any
horrible situation that we're we're given or dealt um that we we can choose to make it something
positive and make an impact on the world so i just want to acknowledge and thank you for for
showing up that way thank you yeah in such the odd way it really cracked me open as a human being
and uh you know reinstated my faith in such a beautiful way so you know i'm forever grateful
for that yeah yeah so you also get excited about some of these like techie uh nerdy i don't know
how you want to describe it but like the lasers and i do too you know the lasers and the stem cells
and oh yeah fun um kind of things we can start to add you talked a lot about the fan the foundations
is kind of how i'm going to think about it with the fancy approach like we got to go through the
fundamentals yeah then when when we've gotten that what can we do to even optimize a little
bit more or what is the research telling us about the latest so this is so exciting and we live at
such an amazing time so we um what just came out in december was this discovery about these cells
which are very small embryonic like stem cells and these were i i did not know about these as a
student or graduate in 2001 when i graduated from medical school they were discovered in 2005 by
dr rattachak in the university of kentucky and these v cells are what we were created in mama's
belly in utero of how the fetus and how the baby develops are these very small embryonic like stem
cells so they can turn into any tissue in the body and they lie dormant we thought in our
kind of uh arrogance in medicine and science was oh those are just dormant cells they're garbage we
could just get rid of them what was discovered that you can actually turn them back on they lie
dormant and they're ready to go to work but you just have to get them turned back on so
how do they turn back on naturally is if like you have a heart attack or some damage to the heart
they will get activated in that sense and but then they go back to dormancy so what we have discovered
is you can turn them back on with a laser and we all have these v cells in our body lying dormant
but then you you turn them back on and then you can direct them with the laser for where you want
them to go so it's a laser activated and guided stem cell procedure and it is phenomenal we're
seeing really great results now i want to be clear we are not treating any diagnosis is or conditions
so i treat people and i give their body the information and then the body and it's innate
innate wisdom heals itself with the information so because it's a big deal i want to be really
clear on semantics and on my language around that um that said we are seeing amazing things we have a
not in the neurodegenerative front now one uh had a Parkinson's patient 30 minutes after the
procedure went from full-on tremors and advanced Parkinsonism to smooth gate face came back amazing
no tremor you couldn't even tell like he was just stunned on the video that we have on that
on my brain regeneration program so i also do an full body IVs and hyperbaric oxygen and photo
biomodulation which are pulsed electromagnetic frequency and low level lasers PEMF and LLT
it's a mouthful but lights you know really the future of medicine is in sound and light
and we're seeing it clinically really accelerating response time where things that
should have taken months or years are we're seeing some results in 30 minutes to four hours now
it's really phenomenal so incredible so the laser i think when you started mentioning laser
guided stem cells i in my mind i was thinking of photo biomodulation so using like red lights to
help with mitochondrial function and the psycho oxygenase enzymes yes but wait so what color light
is the laser i have no any question yeah it is a red light it is a red light laser but it is um
Dr. Todd is the inventor of this and it's a whole patented patented process and just big kudos to
Dr. Todd because he is sharing this with the world and discovered this so he created a laser that has
a coherence factor so a filter that creates a specific wavelength that we think is breaking a
ligand bond assault bond that frees up the V cell that activates it and so it's the frequency of that
laser so the red lights like a juve or red light therapy those are really important as well you
know Weber technology makes a helmet that's really awesome for folks you can do you know laser guided
in IV therapy and beam different colored lights in the body that way as well and all of those are
very effective just in this fancy approach this is what we've got in our kind of cutting edge
methodology how exciting i was actually reading a paper it was a review paper by
Mike Hamplin who's at Harvard who writes a lot about photobiomodulation and he I didn't read the
full russian paper because i think it's in russian but he refers to it and what they did was pretty
invasive they took through the femoral artery they took a light in there were 96 patients i think
and they cut them in half they controlled it and in half the patients they took a light through the
femoral artery and shown a red light in the brain and then on the other half they they did the same
surgery but didn't shine the light and sure enough in a hundred percent of the treated
patients there was a reversal of their cognitive decline that lasted for one to seven years wow
just phenomenal and you think this is just light like it's pretty and it's kind of seems crazy in
russian and invasive but it also is like wow like the potential of light especially when
i'm sure a lot of your patients are like mine their guts are kind of sensitive
so i can't throw a bunch of supplements at them but we can shine light yeah and it can be really
really really powerful yeah you know we truly are light beings you know we that we now can measure
light emitting diodes off of our dna like out of ourselves so you know it makes total sense to put
it back in for healing and that we would get these signals and of course we're diurnal right so
there's light that comes up with the sunrise and then down with the sunset and that a lot of that
is that those reds and oranges and that there would be benefit to being exposed to it it's
so exciting yeah so you know when when someone comes to your clinic what they call and talk to
your staff where or get a chance to talk to you um where do you point them to start because this
can feel overwhelming you know we do we offer consults for our patient base you know i really
try to produce a lot of online offerings too for like brain foundations and kind of just like the
basics foundational stuff to do at home environmental components we do a lot of education as well
so you know at at my website and you know even just calling the office so we i have a full team
here so it's not just me so i have a lot of heart center practitioners showing up and helping me
to get the word out and carry on these therapies because it is you know there are so many people
suffering with these conditions and need a lot of support and i don't want people to feel isolated
or alone now that said not everybody can come to portland oregon now one of the lovely things is
we do a lot of remote consulting now for folks so um you know coming to our website uh is okay if we
mention that here or yeah so that's nature cures clinic dot com um nature singular cures with an
s clinic dot com and we do have a book of call we do a 30 minute consult for folks so you know you
got to qualify for care we only want to work with folks that really want to make a difference so um
you know we do offer that too that's incredible that's wonderful and you know
i'm so curious about the clear my nasal spray like could i use it can i use it can it help me
feel a little clearer and a little more present every day so where do we get that you know that
one currently we we're building the store online um so currently that's through the office so you can
send an email to info at nature cures clinic dot com and um in the subject line put clear clear
mind nasal spray and just inquire right there yeah fantastic that i'm so excited to learn about a
few of these other things that that i hope i'll be able to share with my patients now you are also
the host of a neuro region summit and i'm curious you know i'm having so much fun talking to people
like you but i'm just so curious what was a standout what did you learn from interviewing
the experts that were on your summit you know this so this is a relaunch and i really um on my
second year running i really wanted to focus in on this frequency and light healing and also the
components of environmental toxicity so we really brought in a lot around emfs uh mounting mounting
evidence that it is not good for us as beings and our brains etc now that doesn't mean i'm a lewdite
but we do um provide a lot of great solutions on you know minimizing your risk turning it off getting
your wi-fi off at night time like you don't need to bathe in it all the time um you know putting
your phone on only checking at certain times and putting it on airplane mode because you know you
don't need to be reachable 24 hours a day even though you feel like it but i am before the internet
times here people and you do not need it all the time i will tell you that um we also one of the
big things just in in that vein um i got to speak with uh a neurologist dr chaudry um and she got to
go in uh to the ancient texts the vedic textbooks in india and she pulled out some of the oldest
mantras that are sound healing for all of our seven chakras and she actually has a great um
iTunes uh recording of it that you can sing along with her and you don't even need to have a good
singing voice you can just tone with the sound it's not religious at all and it's the sounds that
help balance the chakras and it's one of the oldest mantras on the planet and it's such a gift to us all
yeah wow thank you for telling us on to that so much value uh thank you for sharing your wisdom
your expertise your experience it's been an absolute pleasure getting to learn more about
you and your practice and all you have to offer thank you dr echo oh you are welcome i'm humbled
and honored that you had me on and i just want to you know last words of encouragement just know
there are tons of heart centered practitioners looking for solutions for you all out there
and just you know connect connect with us you know i'm really grateful uh for this summit
and the opportunity to uh reach you in your living room so thanks for listening gosh what an eye
opening interview with dr greg echo we learned why there should be lots of hope and reversing
alzheimer's disease what a gem next up we have another friend of mine dr chip whitney dr whitney
is a medical doctor who's also been trained by dr redison on the recode protocol after discovering
firsthand is in his clinic the impact of oral health on the whole body he's dedicated his work
to reminding people that health starts in the mouth dr whitney is going to share with us how things
such as sleep apnea oral health affect cognitive decline you'll discover the most important questions
to ask your dentist to help support your brain health and reduce or eliminate the little known
but very serious contributors to alzheimer's disease in case you feel you might miss any
of these incredible interviews during the summit don't worry you can pick up your vip all access
pass at a special discount right now you can have a lifetime access to the entire summit and all of
its bonuses now without further ado let's begin the interview with dr chip whitney so dr whitney
thank you so much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to be here to educate our attendees
on just this this super super important topic i i have my pleasure heather that i mean it's just
everybody needs to know the mouth matters the vet's got it a long time ago and now physicians and
late people need to understand too i think it's one of these things that comes up so often i've
read as people are aging and they're they're juggling like where do i spend my limited resources
i'm on a fixed income dental work is in is expensive it can be out of pocket if you don't
have the right insurance not everything gets covered by insurances so how i just briefly how
do you coach patients when do you say you know make this a priority this is really important
everybody because it really is as you'll hear as we talk further that it really has a big impact
on a lot of disease process i mean we're talking about Alzheimer's in this series but it impacts
cardiovascular disease cancer risk preterm labor complications of pregnancies not just an old person
i mean it impacts potentially everybody so the mouth really does matter it's the gateway to a
lot of diseases so here i am talking to a family physician and you are a key opinion leader in
dentistry so how did that happen some things get dumped in your lap and this was dumped into my lap
so i mean i've done preventive medicine for my whole career back to my Air Force days about
10 years ago i found and implemented a cardiovascular heart attack and stroke prevention program where
you can actually prevent that first heart attack and implemented in my practice well it looked at
things like biomarkers blood tests that really reflect as the Cleveland Clinic talks about a lot
inflammation in the arteries and there's two really important inflammatory markers one of
them is called plaque 2 basically it's if it's up you've got activated plaque in your arteries
and back at the beginning i was doing everybody was doing i was putting on drugs i was having
an exercise they were losing weight and nobody this number wasn't budgeting but the second i
pulled out those few slides during the about oral health in the training certification program for
for me and i started simply having people use a sonic brush use a couple of mouth rinses and
see their hygienists that number was plummeting left and right i mean it was barely budging even
with statin use which is kind of what at the time the treatment was but in lifestyles but it was
plummeting 10 times that amount with oral health so i was preaching the gospel for a year about
oral health and a consensus statement came out between american academy of periodontology the
gum dentist and american heart association trying to tell everybody that there is important connection
between the two confused everyone so i i ended up um writing an editorial that got published in
the dental organization that kind of led towards that but what i really recognize i had my aha
moment when i say i watched these numbers dropping i was like wait a minute why is this
occurring i mean i always have to ask the question why you do i do that's what dr reddison's
practices all our methods all about is why is this happening well i can't you know what i've known
for almost 30 years that if you get bacteria in the mouth from the mouth whenever you have
bite an apple or get the hygiene cleaning done bacteria launch into your bloodstream
and they can infect a diseased valve so that's why we give antibiotics when people have diseased
valves so i sat back and well what else do those bacteria do in health and that's where the whole
connection of the the gum brain the gum cardiovascular the gum cancer the gum preterm
complications of labor all that that's it when those bacteria that are causing inflammation
that you can see in your gums your hygienists can see your gums the bacteria it's an infectious
cause of those those bleeding gums that when they land in those end organs like the brain the
arteries in the organs they drive that same inflammation in those end organs it's so simple
but so important so you um you talked about a marker so this feels really actionable somebody
today could go to their doctor and say can you run this test for me so what is it again is it the
LP PLA2 it is it's the LP PLA2 admittedly people need to recognize most physicians aren't going to
know that test places like the Cleveland Clinic talk about it but it's a measure of inflammation
that almost always comes from activated plaque in the arteries that they can get that doesn't just
have to be done at Cleveland Clinic but it can be done in Quest lab core they run it also but
but again most physicians don't know what don't know what exists and don't know what to do about it
because frankly almost everybody in the 10 years I've been looking at this almost about 80 90% come
from the mouth and frankly I think the rest of them come from leaky gut I've had a handful of people
over the years where that member just won't bud despite great gums I really think that the other
end of the gut got being leaky causes this to conduit to also health starts in the mouth or
in the gut and the gut starts in the mouth right so there's another quick test that I think people
could do today at home and that's brush your teeth vigorously floss and then spit in the
sink and see if there's blood you know you have implored patients doctors dentists everyone involved
in your training module with Dr. Bettison not to tolerate blood in the sink tell us why
blood in the sink by definition there's a connection of whatever's in the mouth with
the bloodstream so whatever organisms there and there's thought to be about a trillion micro
organisms in the mouth alone that they're getting into your bloodstream they're spraying everywhere
and causing disease so whatever's there is getting in your bloodstream if it's there and
unfortunately way too many health professionals and patients don't understand the importance of that
so some people might think well if I'm vigorously brushing and I'm poking something around in my
gums of course I'm going to have blood and no actually that's not true I saw many people over
the years oh yeah I if I stop brushing and if I stop flossing usually the brushing doesn't do it
but if I stop the flossing for a while then I start getting some blood in the sink well that's
because you're allowing the infection to percolate and and and the infection causes inflammation
inflammation is what leads to the bleeding if you do your homeoral health whatever regimen is
recommended by the dentist or your dental team is you're not going to get bleeding when you do
those things so I I've seen it myself I get lazy for a bit and I start doing things I start to see
a little bit of blood in the sink and it's like oops there's my there's my barometer that's your
