woman too because yeah she spent her time thinking about her wonderful vacations your family history
is really fascinating this is how you got into the brain space and the relaxation space and
mindfulness and meditation was you have eight brothers and sisters is that right yes and then
your dad was the one who introduced you and I mean this would be before meditation was cool
before it was something that people knew about in most families that would be talked about so
can you just describe what that was like yeah well part of what I tell people is you have to
reframe your past so I always tell people I was blessed to be the son of an alcoholic you know
at the time when I was 12 years old I didn't think that but looking back because the the the sister
and the priest we were Catholic they came over sister Mary and father Fitzpatrick said Michael
we're going to teach you to do technology during meditation it was something called the silver
method and it's still in practice right now people do it he he he went there and he couldn't
relax so he was using alcohol as his prescribed his own personal prescription to de-stress and he
didn't work very well I mean he drank to the point of yeah we see this a lot in families right when
people are are addicted to any sort of substance whether it's pills or alcohol or heroin they're
really looking for an out they're looking to be more comfortable and that helps us create some more
compassion around substance abuse exactly there's a really good book called Finding Your Perfect High
by John Marshall and he talked about brain balance this was back in the 80s you know so and I and we
all had to read that book my dad was really big on everybody reading which was really good you know
I read books that you know people going through midlife crisis were reading but I read them in
high school because we would have family discussions around them you know we would have we had reading
assignments and because he thought the reason that in in his mother was a nurse but she was
addicted to prescription drugs because at that time the nurses could prescribe for themselves
she was actually at the around the same time she was sent home from the hospital to die
and she lived to be 90 like I said but and they took her off all her medicine and she lived they
told her she was too toxic she was going to die just in her home and and then she began to live so
we got we went from being really pharmaceutical driven family to a health because my dad when my
dad got the help my mother got into nutrition so we we had kind of the double whammy you know we
we got all the sugar out of our house all the dyes everything I mean I don't know if you remember
Yule Gibbons but I was voted to be the next Yule Gibbons by my high school class you know so you
know they're because I ate weird you know I didn't eat what they served I brought my own food ate
healthy not as healthy as I can eat now because we didn't know that much back then but it was
healthier than most and my dad my dad had made a really big effort to say you know the reason
he got in trouble was he didn't know and he want to make sure all of his kids knew and out of all
of our kid all of my brothers and sisters we only have one brother that for about 20 years
decided to go against the grain you know and not follow the meditation not not eat healthy
and he paid for it with gout and he's he's still alive but he's not in really good health
now he's trying to get healthy you know it's it's a lot easier to keep your body healthy than
try to repair it once it's broken down but I think that that really changed and my dad
it helped him so much he decided to go back to school got his degree in psychology and
started working with people and then that's how we began I really wasn't going to do what he did
I didn't really think that way but I went to school for electronics first that's why we have
electronics so my undergraduates in electronics then I went to school to get my degree in psychology
oh that's great and this is a brain tap is really this like magical combination of the two
this very creative combination I want to go back to sleep you know I've you talked a bit about how
important that is for detoxing the brain but there's a lot of people who struggle with getting
good sleep so what are the brain waves and what would be kind of what's going on with the use of
brain tap when you are trying to get sleep and hoping to improve it well one thing is they need
to have a sleep hygiene program if they're having trouble that means about two hours before sleep
they need to start preparing turn off any broadcast news anything that's going to be over exciting
maybe watch some comedies or something like that if you're going to watch tv there's a lot of
different ways start turning off lights in your home because what what happens if they're having
trouble sleeping is the body doesn't know it's sleep time you know what used to happen and this
is how we I've always thought about what is an ancient technology or an ancient tradition and
how can we make it modern technology if you and I were in the Serengeti again and it was nighttime
and we were out hunting and gathering or whatever we were doing we come back to the tribal village
we're going to have a fire and that fire is going to be crackling at a certain rhythm and cadence
that fire is actually a 10 hertz frequency when we when we built our first light and
sound machine we've measured the frequency of a candle because there's a meditation called the
jayote meditation and you look at it and what you do is you'd breathe and try to move the candle
and the flickering of the candle would put you into a deeper state of relaxation and meditation
then when they got leds we could imitate that so we could take people from a beta state
and disengage what's happening when they're laying in bed and they do it most people too
that are having trouble sleeping think you're supposed to go to sleep close your eyes and
you're dead to the world that's not really good the best way to go to sleep is to go to sleep
lay there process your day do some breathing exercises I usually teach them two different
breathing exercises now of course they're going to do breathing exercise when they do the brain
tap but let's say they don't have it because some of the listeners here might not have it
you lay in bed and there's something called box breathing which is pretty simple breathe into the
counter four hold to the counter four breathe out to the counter four then hold it to the counter
four and you just keep doing that box breathing while you're doing that you you scan your body
and you don't you basically focus when you focus on a part of the body energy follows
thoughts so as you think of that part of the body blood flows to that area circulation increases
and with basal dilation and blood flow relaxation follows so you're going to move up through the
body doing that the other one that a lot of more more people like this one than the other
it's the same process with the body but you breathe into the kind of four you're when you breathe in
you engage the sympathetic system so that's your survivor brain and that's that's probably already
activated but you want to activate it just to make sure that your brain knows and then when
you breathe out you breathe out to the kind of eight this engages the parasympathetic so that's
your thriving brain so we and as you do it what I tell people at the end of it just really try to
get it all out what happens then is we've all been in an experience where we're over frustrated and
we finally went I'm just tired of it well that's your body shaking it off and if you notice pets
your pets like especially dogs when they get nervous they'll shake they're doing the same thing
they're trying to shake off that energy and so with our bodies if we do that at night what'll
happen is eventually you won't make it up to your hips relax and you'll be out but you've trained
your body to unwind our body for those that know what a capacitor is uh like Elon Musk batteries
are capacitors they hold a charge and they discharge slowly our bodies are like a capacitor
they hold a charge and then we have to discharge them now hopefully we discharge them by walking
10 000 steps a day drinking half our bodies waiting water eating healthy foods all the thing you know
if we lived on the island with Gilligan and Mary Ann you know it would all be great but because we
don't our body keeps getting interrupted these natural patterns keep getting interrupted interrupted
so at night we can at least bring balance back to our bodies and what will happen is even though
we're asleep your body will continue the process of relaxing so when you wake up the morning you
don't have clenched teeth you don't have a we work with people that they wake up in a ball like a
fetal position they don't understand it and they're telling me they've been doing it for years and
that's because they're going through trauma while they're sleeping because the kinetic energy that
is built up throughout their life has never been discharged so you that's why exercise we all know
people that were really negative or having a bad time in their life they started an exercise protocol
and pretty soon they're all smiles and happy because your your physiology does affect your
psychology and vice versa so it's best to do both that's great yes a couple other people on the
summit here have been talking about sleep apnea and oxygen at night and i think the combination of
both of these things cleanups are really relaxed get into the right state at night and then keep
your airway open you're going to get you know we don't think of sleep as a very productive time
but if you can really harness the potential of the detox and of the that resetting for the next day
your brain is going to be in a much better place in the morning yeah and i think too
unfortunately over time especially during the 70s and 80s and 90s people would brag about how much
sleep they didn't get like i only slept five hours i only slept six hours i mean in college we
can get away with that as we get better looking more intelligent with age we have to sleep more
you know that's you know that's and so like myself it's not always eight hours we we just
finished a study in australia that's going to we're writing it up to be published but it was with
mind workers who work in coal mines and when we were doing our baseline studies we're using
something called the bio strap we partnered with them in the study and during that most of the people
were sleeping seven to nine hours a night but still scoring on the insomnia scale so in that that
proved us something i already knew it's not time in bed it's depth of sleep so you need one hour
of deep sleep over time it's not all at one time it's over time and then two hours minimum
REM sleep and now you're producing enough of those neurotransmitters to have the
to the mood regulation we all it's normal to be depressed it's not normal to stay depressed
you know it's kind of like we flow in and out of these states of consciousness and if we can do that
usually it's measured by something called heart rate variability for those that are listening you
if you're able to get stressed and then relax that's great if you're not able to do that then
you don't have that regularity that you need that ability to adapt to the environment in front of you
dr porter this is so helpful really fascinating work that you're doing and so beneficial i mean
i have walked brain tap transform lives in my clinical practice and so it's really an honor
and a privilege to have you here today thank you so much for taking the time well it's great to be
here and we have a mission of bettering a billion brains so we need to at any age we need to better
their brains spread the word i want our listeners to know where they can find more about you and
about brain tap well they can go anywhere online at dr dr patrick porter dr porter they can check
out my website they can also if they want they can go get a free book and a 15-day trial on our app
for 99 cents and they get to keep the book no matter what they they can download it that's over at
brain tap dot pr o they can they can head over there and get a free copy and we're pretty much
if they just do hashtag brain tap they're going to see thousands of reviews out there and people
that are using it that's awesome that's so great thank you so much again for creating this for
doing the work you're doing to better brains and uh for being here with us today well thank you for
allowing me to i just can't believe all we're learning today wasn't dr porter wonderful he just
shared some incredible takeaways on how to improve your cognitive function in just six weeks how to
heal your brain at any age how to use light and sound to heal your brain how stress affects the
brain and what to do about it our next guest is dr greg echo he's a naturopathic colleague of mine
and has deeply personal reasons for dedicating his career to refining solutions for neurodegenerative
diseases dr echo will reveal why there should be lots of hope in reversing dementia and how it might
be possible to regenerate your brain using your own stem cells let us know in the comments below
what you've been most inspired by today what's moved you or helped you to see things in a new
light we'd love to hear from you and how this empowering information is supporting you as a
caregiver health professional or a patient let's begin the next interview with dr echo
dr echo it is such a pleasure to have you oh thank you so much so you were an obvious
you know a list of on people to invite because our i think our interests are so aligned you know
both being naturopathic doctors both really really inspired and and um deeply passionate about
neurodegenerative disorders and getting people the solutions that they need i think one of the
things that i'm talking to all of our guests with is how you know we see it every day we almost take
for granted that there are solutions whereas many of our listeners haven't heard that that this hope
that there's hope before so i'm just really thrilled to dive in uh to the depths with you on
everything that you're seeing clinically and all of the new and exciting things that you're helping
people with oh i love it you know it is so important i i know firsthand you know you
in my bio you uh shared some of my story there and you know being in medicine for 20 plus years
i i saw that the system was broke but when you go through it with a loved one you really feel it
and it hits you hard of like oh we this is really so fractionated and there isn't a lot of hope you
know i'm now talking to patients around the globe and you know you kind of get a diagnosis and you
get parked especially in this neurodegeneration realm and there's no people get really isolated
and overwhelmed and depressed right uh because there aren't there's no solution in western medicine
and really i swung for the fence and unfortunately what i discovered did not help saraya but it is
helping thousands of patients now and so i love that you have the summit and we're going to talk
about my fancy approach to neurodegeneration and brain health and really provide a lot of options
things to pursue consider and and hope you know i like to say i treat heart-centered beings moving
through time and space so it's not disease pieces and parts and when you treat a heart-centered being
because that's who people are as a heart-centered being that is really where the magic happens that's
where there's so much synergy and intuition that can come into play but also by listening deeply
you can really figure out what's the exact path for this person sitting in front of me great it's
so individualized what is best for that particular person and that so it requires understanding
their history really listening and hearing that story i'm curious about your approach
you call it the fan c approach to neuro and brain regeneration can you break that down for us how do
you yeah so f stands for functional and that's that component of helping heart-centered dynamic
beings like deep listening and really individualizing a program for them now the framework gets set up
in the a that's for assessment n is for nerve health that's different information that we put
into the body to help the nerves and then it's a dash c and c is for cellular regeneration so
we'll unpack each one of those as we go forward here but i really do you know everybody wants to
know what can i take what is the pill what you know what's going to make this go away doctor and
you know we're seeing that system doesn't work it doesn't work for chronic illness and disease
so that functional approach really it's the naturopathic chinese medicine functional medicine
integrated medicine whatever the moniker or label du jour i call it naturopathic medicine
which is treating whole dynamic heart-centered beings moving through time and space and that
aspect is really it brings the heart back into medicine and you really you get to sit you or
you're empathetic you're listening and you're understanding what's going on not you know we
could have 10 people in the room and develop 12 different treatment regimes for them because they're
so unique they've got their heritage they've got their genetics they've got the epigenetics
they have the environment they have their early childhood components they have their
adolescence they have their adulthood you know so there's i kind of give the analogy is how full
is your cup you know all of the and then they have their diet they have their mindset they have
their exercise they have certain traumas throughout their life that all pours water into the cup
and when your cup is full it runneth over and that's where the symptoms come in so we want to
address well what's in that cup for them so that's the assessment and in the assessment in particular
for neurodegeneration people are just not getting worked up you know in Alzheimer's mild cognitive
impairment dementia Alzheimer's you know some of the background stuff that really needs to get
discovered are you know lime is the great masquerader mold toxicity are big things chronic viral
issues so that would be in assessment now the three main pillars that i look at for everybody with
a brain are heavy metals the microbiome and hormones now these are the three legs of the stool
in the fancy approach now those first ones that i mentioned those are things to consider if it's in
the history not everybody we don't need to do a seven to ten thousand dollar work up on everybody
coming in to see us so you know a lot of folks in the functional realm and allopathic realm will
just say well we're going to throw the kitchen sink at it at them and basically them is treated as it
right as a product in the machine and so i really stress like we want to make a program for you
so it is individualized but the three starting spots heavy metals when i learned in environmental
medicine in the n hanes data in north america that the levels of toxicity of metals are through the
