kidney etc they'll be able to and this is why we can see that kids recover way faster than older
people recover from the same thing their system has more resilience to it so there's something
about aging that even if someone does never disease there's less homeodynamic capacity
in the system right it can handle a less amount of stressor and still be able to come back without
symptomology so aging we wouldn't say is disease we would say it's an increased
susceptibility to disease of all kinds because the system just has less resilience
we can say that disease is not just about the decrease of the resilience of the system it's
the system actually having been not resilient and moved outside of the homeodynamics that a
healthy person is in now it's an altered homeodynamics or pathophysiology which we'll
call a disease state so the disease state means that some stressors were more than the body's
capacity to respond to and now there's an altered function of the physiology so there's a generalized
and a specific way we can deal with that the generalized way is how do we support the body's
resilience capacities that are general that are across the scope of everything and so most of the
like basics of health recommendation like exercise increases your you know if you're
exercising where you're increasing your mitochondrial density your mitochondrial quality you're
increasing your oxygen transport and your vasodilation that's going to decrease your likelihood
and susceptibility to disease of all kinds right the same with sleeping enough the same with stress
reduction the same with good diet and basic nutrition so it's how do we support health which
is how do we support the resilience of the system writ large in general and then how do we identify
the specific unique stressors that took this this system out of homeodynamics into altered
homeodynamics or disease state and how do we reverse those specifically so we use diagnostics
for the second part and we use general lifestyle work for the first part
and imbalance I love your your definition of balance and then also imbalance right that too
much too little in the wrong place and at the or at the wrong time is part of what leads to a
disease process so very simply we can think of diabetes right is too much sugar for too long
and of course scurvy is going to be too little vitamin C and these are kind of big examples
that are very obvious but there's going to be a gradation in between a spectrum in between where
you can have too little b12 or choline or magnesium or something else that is going to show up as a
as a small symptom at first but can later lead to a bigger disease process the kind of where our
interests intersect here right you this sort of imbalance you can apply to financial systems
education systems government systems if you have too much too little in the wrong place or at the
wrong time you're going to create imbalance and if we can focus on those things that really are
essential to maintaining balance and whether it's communication which is in in the body's in the
example of the body in the complex system that is the human body this communication system
is going to be the nervous system or the endocrine system with the hormones right where are we getting
those signals to tell our neurons to make more neurotransmitters or to connect create a synapse
and those things need to be in balance if they aren't that leads to disease
yeah so the topic you bring up right now is something that i would say naturopathic medicine
orthon molecular medicine functional medicine have started to popularize and pioneer but it's
so critical we should underscore it here is the idea of a um a subclinical imbalance and what we
mean by this is we know the level of vitamin c deficiency required to cause scurvy scurvy
meaning the formal disease definition that the person is now acutely dying of vitamin c deficiency
and it's actually pretty hard in the modern environment to get scurvy um you eat in orange
a couple times a year and you'll be fine right um so you've got scurvy down here but then we
can say what is the optimal vitamin c level for maximum health and it's pretty reasonable that
there's a pretty big difference between i'm acutely dying of vitamin c deficiency acutely dying
not chronically right not like it has just decreased general health maybe asymptomatically
that will have effects on lifespan but i'm now acutely dying of it there's a pretty big range
between that disease diagnosis and where optimum is and that if i'm anywhere within there i'm sub
optimal but not yet a definable disease so if i'm only looking at rickets and berry berry
and scurvy as signs of deficiency then i'll come up with the rda that we have and say that nobody
has nutrient deficiencies and it's just nonsense they don't have acute dying of nutrient deficiencies
but they might be very very far from optimal and that might make a pretty big difference to how
likely they are to get a autoimmune disease or cancer or a neurodegenerative disease or
psychiatric disease or just low grade energy or live less long and there are more areas where
that's starting to be recognized like metabolic syndrome you don't quite have diabetes yet
but you have a subclinical excess of glucose in the blood and maybe your baseline levels of
insulin have raised because of insulin resistance and so what we'd say is that and another classic
example is let's say we're talking about lead poisoning well there's a there's a level that
is basically the result of political lobbying legal lobbying of what do we consider the level
of lead poisoning to now get an insurance diagnosis where someone is going to have to pay workman's
comp or someone can be sued for negligence right like that we get into law criminal law
whatever lobbies are involved to say why did we set the parts per million here as opposed to here
and we can see that the parts per million of what was considered toxicity for mercury got
raised many times in the us because we kept creating industry that exposed people to more
levels and so long as it didn't cause immediate acute symptoms of poisoning then we could say okay
well it's not toxicity so the idea is that there's a level of deficiency that takes you into
instant disease but there's a level that doesn't take you into instant disease it might take you
into no signs of symptoms but to suboptimal resilience which means increased likelihood for
any number of diseases down the road but it's very hard to ever prove that because
that's going to be one of many factors that ends up affecting the nature of the disease you get so
you have very delayed causation which means very hard to prove causation right and so the same with
toxicity there might be a toxicity where you say okay here's the level of mercury or lead that is
in acute poisoning meaning you have symptoms your hair is falling out you're puking from the poisoning
what is the optimal level of lead or mercury exposure of those kinds in the body well it's
none right so how much higher is someone's exposure level if they're operating in industry or around
certain kind of chemicals then is ideal well it might be very far from what we would call acute
poisoning but it still might be a subclinical toxicity and then the same is also true with
infections and infections are kind of even more surprising because with infections there has been
this general kind of view in infectious disease that in infection means a pathogen enters the body
and you have immediate acute symptomology but we all know now that you can have an infection
that is say viral say HPV that increases your probability for cancer years or decades down the
road that is asymptomatic the entire time so is that that would we would call a chronic infection
that is statistically affecting the likelihood for certain types of disease the same with say
chronic subclinical H pylori increasing the likelihood for stomach cancer
and so as time goes on diseases we didn't think were correlated we start to find correlations
with some of those things but there's a lot of those that we have not found in medicine as a whole
yet but people at the cutting edge who are paying attention are starting to find these things so
subclinical infections subclinical deficiencies and subclinical toxicities are all really key
aspects of what take people out of optimal resilience increase their likelihood for disease of
various kinds are going to be multifactorial because they might have many different subclinical
deficiencies and toxicity simultaneously none of those would normally ever be assessed or treated
in a traditional allopathic framework and yet if i'm looking at why did this person come down with
chronic fatigue syndrome or autoimmune disease or cognitive decline these are probably where the
answers live you mentioned how industry influences so much of how we might interpret certain labs
and how and rda's or you know the cutoffs and thresholds where we consider it a disease process
or or significant there is quite a few ways in which society is structured that makes us sick
keeps us sick and really prevents us from getting the help we need at times and this is another
place where you inspire me because it can get very overwhelming and i think can feel paralyzing
to many people who are stuck in this trap however there are solutions i've seen it with my own eyes
i see it every day in my clinical practice and at marama and and we can work together to to solve
these problems but i also want to call them out so that people feel you know that they're not alone
you and i have worked together with patients who are trying to get life insurance and because
they've been proactive they've seen a chiropractor they've seen a therapist you know they've they've
gotten medications to prevent disease or to help to optimize their their physiological function
now they're being you know they're not they're either not getting disability insurance or they're
struggling to get life life insurance and this really i watch this i've told patients in my office
you know let's wait on the testing go ahead you have a new child get your life insurance
and then come back and we'll do all of this because your other doctor's telling you you're fine
you have symptoms so we need to treat them we need to figure out what's going on but we've
got to kind of go through this whole process that really is not designed to support healthy human
beings and so uh i just i want to i want to let people know that like they're not alone in that
that you know cheap food is not healthy for us but it's what's simple easy to grab and inexpensive
and healthy food it takes a little bit more effort it takes a little bit more money takes a little
bit more of that that you know you have to stick with it um takes a little more motivation but
it's so worth it and there are a handful of things including applying this model to complex
disease when you're not getting answers that really if you put in that effort extra effort
there are solutions well i mean this is kind of the um
the classic libertarian socialist dialogue of to what degree are we just self-determined and
can pull ourselves up by our bootstrap and to what degree are we influenced by the larger social
systems and environment we're in and it's obviously both and it's a reciprocal relationship between
both so i think everybody thinks that it's pretty clear that if you're born into an area into a
society where all of your water has malaria or guinea worm in it you're likely to have different
kinds of diseases and health issues as a result of where you're born um or lead i mean if there's
lead in the pipes and you're born there one point of lead in your blood starts to influence your IQ
so your potential what schools you get into what jobs you can get your earning potential
the rest of your life is influenced by that early lead exposure which is happening right here in the
u.s. today so i started with the malaria case because it's obvious and because it seems more
foreign to us we actually kind of really see it and the lead case is less obvious and because
you know we we don't necessarily have as big a reference for it but that it's the same thing so
let's say we take a more extreme example and look at flin michigan we're like okay we can see that
there's a thing there that is affecting the public health of everyone who lives there
so then we start to say well all right well if
as soon as uh commercial agriculture better living through chemistry started where we started using
ddt and then malathion parathion and now glyphosate whatever on almost all of the crops
is this going to have an effect on the human health of the people who live in that system at scale
yeah of course it is um and as soon as we start having a food system where the majority of the
food that people eat is processed and the processed food doesn't have anything similar in terms of its
macronutrient micronutrient profile is that going to start affecting health at scale of course
and it's important for people to understand that if i run a corporation in the u.s as a director
of the corporation i actually have a legal responsibility a fiduciary responsibility
to the shareholders to maximize the profit of that company it's a piece something i sign in
law that i'm breaking the law if i don't do it so if i'm the ceo or director of a major corporation
say nesli or hostess or mars or whatever it is right uh as a food company i have to work to
maximize its profit legally to be responsible to the shareholders money who's in it now to
maximize the profit i need to maximize the total number of customers buying the thing multiplied
by the total lifetime value of the customer lifetime value of the customer is how many
things they purchase how often there is nothing that maximizes lifetime value of a customer more
than addiction and particularly the younger the addiction can start the better so now you start
to look at the proliferation of uh soda and fast food and you know that type of thing and you're
like well this humans have an evolutionary weakness because we grew up in an we evolved
in an environment where famine was a real thing and so it was very hard to get enough fat or enough
salt or enough sugar in the evolutionary environment oftentimes it was always easy to get enough
cellulose right there was like green planty stuff pretty often but hunting is much harder
and and wild meat has lower body fat percentage and so we got we evolved a dopamine response
to things that have salt fat and sugar because that's where we would survive and have be able
to survive famine better well now post industrialization we created a world where we don't have a
deficiency of salt and fat and sugar we have excess of them and so then we get the but our
genetics haven't changed where we still get a hit you get a dopaminergic hit and so if you notice
all fast food is a combination of those three things just different combinations of salt fat
sugar with different types of palatability that are kind of split test optimized for addictive
maximization and we would hope that if there's multi-billion dollar organizations in the healthy
society that they have the vested interest of the well-being of the people in mind this is obviously
not the case they have the vested interest of extracting capital from those people which happens
through in this case optimizing for addiction and we can go through and look at that when it has to
do with the more that a company can externalize its cost to the commons as environmental pollution
the more profit it makes rather than spend the money it takes to actually process that waste
but then that equals public health issues for everybody and so we have a world where
nutrient deficiency and toxicity if not just the glyphosate that is put on the food it's the fact that
the paint in these buildings has volatile organic compounds that are all from petrol derived
chemicals that we have no evolutionary relationship in our genetics with and these volatile organic
compounds are mostly either carcinogens endocrine disruptors or neurotoxins and that it's
ubiquitous in the way we manufacture everything because it's an externalized cost nobody has
to pay for nobody's accountable for and so this is like all right well I have a hard time taking
responsibility for all those aspects of the world that I'm a part of right and so part of the answer
has to be systemic change right how do we actually change the nature of food manufacturing and
agriculture to have the well-being of the people in mind rather than not in the maintenance of the
soil the microbiome and the nutrients of the soil and how the food is processed and not having
addiction maximization associated with the profit structure and then materials manufacturing of how
we make homes and the nature of industries not having a financial incentive to externalize the
cost to the commons so not the whole so the whole solution is not simply what an individual can do
right a lot of it has to be systemic and if we dealt with that systemically just like
in our societies today western societies malaria is not really a thing even though it's totally
a killer in some places can we change the environment in a way that absolutes whole classes of
disease of course we can now in modern society do we have whole new classes of disease like
chronic fatigue and things that are pretty starting to become very ubiquitous that are totally uncommon
in other less developed environments yes that's because of different environmental factors
so of course right now most of the people on your call probably aren't working on how they're
empowered to do systems change for materials manufacturing but it's important to know that's
a part of the picture of what has to shift what you're trying to do with them now is within the
context of the world we're in how do we at least understand those factors so you know they might
be affecting you so you can take responsibility for it and if you're going to repaint your house
use non-boc paint maybe you run an air filter inside maybe you test for mold before you move
into an area maybe you pay attention to whether the food is organic and if you have a water filter
in those various things so other things that we can do you know just thinking about what do we
have the power to do right now while we wait for systemic change and one of the things is to be
well informed and part of that is getting a complete assessment and the next five days of the summit
are going to be deep dives into the different assessments we can do and so when we talk about
imbalance and complex chronic disease in particular Alzheimer's there's essentially five things that
can cause disease or imbalance and their toxins nutrients infections structure and stress and
