so when I work with a patient we break it down and we want to get information about each and
every one of those pieces and so we'll be I'll be interviewing you know 39 other people this week
and talking about each of those pieces but Daniel you and I work to come up with that model to make
this very complex sort of overwhelming process of categorizing what are the things that are
going to inform our treatment and also inform the etiology how did this happen where did the
imbalances start yeah and I would say that is a very good clinical model to work with that
is kind of the applied side of some theoretical models that have a different number of categories
in them where it's not I'm saying this to simply say it's not an arbitrary taxonomy it is a useful
applied taxonomy resulting from some very non-arbitrary taxonomies of how do we understand
how a complex system self-organizes how the self-organization breaks down and can we create
models for looking at those factors that are necessary and hopefully sufficient something
like complete models and so what you were mentioning stress I think one of the things
that I was fascinated by earliest regarding human health was placebo trials and there are
some placebos where people feel better but they don't actually get better the underlying
pathophysiology doesn't change just their own sensorial process does so endogenous opioids or
whatever but there are some situations where the placebo actually makes people get better from
at a statistically higher rate from some underlying physiologic things going on meaning
we can see changes in objective biomarkers and this really fascinated me because I'm like
genetically the body has an imperative to survive that's its maximum imperative right
survive and reproduce but survive is fundamental to that there's nothing in the chemistry of that
sugar pill that should have empowered the body to heal better why is it if it's healing better
after giving the sugar pill with the belief that means it was not healing to its maximum
capacity before what is that like why would the body's genetic imperative to survive not be self
optimizing and there's a whole deep discussion of what's actually happening in placebo that's
very interesting but kind of the main thing that was the first interesting insight there for me was
that placebo is not equally effective across all audiences and placebo is not the only thing that
is effective of that kind so when someone has a placebo and it works they feel it works proportional
to them believing in it which is why we've seen that larger pills and more colored pills and if
the injection is actually more painful all those things actually increase the likelihood of the
placebo because the people are believing a real thing is happening if they believe they're going
to get better there's a hopefulness that increases that hopefulness replaces some of the worry that's
there worry is the projection of a negative future worry moves the person into a more sympathetic
nervous system state as they feel hopeful they go into a more parasympathetic nervous system
state well the parasympathetic system is key for regulating the immune system the digestive system
the detox systems the all the way down to genetic transcription and so it's not that the person
wasn't healing at maximum before it's that they were healing at maximum with the fact while being
in a sympathetic state which is dealing with the toxin of those kinds of stressful thought processes
that are keeping this body from going into the kinds of neurologic states that are necessary
for its own reparative systems to be optimized but then we got to see that you look at studies
like Norman Cousins where people just started laughing a lot watching comedy and their cancer
got better and they weren't believing they were going to get better but they were feeling better
so we get to see the belief they were going to get better was actually just one way to get to
the feeling better which was the more parasympathetic state and then we see spontaneous remission
stories where someone had cancer whatever they fell in love and got better and we're like oh
there's a there's a similar thing happening here which is the body can heal a lot better
when it is less sympathetic more parasympathetic overall well there's a lot of psychological
things that are keeping people in low-grade sympathetic overtone that are affecting the
system's regulatory capacities as a whole and so if we're not looking for that if we're not
paying attention to that we're just we're just missing whole categories of what's going on
and in the same way let's say that we're trying to help someone heal and we aren't trying to
figure out if their house has mold in it and maybe we see signs of inflammation in their body
and maybe we see signs of biotoxin maybe whatever and we're trying to deal with it but we aren't
looking at the environment they're in well they're just never going to get better
let's say that we're not looking at do they live in a household with weird codependent
relational dynamics associated with food where everybody in their household is obese
and nobody exercises and they actually don't have the willpower to change their behavioral
pattern inside of that relational environment so if you don't actually change their relationships
their relationships are a primary cause of their illness right so the physical environment can be
the social environment can be their own internal stressors can be psychological stressors including
ones that they aren't even aware of meaning unresolved trauma from the past that has just created
chronic hypervigilance right and heaps of different categories of physiologic things like
subclinical nutrient deficiency subclinical excess of toxicity or pathogenicity so if
we really want to be comprehensive in assessing what's going on for someone got to look at all of
that right we have to look at all the different categories of what might be subclinically imbalanced
in their physiology and in their psychology and in their social environment and in their physical
environment and that's kind of like a minimum taxonomy to start to make sense of these things
and in order to do that the doctor has to spend a real chunk of time the patient and this is the
tricky part is that we don't have enough doctors who have the training to do that and we just don't
have enough doctors period or a financial system where most people could pay for a doctor's time
to be able to do that and have it make any sense but like you just you can't run labs on all that
right like I can't run a quick lab on what the social environment that is embedding someone in
behavioral patterns or in stress patterns is like that takes time asking a lot of questions
you know I find and I know you do that by far the number one most important diagnostic tool in
the world is a comprehensive medical history and that takes in a very educated healthcare practitioner
spending a lot of time and you know what exposures did you get and what injuries and what
surgeries and when did your symptoms start and trying to really piece that whole thing together
and then running the labs and then contrasting the labs to that story and to their current
symptomologic presentation and what makes it better and what makes it worse and seeing does
this story make sense before we start treating another component of that is doing the right
things but in the right order as well so if we jump straight to treating Lyme disease or treating
an infection when we haven't supported the immune system by getting rid of toxins and reducing
stressors or balancing stressors we haven't supported nutrients then it's going to be
really challenging if not next to impossible to get actual disease resolution but to actually get
rid of those microbes to get rid of those bugs if we don't have the system working with our
antimicrobial agents whether they're pharmaceutical or supplemental or herbs or whatever it is and so
if we're jumping straight to our favorite diagnostic tool or favorite diagnosis as a
provider again like you mentioned we're just missing this entire problemscape right and that
being as comprehensive as possible we're doing a clinical trial on reversing Alzheimer's
currently in my practice and what we see over and over is that the more comprehensive we can be
the faster the easier we get real results so putting all of it together is so essential
and yet unfortunately although it's common sense it is not yet common practice
word of operations is important and you know like let's say the system let's say there's a
number of different factors going on maybe there's a couple heavy metals that are elevated maybe there's
a handful of volatile organic compounds and environmental toxins that are elevated maybe
there's a handful of infections there's some deficiencies there's some structural issues
we don't have to treat every single one for the person to get better sometimes you just start to
de-burden the system and as you de-burden the system the regulatory apparatus can handle the
rest of the burden better right and so oftentimes you look at the whole thing and you start to say
what are the things that make most sense to address first and as you address those you start to see
increase the other things start to get better before you even treat them right if if I like I
might be looking at eight of those things that all have to go through the same detox pathways
I start to address some of them and those detox pathways become unburdened they can deal with
other ones better absolutely and this is a great argument for prevention right if we can address
these things earlier then the system has more resilience and we get much more resolution
a lot quicker and so when we stop the focus being so much on the diagnosis and the symptoms and more
on the resilience of the system and that becomes our metric then we get the outcomes are just so
much better and it's hard to prove prevention right because you don't have a disease that you're
reversing um but my my greatest hope is that our contribution to this space is that if we can show
we can reverse Alzheimer's we can convince more people that what they can prevent it I
believe strongly that Alzheimer's is optional and if we can intervene when people are in their 30s
and 40s we can make that a rare disease yeah the thing I was going to say there about sequences
there are general rules of thumb of sequence but they're only general
principles they're never absolute and so one has to be careful to not try to get too
formulaic about it if you're looking at the GI system you can say as a general trend things
that are upstream of the GI system will affect things that are downstream more because there's
kind of a flow to it so if you have an infection in your mouth maybe it's more likely that it'll
create an infection in your stomach if your stomach's not working well you're going to have
undigested stuff going into the small intestine so in general the idea that you treat the front of
the one directional flow channel before treating the end that's a generally good principle but it's
not always true sometimes you have to treat something in the appendix before anything else
because it's really timely sometimes there is something that is acute enough in another part
of the system that de-burdening it de-burdens the whole system and similarly like it generally
makes sense to treat the mucosal immune system before trying to treat the blood because otherwise
you just if the mucosal immune system is in balance you have leaky tight junctions you'll
just keep getting stuff dumping into the blood but sometimes there's something in the blood that is
actually down regulating the immunocytes ability to produce secretory immunoglobulins in the mucosal
system and you actually have to deal with that first so it's valuable to have as practitioners
these general rules of thumb but really you have to take each case uniquely and then you have to
really pay attention to what is working and what's not and you have to not get married to your favorite
hypothesis where then even if the person isn't getting good results you just say it needs patience
or you explain the bad symptoms as a healing crisis maybe it's a healing crisis maybe you're
doing the wrong thing and so there there has to be like very much like Bruce Lee discussed with
Jeet Kune Do there's a formless form where you don't get attached to there's one particular form
it's like what is the right move next and that's what real mastery looks like is I don't know ahead
of time what the right move next is what I'm going to do is look at all the factors I'm
going to have a model that helps inform all the things I can consider but then it's the entirety
of clinical experience and judgment and discernment that is going to inform that and then really paying
attention and the thing that I would say is it's like damn that's kind of like difficult and hard
to automate and expensive right now for people and that's true and there's a lot of things that
we think of as incurable that are really only incurable because they're
hard like it just takes work and it takes a lot of assessment and
but I think the fact that we can see people getting better pretty regularly with a lot of
these things means it's not incurable and the people who are going through that work now are
helping to prove with enough statistic that these things aren't curable that that starts to motivate
economies of scale to catch up right to start to motivate changes in medical model and medical
research at large and better diagnostic methods that can bring the cost of diagnostics down
that can train more doctors up and change the nature of medical school so everybody who is
taking the time to work on it now one should feel really lucky that they're at a time where
there are any doctors that have better solutions because 10 years ago that wouldn't have been the
case or 20 years ago that wouldn't have been the case and should also feel like they are beyond
just helping themselves and their family member helping to contribute to a change of paradigm
that will make this easier and more accessible for a lot of people in the future it is an exciting
time because they I do believe that we are we are changing the paradigm and when you talk about the
cost and expense of this at a societal level we cannot afford for as many people to have Alzheimer's
as are about to and not just it's going to frankly bankrupt Medicare but also we're squandering this
extremely valuable resource by putting our seniors in assisted living facilities where they're parked
in front of TVs and fed cake and cookies and visited by loved ones you know the statistics
the average is once every six months it's not even every Sunday it's every six months
and of course with COVID it's been even worse however you know that is optional again like
this it doesn't we can do better than that society can be better we can bring these people back into
society where they can contribute if they want they can continue to work they can you know add value
to their families they can care for young children they can be engaged and they can pass on the
wisdom and experience that they have accumulated over a lifetime and give that back and the fact
that you know forget the dollars the fact that right now we're squandering that resource I think
that is more expensive than we can afford right and putting investing a little bit you know it ends
up being we're doing this in the clinic so for someone with diagnosed dementia it's about $25,000
to take them through this process we can put a number on it now and that will get you usually
some reversal and if if we can do that for at scale this will save Medicare money this will
save people the money they're going to pay to us you know a subpar memory care facility
it will save the heartbreak of this very long and awful disease called Alzheimer's and so I
am so grateful to you for inspiring me to take on these really challenging problems things like
Alzheimer's and brain degeneration and to find solutions not only for this but but for medicine
in general. Now Alzheimer's is so interesting at a societal level to just to just continue with
where you were going such a high percentage of people that are experiencing some form of cognitive
decline that is significant as a part of their aging right now and increasing to where most
young and middle-aged people can forecast cognitive decline to mention Alzheimer's as
the end of their life
and I think it's hard not to fall into nihilism if you actually think about that when people stop
having something to look forward to they have to go into disconnecting and numbing out and so then
then like the only response to nihilism other than suicide ends up being hedonism
right because there's nothing to look forward to then fucking go for it enjoy what you can
and then that ends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy that drives the addiction cycles and the
whatever that ended up leading to that happening later and I really do think it is not
a necessary outcome and so I think it's important that people can actually look forward to their
older years being good and meaningful and not lonely ones and not useless ones I think when
you look at the evolutionary history of humans the old people and the kids being in connection
was the center of a tribe that was about intergenerational knowledge and wisdom transfer
and the middle-aged people were really just supporting that process and right now our kids
are mostly lonely farmed out to day cares and schools where you have the least number of middle
aged people necessary one to 30 or whatever it is paid the least amount of money to tend to them
without actually really caring in the same way that an invested person would and then as soon
as the person is no longer a money generator again we want the least number of middle aged
people necessary to tend to them in the cheapest way possible and it's just a completely fucking
broken civilization values broken civilization it's so interesting how just reconnecting the
kids and the old people instantly increases the health of both and so much of childhood
psychiatric issues are gone if the kids just actually have someone who cares about them and so
much I mean Alzheimer's is not just a meaning issue there's other things going on but it's
amazing how much of it is affected by meaning and connection that when someone feels that they have
people that need them and something that counts on them how much more motivation to keep the system
capable and upregulated there is um so yeah I mean I just when you told me you wanted to start
