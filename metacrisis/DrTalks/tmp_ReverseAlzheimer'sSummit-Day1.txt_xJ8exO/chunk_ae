and when we compare this to what some of the drug makers are looking for in terms of success
I want to be really clear about the differences there what you're talking about is improvement
what they're talking about is a slowing of decline so I know you have a slide that really
represents this well yeah let me just show this that's a great point let me just show the
difference here so I think you're right the the semantics of success are very important so this
is just to illustrate that on average if you have someone who has Alzheimer's or MCI and this has been
this is in published literature then you lose on average about 3.4 points on a 30 point scale per
year so you lose uh whether you're talking about MMSC or or mocha you're losing a little bit each
year the best and so adecanumab which was just approved in June by the FDA so-called adu helm
this in its best trial and I should say in one trial it failed completely but in another trial
at one dose only the best it did was to slow the decline by 22 percent so it's not making people
have a better cognition it's just slowing the decline and unfortunately you know one of the
years ago one of the husbands to one of the patients said you know I know the drug makers
are trying to make drugs that slow the decline said but speaking as someone who's the spouse of
someone with relatively late stage Alzheimer's this is the last thing that I would want to see
so it's really tough and and you know we all want to get things earlier on get people like
that's one of the big goals to get people to come in earlier and I should say in the adecanumab
trial the range of cognitive scores that they took were very similar to what we did in our trial
so ours were 19 and above for the for the mocha scores and so you can see here in the trial in
in our trial on average there was a 3.89 point improvement so they actually had improved cognition
now as I said we had people going from 19 to 30 but but on average it was 3.9 and a lot of them
there was a bit of a ceiling effect because people would start at 26 well you can't go up too much
from 26 you can only go to 30 but this is what we saw on average so I think you're you're absolutely
right it's important to talk about the semantics of success so many people have asked me well I
should should I put my spouse on this drug because do you think it will help do you think it will
make them better well that's not what the drug is for it's simply to in the best case scenario
slow the decline and of course that's with 17 percent of them developing microbleeds in the
brain about 40 developing some form of edema swelling in the brain headaches you know all
sorts of issues and with the April before positives it was about 50 who had complications
so I think as as many neurologists have said this is not the drug we were looking for you know this
is a drug but it's it's not the goal so that's another point that I really want to drive home
here is the difference in side effect profiles right so this we're talking about a drug that can
cause micro hemorrhage so bleeding in the brain swelling in the brain high cost burden to Medicare
whoever's paying for it to make sure that these side effects are managed on the flip side what are
some of the side effects of your intervention that's a great point so the intervention that we use
the side effects have been better weight control improved lipid profile improved glycemic
profile improved insulin sensitivity improved microbiomes improved depression more joy you
know happiness now to be fair yes it's you know it's a complex approach you're you're hitting
various things and so you do you know it definitely helps to have a health coach but what people
found is that they have more energy they do better they feel better they sleep better they you know
their their whole lives are improved and again I think this comes back to this fundamental schism
in medicine when I was trained in medicine and I'm sure when you were as well there was a lot about
writing a prescription and a lot about kind of non physiologically relevant although I know you
were trained in a more physiologically relevant environment which is fantastic you know human
beings are complex organisms and I think we're now understanding that there is so much more that we
can do to address the physiological parameters that are driving the decline to begin with we are
unfortunately still laboring under this whole the flexner report of over a hundred years ago
that changed American medicine and said medicine should be more scientifically based great the
science has moved on by more than a century and the medicine really hasn't so it's now time to
increase our data set size to have more complex algorithms to have deeper dives into what's
actually causing these problems so I think that you know that is the future and I think that the
part of that future is going to be a future where we really pretty much end these complex
chronic illnesses from Alzheimer's to Parkinson's to Lewy body disease to you know on and on yeah
this is such a really great point is that the the science and the paradigm that we're using
they don't match anymore right and we have the ability we have the the intellect we have you
know we have the people we have the the technology to really start to match the complexity of the
human body with our intervention and there's there's nothing stopping us other than sort of these
social constructs right you know it's interesting to me that you know Google knows where you shop
they know you know how you're living your life they know a lot of things about you and they have
some very some very complex algorithms to use now why are we not using that same sort of technology
to identify people in their earliest changes and there's been discussion about using changes in
keystrokes for example or using changes in pickup when Alexa's listening to you Alexa can tell you
hey you know your voice is beginning to change in a way that suggests that you may be beginning
maybe at the earliest stages of cognitive change so I think for the future having the
earliest ability to get people to make sure that you now are going to reverse your cognitive
decline is absolutely feasible and will be the way of the future if we simply get people to come
in earlier either for prevention or earliest reversal we really can make neurodegenerative
diseases rare beginning with Alzheimer's but then including these others so let me just
make one other quick point here one of the biggest things that has held all of us back and I think
is actually hurt millions of patients is the term mild cognitive impairment so if you look at what
happens to all of us to people who are developing Alzheimer's there are these four stages so you
have you have a pre-symptomatic stage where you can already pick up changes on pet stands and spinal
fluid and things like that and so so you know we call this pre-symptomatic then we have SCI
subjective cognitive impairment which typically lasts about 10 years it's easy during that time
to reverse the decline but very rarely do people do anything about it then the third stage out of four
we call mild cognitive impairment at that point you're relatively late in the path
of physiological process so this is very much like saying oh don't worry you just have mildly
metastatic cancer it's really a late stage and so to me MCI should be called advanced stage
Alzheimer's it's the third of four stages and by the time you're actually told you have Alzheimer's
that is final stage Alzheimer's you're actually now losing activities of daily living typically
you've now had the underlying process for two decades so we're hurting the patients we're hurting
our practices and we hurt we're hurting the global burden of neurodegeneration by saying oh don't
worry it's just MCI we really want to get people in far before that hopefully for prevention or at
the latest for SCI SCI which really should be called early Alzheimer's disease that's when the
changes are actually there and they're already symptomatic the reason this is so important is
because this drives human behavior right there are so many people who are still told the old outdated
factually inaccurate narrative that there is nothing you can do by their neurologist who's
very well meaning but who doesn't realize that there are interventions that can work and so people
are driven to either hide it or go further into denial and they delay getting the care that could
help so changing the storyline so that people hear go soon go immediately when you start to
notice change that's when we can have the biggest impact that's when we can really prevent this
disease from from essentially torturing you and your family exactly right so a number of people
that were in the book that's coming up the first survivors of Alzheimer's they are worried about
their families so now the the idea is you're going to end it with this generation and none of the
future generations should have this problem Alzheimer's is optional there are things that
we can do especially if they're done early on that can prevent the progression of the
neurodegeneration so there's a lot we know a lot more certainly than even a handful of years ago
what are some of the intriguing things to you that we don't know what are some of the important
questions that are left unanswered great point I think there are you know there are a couple of
directions that are that things are happening so we looked initially in the laboratory at
what is the what is the fundamental nature of this problem and what came out of this
was surprising and interesting to me in that it really is if you look at the fundamental
nature of this problem it is a it is a network insufficiency so just as you would have a deficiency
of vitamin c giving you scurvy this simply is a more complex insufficiency it's an insufficiency
of a network so that now the network demand exceeds the network supply for years and then
ultimately you start you know bringing the network down very much by the way what it's very much
analogous to what happened with COVID-19 we had an insult SARS-CoV-2 everyone was told
shelter in place pull back go into a protective mode a downsizing protective mode and of course
we end up with a recession your brain is doing the same thing it's exposed to pathogens things
like P. gingivalis and things like you know various fungi herpes simplex Lyme disease toxins all these
sorts of things and your brain is saying okay I'm going to go into a protective downsizing mode
so we then simply have to address these things so we look at that and then there are kind of two
critical directions one is can we now adapt this and look at the specific neurochemistry
for other diseases so we're now starting what we call the ARC project ARK because the ARC was
two by two by two this is small numbers of patients and we're dealing with the first ones
who have macular degeneration so we're very excited it's a different chemistry
but there are some of the same sorts of things and then the next one is going to be
Parkinson's Lewy body and on and on so we're very interested to go in that direction and see if we
can adapt this approach to all other neurodegenerative diseases at the same time as you kind of applied
we're also looking at how do we now make this better what about people who come in with single
digit mocha scores who truly have very late stage Alzheimer's and so we're I'm very interested in
setting up another trial that we would call the seratrial severe Alzheimer's reversal attempt
so this is an attempt what do we need to add so for example what if you take these people now and
who we there are no question anecdotally there are a few people who will improve their mocha
scores we've seen people go from zero to six seven nine we've never seen anyone go from zero to 30
what are we missing what you know is there do you need a brain transplant do you need stem cells
do you need intranasal trophic factors do you need you know what is it that you need to to make
people do even better of course we hope that ultimately that won't be an issue because nobody
will wait that long but but we so we'd like to understand so all sorts of interesting new areas
as you know plasmalogens all really interesting work by the biochemist Dr. Day and Goodnow on
plasmalogens which are typically low in people how do we you know how do we improve those and is
that going to turn out to be critical I think the jury's still out we don't yet know but they
certainly look very promising what about stem cells and are there specific ones that are going to be
better than others and are you going to have to administer them in a better you know in a different
way do you want to open the blood brain barrier which is a common thing that's done when stem
cells are administered is that going to be more helpful I think there's a lot of promise for some
of the intranasal trophic factors so things like davunatide which failed unfortunately in the past
but of course it was it was used as a monotherapy so all of these things where they try to use it as
a monotherapy I do think the future is going to be to combine targeted drugs along with the the
protocols where we can target the things so that you're now going after what's causing the problem
but you also have very powerful drugs against specific molecular targets I do think it'll be
interesting to see when you take things that are anti-amyloid which I think are not a great
idea at the beginning the amyloid's there for a reason but now after you've addressed those things
is it going to be okay secondarily to begin to remove the amyloid and I think you know that is
going to be an important question the concern is are we going to cause cerebral hemorrhage so
we're still arguing about whether we should be trying to include this as a control in this next
trial my concern is it might be a bit dangerous I mean we don't want to cause cerebral hemorrhage
in people we don't want to cause edema and things like that however maybe very low doses
over time to help slowly remove that amyloid which you now no longer theoretically need
because you don't have the same insults of course there's a lot now on micro dosing of
various things like lsd and various thing the ayahuasca and psilocybin and all these sorts of
things so there's some promise there with with small doses of these as well you have to be a
little bit careful there's some interesting work on cannabinoid receptors and fairly direct roles
in in the process of amyloid and cognitive decline so I think that the what's really interesting to
me is we've been taught that the arsenal is zero there's nothing you can do to prevent or reverse
or delay the decline of Alzheimer's and therefore don't check your APOE status you know don't look
and I think the truth is just the opposite of that the arsenal is huge and the critical piece is
knowing when to use it how to use it what to target and knowing you know what the critical
species are now one thing we are finding and I'm sure you're seeing the same thing people will
improve and then plateau and there's something being missed and sometimes we'll say okay this turns out
and one example for for example is a person who did it very well then started to have a little
problem actually and turned out to have undiagnosed babesia and when that was addressed she then did
very well once again I mean other people it turns out to be things like leaky gut or it turns out to
be things like undiagnosed or unrecognized toxins that were present one recent one turned out to be
just a person who is now under additional stress and just removing that stress and I was you know as
a scientist I used to think that stress wasn't particularly important and I have to say you
know I have to say it's turning out to be very important and of course I can't argue with the
data so things like meditation which we never considered in a laboratory turn out for some
people to be absolutely crucial to getting best outcomes so I think we're all once we kind of have
the background we have the template we're now all seeing how we can make this better better better
better and so I'm really interested to see you know what you see now I should say we just look
at the data so we you know we published the data on the the preprint server med archive
we've now looked at what happens when you just don't do the trial but you just take large sums
of data for many many practitioners so we've had as you know over 2000 practitioners who's now who've
now been trained they're not no one's following them so that therefore it's that you don't have
the same level of compliance with the program and no surprise the data show that on average
people did a little better but it clearly wasn't as good as the trial so getting people to do the
right thing and optimizing things really turns out to be important and this is much more like surgery
than it is like medicine there are doctors who are getting almost everybody to get better and
there are doctors who are getting almost nobody to get better so it really does depend on because
you know you become good at this over time and working with people and getting your best outcomes
so one of the things that people can do right now that they could take away today is a
cognoscopy is what you call it so if someone is listening to this and they're saying this
makes a ton of sense what can I go do tomorrow can you describe what they would ask their doctor to
do essentially yeah that's a good point and so you know the idea was simply that we all know that
when we that when we turn 50 we should we should get a colonoscopy so that we know where we stand
and and you know we can we can make sure that we lower there are risks of dying from colorectal
cancer so our idea was okay don't forget the cognoscopy you want to you know if you're 45 or
older and certainly if there's Alzheimer's in your family you probably want to do this at 40
so at some point you you know you want to find out where do I stand and it's really
the four big groups of things that you want to know you want to know are there ongoing pathogens
are there ongoing toxins are and what's the status on trophic support so hormones and nutrients
and things like that and then what's the status on energetics which means you know it's going to mean
cerebral blood flow oxygenation especially people who have sleep apnea that's a huge issue
mitochondrial function and then your ketones are you getting combustible
substrates there and that's where you can even see on a PET scan that people who have Alzheimer's
and pre Alzheimer's are not doing well at with utilization of glucose in their temporal lobes
and parietal lobes so for a congnoscopy we look at that set of things we're looking at the various
nutrients and the various hormones and the various inflammatory you know metabolic and
inflammatory parameters and looking at that microbiome and that those sorts of things
