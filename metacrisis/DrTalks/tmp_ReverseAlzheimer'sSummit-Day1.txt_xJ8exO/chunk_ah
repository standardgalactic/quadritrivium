got to meet with her and she's they had that they had to all the press about blue light and
gamma and all of that so we we went there and we showed her our she has a brain tap now by the way
and she's using it in the uh but we showed her that with our device we can encourage 23 percent
or more gamma activity now we can only we up we found that it doesn't matter how many times you
do it you can only get so much advance it's kind of like weightlifting it doesn't matter how many
times you go to the gym you can only get so much muscle growth you can only get so much brainwave
change so what we find is that gamma on the other side gamma is kind of like a high frequency theta
and people have really like when I've interviewed our scanned doctors like I have a brother-in-law
that's a pretty famous maxillofacial surgeon and he does just this intricate work and and I said
Carl I want to measure your brain while you're doing that and what we found is when he's in his
zone he's in he's actually in gamma would this be like a flow state yes yes and we're we're finding
that true with athletes too they they and creative artists healers like when we when we meet healers
people that they don't even think they're healers just people come to them and they heal people
they they resonate this and now their studies that actually show our gut biome actually attracts
people to us or repels them because it's a field we're creating this field of energy through the
electromagnetic field even though the brain is very low the heart is like six times more and the
gut is actually 12 times more than that so you're actually projecting this information out when
people say I got a gut feeling about that person or they're really it's a gut brain so all of this
is kind of interconnected but the the real thing for what we found is the the biggest secret weapon
to helping with Alzheimer's to kind of bring it back to the summit is that we need to get people
sleeping and we need to get them to have more level four or paralytic sleep they call it
because that's the only time the leog lymphoma system which is a new thing that the medical
community found in 2016 which always been there but we didn't they didn't know it because they
never looked at it while people were sleeping but that's when it engages and that's when you
detox the brain so just everyday use we have it's like driving your car you're going to have exhaust
you know our every cell has exhaust system right and it's all trapped in the brain all day long
until you go to sleep so if you're not sleeping because your brain is dysregulated
then you're not detoxing so once we once we can now they're coming up with a lot of different
medicines if you will or vitamins and nutrients that actually can they do the pairing or they
they bind the toxins and get them out of the system they didn't have those before so now
now now we can measure it and we can actually see the results so there's always a combination with
what we do with some kind of nutrition or therapy and brain to have to get the best results but the
study I was talking about we we wanted to just do the brain tap just to see so I think if somebody
were to put other modalities in with it we just get even better results I would imagine yeah
so what is photobiomodulation can you explain that mouthful of a word well what they found out was
in our you know they mapped the genome right in in 2002 they made this big fuss hey we mapped the
genome but they didn't they mapped one percent of it you know could you imagine passing your
boards and you go I answered one percent of the questions give me my certificate but what
they found out was that other 99 percent is always in a state of flux and it emits a light pulse
every cell of your body including the mitochondria emits light pulses that's why I can see you and
you can see me we're sharing our light in other words and so what happens at the DNA level they
now know the name that pulse happens it happens across the whole system of your body and actually
rebraid your DNA and that that changes based on the words you use the people you're with the food
you consume for instance if they're running they now know they they've tracked 2,300 different
gene expressions that change by the words we use foods can do it environment emf you know that's why
some people who are sensitive now they also know the more fear you have the more you shut
those down so people who are optimistic and more open-minded they seem to tolerate things better
because the body adapts we are very adapted in nature so this and then the dura in the fascia
in the body now science is showing that that's like fiber optic cabling that's what carries
these bio-photonic information in each now they they also know just as a side note that
they can only store so much information in silicon right so we've kind of run to the end of our
silicon how fast can we make a computer they're now storing it in two things water they can now
structure water and they can hold all the information we in the history of time and one and they have
a lot of room left over in one drop of water that structure now they're also storing data in light
so guess what we are we're light and water you know so all that information is there and it's
redundant but if in part of that i used to uh when dr emoto was still alive he wrote a book
called the secret life of water and he would come out to quantum university and speak and it just
was amazing what the what you can do they actually know that when how you communicate it shows up in
the cellular memory of the water that you will carry in your body so if you're loving to yourself
if you're caring about yourself now some people as they get Alzheimer's what happens when the brain
gets dysregulated let's imagine you're trying to remember your son's name they just walked in the room
well eat that simple for us if our brain's working right boom it happens but if not there's eight
places or more in the brain where you have to go collect all that data the brain like it stores it
all over the place and then it represents at one time but it happens at the speed of light
not at the speed of thought thought is even slower than light i mean it happens but let's
say that one side of the brain is just even a millisecond off the brain will stop the program
because it says that's too much work so it says let's that data is not there let's write it off
because we're used to uh we only truly remember the very good times like our first kiss our wedding
maybe you know different things like that the first time we rode a bike you know our awards
whatever those are and then we remember the very bad times right in depending upon which one we
focus on that's how we feel today so we want to focus on those positives but the brain is writing
off most things and kind of put in perspective for the listeners our brain just as we're talking here
our ears are processing 25 000 pieces of information while we're talking now that 25
000 pieces of information we only act on 40 of them so our brain has a really good way of sorting
out information and if you you and I were at a restaurant it was your favorite restaurant we're
sitting there eating you told me about this meal it's perfect revenue it's great conversation
then somebody two tables over says Alzheimer's we're going to hear it even though we didn't
hear anything else they said because this reticular activating system or our default
mode network is always looking around is this safe for me what's going on and so when when people
wonder what's going on when they get older that sorting system has been compromised and so it says
that's not that those aren't the 40 pieces I want to deal with I want to know the name the person
you know but it's not keeping that that information it's lost its hierarchy of needs
as far as information goes that's why when you start doing the practice like what we're talking
about and keeping the frontal lobe engaged I should finish that thought I guess the reason we have
light in the eyes when people are their eyes are closed but the light pulses are actually triggering
cranial nerve too so it doesn't matter if you can even see as long as you have that nerve your brain
is going to synchronize but when we introduce light into the brain we actually keep the brain awake
when you when you close your eyes the first thing's going to happen is your frontal lobe's
going to start shutting down this is evident when we watch a movie right we're watching a
scary movie and we go oh it's just a movie right we close our eyes and we remind ourselves we're
not really there because our mirror neurons are going crazy we're either freddy krueger or we're
being chased by him you know so we have to decide and then we have to say wow that's just a movie
that's not really happening and but in our when we do when people go to meditate or relax they think
that when they close their eyes the brain goes oh it's time for sleep we want to keep them in that
if you can keep them in that alpha theta brain wave now they can really produce those neurotransmitters
that our brain needs we produce I like to tell people the world's greatest pharmacy is not on the
corner it's not in Walgreens or Walmart it's in your brain it's between your ears it can create
30 000 different neurochemicals with the right thoughts some of those are good and some bad so
if we can keep it going then you know the brain will do its work for us and it can
reregulate it regulates because of uh like like a tuning fork like I used earlier the
the body just knows how to do that it's not something you can't really train the brain to
come together it's got to have the right stimulus that's why like people do neurofeedback different
things like that to get the brain engaged you know I want to share with our listeners some of my
clinical experience with brain tap as I was telling you Dr Neil Nathan also a guest on the summit
is a big fan of yours and he's a formal mentor of mine so I have recommended brain tap to a
number of my patients and clinically I haven't used it yet to its potential with Alzheimer's
and dementia but I have been using it with the patients you were describing who are highly
sensitive they don't they don't tolerate a lot and many of them have mole toxicity they find me you
know uh because we focus on that at my clinic as well and what I have noticed is that many of them
have experienced early childhood trauma and so what you're describing makes so much sense for
why it really really helps them this regulation of the nervous system maybe because it's been
maladapted early on when we can regulate that they become more tolerant to whatever the stressor
is whether it is a mole toxic environment or a relationship or you know even like non-organic
foods or flying you know travel is a little stressful all of these things that we should
be able to tolerate a little bit of um some of us some some people many of my patients
are unable to and then brain tap helps so I want you to like tell I'm so excited to have you here
like tell me exactly what's going on and why well what happens is when if you think about in the
hopefully you remember these days but in you might be before you but in in houses when I was
growing up we had fuses so if we were running the dryer and the toaster was going then my sister
would turn on the hairdryer we'd blow a fuse right so but nowadays we have a we just have a flip we
just go flip the switch well our body doesn't have a fuse or a flip switch it basically just
resets keeps resetting so the nerve that's what they call stimming like when you when you have a
child with on the severe is the autistic child that has stimming you know they're trying to
they're really trying to get rid of the energy that's built up in the system they don't know
how to regulate the energy if we have all those brain waves going in the right order then we
regulate energy that's what really what we're about we're our body takes in energy even music
energy like if you're at a if you're at a party you don't really want to be there but they start
playing your favorite songs from your high school days pretty soon you're tapping your toes you're
smiling you're having a good time because our body converts that to energy and we've got to use
that energy so what's happening is if their brain is dysregulated all the information comes into
the central cortex at the same time there's no space this is a this is a phobic reaction
so what we have to do they call it a synesthesia actually in psychology which means overlapping
sensory systems so what we what we do is we're going to slow that down time in the brain or in
the mind however you want to think about that at the states of alpha and theta is not relevant
you know everybody's had a dream where it felt like it lasted forever then you finally wake up
and go do you know how long the average dream lasts no seven seconds you know so but there's no time
there so it's kind of like those star trek movies where somebody goes into a dream and has a whole
lifetime while they get an hour long massage and it feels like it's been 10 minutes yeah exactly
so there's no time when you get into those that place but what we can do is we can teach the
brain to reorganize as an example professional athletes like baseball players when we when we
interviewed them and they do something called modeling we want to find out how does these
the best hitters in the world in baseball how do they do it well when they're in the batter's box
they're not thinking oh no that guy's going to throw the ball at 90 miles an hour across the plate
what they're thinking is i'm going to slow down that ball so i can see how it's spinning now if you
don't have the experience or the brain capacity you get freaked out but they stand in the box they
literally see it leave the fingers of the pitcher in slow motion they see the rotation of the ball
they know if it's a curve a screwball or a fastball and they make the adjustment now those are experts
right those are the now we all do that to some degree you know like we call it anticipatory
stress you know we some people actually don't get out of bed till they have enough stress you know
they thought of enough catastrophes that it's time to get up right so we want to change that
in what happens as you're sharing this about the baseball players like i've watched my daughter fall
and i see her falling in slow motion right is that the same kind of yes going on in my brain
right it happens when people get in car accidents too they'll say everything just slowed down
because you went into a hyper state it wasn't the everyday normal conscious state of reality
because you're thinking what am i going to do and i i tell me the worst thing that happened
like i have two grandchildren and now they're a little older they're eight and eleven but when
they were little i didn't care if my kids hit their heads everywhere but every time they hit
their head now that i know about brain health i'm going oh my god what am i going to do i got to
get them on the brain helmet you know do something to fix their brain but i mean everybody has fallen
down anywhere between 3000 to 5000 times growing up so we all have some traumatic traumatic injuries
it's just how did our brain remodel around it some people tried to do a shortcut and then
they start getting anxiety and what happens is they then start to use affirmations like anxiety
runs in the family anxiety doesn't run in the family the propensity does but the reality doesn't
you know you that's why there's always that person in the family that doesn't have it because they
don't buy into the family belief you know so but the the now what we know about epigenetics
only 20 percent of who you are is your parents responsibility 80 percent is your environment
in your everything that you've done since that time so what happens with these with this fear
factor that's happening in the brain is under stress the brain dysregulates that's why we're
told never like if we get a divorce we lose a job we have to move across country you know
we don't they tell you don't make any real life changing decisions don't don't do that you know
take some time because we don't make good decisions when we're stressed out right so we have to go to
we have to go to an altered state to relax and do that and most of it is that we are not trained to
process our day and if you remember back to some of my brain tap sessions I always have people do
a review of their day and when you train your brain to review your day you're not leaving
anything on the table you're sorting it out so that basically it's like if you worked at IBM
during the 70s you couldn't leave your office until there was no papers on your desk it actually
looked like nobody worked there because that's the way they knew that you had finished up the
task for the day well we should consider that for our own brain every night now what happens is if we
don't or a better way to say that would be let's imagine watching your favorite tv show or movie
and the actors and actresses never rehearsed that would be ridiculous right we would never see that
but people get up every morning and do that in their own life they never rehearse how to talk to
their children they never rehearse how to talk to their spouse they never rehearse how to drive
across town they never rehearse how to do anything different and then when while they're doing it
they get all upset about they're not doing it right well you your time to practice is before
you do it that's where the visualization comes in and the mental practice so part of the process is
just teaching them how to prepare because life happens quickly I love what Deepak Chopra said
years ago I was at a training of his and he said 90 percent of what's going to happen to you tomorrow
you know about today so what are you pretending not to know there's a lot of people running around
pretending now if that happens long enough let's say that they do it over seven years 10 years 20
years that damage is being it's accumulative damage like the amnesia the amnesia like people
pretend that that's not happening they pretend that that's not going on well the brain starts
thinking that's a pretty good program that amnesia program you're running why don't we start forgetting
names and addresses and phone numbers and it's it doesn't you know so that's why you have to
rehearse you have to play with my grandmother who lived to be 93 and had a great memory up to the
day she died I was for lack of a better word babysitting for her so my aunt could go on a
cruise and I could go golfing during the day in in in albuquerque new mexico and I came back from
golf and I hear her talking out loud I thought she was on the telephone she was in there for
almost an hour and when she came out she says why didn't you tell me you were here and I said well
you were on the telephone she goes I wasn't on the telephone I said well what were you doing
she says I was reviewing all of my favorite vacations oh that's great I bet she was a happy
