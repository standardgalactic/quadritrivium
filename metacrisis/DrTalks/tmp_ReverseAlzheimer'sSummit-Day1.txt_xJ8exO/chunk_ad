focusing on this and prototyping a a type of clinic that could show a model that could start to
get replicated is just such a humongously important thing to do and the fact that the model is
starting to have the success that it is already so early is amazing it's important work and very
meaningful and you know I am looking forward to aging as your friend so that we can continue
to to do this work and I really my biggest goal is that if if I think if we can influence one family
and one family can avoid the catastrophe that is the development of Alzheimer's we've been successful
and if we can do that at scale then we're really making some progress and and I think that the
generations after us can can avoid this and and live more full more meaningful more connected
lives and I'm I'm looking forward to that I'm looking forward to seeing the benefits of this
information getting out and really excited to dive even deeper with our our next summit attendees
and and interviewees over the next few days Daniel thank you so so so much I I'd love to
hear some parting thoughts for our guests and also learn a little bit more about the
Consilience Project and where people can find out about your current work
there's just a psychological thing I'd like to say I'm sure this will be said other places
throughout the course but when we're learning how we might be able to influence things we didn't
think we could influence there's an empowerment that comes with that that's beautiful the unhealthy
psychological way to hold that is some kind of blame like if I have Alzheimer's I did wrong
things or if my family member has Alzheimer's the doctors didn't treat them properly or we
didn't do the right things for them or and but nobody knew these things right so it's important
to say like we're coming to understand stuff we didn't understand as a result new capacities are
starting to come online which is awesome if your family member died of Alzheimer's and you didn't
have access to these capacities and you're like fuck why didn't I know about this earlier why
didn't medicine get there like that's just sad there's no nothing else that really can be said
there's realistic grief to that but this is where like we are actually evolving in our knowledge
as a as a species as a people where certain kinds of suffering don't have to keep happening
and we're nowhere close to being able to say anyone with Alzheimer's at any stage it can be
cured that's not true we don't know it's very very early but it is promising that more can be done
than we thought and for people to have as much commitment and as much of an empowered perspective
as they can to be part of helping to advance to utilize the best of the knowledge that's there
and support the people who are doing the research to advance that knowledge is super important
so tell us more about the conciliants project
ah it's a big jump of topics but um well i know that you've inspired people you've educated
inspired people and a lot of everyone here who's listening i know if you've opened their minds
in a way that probably hasn't happened before or hasn't in a long time you are a thinker like
Leonardo da Vinci and i said you know like so many not not that many actually like a handful of
really big thinkers before you take these complex ideas and really can create change out of them
things that i i i imagine will change the world and i want i'm sure people are inspired to learn
more about your projects and what other places you are applying this idea these ideas to and the
conciliants project is the current one it's funny how if i'm thinking about it in the context of our
current conversation we can see how in Alzheimer's there's a decrease in the coherency of cognition
and that if we look at the collective body of humanity or even just the collective body of
say a nation like the us today there is a similar kind of decrease in the coherency of its collective
understanding of what the nature of reality is and how to move forward like to say that the
us has Alzheimer's is kind of an interesting way of thinking about it because is covid a hoax
is it man-made was it did it have zoonotic origin does hydroxychloroquine help is the
vaccine the right approach like you we can see that there is fervent disagreement on the most
fundamental and consequential base realities climate change systemic racism second amendment
anything right um do guns think people safer or less safe just write down the line fervent
disagreement on everything so how do those people self-organize to be able to make coordinated choices
together the idea of what a democracy is that we can make sense of the world we can identify what we
all value and make the coherent best choices in areas we infect each other well we can see that
we can't right like we're as a society we put all this energy into fighting every four years for
who gets in whoever gets in spends the time undoing whatever was done in the last four years nobody
works on anything that has a longer than four-year timeline because it won't get them reelected so
there's no long-term planning almost all the energy of the system is wasted as heat in just
terms of infighting meanwhile somewhere that doesn't have those coordination challenges that
doesn't have term limits and two parties competing against each other like china can put
together a hundred-year plan and build high-speed rail all around the world in the time that we
haven't built a single high-speed train even in our own country and so we're like oh
at the level of the collective there is a decoherence and a breakdown that is affecting
the environment social well-being everything so how do we create health at the level of the
societal body right how do we reverse the pathologies there and you can see a cancer or an
autoimmune disease autoimmune disease is where some of the cells in the body end up turning
against other ones because they get confused their immune differentiation to be able to recognize
foreign versus not foreign is off right and cancer similarly is where there is a base kind of genetic
change where some of the cells pursuing their own self-interest are doing it in a way that is
no longer aligned with the image of the well-being of a whole and what's so interesting is as the
cancer is proliferating it's also in the process of committing suicide because as soon as it kills
the host it all of it dies so it's pursuing short-term interest which is its own more rapid
proliferation at its own long-term expense those metaphors are actually pretty apt for what's
happening to civilization as coal and so how do we similarly do a multifactorial analysis of what
it is that's causing that how and how we reverse those things to create a healthier society that's
those are the topics where most of my attention is and the consilience project is
an attempt to see can we upgrade public sense making meaning that everybody can make sense of
base reality better on their own rather than just adopt whatever their in-group or the authority
they are used to deferring to says is true and can they come to understand their own values and
understand other people's values better to be able to say what are all the values that matter
can we create a proposition meets all these values as opposed to we'll pursue our values at the expense
of yours and stay stuck in cultural arms races so can we improve our collective individual
and collective sense making and meaning making enough that we can improve our choice making
enough that we can actually coordinate effectively to be able to apply the more powerful technologies
we have to rather than ruin the world actually create a desirable functional world that that's
roughly the topics that we're working on so somebody wants to go check it out it's in the very
very early stages beta stages but that's that's the gist thank you for sharing that you have
inspired me more than anyone else to take on these big hard challenging problems and
somebody needs to so I'm so grateful to you for being here and I am sure you have inspired more
people to do the hard work that it takes to create not only healthier individuals but a
healthier society whether that means contributing a little bit more with raising the young ones
or reading a little bit more about the conciliants project and potentially even donating so Daniel
thank you so so so much for your time you are very busy and I am so grateful to you for your
friendship and for being here today to share your insights thank you for having me here
wow what a truly powerful interview with my good friend Daniel Schmattenberger
we've learned why it's so important to treat the root cause of complex disease whether it's
dementia or something else we've better understood what healthy aging can look like and if there's
a science an art and most importantly there's a framework there's a structured way to go through
discovering and understanding the root cause of dementia in any individual
next up I'm so pleased to have Dr. Dale Bredesen he is a hero of mine he's a medical doctor who
trained at Duke University and the author of best-selling books the end of Alzheimer's and the
end of Alzheimer's the program Dr. Bredesen will share how to protect your brain against memory
loss as well as share the exciting and brand new clinical trial results where 84 percent of
participants reversed their symptoms of cognitive decline before we dive into that who do you know
who needs this information by sharing the summit with others you could change or even save someone's
life please click the share button below this video to help us spread the word now let's begin
with this exciting next interview with Dr. Dale Bredesen so one of the reasons I'm so excited
to be recording this now at this time is because you and your group have just published a trial
taking 25 participants through your basically your whole program so I'm thrilled that we can
finally share with the world what you guys are finding there's a study that we can point to
to not just the one patient here or there that is getting better in someone's clinic but that
there's robust science coming out so would you please just describe the the trial how it was
set up the protocol and then also what you found yeah great point so you know way back in 2011
we proposed the very first trial that would address all the different pieces the things that we have
identified in the laboratory over the years that were critical things like specific pathogens and
things like specific toxins and all the things that you deal with with your patients as well
and we were not allowed to do the trial back in 2011 because it was both multivariable and the IRBs
wanted this to be single variable so you just had you know drug or placebo and so of course we
objected and said hey wait a minute this is not a one variable disease so we wanted then to collect
anecdotes and as you know we published anecdotes 2014 2016 2018 we published 100 with improvement
that was documented so then we went back in 2018 after that publication and said okay can we do the
trial now and they said no and so I know still crazy so finally in 2019 we were allowed to do a
proof of concept trial it's only 25 patients but the idea was it would allow us then if we got good
results with that to go to a randomized controlled trial which is what we're now in the midst of
doing so really very fortunate to link up with Diana Merriam and the Four Winds Foundation that
supported this trial and we're just fantastic and then also three absolutely outstanding functional
medicine physicians Dr. Anne Hathaway, Dr. Cat Tubes and Dr. Deborah Gordon so really honored to
work with them and as you know we basically took this from the test tube straight to the people
and to say okay what are the things for each person instead of all previous trials which as you know
have predetermined what's going to be the treatment which makes no sense so they say ahead of time
everyone who comes in is going to be treated with drug x no matter what's causing the problem
which makes very little sense so the idea for this trial was to flip the script and say okay
for each of these people we're going to look at all the different determinants and there are about
150 different determinants from their various genetic things and we worked with Intelx DNA
and Dr. Sharon Hausman-Cohm whom you know to look at the genetics whether there were issues
with glutathione related with methylation related with thrombosis related on and on
and then also looking at the various biochemical parameters the various microbiological parameters
looking at gut status of course looking at all the different pieces and for those for then for
each person we were able to construct a fairly hopefully a fairly accurate map of what were
the contributors and as you know you virtually never see people with just one contributor
typically there are multiple things starting of course with the genetics with ApoE4 very commonly
and about half the people in the study turned out to be ApoE4 positive but we saw all sorts of
different things as you can imagine across the spectrum and then tried to guide the target
treatment to each of those things and of course it included a core so we had a mildly ketogenic plant
rich diet for people we wanted to look at their sleep we wanted to look at their nocturnal oximetry
we wanted to look at their stress levels we wanted to look at their hormonal levels
so all the things that you know well from functional medicine world that are critical
I think what the science has taught us is what the what the priorities are there are things that
have a fairly small input into cognitive decline and then there are things that have a huge input
into cognitive decline and so then we can look at each of these and target these and as you can
imagine the people who were able to comply and we had people working with health coaches so it was
really fantastic people working with nutritionists and people working with physical trainers
and then working with neurofeedback and things like that did very very well and so we were very
excited to see how much better the outcome was with these people than with a typical drug approach
to Alzheimer's disease so how long did it take how long were people in the trial when were you
getting the metric yeah great point so the each person was on for nine months and so the idea was
we typically see people improving within three to six months so we did there we looked at several
variables so we looked at their mocha scores we looked at their cns vital signs scores so we
could get a more sensitive indicator and also different domains we looked at their aq change
scores so in other words did their partner notice as you know some of the drugs just barely reached
statistical significance but the partners couldn't tell any difference at all so we wanted to know
did the partner also notice that these people were better yes or no and then we also looked at
their MRI volume metrics so we looked at what happened to their gray matter and what happened
to their hippocampal volumes and then we also looked at their brain hq so did they get better
with their brain training or were they failing on their brain training so that way we gave us a lot
of different complementary parameters that we could look at for these people and what do you find
so yeah so we looked it was interesting we looked at three months six months nine months and the
nine months was the end as I mentioned and what was interesting to see was at three months they
had improved somewhat but it was just reaching statistical significance at six months they had
clearly reached statistical significance and at nine months they were still better and at that time
it was less than p p less than 0.001 so really strikingly improved and we had people who went
from mochas of 19 to 30 perfect scores of 30 so we had some dramatic improvements and then we had
some less dramatic improvements and again we had and we had just a few people so 84 percent of the
people improved their scores improved their cns vital signs scores 76 percent of the people improved
their mocha scores and what was interesting is that their MRIs actually improved so you can look at
MRIs and there's a there's a great example of what actually happens with MRIs over time if you have
Alzheimer's or MCI you typically lose a significant amount of gray matter volume and hippocampal
volume each year and you can see that going down if you're aging normally with no no complaints
you actually still lose a little bit on average so these people who actually had MCI or Alzheimer's
and we had some with each actually did better in terms of their MRI volume metrics than normal
people who had no complaints so their gray matter volume actually increased slightly their hippocampal
volume was a slight decrease but as I say less decreased than just normal aging so they so for
all these parameters they did well and by the way their aq change scores their partners noticed that
they did well as well so by all these different criteria and actually a hundred percent of them
improved their brain hq scores so just practicing getting on this they actually they all did better
with that so I think again it really supports the idea that targeting the things that are driving the
decline really is the way to go now of course we didn't include people with mocha scores of zero
or five or ten and that's one of the reasons I'm very excited about your trial where you're looking
at people with mocha scores down to 12 ours was 19 through 30 and with cns vital signs that were
abnormal as well and so I think it's going to be very interesting and very important what you see in
your trial so one of the questions that I get asked most frequently in my office is if we do this if
we put the money and the effort and all of this energy if I you know go to part-time work so I
can help my mom or dad do this how likely is it that we're going to get benefit and that really
was what drove me to ask the question of you know who who's going to get benefit and how often so
that I can have a lot of confidence telling these families I think one of the big things I want to
come back to that you mentioned was the changes that the spouses saw right the Alzheimer's is
so devastating not only to that individual but to the entire family network that's affected and
sometimes it's not even just the family right they're out of the workforce and a caregiver can
come out of the workforce often to take care of that person doesn't just take down the patient
it affects many people around them and you measuring we failed to do that in the next
trials I think everyone should be doing that because how we define success is really important
here and that's what I want to draw attention to for our listeners is that the changes that a
caregiver notices can have that has more you know you start to get exponential impact
