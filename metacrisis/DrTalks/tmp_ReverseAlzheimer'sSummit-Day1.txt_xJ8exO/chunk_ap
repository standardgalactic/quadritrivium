had an 84 gentleman there 84 year old gentleman there was nothing short of the vegetable that
we reversed so you know these are not these are not common things but once again a lot of people
don't have the staying power particularly older folks but let me give you one other food for thought
in terms of this whole i gg i gm thing when you die you are no longer exposed to the environments
so you no longer have exposure yet you start decomposing from within and what ewald says very
clearly in his book is they're already there he was making a different reference he's talking
about plagues and we've been exposed to everything so that's why he says this he didn't really say
this but i can you can infer from what he said that this sars-cov-2 is novel very novel because
we've been exposed to everything but the world is global but his points well taken they're already
within and so the difference between you decomposing when you die and you not now is that when you die
your immune system is zero so everything lying in weight now has nobody nothing holding them back
you know it's no different than the gut when you start losing stomach acid
all the pathogenic organisms start proliferating and the beneficial organisms
you know are flagging because they've adapted to strong acid right acid is certainly a line of
defense right necessary very necessary one dr. lewis it has been so insightful so wonderful to
have you i know you have so much more to share um but i do have to wrap up and i want to make
sure that everyone who is listening um and watching knows how to find out more from you
because there is you just have a wealth of information to share and again these alternative
kind of interpretations that they may have not seen elsewhere that i i think
something that will prevent suffering for many people so i'm really excited to get this information
out and want to make sure that uh i stop babbling in time for you to tell everyone where they can
learn more so we we run two websites but i really want people just to come to one we run two so
people don't get confused it's like oh i have Alzheimer's why am i going to work on a disease
site but our real site is health revival partners with an s healthy viable partners
and that's where you know you want to work with us and what i'd suggest is if you've been through
treatment with Alzheimer's and you haven't got the results you want i think i think we can
add some intel into that and the other thing is most importantly i want people to get pre-treated
before they have symptoms and that's where eye testing might be just the right thing to convince
them that there's a neurodegenerative process going on so once again this all happens on
healthrevivalpartners.com thank you so much super important especially not even maybe
pre-symptomatic but early symptoms right instead of oh yeah the earlier the better
yeah the earlier the better so if if there is a family history if there's any reason to think
that you might be predisposed towards dementia get this information sooner rather than later so
we can start acting now it is so much easier to prevent than to treat and certainly so much
easier to treat when it's early than when it's late stage so get the help that you need your
loved one needs visit dr lewis's website and quick look at the show notes it's also you'll be linked
