is we unplug and because the brain is so much of an energy hog it's going to keep unplugging
just one example for the listeners if you speak more than one language for instance you have a
brain circuit that never shuts down for your whole life as long as you learn that language before
the age of seven so I always encourage people to have their children learn more than one language
because if you don't you'll be like me in college and you have to learn Spanish and the only thing
you take away is banyos and cerveza you know so you know and and kachino so you can go get your
beer you know all these things it's harder to learn you know when we're children we're in a state of
theta brainwave really mostly and we absorb a language and just to give an example just to
put in perspective our science officer he speaks six languages wow he was traveling through India
with me we were doing a university tour speaking to different universities and by the time we left
in three weeks he's speaking Hindi and I said Francisco when did you learn Hindi he goes
why we're here and I said what do you mean he goes if I'm around it he goes I've learned
so many languages that all I have to do is be around him and I'll start doing it because
the way our brain think about it we have a super computer in our head and if we don't use it we lose
it so because it's beginning again because it's an energy hog it's going to keep conserving energy
conserving energy to our detriment so that's why brain fitness is so important in this day
and age and what we do so you have a pilot program a six a six week program that you've been doing
that shows that basically guides people how to get that neuroplastic change at any age right
yes we did the study with women 55 65 they were all diagnosed by their medical doctor to have
dementia we had them take the Cambridge science testing which is a cognitive skills test they
all scored that they had dementia the the unique thing that we found and we find this with ADD
as well is the brain was out of synchronization so it was it was not coherent right the right and
left brain the left hemisphere was actually moving slower than the right and this is just the mechanical
the electrical functions of the brain we can measure and so we put them on a protocol that was
three times a day morning we have a morning session we call digital coffee it's about 10 minutes
and there's a brainwave that most people think but as we get older that we lose our balance
but really what we lose is a brainwave called smr it's it's between alpha and beta it's a very
small brainwave feature but it has to do with cognitive thinking and balance so we actually
did a balance score test with them too without doing any exercises just the brain tap and when
we when we ended the study after they did that three times a day the afternoon we did a reboot
because they we lose energy all we all do anyway but if we haven't trained our brain it's even more
every day at two o'clock our brain drops i mean our body drops in temperature two degrees so
are these bodies are designed for the serengeti so we're supposed to be taking a nap like the
lions and the zebras but we what do we do we we drink coffee tea eat chocolate whatever it is to
stimulate ourselves and we have this great electrical system so we wanted to train them
we told them if you really need coffee do it after your brain tap session but try to do it
without it uh just to to regulate within our own innate system and then we have a program
that we had them do to put them to sleep what we find unfortunately is most people are running
around with their brain trying to go to sleep when they're awake and that means they have high
degree of delta activity which is deep sleep but at the end of that six week study to shorten the
conversation here they went back to their doctor before we tested them we had them go back to their
doctor their doctor said wow if you came here like this six weeks ago we would not have diagnosed
you with dementia wow we had them sit down and do the cognitive skills test they scored that they
were inside the normal range for their age group this is 55 65 females and then we had the we measured
their brain with a product called the wavi which measures brain synchronization and things of that
nature we found out that their brain was now synchronized because it was it was coherent in
other words and so their their doctors you know of course they're not going to take away the
diagnosis but they had no symptoms so that gave us we took that to duke duke university is one of
our research partners and we said what do you think of this research they said i don't believe it
and i and i said well here's the research they said let's do a bigger study so we're in the middle
right now we have seminal college and valencia college in florida that have partnered with us
to get a hundred people in florida women and men we're going to do both we're going to try to get
50 of each to do the study down there and see what we can do and i think i mean we see this in
our clinics we're lucky that we have 2300 clinics across the country and they give us feedback all
the time and wavi had already told us this because they put all their information up into a cloud
and the people at wavi contacted us and said what are you doing over their brain tap these people
are getting so much better faster and and i had to explain you know everyone knows how lasers work
at least in the field of medicine right and but through vasodilation blood flow and circulation
the innate intelligence of the body can take over and i think uh any brain at any age can heal we
we actually showed significant change she wasn't part of the study but she was 102 years old
and we have the documents that show what happened after six months of using brain tap
she improved her brain function by 30 percent that is incredible this is so exciting oh so
we're doing a clinical trial in my office and we're using both Cambridge brain sciences to
track the data and then also wavi so it sounds like there's a there's a lot of synergy and and
overlap in what we're doing now we're using kind of a reticent style approach but i can't believe
we haven't been also using brain tap because i can only imagine when we start to marry those
and we start to combine things that we get even more potential benefit for our patients right
but we tell people especially in the because a lot of our doctors are neurological doctors and
chiropractors is we say after you're done with all of that work most people don't know that even
when you're meditating or sleeping you're still your brain is still using 20 to 25 of the energy
of the body so it's a workout you know when you're getting that therapy whatever that therapy is
your brain is getting a workout so we want them to restore that restore the brain function before
they leave the office we we do this also with chemotherapy centers and things like that because
people get radiation or chemotherapy they need to rebuild that really for those familiar with
the term ATP production we need to get the brain producing more energy for rejuvenation
more fuel so just to go back to the the six week pilot program you had how many women
in the trial and then how many days or how many times per day were they doing a session
and how long were those sessions this pilot was only six people and that's why we have to do more
you know yeah it was significantly when we did this numbers it was significant but we couldn't
publish you know it's right you need more so we figured actually we need 35 people to get
the significant number that we need so we figure we'll get a hundred you know and then we'll get
that number because you know just the more the more you have the better we've done some just
case studies before that but because we didn't do the exact same thing we couldn't put them into
the study and we we actually designed a program for brain tap that's only available to our professionals
because it actually speeds up the left hemisphere and slows down the right so we designed that just
for the study and once we once we prove it out we'll make it available to everybody not not the
general populace because you need to measure the brain before you do that we don't want to
speed somebody's left hemisphere up when they don't need it yeah don't want to have new problems
most of our most of the problems people have is the hemispheres are out of sync so the first
four minutes of every brain tap session is a synchronizing session and that has to do with
just right down to even heart rate coherency I mean we're trying to get every the whole body
just coherence so the communication between the systems is happening the way it was designed
that's incredible so but those women that did that they were doing three sessions a day yes
they were doing a morning afternoon and evening session and they're about how long each well the
morning session is 10 minutes the afternoon session is 20 and the evening session can be between 25
and 30 but you we had them do it with just the earbuds in so they could just fall asleep because
the evening sessions although 90 percent of our users use it at night we didn't want to have the
interference of the light sometimes the light at night for especially blue-eyed people and
they are more sensitive to light so we don't recommend they use it at night after six o'clock
because it can over psych the nervous system interesting but there's a potential that for
under an hour a day doing something that probably feels good and helps you sleep better and helps
you feel better day to day anyways can improve your memory can improve your cognitive function
yeah that is amazing yeah we see because we do a lot with a concussion care and with the sports
teams and we have a lot of different sports teams that put in 10 20 chair stations where after
their training ritual though they'll go in with compression pants you know to get the bad blood
out especially soccer teams and hockey teams they seem to be the biggest users and they'll
they'll do this afterwards because they don't realize the fatigue a lot of that is mental
these are people that are running the whole time running in balance takes a lot of energy
you know even if you're just standing you know you're using a lot of energy to keep that keep
your position in space and you know especially if you're out of balance you know it's going to be
hard well then i'm sure at the professional level or even collegiate level they there's a lot of
mental energy that goes into the strategy into executing into thinking ahead into into playing
the game yeah yeah the biggest thing we find for professional athletes in their brain is
how to disengage you know and then that's when they get in trouble they start looking at substances
that are not really healthy for your body like alcohol or drugs to because they're so high you
know they're they're they're buzzing up here and then they have to go back to regular life you know
they're not in front of 100,000 people or 30,000 people and now they've got to go home and you
know make their own popcorn or whatever you can balance so tell us about the role and you mentioned
it a little bit but i want to go more into depth about the role in brain waves in reversing Alzheimer's
so like we think when we think about Alzheimer's i think a lot of people go to beta amyloid plaques
and tal proteins and you know maybe the neurons and the synapses but what you're talking about
are brain waves so tell me how those how how those create memory how they keep us from making memories
how they contribute to this this world of dementia yeah well if you get stuck into
chronic low-level stress if you just under stress all the time that means let's say you have a
traumatic event in the morning maybe you get a text or a phone call and in the evening you're still
ruminating about it you probably have a nervous system that isn't able to disengage
that chronic low-level stress is going to influence your gut which we all know
in the field that that's really important too because your gut makes all the neural
transmissions so if your gut's out of balance and there's a lot more to it i'm sure you have some
experts that are going to be talking about that the gut brain connection but if we don't
organize so that we can digest so i tell people that we've got to calm down that beta brain
and you can do that a few ways of course brain tap is one way but you can do it through breathing
through you know just body scans prayer is a way when somebody says why would we pray before we
eat well obviously it's a religious ritual but really it's so we digest our food and we've had
a study done in provo utah where we showed that when we put people on a session to got them into
alpha and theta they actually digest and metabolized more than 30 percent of the nutrients through an
IV than they did when they were just doing it on their own texting and looking at their phone
so when you're that's when we did that to prove out when you're doing other therapies at your
clinic you should be using you know the technology but the the reality is that alpha and theta alpha
has to do with creative thinking and that creative thinking the reason you have to close your eyes
usually to get into visualizing and meditating and doing those things is it takes a lot of power
to do that but what happens is in that state of alpha most people shut down their frontal
the frontal cortex right the the frontal lobe so basically all reasoning goes out the window
and they fall asleep they go i i've tried to meditate all i do is fall asleep but when you
introduce light into the equation and that light frequency is at whatever hurts frequency you
want the brain to be because they through entrainment the the like a tuning fork in other words
the brain is going to follow that frequency you know and so we're imitating nature so for
instance alpha is like going to the ocean when you're sitting by the ocean you're relaxing
even if you didn't want to be there you might have been irritable but by the time you get there
you look out at the ocean you're there for a little bit you start feeling good because your
your body will actually entrain to its environment so in the ocean you're going to get alpha alpha
produces acetylcholine or instructs the gut to produce acetylcholine you can't do you can't be
stressed and produce that amount of acetylcholine you know your body will try to do it but what it
will do is it'll rob peter to pay paul so something's got to give so when you get if you get time in
that brainwave now we're designed to take naps in the middle of the day our bodies are and to
sleep you know longer than we are you know a hundred years ago we used to sleep 12 hours a day
you know i haven't seen that since i was a kid you know so but the in the process of doing that
at night we're going through these cycles and the cycles all represent different brainwaves
so when we get into alpha we're creating that acetylcholine when we get into theta we're producing
GABA GABA is the most researched drug on the market before COVID COVID kind of pushed it out
but the reality is that most people are missing theta it's a very small brainwave right before
sleep everyone out there has been in that state before consciously because it's it's when you
wake up in the morning at some point you hear a song maybe you don't really like it but that
stonk sticks in your head all day theta is known for it's it's called hypernesia super memory state
so like the great inventors when you read about them they take these cat naps in their labs and
these solutions would come flying into their subconscious out of their subconscious to their
conscious mind that was the theta state and so that's really important to be basically to make
the jump from being in the waking state to the sleeping state then there's delta delta is really
important now we should have very little delta while we're awake it should be less than 10 percent
of our overall brain when you look at we call it a full spectrum brainwave because all these
brainwaves are going at one time it's just where is the prevailing awareness is a proper brainwave
when we're awake is 45 percent of your brain should be operating in beta 30 percent should
be operating in alpha if we have too much alpha for instance and not enough beta we become attention
deficit because we have too much energy and activity if we have too much beta and too much
alpha i mean too little of both we become just attention deficit we're just not there because
theta arises now to put it in perspective too for people wondering about autism we have a lot of
luck really good results with autism because we can encourage alpha activity alpha i always tell
people think of brainwaves like wi-fi networks but are healthy you know so they're they're basically
through electrical signals and also through light signals in the body through something called
bio-photetic exchange we're actually light beings so our body at the cellular level emits light
pulses every 40 seconds and that that's part of it so there we have redundant systems we're not just
electrical we're we're light sounding vibration we're we're information packets running around
you know living our life and what happens to an autistic child that we found now we don't work
we work with doctors that have a lot more it's not just brain tap so i don't want anybody to think
hey just get the brain tap and all this happens we have clinicians like yourself that are doing
other things but what we found was when we can encourage when we can after six weeks most of
our studies are about six weeks so we did a study with 34 autistic children in orange county california
with joquita handy dr handy and what we showed is we could improve their alpha by 23 percent
as soon as they went over the 23 mark from where they were which was almost zero they were speaking
we had about a 90 speaking rate and she's a speech pathologist so it worked for her so
she was doing all of her work and she asked me why did i think that was i said well you're doing the
exercises and then we're relaxing the brain so it can accept them you know if the brain is
stressed out too because i believe all stress is brain stress so if we can relax the brain you've
just taught them some maybe they're doing the metronome or they're doing other exercises
and they're all stressed out and then the next day that all gets washed out but we want to take
short-term memories and make them long-term memories as fast as possible so the brain can
recall and actually feed it back into the system and so what we found too in that study where people
are wondering six months later we checked it they still had 23 percent alpha activity so once the
brain learns it and it's normal that's a normal in uh you had mentioned the amyloid plaque studies
we went and saw lutei because our ceo was friends with the guy who runs the brain lab at mit so we
