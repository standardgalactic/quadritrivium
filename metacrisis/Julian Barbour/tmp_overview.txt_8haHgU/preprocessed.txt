1. **Complexity Measure**: In the context of shape dynamics, complexity is a measure of clustering. It increases as particles approach each other, with the complexity going to infinity at the point of collision, which is never actually reached.

2. **Shapespace Representation**: The shapesphere and its extruded version (with complexity values) provide visual representations of the trajectories and complexities of three-body systems in shapespace. These representations highlight the paths of least complexity as blue lines on the shapesphere.

3. **Three-Body System Trajectory**: A trajectory of a three-body system shows a spiral around one of the peaks as two particles form a Kepler pair, with the third particle moving in the opposite direction, leading to an increase in complexity (and thus, no actual collision is depicted).

4. **Infinite Complexity**: As particles become more widely separated (in the case of one particle and a Kepler pair), their relative positions can appear to merge at infinity, leading to a point where complexity increases without bound.

5. **Mass Ratios**: The shapespace contours and alpha point (the point of minimum complexity) change depending on the mass ratios of the particles. With equal masses, there are three separate peaks. With unequal masses, these peaks can merge or become less pronounced.

6. **Relational Universe**: In shape dynamics, the universe is understood relationally, where only the masses and their ratios, as well as the separation distances between particles, matter for determining the dynamics of the system.

7. **Resources**: For further exploration of these concepts, Dr. Barber's website (www.plotonia.com) and his book "The Janus Point" are recommended resources. These resources provide more detailed explanations and additional information on shape dynamics and the relational nature of our universe.
