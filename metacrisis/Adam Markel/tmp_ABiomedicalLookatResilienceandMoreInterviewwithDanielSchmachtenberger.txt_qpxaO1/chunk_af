we happen to be a company right now but and i think you would hold this
so we're people with a mission that happens to be the vehicle that allows the mission to exist right
now reason why even as a company we have collected in the name you know i have to
collect it is to really achieve the mission given the scale that it is we need to participate with
everyone that's doing really wonderful work and so if they're we will only make products if there
is a major gap between the best of what's currently available and what we know how to make
if there's something that's already near the best of what's scientifically possible we'd
much rather partner because it's really hard to make stuff right it takes a lot of cycles
if anyone's done a good job with it we'd love to partner on kind of in any space so you know
this already is the beginning of partnership between us and i'm honored yeah collaboration
beautiful cheers thank you brother
