Neurohacker Collective it's in the process of going through a roll-up merger with some other
companies that we really love and we're partnering with so see that in the hopefully not too
distant future but you know we're we're focused on technologies of well-being
that can right now optimize neurologic function physiologic function in the near-term future
also psychological function to increase quality of human life human experience and human capability
um our specific approach which is different than other wellness or medicine approaches has to do
with uh complex comprehensive system science approach so when we're looking at um this involves
a few things it involves personalization it involves uh addressing multiple systems
simultaneously it involves synthesis of multiple different strategies and applied synergy you know
those kinds of things I can speak more about that in a minute but basically we saw that there were
major sources of human suffering physical pain anxiety depression etc that as well as chronic
illness that we had an approach that we believed could do something really novel to address and
our early testing showed that was true and that we were able to actually make major changes in
things that hadn't believed hadn't been believed to be modifiable or correctable things but that
beyond addressing human suffering and increasing individual human quality of life as we look at
the major macro issues of the world whether we're talking about religious extremism and female
general mutilation or violence towards children or overfishing of the oceans or total biodiversity
loss like all these issues are human behavior mediated and so changing them requires changing
patterns of human behavior and as I was talking about earlier you know the focus of changing
economics is because economics drives patterns of human behavior you make a well worth a million
dollars to add nothing alive in that incentive system drives human behavior so you have to
change macroeconomic incentives but you also so economics is one thing that affects human behavior
it's not the only thing right so all of the social systems that lead to incentive and status and you
know the kind of game theory dynamics are certain things that we need to change environmental
psychology and the way environments condition and pattern human behavior is another set of things
the thought where which is you know largely where you know I imagine you focus with your clients in
terms of changing people's definition of success their definition of self definition of other
working with integration healing trauma you know their strategies for how to navigate the world
all of that is key to patterns of human behavior so it's physiology and this was one of the things
that we really started to look at was in order to address the problems of the world at scale we have
to have humans that are not predisposed to continue causing those problems that's a big deal
we also have to have humans that are predisposed to solve the problems
and to create beauty and so this means humans that are oriented towards more empathy
more emotional resilience more creativity more multi-perspective taking and perspective
synthesis right more complex thinking to actually be able to solve complex problems
um and while all of that can be affected at the level of thought wear and must be
we saw that you know empathy is mediated over certain neural networks mediated by certain
neurochemistry and that there it can be down or up regulated physiologically so could complexity of
thinking so could impulse control right so could so many of those dynamics and we started looking at
neurochemical and neuro structural predisposition for uh dichopathy for sociopathy on one extreme
and how to not only prevent and correct those dynamics but also continue to support the evolution
of uh you know vicarious experience empathy etc beyond baseline intelligence ultimately you know
we talk about increasing human sovereignty and by sovereignty we mean the the product of people's
intelligence agency and sentience their sentience is their ability to sense the world
and this means sense themselves have more inner awareness because of that vicarious sensing of
other people empathy and uh more perceptivity about world around the mindfulness etc depth of
feeling this means their intelligence to process all of what they sense to make meaning out of it
to understand causation and dynamics and what effective solutions could look like
and then their agency their ability to actually act on and in the world with increase adaptive
capacity and power and so this is sensory input information processing actuator output closed
loop cycle right and how do we increase that whole thing which is both going to relate to their
quality of life individually and the way that they are an agent for the quality of life of everything
we touch and so we're interested in this this particular company neural hackers focused on
how do we increase human sovereignty what are all the technologies that are relevant to that
and as far as the biology goes what can we do to support the human biosystem to predispose
more sovereign adaptive agents right increase quality of human experience and human capacity
and choice making and so that's through chemistry that affects cognitive ability and
psychological resilience etc it's through but chemistry is just one pathway we are
very interested in every pathway so on physiology eeg neural feedback transcranial stimulation
closed loop neural feedback microbiomics in the gut all of those were basically technology
agnostic so it's not particular technology categories we're interested in we're interested
in technologies that work by increasing system resilience rather than overriding it to put you
in a particular range right and so fundamentally different than the you know traditional medical
approach our goal is not to identify a specific range of a biomarker we want people to be in and
if they're too high give them something that externally lowers it and if it's too low give
them something that externally raises it but to identify what's going on with their own regulatory
systems and increase the regulatory capacity of their system so they are more adaptive more resilient
as you talked about and so that's the gist of what we're working on doing here is how do we
optimize human quality of life and human capability to be a positive force for the quality of life
of everything else because realistically if we look at the balance sheet of nature right if we
think about the earth's balance sheet most humans are on the liability side of nature's balance sheet
and the humans all have to move to the asset side which means that they are doing more net
positive to the balance sheet of the commons and they are net negative and we're not even in the
realm of that and we need to be very quickly and so we want to increase the balance sheet of the
psychological emotional balance sheet of the human and where they live on nature's balance sheet
wow
so you're technology agnostic and at the moment you've developed certain products that you're
using to move that move tip those dominoes get them started right so just take a couple of minutes
we could share you know this is this is not a I know I know how you feel about this anyway so
it's not marketing or sales but I love people who are curious to just know a little bit about the
products that you've got and then last thing I'll say is you know where can people find out more
information that way they can they want to follow their curiosity they actually can
so you know the company started just under three years ago we only moved into sharing products
with people about six months ago we you know we're in testing with people over that entire time
but in terms of you know actual marketing um and so we have you didn't even choke when you said it
it's good right oh like I said we added that but uh and and so the of course the essence of how we
do marketing is education um and if people are interested in lined great um
so we have one product that is currently for sale that's available it's called qualia and
we have a handful more that are uh in various phases of development that will be coming available
soon and then a number of other ones that we're in just kind of early R&D on and why
we started with qualia a number of reasons one is um taking pills is a much more familiar thing to
people than hooking up transcranial devices to their head uh so there's much lower barrier of
entry to something that you know there's already familiarity with it requires almost no deep
behavior modification so it's also low barrier of entry from like a total behavioral input point of
view uh compared to intermittent fasting or exercise or something that takes you know some
will work uh and it can actually lead to increased predisposition to do those other things by
its dynamic on motivational chemistry um and specifically you were talking about the
pressure for productivity and how we have simultaneously an increasing pressure for
productivity while having an increasing number of topics that we're trying to be productive
across simultaneously while having more and more that is distracting um and you know shortening
attention span and things relevant to productivity in a world where we also have more
physiologic stresses from indoor outdoor pollution shittier diet etc so uh that's a lot
and as a result of it we've seen an exponential increase in off-label ateral sales of people
who are trying to deal with their productive capacity which is totally reasonable and energy
drinks and five-hour energy and other smart drugs and most of these are psychostimulant billions of
dollars in things to help people sleep so it's just truly incredible okay and so you know chemistry
to sleep chemistry to wake up and be productive chemistry to chill out and we're fans of chemistry
but we're fans of chemistry that have more comprehensively positive effects and have
longer term positive and at minimum longer term neutral rather than negative effects
and so that means that it's going to have to work with the way that the body regulates its own
chemistry rather than override the way the body does chemistry um so most of the kind of psychostimulants
that people have used for productivity enhancement cognitive enhancement aterol is a great example
and i'm not talking here about actual prescription aterol for um relevant things and we could argue
whether or not they're ever irrelevant but i'm not talking about that i'm talking about off-label use
which is huge whether it's people studying for midterms or finals or whether it's uh you know
people's tech startup or whatever um when you take a dopamine agonist like that that is going to
synthetically increase dopamine specifically and you aren't supporting the entire dopamine production
and regulatory process then the body becomes dependent upon an external right an exogenous
dopamine stimulation process so if you do that long term then you get down regulation of your own
endogenous dopamine process which means addiction right addiction dependence also if you are doing
exogenous stimulation you get a more fixed level of dopamine as opposed to more adaptive capacity
for your body to change its own dopamine levels based on what it's doing because you when you
want to chill out you don't want your dopamine high right um and dopamine by itself is not really
going to produce the kind of cognitive effects someone wants it's going to increase focus and
it's going to increase drive it's not going to increase working memory it's not it's going to decrease
some of the things that really matter and so you get a very narrow increase in some things
you get a decrease of other things that are actually meaningful to your goal in real time
and then longer term down regulation so our goal was could we produce a much more comprehensive set
of real time increases to the things that matter while having our long term effects be
neutral to positive on those same metrics and you know other metrics which would require a
fundamentally different approach it's not going to be you know any kind of pharma approach just
because the way the economics are structured where it has to be uh patentable to ever be able to make
enough money to go through FDA approval so it has to be synthetic it has to be single molecule
how could a synthetic single molecule ever comprehensively up regulate meaning synthetic
meaning it's not part it's not part of your normal endogenous chemistry and your normal chemistry
involves so many simultaneous parallel and sequential pathways how could that comprehensively
upregulate it just couldn't right it's just structurally not a reasonable approach to that
kind of thing so medicine so far western medicine has done a really good job with acute illness
and so if there's one cause of the issue like an acute infection or an acute injury then it can
deal with an acute solution to that single molecule can deal with that if it's a single pathway but
if we're talking about lots of pathways then we need a different way of approaching it and so
when you look at uh when people are taking cognitive enhancers when you look at what they
really want they want a kind of creative productive flow state where their cognitive
capacities are engaged which is different than the flow state an athlete wants where their cognitive
capacity is being online their linguistic capacities aren't really relevant but in fact
you know you hear the flow genome guys talking about flow states where prefrontal cortex is
shutting down and people are in a very just kind of automated response set but if you're trying to
write a book if you're trying to do science if you're trying to do a midterm if you're trying
to figure out how to do your tech startup you need a different kind of flow state than that right so
what does it mean to have a sense of flow a sense of heightened creativity a sense of heightened
productivity to actually have heightened productivity and uh where all of your cognitive
abilities are online well it involves cognitive capacities like speed of memory total working
memory short-term long-term memory digit span verbal fluency right all those things intensity
of concentration duration of focus task switching now these are very opposite things which is why
it's usually hard to increase them usually if i get intensity of focus i get pissed off if someone
distracts me usually if i have task switching fluid intelligence i can't focus that hard on
anything we actually want the ability to be deeply present with something and then be able to move if
we need to be deeply present come back right so how do we do all of those different functions
simultaneously those are cognitive abilities while also having increased sense of purposefulness
meaningfulness drive emotional resilience you know etc analysis critical thinking
synthesis creative thinking there's a lot of different things so that we started by kind of
modeling the space of what we're actually seeking to affect from a cognitive science point of view
and then looking at what are all the physiologic pathways that are known about that are involved
in mediating all of those functions then what chemistries can support those pathways and
then which of those chemistries are generally well tolerated synergistic with each other
have really good data on them and that was the beginning of our hypothesis process for generating
a complex chemistry formula there's lots of different ingredients affecting lots of different
pathways different neurotransmitters for kind of short-term effect but also longer-term effects
of supporting neurogenesis synaptogenesis for actually affecting you know structure and brain
um and then we went into of course an iterative process where we were taking our initial hypotheses
and testing them and then getting feedback and iterating until we got to a place that we were
really happy with it and of course there's continued iteration forever because that's nature of
evolution so that's qualia and obviously it it is not intended to treat any disease we make
no medical claims about it etc etc but the experience people have been reporting on it
over quite a lot of people now has been remarkable for a lot of people yep i'm i'm
one to add to that so i've had a very good experience with it and what's the best way for
people to follow their curiosity and learn more as you said educating and that's the best marketing
there is so i agree with that so neurohacker.com is our website and uh imagine you post this might
be able to put a link so it'll be easy for people and uh we've got a science section that describes
our approach and the formulation and site research and all that fun stuff and it's really just kind
of focused around qualia right now because it's the first product that's available as the other
products come online they'll be there and the total kind of education information on the site
sure there's a lot of projects that we're engaged on that aren't referenced on the site at all yet
because putting things up as they're actually available for people to engage with but we look
forward to having more to share soon it's exciting yeah daniel what what i don't know how long we've
been on i haven't even looked at the at the clock but it's been a blur very quick and incredibly
valuable so thank you for your time thanks for i know i think at this point when people will
will be listening uh you know viewing etc they'll be all times a day and night but uh this is your
fifth this is the fifth of these interviews that you've done all different today so i appreciate
you taking the time and i know your base is just uh you know just getting started so i appreciate
i appreciate your time and what you're doing in the world because it's a different type of solution
than i think i've heard come from really a company before and um and i'm intrigued by it you know i'm
i'm uh and i want to support it i mean that's what our company is committed to peace that's our
vision is to create peace through self-actualization so we're all about helping people just
do the things that create peace for themselves because i have this very simple philosophy it's
when enough people are are selflessly focused on just creating their own peace
we'll have a tipping point where there's there's just more peace in the world
in any given moment there'll be more peace in the world than there is anything else
i think that's a shifting event for for all of us so really really value brother thank you so much
likewise thank you it was a blast to be here and you know we're not really a company
