he also developed a narrative, this story of a kind of different experiences of consciousness
shaped throughout time, words of fossils of an older consciousness, as well as reflections of our
consciousness now. And that understanding that narrative is imaginatively, immensely creative
for us now, because older consciousnesses are not just things we've moved on from, but they have
their own genius, and they enable us to become awakened once more to something which was experienced
before, and particularly a participation in life, which is kind of our struggle now. It's a you
image of development, and it's completely ontologically committed, not because it knows
the divine, let alone all the spiritual reality and so on, but because it senses it's there,
and when it speaks to reality, when it tries to study, reach out to reality, it's a way
contraining itself for those moments when reality speaks back, it learns to hear, you might see,
like the AO in harp, with the music that comes out of the winds moving over its strings,
as well as to look, which is the more camera consciousness, trying to trade sort of snapshots
of reality. It brings in, I think, a whole story. Now if that was of interest, I'll be doing other
conversations about this, because I appreciate that I probably didn't capture all of it very clearly,
and it's quite a big story to tell, and if I may just make one plug, if you've got this far in the
story in my video, it's this book, which is coming out in August 2019, where I try to tell this story
through particularly the Christian consciousness, which is the one that's dominated in the West,
that's the reason for picking up on Christianity, but hopefully unpacks a lot of what Barfield has to
say. Thanks.
