bottom of everything at the root it's the foundation of it and we have to understand that and if we
can understand that in our individual lives we can't enliven not only ourselves but the actual
world i mean this is part the redemption is not just of ourselves it's redeeming the world as well
and we obviously we need to do that in real practical physical terms in terms of the ecology
environment but there's another way we can do it through how we envision the world how we how we
actually perceive the world and Blake would say as as you see so it becomes you know as as you see
the world so so it will become that so it's very important that we you know sort of have an idea of
the power behind the imagination thank you very much i mean i'm going to draw this first session
to a close sort of on that note that um it matters very much what we think what we imagine um and
just to introduce interject the note the notion of struggle because that's another key part of it
that well maybe i should invoke the more Sufi words since we're in this room used very regularly
by Sufis of bewilderment that this is a crucial part of the emergence of a true spiritual imagination
and this room is full of individual minds connected to one another struggling perhaps
with these ideas wondering what they realize um one resource which we've given to help this struggle
to help navigate through this bewilderment is a glossary of terms on the inside of the program
which i hope will help this sort of first session of really trying to get some grip on what we're
talking about you're also surrounded and these lovely round tables um by many people with many
different experiences some have written about barfield some have made films about barfield
one person is related to barfield because we have own barfield's grandson here um as well today
and other people that know about different traditions as well
so please in the breaks do make the effort to say hello because that's very much part of the day
which we're hoping to facilitate when we come back after the break we're going to have a panel of
four people with a different take on all these things and that too is really crucial the difference
because as gary mentioned there this notion of polarity is absolutely crucial to the emergence
of a true imagination what coleridge described as the tension between different points of view
that don't just get stuck in a kind of diaded combat to the death a zero sum game which so often
characterizes our um our world now but as jung put it to draw another thinker who's quite related
here creates what he called a transcendent function where the two can emerge into a third
and something completely new emerges from the meeting of the imaginations of the both
and so I hope very much that as we move into the second phase of today that might even start
to unfold in our experience as you listen to the panel um of the four where their different takes
on these things it meets your minds it meets your discussions and something starts to emerge
from this basis um but um that perhaps you didn't even quite expect and might be sort of shown to
you um as our participation I mean life maybe even today grows that little bit more so I'm gonna
call thing to a pause now I'm gonna say thank you very much to gary um for helping us to put down
these kind of foundational ideas but thanks very much for this first session I hope you're excited
I hope your imagination is stirring thank you
