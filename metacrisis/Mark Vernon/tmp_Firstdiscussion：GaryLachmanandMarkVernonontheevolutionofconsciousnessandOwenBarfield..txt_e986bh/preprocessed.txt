But let me turn now to Gary, I think we can sort of begin the content of the day.
Gary, now you met Owen Barfield, so tell us something about that, it would be good to
bring him in the room with someone who has met him.
Hello, yeah.
Sorry, this is a bit low here, but yeah, I met Owen Barfield in early 1996 when I first
moved to London from Los Angeles and I had become aware of him, well I became aware of
him because I was having difficulty trying to understand Rudolph Steiner and I'm sure
that's not an uncommon experience.
And I read, there was an anthology edited by Robert McDermott who was from Baruch University
but was also one of the leading lights at the California Institute of Integral Studies
and it was an interesting anthology of Steiner's writings and in the introduction he mentioned
Owen Barfield and he said that he was one of the Inklings and a friend of Tolkien, I
mean a friend of Lewis and things of that sort, so that struck me as interesting.
And then when I found Barfield he was much more readable than Steiner which is not to
diminish Steiner but Barfield's had quite a grasp of the English language.
And so I read quite a bit of him and then when I was here in the first few months I
was living here, it used to be, I don't know if it still exists but there was a little Steiner
bookshop over on, I think it was High Hallburn, it was called the Wellspring Bookshop and I
was in there and they had quite a few of Barfield's books and I was looking at them and the fellow
running the place said, well he likes visitors you know and I didn't know that so I was pleased
to learn it and he told me where Barfield was up in Forest Rogue, East Grinstead and
he gave me a phone number to call so being an enterprising young 40 year old something,
I gave him a call and he invited me out to visit him so this must have been February
or March 1996 and I think it was the last interview, I don't know for sure but that's
the impression I get and oddly enough in a way I had met him in a different way months
earlier when I was still living in Los Angeles and I forget how I got involved with this
but there was a professor of English at University of California Los Angeles, UCLA, G.B. Tennyson
and he was a big promoter of Barfield's work and he edited or brought together some of
reissues of his books but he was working on a video, a documentary of Barfield and somehow
I got involved transcribing about 20 hours worth of videotape of interview with Barfield
so I spent about a week, several hours a day listening over and over trying to get exactly
what he was saying, I mean the documentary is up on YouTube, it's a half hour so after
about somewhere between 15 and 20 hours worth of videotape I boiled it down to a half hour
so I sort of felt I knew him or had met him and then when I actually did meet him, no
it was wonderful, he was brilliant, very sharp, witted, he I suspect was 97 or 98 at the time
and he was staying in a sort of, not exactly a care home but he was living in a sort of
an estate where he was taking care of and things of that sort because he was elderly
but one of the things I said to him was that I don't usually see too many 97 year old people
and he said, oh really, I meet them every day so he was very clever and I just found,
I mean he's quite humble, Barfield, about his own contribution to this notion of an
evolution of consciousness and he says that he was working on it before he became introduced
to Steiner's work, if you know Barfield's books, his very first, well nonfiction book,
history and English language, history and English words, is about the evolution of consciousness
through the study of language and then he said, well I was doing this on a small scale
and then when I became aware of Uro Steiner's work it was a much larger operation that he
was doing.
That may be the case but I was more convinced and I found more of a way into this particular
way of understanding the evolution of consciousness through Barfield's writing than I had through
Steiner's because, again, not to diminish Steiner but you don't have to get over the
hurdles of sort of Lemuria and Atlantis and various sort of root races and things of that
sort, sort of the Blavatsky and the esophical inheritance that Steiner had because if you
follow Barfield's argument through the study of language you will see that it makes sense
that there is this or there's evidence for a kind of evolution that's taken place.
So let me jump in there and see whether my understanding of these sort of key terms resonates
with yours and let's see if we can sort of begin to nail this down.
This is not about the hard problem.
If you thought today is going to be another step towards solving how meat generates mind
as it's sometimes rather gruesomely put, that's not today.
We are assuming that our most immediate experience awareness consciousness is the most sure thing
we can rely on.
What consciousness means therefore in this context is our perception, how we experience
what it is to be human, what we see, what we don't see both with our senses but also
with the mind's eye.
So it's all that, it's the nature of consciousness.
Evolution doesn't mean Darwinian evolution, we're not talking about how consciousness
might have arose or emerged, emanated even over the millennia of our species but rather
how it shifted more recently in cultural time and particularly it's over the last 3,000
years or so and the reason why that's such a good period is because as Gary just mentioned
there, words were the key bit of evidence for Barfield that he worked on and he realized
that words don't just transmit meaning now, you know, you're not just hearing acoustic
vibrations coming across the airwaves, you're actually hearing meaning as I speak, I hope.
And it's that which is most immediate to us but if that's true now Barfield realized
then words that have changed meaning over time can become what he called fossils of
consciousness and if you can track back how meaning has changed over that time then you
can track back how consciousness has changed too.
And what he realized when he did this was it wasn't just that people had different ideas
or insights or thoughts but the very nature of thinking, the very way of receiving insights
from the world around had itself changed too and this is really the key notion I think
and this is what this notion of participation means.
It means that the way that we engage actively or passively with each other in the world
around us, it's not just developed in a kind of linear sense but the means by which we
do it has changed so interestingly as well.
So let me just give you a couple of examples that I hope flesh that out and Gary and then
I'll pass back to you.
If you read say Homer or if you read say the earliest bits of the Hebrew Bible or other
ancient traditions maybe even if you look to indigenous peoples today who still I think
carry this older consciousness they may well say use myth much more than theory.
They may well tell stories that somehow keep them, give them a sense of direction through
what feels like a sort of flow of meaning within which life is embedded rather than
say our approach which is to come up with a theory say a proposition and idea which
we feel exists more or less inside us that we then as a word step back into the world
to try and test out, to try and see whether it's true or not.
So rather than as a word having maybe a whole panoply of myths, maybe a whole pantheon of
gods that people previously would have turned to to navigate say their way through autumn
or winter, spring, summer for a period of life depending on where they were through
a rite of passage in life and use that to navigate this sense of way through life.
We tend to look for well ideally even one theory that kind of sums it all that can capture
everything that we then sort of test into the world and I quite often feel that a good
way of summarizing it is that Balfour realized that where consciousness before was experienced
from the outside in, we now tend to experience it from the inside out and this leads me to
the sort of second big idea I think that's in Balfour's and then he found in Steiner
and I think you can find in other figures as well which is that the individual matters
more to us today in the sense that we regarded as the kind of primary site of say our development
of progress, of almost sovereignty you might say, you know there is probably as many women
in this room as there are men because we value the individual rather than say in this older
consciousness which Balfour called original participation where your social status sort
of showed the place in society where you could flourish.
So justice back then for example meant a harmonious society where everyone was living to their
fullest humanity but in their place in the cosmos in the divine order whereas now for
us justice means how you as an individual can exercise not only your rights but can
become all that you might be able to become as an individual which in principle is as
much and the same as everybody else around you.
So the individual matters in terms of the divine this also I think was key to the understanding
of monotheism and the understanding of particularly of the significance that Christianity played
in this evolution of consciousness because what Balfour argued and I think this is true
for Steiner in his way as well that whereas say in the earliest parts of the Hebrew Bible
and certainly in the ancient Greek world pantheism many gods was the natural way of experiencing
the world around you because you experienced yourself as related to this kind of scattering
of spiritual beings of entities of vitalities round and about that you drew into yourself
to find a life.
We now experience ourselves at least in principle as kind of gathered holes having a kind of
integrity and a oneness of ourself and so certainly in the Hebrew tradition this old
difficult to understand perception that Yahweh might be I am comes to be realized in the
reflection and the echo of your own I amness that you can see catch a glimpse of the divine
oneness the divine I amness and so one of the key steps in the evolution of consciousness
in this 3000 year period was the emergence of monotheism in the Jewish tradition that
became Christianity that became Judaism as we understand it and in fact has been quite
a big influence upon religiosity spiritual traditions around the world as well.
So that's the kind of Christian bit why Barfield saw the position of Jesus and the emergence
of Christianity is a kind of pivotal point he talks about being a kind of turning of
the tide where this oneness gathered to such a point that individuals could start to realize
that first of all a person who had lived who transmitted the divine and that could become
our calling to our most fully flourishing moment for us as human beings too would be
to know the divine oneness as well. Gary does that make sense to you in terms of your understanding?
Well I know that for Steiner Christ's incarnation and then what he calls the mystery of Golgotha
which was the crucifixion was sort of the center the most important event in human history
so far at least but I have to say my own approach to Barfield and to Steiner was to kind of
not necessarily Christ-free but it wasn't sort of the way I got into it and before I go on I just
want to say something that on a personal note I'm quite thrilled and honored to be here because
in a book I wrote called Secret History of Consciousness in which I talk about Barfield's
ideas in the context of other philosophers of consciousness one of the people I talk about
in there was PDU Spensky who in the 1930s and 40s held his talks and groups here you might have
noticed the blue plaque outside on the building so on a personal note I feel kind of chuffed
as they say to be in the same space that Spensky was in and he probably would have thought
but well I'm sure he didn't have much good to say about Steiner so I suspect he wouldn't have had
too much good to say about Barfield either but I mean the notion of a kind of group consciousness
or more I don't want to use the word racial but Steiner used that and Barfield used that as well
a kind of consciousness in which the individual was not as important or didn't play as important a
role this is something that I could see happening in the shift from this original participation
in which we're embedded we're embedded in nature then we're embedded in the world where we don't
have the sense of separation from it which we enjoy or languish in today depending on when
you're feeling it and this was something that I thought was very key because one of them
one of the issues with I mean we recognize that there's something wrong with human consciousness
there's something wrong with our consciousness that we're not particularly happy we have a vague
sense that things aren't quite right and it's got something to do with our being separated
from the rest of nature something to do with being separated from the rest of the world
and in a general broad sense in the alternative or mystical or spiritual community this is seen as
kind of a bad thing this is the fall you know we've fallen from this earlier state of unity
of connectedness of being part of the the great surround and it's sort of a negative thing that
we found ourselves here kind of alienated and but barfield and steiner and other people that I
wrote about in my book the with barfield people like the german swiss philosopher gene gebser
or the maverick french alchemist and egyptologist r. r. e. shwala dilubic the british writer
collin wilson uh yes this this sense of uh what do we saw kind of separateness or detachment or
alienation it's um kind of a period of growth let's say it's sort of something we have to get
through to be able to get to a barfield called final participation which would be something
he talks about it in the context of reading poetry this is how it kind of came to him
um he talks about how the same sort of shift in consciousness that he experienced in reading
poetry and the poetry that he's talking about are the romantic poets people like keats and
shelly and blake and wordsworth uh who are the lyrical poets they are what they're talking about
is the soul they're talking about the inner world uh and this had got lost in the modern in the modern
age the kind of sudden shift or break or change in consciousness that he experienced in his reading
these poets he got from reading ancient language as well and the difference there was where the
poets are sort of going out of their way they're trying to make this effect they're using language
in order to create this effect to kind of break the barrier between inner and outer and when you
have that poetic moment um it's it's a mini mystical experience you the separation between you and the
outer world ego and the non-ego is dissolved briefly and you as blake said you can see heaven
in a wild flower or you know the world in a grain of sand and things of that sort and it's something
that we experience from our children and and we grow out of necessarily so i would say in order
to deal with the world because the world is a difficult place uh if every time we everything
we saw was infinite we wouldn't get much done you know we'd be kind of stuck uh uh uh you know just
sort of uh just completely gobsmacked by you know the mystery of existence itself so seem to be a
necessary evolutionary change in order to take ourselves out of that but we you know with the
apron strings cut we found ourselves adrift in the cosmos i mean the american novelist walk with
persie had a book called lost in the cosmos and it's uh it's i think it's a good kind of summing
up of where we find ourselves but this is a it's not we talk about evolution of consciousness we
we've arrived at this place we have come to this place through a process the consciousness we feel
today is not consciousness per se and what barfield discovered in poetry but also ancient language
was a kind of consciousness that seemed to not experience this detachment not experience the
separation from inner and outer it was the language suggested that that wasn't the case
and this suggested to him that at an earlier time the kind of participatory consciousness
in the sense that inner and outer uh are not separate but there's a continuum that the poets and
you know mystics talk about and which today you know we can we can experience if we ingest
certain substances or meditate or something like that this was something that was common let us say
it's radically new for us but it was common back in an earlier time but they didn't possess the
individual ego consciousness that we have now so it's like okay you can have the separate ego
consciousness where you feel free and you're able to make decisions but you're completely detached
from the rest of the the cosmos in your lost in the world or you can be embedded in consciousness
uh in in the world and feel that closeness and that connection but you don't have the individual
sense of self and you can make your own decisions and um you know you have free will so neither of
those seem to be a good answer but what barfield discovered through his uh reading of poetry was
that there seemed to be times when you have both at the same time and this out of this he developed
his notions of polarity and things of that sort so um i would say that i mean i know both in barfield
and steiner the sort of christ event is the christ incarnation and crucifixion is sort of the
he talks about kind of a v shape movement and you know we start up up here metaphorically
closer to the cosmos closer to this you know the spiritual world and the divine and all that
gradually through a process of crystallization or hardening we lose that connection but we're
gaining the individual ego but not at the bottom of the v that's like the worst you know that's at
the dark night of the soul as it were but then with um pristina and for barfield christ's
incarnation crucifixion is the beginning of the upward movement back back towards the spiritual
realms but with retaining our our ego consciousness and this would be something that i i would say
most spiritual practices aim at in some way although there are some schools that say no we
just got to get rid of the ego completely and plunge back into the one but i i i don't think
it's understandable that some schools would uh uh think in that way but i don't think that's the
way that barfield thought we should go or steiner or any of the to me the really important spiritual
thinkers yeah i mean that's a very helpful point i think because it's one of the reasons why
barfield very much started making sense to me is that you can read older spiritual texts where the
return to the oneness and with a kind of dissolution of self um seems to be the goal maybe a deep
dreamless sleep these kind of metaphors are used um but i think that with this evolution idea you
get a sense of um how the alienation of today which you described there itself has meaning and is
part of this process because what we're invited into uh in the future is a freedom where both we
have our sense of being uh individuals but as it were our microcosm reflects the macrocosm once
more the many return to the one but without losing the individuality of the many um this is both as
it were um the task and the mystery um which you see echoes um across very many traditions
now um you mentioned coleridge there and um maybe just to add a little bit about the imagination
which you have written about and i have as well um because it feels to me this is one of the key
faculties that we have now um imagination itself is a word that has a history and it did not mean
the same thing that it means in the modern world as it did say if you read imagination and epicurus
um now what it means is that we are if you like kind of fantasy generating individuals
people um we're constantly um rather than as a we're receiving receiving the stream of insights
and impressions and presences from the outside we experience them now as emerging from within us
and what people like barfield drawing a lot on coleridge actually in the romantic tradition
realized is that a lot of these fantasies that come from within us um are maybe fun but they're
a bit chaotic and they don't really add up to much they don't really take us anywhere but every so
often one of these fantasies really lives and if we can stay with it if we can sort of follow its
energy and its spirit without trying to reduce it too much too quickly it takes us into a whole
new world um this is what barfield discovered when he read poetry um it's what coleridge
referred to when he said that our imagination proper um this creative part of ourselves this
expansive part of ourselves that lives and grows is but an echo of the divine imagination
which runs through all of creation and with people like william blake as well he felt that is what
creativity is in fact it's kind of like the divine imagination um emanating and exploring
extending the world we too are called to be part of that and so in terms of spiritual practice
one of the things which i feel say psychotherapy which is one of my own practices i work as a
psychotherapist um can get onto is how our fantasies aren't just illuminating about our inner lives
in dreams say in synchronicities um in maybe even um unusual experiences um but when we can
stay with them we realize that their but echoes of the inner life of the whole world um as barfield
put it rather beautifully um and so our imagination is one of our key kind of faculties that we need
to learn it's not just as we're adding color to the world um which i think is how c.s lewis
rather sold it we hadn't quite um mentioned uh inklings yet but another really important part
of barfield's life was his relationship with both c.s lewis and jr are talking both lewis and talking
broadly said that barfield had the best ideas they had the genius ability with writing and so
are now wildly and well known throughout the world um but um but barfield was really key that this
imaginative writing that they were so good at wasn't just um allegorizing meaning wasn't just as it were
maybe amplifying what rational thought can pin down but was itself part of the experience part
of the knowledge and in particular was the way that we grow into this return to what was called
original participation but he referred to as final participation um by final he didn't mean the end
point what he meant was it's the teleological um points to which we're moving the kind of um
the the heuristic goal as it were to know both ourselves ritually and fully um as individual
souls but realizing that our our egos had become in the service you might say of the wider self
as jung called it um or as the divine i am um as would maybe be more of the judo christian way of
putting it um so um the imagination is so key here and i think you know in science we're going to
develop this i hope after the break and with the scientists on our panels um but it's in that
romantic tradition of science which realizes that the intuitions that then get developed
um into the hard science come from an immersion in the world um be that by literally traveling the
world as figures like horn bolt realized when they developed the notion of ecology um or by
imaginative um thought exercises as einstein realized when he realized when he thought about
traveling on a light beam um that led to the science of relativity um personal development
it's about i think not this um how do i sort of get over my ego but in a way how do i go into the
ego more and more and more to discern how it can open up into the service of the wider whole so
that i don't know a realignment takes place within myself um i think you know spiritual
experience is often about that now sometimes it happens rather dramatically and then people
work out what that realignment might be um and call it waking up or enlightenment um sometimes
it's a steady slow process as was the case much more in my own experience through um the bitter
years the hard struggle years of psychoanalysis um in the more Jungian tradition um what it means
for our society is very very pressing now of course with the ecological crisis and broadly
speaking i think it's going to mean something like realigning our sense of growth so that's not
just about material growth which is the accumulation you might say of more and more and more and the
development of technology um which has its own blessing its own great benefits um but it's going
to be realizing there's another kind of growth that that material and technological growth itself
can be in the service of which is about rediscovering the depths of reality about awakening ourselves
even to not just forces in nature you might say but the spiritual reality of nature wants
more the inside of the whole world and the intelligence within which our own intelligence
rests and can capture an echo um so that's something a bit about um you know what this move
from the now the meaning of the now um towards something different might be about again any
further thoughts yeah well i mean um imagination was key for barfield and colleridge and blake and
you know many others as well and one of the things that i uh do in in we're written about barfield
is that i said i lined him up with some other thinkers and there's something that they share
in the sense that we think of imagination as um fantasy and coming up with a substitute for
reality or in a utilitarian sense being on the cutting edge being you know innovative and you
know getting ahead of your competitors in in the market and things of that sort and of course we
still have a place for it in the arts and all that sort of thing but um as mark said i mean for
barfield and for the other people we're talking about imagination is key it's it's it's central we
wouldn't be seeing this room we're in now uh were it not for imagination not in the sense that we're
making it unreal but it's a formative power it it it informs what we're seeing if we were just
left to just the sensory perceptions of things out here in the room it wouldn't make any sense we
we wouldn't know what any of the things were they wouldn't be things they would be sense data in this
kind of you know uh very fundamental sense they become things in the sense that our imaginative
power which is a creative power forms them turns them into um recognizable shapes and forms and
objects that actually again we just look at it blankly it's it's not even a chair it's a chair
because you bring your imagination to it you know what a chair is it's your idea of what a chair and
it's a chair because it it shares many other uh shares all the qualities that chairs have and
other chairs have them as well and things of that sort but the other aspect um i'm saying there's two
two things i would say about imagination is that it's basically a way of getting to the inside of
things our rational ego consciousness deals with the outside of things and again rightly so the world
is a difficult dangerous place um you only need to know we reduce our experience to just enough to
be able to deal with it i mean um i talk about the distinction very simple you know a thumbnail way
of looking at it between sort of survival consciousness and appreciative consciousness
so there's a survival consciousness when you're walking down the street and you see this large
body hurtling towards you down the road you don't need to know the make and model or the color
of the car you just need to know to get out of the way of it just as if you're in the jungle and
there's a large uh being over there some shape moving towards you and it's making a loud noise you
don't you don't have time to marvel at the you know the stripes on the tiger and things of that
sort you just need to get out of its way once you've got out of its way and you're safe and all
that then you can turn around and say oh what a lovely you know oh that's a mercedes 1966 or whatever
it is something like that you can take in all the irrelevant information from a purely practical
utilitarian survival aspect we need both i mean someone who's brought this up and uh rebooted
a great many of these questions in a scientific context is uh ema gilchrist i don't know if you
know his book master and his emissary where he reboots the whole left brain right brain story
which had got kind of sidelined for quite some time and i talk about McGilchrist's work in the
context with barfield because barfield is talking about participation that's very much it seems to
me along the lines of what McGilchrist is saying how the right brain engages with the world and the
difference he makes is that what he and other neuroscientists discovered it isn't so much what
each brain does they seem to be doing the same sorts of things but it's how they do them and the
left brain is very precise it's very good at narrowing down to detail and it gets you know
finer and finer sharper and sharper sharper more precise detail at the expense of the connection
to the larger whole the right brain presents a global total picture but it's fuzzy it's not as
detailed uh the right brain sees the forest the left brain sees the trees it sees the individual
leaf on the tree it sees the individual veins in the leaf it sees the individual cells making
up the veins in the leaf you know finer and finer and finer in detail we need this it's absolutely
necessary but we gain that at the loss of the connection much like the ego you know we become
more and more conscious of ourselves as separate individual egos but we lose the sense of connectedness
we gain the connect sense of connectedness at the expense of having that kind of sense of ego but
imagination of barfield is a way of seeing into the inside of things and this is something that
the french philosopher arnie berkson talked about in the late 19th early 20th century is intuition
i mentioned shwala dilubic he's he's the fellow who's first said that the sphinx was much older
than the official account because the erosion marks on it are from water not from sand and wind
so it must have been there quite some time ago when there was a lot of rain
in egypt which hasn't been the case for for for some time but he talked about something called
the intelligence of the heart and this is something that he believed the ancient egyptians
knew and understood and their whole religious pantheon is based on this and again it was a way
being able to understand the inside of something and someone who took this idea very seriously
and was a major influence on rudolf steiner was the german poet scientist novelist statesman
gerter gerter developed a whole scientific approach using the imagination he wrote a book
the metamorphosis of plants where he devoted this kind of loving attentiveness to the study of plants
and he he claimed that he was able to perceive something that he called earth lanza which is
the primal plant it's a kind of arctipple plant that isn't it's not sensory you can't see it
with the senses and it's not just a concept it inhabits this intermediate intermediary realm
that the french phenomenologist and student of persian mysticism on recorbin would later call
the imaginal it's it's not the imaginary which is the fantasy which is the substitute for reality
but the imaginal is a realm in between the physical and the purely conceptual it's a realm of images
it's that's the realm of poetry that's the realm of the imagination mark was talking about these
fantasies that come up in our consciousness at times and these are images young would say
they're emerging from well your personal unconscious but also your collective unconscious
and they tell us something about the world they have a real cognitive content and this is relates
to the other thing i wanted to say about imagination whereas as if it is the case that for the last
300 400 years we've sidelined the imagination in favor of this more precise rational logical
scientific you know material you know however you want to characterize it way of dealing with the
world it isn't the the the answer to that or the what should we say you know what what we need to do
to correct that imbalance isn't just to plunge into the imagination itself i mean barfield was
very concerned about that i mean in a book of his called saving the appearances that came out in
the late fifties because he because because barfield believed there was a real relationship between
what goes on here and what happens outside i mean one of the strangest things steiner ever said that
the way the world will appear in the future depends on what people are thinking now which suggests
that the way the world appears now is a result of the how people thought sometime before us
and this this is goes completely against you know our modern rational thinking because this this is
this you know this is just like there's a little blob of consciousness in my head in your head in
your head it doesn't get outside of of our skull but what barfield and steiner and these others say
is like unlike vegas what happens in the mind doesn't stay there it actually goes out into the world
and it affects the world in some way and this is you know we talk about this in a pop kind of
um trivial way about create your own reality and things of that sort which is based on something
true but i think a lot of it's used today is rather shallow and uh it's a kind of trivial way but
it's based on a fundamental true idea this our inner world is intimately connected with this
outer world out there we've lost the sense of that in these moments of participation through you
know meditation or poetry or anything that does it we have a brief feeling of there's a
continuum between the two and the next step is to realize oh well what happens here takes precedent
what happens here after some time will affect the world in the out there so it's very important
what we imagine it isn't just plunging into any kind of you know imagination let's go let
you know just let the imagination go and let it rip and it'll be better and this was sort of
some of the romantics believe that at different times in history um a book i wrote about the 1960s
it was something like that too the sort of 60s counterculture uh sort of the rejection of the
scientific materialist reductive world they said but let's let the imagination rip let the unconscious
rip let it just go and barfield was concerned that um at the time the sort of art that he was aware
of was being produced uh suggested that the imagination was delving into some rather dark
kinds of places he was concerned about surrealism and things of that sort and i would think today
i mean you might read what he says and think oh my god he was hysterical he was an alarmist
and all that but i don't know if you look around at the art i see these days i don't say it's got
much better uh than when it was when um barfield was writing he was concerned so it's very important
what we actually imagine it's not it's not any old imagination will do and this is a distinction
courage makes as well it's really important the difference between what he calls true imagination
and and fancy or fantasy and a simple distinction is with fancy or fantasy you take things that
are already made and you put them together in strange ways so you put some wings on pigs
you have flying pigs you don't see them they're a product of imagination but they're not truly
original or truly creative because you're taking stuff that's already been made and just putting
it together in a strange combination whereas for courage for Blake and the others the product of
true imagination it may not seem original or novel in the kind of sense that we want to see
things novel but it's it's truly original because it goes back to the origin it it it's an echo and
uh a product of the origin which is this true imagination which for Blake for Coleridge for
barfield um so many of the others we're talking about here is at the root of the the phenomenal
world i mean you have to turn it around completely i mean we tend to think in the modern world
imagination is just something that we kind of tack on to make life a little bit you know
better to make it a little more bearable whereas they're saying no it's at the it's at the fundamental
bottom of everything at the root it's the foundation of it and we have to understand that and if we
can understand that in our individual lives we can't enliven not only ourselves but the actual
world i mean this is part the redemption is not just of ourselves it's redeeming the world as well
and we obviously we need to do that in real practical physical terms in terms of the ecology
environment but there's another way we can do it through how we envision the world how we how we
actually perceive the world and Blake would say as as you see so it becomes you know as as you see
the world so so it will become that so it's very important that we you know sort of have an idea of
the power behind the imagination thank you very much i mean i'm going to draw this first session
to a close sort of on that note that um it matters very much what we think what we imagine um and
just to introduce interject the note the notion of struggle because that's another key part of it
that well maybe i should invoke the more Sufi words since we're in this room used very regularly
by Sufis of bewilderment that this is a crucial part of the emergence of a true spiritual imagination
and this room is full of individual minds connected to one another struggling perhaps
with these ideas wondering what they realize um one resource which we've given to help this struggle
to help navigate through this bewilderment is a glossary of terms on the inside of the program
which i hope will help this sort of first session of really trying to get some grip on what we're
talking about you're also surrounded and these lovely round tables um by many people with many
different experiences some have written about barfield some have made films about barfield
one person is related to barfield because we have own barfield's grandson here um as well today
and other people that know about different traditions as well
so please in the breaks do make the effort to say hello because that's very much part of the day
which we're hoping to facilitate when we come back after the break we're going to have a panel of
four people with a different take on all these things and that too is really crucial the difference
because as gary mentioned there this notion of polarity is absolutely crucial to the emergence
of a true imagination what coleridge described as the tension between different points of view
that don't just get stuck in a kind of diaded combat to the death a zero sum game which so often
characterizes our um our world now but as jung put it to draw another thinker who's quite related
here creates what he called a transcendent function where the two can emerge into a third
and something completely new emerges from the meeting of the imaginations of the both
and so I hope very much that as we move into the second phase of today that might even start
to unfold in our experience as you listen to the panel um of the four where their different takes
on these things it meets your minds it meets your discussions and something starts to emerge
from this basis um but um that perhaps you didn't even quite expect and might be sort of shown to
you um as our participation I mean life maybe even today grows that little bit more so I'm gonna
call thing to a pause now I'm gonna say thank you very much to gary um for helping us to put down
these kind of foundational ideas but thanks very much for this first session I hope you're excited
I hope your imagination is stirring thank you
