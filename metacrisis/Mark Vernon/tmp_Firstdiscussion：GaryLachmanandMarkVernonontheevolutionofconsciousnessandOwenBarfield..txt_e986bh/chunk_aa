But let me turn now to Gary, I think we can sort of begin the content of the day.
Gary, now you met Owen Barfield, so tell us something about that, it would be good to
bring him in the room with someone who has met him.
Hello, yeah.
Sorry, this is a bit low here, but yeah, I met Owen Barfield in early 1996 when I first
moved to London from Los Angeles and I had become aware of him, well I became aware of
him because I was having difficulty trying to understand Rudolph Steiner and I'm sure
that's not an uncommon experience.
And I read, there was an anthology edited by Robert McDermott who was from Baruch University
but was also one of the leading lights at the California Institute of Integral Studies
and it was an interesting anthology of Steiner's writings and in the introduction he mentioned
Owen Barfield and he said that he was one of the Inklings and a friend of Tolkien, I
mean a friend of Lewis and things of that sort, so that struck me as interesting.
And then when I found Barfield he was much more readable than Steiner which is not to
diminish Steiner but Barfield's had quite a grasp of the English language.
And so I read quite a bit of him and then when I was here in the first few months I
was living here, it used to be, I don't know if it still exists but there was a little Steiner
bookshop over on, I think it was High Hallburn, it was called the Wellspring Bookshop and I
was in there and they had quite a few of Barfield's books and I was looking at them and the fellow
running the place said, well he likes visitors you know and I didn't know that so I was pleased
to learn it and he told me where Barfield was up in Forest Rogue, East Grinstead and
he gave me a phone number to call so being an enterprising young 40 year old something,
I gave him a call and he invited me out to visit him so this must have been February
or March 1996 and I think it was the last interview, I don't know for sure but that's
the impression I get and oddly enough in a way I had met him in a different way months
earlier when I was still living in Los Angeles and I forget how I got involved with this
but there was a professor of English at University of California Los Angeles, UCLA, G.B. Tennyson
and he was a big promoter of Barfield's work and he edited or brought together some of
reissues of his books but he was working on a video, a documentary of Barfield and somehow
I got involved transcribing about 20 hours worth of videotape of interview with Barfield
so I spent about a week, several hours a day listening over and over trying to get exactly
what he was saying, I mean the documentary is up on YouTube, it's a half hour so after
about somewhere between 15 and 20 hours worth of videotape I boiled it down to a half hour
so I sort of felt I knew him or had met him and then when I actually did meet him, no
it was wonderful, he was brilliant, very sharp, witted, he I suspect was 97 or 98 at the time
and he was staying in a sort of, not exactly a care home but he was living in a sort of
an estate where he was taking care of and things of that sort because he was elderly
but one of the things I said to him was that I don't usually see too many 97 year old people
and he said, oh really, I meet them every day so he was very clever and I just found,
I mean he's quite humble, Barfield, about his own contribution to this notion of an
evolution of consciousness and he says that he was working on it before he became introduced
to Steiner's work, if you know Barfield's books, his very first, well nonfiction book,
history and English language, history and English words, is about the evolution of consciousness
through the study of language and then he said, well I was doing this on a small scale
and then when I became aware of Uro Steiner's work it was a much larger operation that he
was doing.
That may be the case but I was more convinced and I found more of a way into this particular
way of understanding the evolution of consciousness through Barfield's writing than I had through
Steiner's because, again, not to diminish Steiner but you don't have to get over the
hurdles of sort of Lemuria and Atlantis and various sort of root races and things of that
sort, sort of the Blavatsky and the esophical inheritance that Steiner had because if you
follow Barfield's argument through the study of language you will see that it makes sense
that there is this or there's evidence for a kind of evolution that's taken place.
So let me jump in there and see whether my understanding of these sort of key terms resonates
with yours and let's see if we can sort of begin to nail this down.
This is not about the hard problem.
If you thought today is going to be another step towards solving how meat generates mind
as it's sometimes rather gruesomely put, that's not today.
We are assuming that our most immediate experience awareness consciousness is the most sure thing
we can rely on.
What consciousness means therefore in this context is our perception, how we experience
what it is to be human, what we see, what we don't see both with our senses but also
with the mind's eye.
So it's all that, it's the nature of consciousness.
Evolution doesn't mean Darwinian evolution, we're not talking about how consciousness
might have arose or emerged, emanated even over the millennia of our species but rather
how it shifted more recently in cultural time and particularly it's over the last 3,000
years or so and the reason why that's such a good period is because as Gary just mentioned
there, words were the key bit of evidence for Barfield that he worked on and he realized
that words don't just transmit meaning now, you know, you're not just hearing acoustic
vibrations coming across the airwaves, you're actually hearing meaning as I speak, I hope.
And it's that which is most immediate to us but if that's true now Barfield realized
then words that have changed meaning over time can become what he called fossils of
consciousness and if you can track back how meaning has changed over that time then you
can track back how consciousness has changed too.
And what he realized when he did this was it wasn't just that people had different ideas
or insights or thoughts but the very nature of thinking, the very way of receiving insights
from the world around had itself changed too and this is really the key notion I think
and this is what this notion of participation means.
It means that the way that we engage actively or passively with each other in the world
around us, it's not just developed in a kind of linear sense but the means by which we
do it has changed so interestingly as well.
So let me just give you a couple of examples that I hope flesh that out and Gary and then
I'll pass back to you.
If you read say Homer or if you read say the earliest bits of the Hebrew Bible or other
ancient traditions maybe even if you look to indigenous peoples today who still I think
carry this older consciousness they may well say use myth much more than theory.
They may well tell stories that somehow keep them, give them a sense of direction through
what feels like a sort of flow of meaning within which life is embedded rather than
say our approach which is to come up with a theory say a proposition and idea which
we feel exists more or less inside us that we then as a word step back into the world
to try and test out, to try and see whether it's true or not.
So rather than as a word having maybe a whole panoply of myths, maybe a whole pantheon of
gods that people previously would have turned to to navigate say their way through autumn
or winter, spring, summer for a period of life depending on where they were through
a rite of passage in life and use that to navigate this sense of way through life.
We tend to look for well ideally even one theory that kind of sums it all that can capture
everything that we then sort of test into the world and I quite often feel that a good
way of summarizing it is that Balfour realized that where consciousness before was experienced
from the outside in, we now tend to experience it from the inside out and this leads me to
the sort of second big idea I think that's in Balfour's and then he found in Steiner
and I think you can find in other figures as well which is that the individual matters
more to us today in the sense that we regarded as the kind of primary site of say our development
of progress, of almost sovereignty you might say, you know there is probably as many women
in this room as there are men because we value the individual rather than say in this older
consciousness which Balfour called original participation where your social status sort
of showed the place in society where you could flourish.
So justice back then for example meant a harmonious society where everyone was living to their
fullest humanity but in their place in the cosmos in the divine order whereas now for
us justice means how you as an individual can exercise not only your rights but can
become all that you might be able to become as an individual which in principle is as
much and the same as everybody else around you.
So the individual matters in terms of the divine this also I think was key to the understanding
of monotheism and the understanding of particularly of the significance that Christianity played
in this evolution of consciousness because what Balfour argued and I think this is true
for Steiner in his way as well that whereas say in the earliest parts of the Hebrew Bible
and certainly in the ancient Greek world pantheism many gods was the natural way of experiencing
the world around you because you experienced yourself as related to this kind of scattering
of spiritual beings of entities of vitalities round and about that you drew into yourself
to find a life.
We now experience ourselves at least in principle as kind of gathered holes having a kind of
integrity and a oneness of ourself and so certainly in the Hebrew tradition this old
difficult to understand perception that Yahweh might be I am comes to be realized in the
reflection and the echo of your own I amness that you can see catch a glimpse of the divine
oneness the divine I amness and so one of the key steps in the evolution of consciousness
in this 3000 year period was the emergence of monotheism in the Jewish tradition that
became Christianity that became Judaism as we understand it and in fact has been quite
a big influence upon religiosity spiritual traditions around the world as well.
So that's the kind of Christian bit why Barfield saw the position of Jesus and the emergence
of Christianity is a kind of pivotal point he talks about being a kind of turning of
the tide where this oneness gathered to such a point that individuals could start to realize
that first of all a person who had lived who transmitted the divine and that could become
our calling to our most fully flourishing moment for us as human beings too would be
to know the divine oneness as well. Gary does that make sense to you in terms of your understanding?
Well I know that for Steiner Christ's incarnation and then what he calls the mystery of Golgotha
which was the crucifixion was sort of the center the most important event in human history
so far at least but I have to say my own approach to Barfield and to Steiner was to kind of
not necessarily Christ-free but it wasn't sort of the way I got into it and before I go on I just
want to say something that on a personal note I'm quite thrilled and honored to be here because
in a book I wrote called Secret History of Consciousness in which I talk about Barfield's
ideas in the context of other philosophers of consciousness one of the people I talk about
in there was PDU Spensky who in the 1930s and 40s held his talks and groups here you might have
noticed the blue plaque outside on the building so on a personal note I feel kind of chuffed
as they say to be in the same space that Spensky was in and he probably would have thought
but well I'm sure he didn't have much good to say about Steiner so I suspect he wouldn't have had
too much good to say about Barfield either but I mean the notion of a kind of group consciousness
or more I don't want to use the word racial but Steiner used that and Barfield used that as well
a kind of consciousness in which the individual was not as important or didn't play as important a
role this is something that I could see happening in the shift from this original participation
in which we're embedded we're embedded in nature then we're embedded in the world where we don't
have the sense of separation from it which we enjoy or languish in today depending on when
you're feeling it and this was something that I thought was very key because one of them
one of the issues with I mean we recognize that there's something wrong with human consciousness
there's something wrong with our consciousness that we're not particularly happy we have a vague
sense that things aren't quite right and it's got something to do with our being separated
from the rest of nature something to do with being separated from the rest of the world
and in a general broad sense in the alternative or mystical or spiritual community this is seen as
kind of a bad thing this is the fall you know we've fallen from this earlier state of unity
of connectedness of being part of the the great surround and it's sort of a negative thing that
we found ourselves here kind of alienated and but barfield and steiner and other people that I
wrote about in my book the with barfield people like the german swiss philosopher gene gebser
or the maverick french alchemist and egyptologist r. r. e. shwala dilubic the british writer
collin wilson uh yes this this sense of uh what do we saw kind of separateness or detachment or
alienation it's um kind of a period of growth let's say it's sort of something we have to get
through to be able to get to a barfield called final participation which would be something
he talks about it in the context of reading poetry this is how it kind of came to him
um he talks about how the same sort of shift in consciousness that he experienced in reading
poetry and the poetry that he's talking about are the romantic poets people like keats and
shelly and blake and wordsworth uh who are the lyrical poets they are what they're talking about
is the soul they're talking about the inner world uh and this had got lost in the modern in the modern
age the kind of sudden shift or break or change in consciousness that he experienced in his reading
these poets he got from reading ancient language as well and the difference there was where the
poets are sort of going out of their way they're trying to make this effect they're using language
in order to create this effect to kind of break the barrier between inner and outer and when you
have that poetic moment um it's it's a mini mystical experience you the separation between you and the
outer world ego and the non-ego is dissolved briefly and you as blake said you can see heaven
in a wild flower or you know the world in a grain of sand and things of that sort and it's something
that we experience from our children and and we grow out of necessarily so i would say in order
to deal with the world because the world is a difficult place uh if every time we everything
we saw was infinite we wouldn't get much done you know we'd be kind of stuck uh uh uh you know just
sort of uh just completely gobsmacked by you know the mystery of existence itself so seem to be a
necessary evolutionary change in order to take ourselves out of that but we you know with the
apron strings cut we found ourselves adrift in the cosmos i mean the american novelist walk with
persie had a book called lost in the cosmos and it's uh it's i think it's a good kind of summing
up of where we find ourselves but this is a it's not we talk about evolution of consciousness we
we've arrived at this place we have come to this place through a process the consciousness we feel
today is not consciousness per se and what barfield discovered in poetry but also ancient language
was a kind of consciousness that seemed to not experience this detachment not experience the
separation from inner and outer it was the language suggested that that wasn't the case
and this suggested to him that at an earlier time the kind of participatory consciousness
in the sense that inner and outer uh are not separate but there's a continuum that the poets and
you know mystics talk about and which today you know we can we can experience if we ingest
certain substances or meditate or something like that this was something that was common let us say
it's radically new for us but it was common back in an earlier time but they didn't possess the
individual ego consciousness that we have now so it's like okay you can have the separate ego
consciousness where you feel free and you're able to make decisions but you're completely detached
from the rest of the the cosmos in your lost in the world or you can be embedded in consciousness
uh in in the world and feel that closeness and that connection but you don't have the individual
sense of self and you can make your own decisions and um you know you have free will so neither of
those seem to be a good answer but what barfield discovered through his uh reading of poetry was
