that there seemed to be times when you have both at the same time and this out of this he developed
his notions of polarity and things of that sort so um i would say that i mean i know both in barfield
and steiner the sort of christ event is the christ incarnation and crucifixion is sort of the
he talks about kind of a v shape movement and you know we start up up here metaphorically
closer to the cosmos closer to this you know the spiritual world and the divine and all that
gradually through a process of crystallization or hardening we lose that connection but we're
gaining the individual ego but not at the bottom of the v that's like the worst you know that's at
the dark night of the soul as it were but then with um pristina and for barfield christ's
incarnation crucifixion is the beginning of the upward movement back back towards the spiritual
realms but with retaining our our ego consciousness and this would be something that i i would say
most spiritual practices aim at in some way although there are some schools that say no we
just got to get rid of the ego completely and plunge back into the one but i i i don't think
it's understandable that some schools would uh uh think in that way but i don't think that's the
way that barfield thought we should go or steiner or any of the to me the really important spiritual
thinkers yeah i mean that's a very helpful point i think because it's one of the reasons why
barfield very much started making sense to me is that you can read older spiritual texts where the
return to the oneness and with a kind of dissolution of self um seems to be the goal maybe a deep
dreamless sleep these kind of metaphors are used um but i think that with this evolution idea you
get a sense of um how the alienation of today which you described there itself has meaning and is
part of this process because what we're invited into uh in the future is a freedom where both we
have our sense of being uh individuals but as it were our microcosm reflects the macrocosm once
more the many return to the one but without losing the individuality of the many um this is both as
it were um the task and the mystery um which you see echoes um across very many traditions
now um you mentioned coleridge there and um maybe just to add a little bit about the imagination
which you have written about and i have as well um because it feels to me this is one of the key
faculties that we have now um imagination itself is a word that has a history and it did not mean
the same thing that it means in the modern world as it did say if you read imagination and epicurus
um now what it means is that we are if you like kind of fantasy generating individuals
people um we're constantly um rather than as a we're receiving receiving the stream of insights
and impressions and presences from the outside we experience them now as emerging from within us
and what people like barfield drawing a lot on coleridge actually in the romantic tradition
realized is that a lot of these fantasies that come from within us um are maybe fun but they're
a bit chaotic and they don't really add up to much they don't really take us anywhere but every so
often one of these fantasies really lives and if we can stay with it if we can sort of follow its
energy and its spirit without trying to reduce it too much too quickly it takes us into a whole
new world um this is what barfield discovered when he read poetry um it's what coleridge
referred to when he said that our imagination proper um this creative part of ourselves this
expansive part of ourselves that lives and grows is but an echo of the divine imagination
which runs through all of creation and with people like william blake as well he felt that is what
creativity is in fact it's kind of like the divine imagination um emanating and exploring
extending the world we too are called to be part of that and so in terms of spiritual practice
one of the things which i feel say psychotherapy which is one of my own practices i work as a
psychotherapist um can get onto is how our fantasies aren't just illuminating about our inner lives
in dreams say in synchronicities um in maybe even um unusual experiences um but when we can
stay with them we realize that their but echoes of the inner life of the whole world um as barfield
put it rather beautifully um and so our imagination is one of our key kind of faculties that we need
to learn it's not just as we're adding color to the world um which i think is how c.s lewis
rather sold it we hadn't quite um mentioned uh inklings yet but another really important part
of barfield's life was his relationship with both c.s lewis and jr are talking both lewis and talking
broadly said that barfield had the best ideas they had the genius ability with writing and so
are now wildly and well known throughout the world um but um but barfield was really key that this
imaginative writing that they were so good at wasn't just um allegorizing meaning wasn't just as it were
maybe amplifying what rational thought can pin down but was itself part of the experience part
of the knowledge and in particular was the way that we grow into this return to what was called
original participation but he referred to as final participation um by final he didn't mean the end
point what he meant was it's the teleological um points to which we're moving the kind of um
the the heuristic goal as it were to know both ourselves ritually and fully um as individual
souls but realizing that our our egos had become in the service you might say of the wider self
as jung called it um or as the divine i am um as would maybe be more of the judo christian way of
putting it um so um the imagination is so key here and i think you know in science we're going to
develop this i hope after the break and with the scientists on our panels um but it's in that
romantic tradition of science which realizes that the intuitions that then get developed
um into the hard science come from an immersion in the world um be that by literally traveling the
world as figures like horn bolt realized when they developed the notion of ecology um or by
imaginative um thought exercises as einstein realized when he realized when he thought about
traveling on a light beam um that led to the science of relativity um personal development
it's about i think not this um how do i sort of get over my ego but in a way how do i go into the
ego more and more and more to discern how it can open up into the service of the wider whole so
that i don't know a realignment takes place within myself um i think you know spiritual
experience is often about that now sometimes it happens rather dramatically and then people
work out what that realignment might be um and call it waking up or enlightenment um sometimes
it's a steady slow process as was the case much more in my own experience through um the bitter
years the hard struggle years of psychoanalysis um in the more Jungian tradition um what it means
for our society is very very pressing now of course with the ecological crisis and broadly
speaking i think it's going to mean something like realigning our sense of growth so that's not
just about material growth which is the accumulation you might say of more and more and more and the
development of technology um which has its own blessing its own great benefits um but it's going
to be realizing there's another kind of growth that that material and technological growth itself
can be in the service of which is about rediscovering the depths of reality about awakening ourselves
even to not just forces in nature you might say but the spiritual reality of nature wants
more the inside of the whole world and the intelligence within which our own intelligence
rests and can capture an echo um so that's something a bit about um you know what this move
from the now the meaning of the now um towards something different might be about again any
further thoughts yeah well i mean um imagination was key for barfield and colleridge and blake and
you know many others as well and one of the things that i uh do in in we're written about barfield
is that i said i lined him up with some other thinkers and there's something that they share
in the sense that we think of imagination as um fantasy and coming up with a substitute for
reality or in a utilitarian sense being on the cutting edge being you know innovative and you
know getting ahead of your competitors in in the market and things of that sort and of course we
still have a place for it in the arts and all that sort of thing but um as mark said i mean for
barfield and for the other people we're talking about imagination is key it's it's it's central we
wouldn't be seeing this room we're in now uh were it not for imagination not in the sense that we're
making it unreal but it's a formative power it it it informs what we're seeing if we were just
left to just the sensory perceptions of things out here in the room it wouldn't make any sense we
we wouldn't know what any of the things were they wouldn't be things they would be sense data in this
kind of you know uh very fundamental sense they become things in the sense that our imaginative
power which is a creative power forms them turns them into um recognizable shapes and forms and
objects that actually again we just look at it blankly it's it's not even a chair it's a chair
because you bring your imagination to it you know what a chair is it's your idea of what a chair and
it's a chair because it it shares many other uh shares all the qualities that chairs have and
other chairs have them as well and things of that sort but the other aspect um i'm saying there's two
two things i would say about imagination is that it's basically a way of getting to the inside of
things our rational ego consciousness deals with the outside of things and again rightly so the world
is a difficult dangerous place um you only need to know we reduce our experience to just enough to
be able to deal with it i mean um i talk about the distinction very simple you know a thumbnail way
of looking at it between sort of survival consciousness and appreciative consciousness
so there's a survival consciousness when you're walking down the street and you see this large
body hurtling towards you down the road you don't need to know the make and model or the color
of the car you just need to know to get out of the way of it just as if you're in the jungle and
there's a large uh being over there some shape moving towards you and it's making a loud noise you
don't you don't have time to marvel at the you know the stripes on the tiger and things of that
sort you just need to get out of its way once you've got out of its way and you're safe and all
that then you can turn around and say oh what a lovely you know oh that's a mercedes 1966 or whatever
it is something like that you can take in all the irrelevant information from a purely practical
utilitarian survival aspect we need both i mean someone who's brought this up and uh rebooted
a great many of these questions in a scientific context is uh ema gilchrist i don't know if you
know his book master and his emissary where he reboots the whole left brain right brain story
which had got kind of sidelined for quite some time and i talk about McGilchrist's work in the
context with barfield because barfield is talking about participation that's very much it seems to
me along the lines of what McGilchrist is saying how the right brain engages with the world and the
difference he makes is that what he and other neuroscientists discovered it isn't so much what
each brain does they seem to be doing the same sorts of things but it's how they do them and the
left brain is very precise it's very good at narrowing down to detail and it gets you know
finer and finer sharper and sharper sharper more precise detail at the expense of the connection
to the larger whole the right brain presents a global total picture but it's fuzzy it's not as
detailed uh the right brain sees the forest the left brain sees the trees it sees the individual
leaf on the tree it sees the individual veins in the leaf it sees the individual cells making
up the veins in the leaf you know finer and finer and finer in detail we need this it's absolutely
necessary but we gain that at the loss of the connection much like the ego you know we become
more and more conscious of ourselves as separate individual egos but we lose the sense of connectedness
we gain the connect sense of connectedness at the expense of having that kind of sense of ego but
imagination of barfield is a way of seeing into the inside of things and this is something that
the french philosopher arnie berkson talked about in the late 19th early 20th century is intuition
i mentioned shwala dilubic he's he's the fellow who's first said that the sphinx was much older
than the official account because the erosion marks on it are from water not from sand and wind
so it must have been there quite some time ago when there was a lot of rain
in egypt which hasn't been the case for for for some time but he talked about something called
the intelligence of the heart and this is something that he believed the ancient egyptians
knew and understood and their whole religious pantheon is based on this and again it was a way
being able to understand the inside of something and someone who took this idea very seriously
and was a major influence on rudolf steiner was the german poet scientist novelist statesman
gerter gerter developed a whole scientific approach using the imagination he wrote a book
the metamorphosis of plants where he devoted this kind of loving attentiveness to the study of plants
and he he claimed that he was able to perceive something that he called earth lanza which is
the primal plant it's a kind of arctipple plant that isn't it's not sensory you can't see it
with the senses and it's not just a concept it inhabits this intermediate intermediary realm
that the french phenomenologist and student of persian mysticism on recorbin would later call
the imaginal it's it's not the imaginary which is the fantasy which is the substitute for reality
but the imaginal is a realm in between the physical and the purely conceptual it's a realm of images
it's that's the realm of poetry that's the realm of the imagination mark was talking about these
fantasies that come up in our consciousness at times and these are images young would say
they're emerging from well your personal unconscious but also your collective unconscious
and they tell us something about the world they have a real cognitive content and this is relates
to the other thing i wanted to say about imagination whereas as if it is the case that for the last
300 400 years we've sidelined the imagination in favor of this more precise rational logical
scientific you know material you know however you want to characterize it way of dealing with the
world it isn't the the the answer to that or the what should we say you know what what we need to do
to correct that imbalance isn't just to plunge into the imagination itself i mean barfield was
very concerned about that i mean in a book of his called saving the appearances that came out in
the late fifties because he because because barfield believed there was a real relationship between
what goes on here and what happens outside i mean one of the strangest things steiner ever said that
the way the world will appear in the future depends on what people are thinking now which suggests
that the way the world appears now is a result of the how people thought sometime before us
and this this is goes completely against you know our modern rational thinking because this this is
this you know this is just like there's a little blob of consciousness in my head in your head in
your head it doesn't get outside of of our skull but what barfield and steiner and these others say
is like unlike vegas what happens in the mind doesn't stay there it actually goes out into the world
and it affects the world in some way and this is you know we talk about this in a pop kind of
um trivial way about create your own reality and things of that sort which is based on something
true but i think a lot of it's used today is rather shallow and uh it's a kind of trivial way but
it's based on a fundamental true idea this our inner world is intimately connected with this
outer world out there we've lost the sense of that in these moments of participation through you
know meditation or poetry or anything that does it we have a brief feeling of there's a
continuum between the two and the next step is to realize oh well what happens here takes precedent
what happens here after some time will affect the world in the out there so it's very important
what we imagine it isn't just plunging into any kind of you know imagination let's go let
you know just let the imagination go and let it rip and it'll be better and this was sort of
some of the romantics believe that at different times in history um a book i wrote about the 1960s
it was something like that too the sort of 60s counterculture uh sort of the rejection of the
scientific materialist reductive world they said but let's let the imagination rip let the unconscious
rip let it just go and barfield was concerned that um at the time the sort of art that he was aware
of was being produced uh suggested that the imagination was delving into some rather dark
kinds of places he was concerned about surrealism and things of that sort and i would think today
i mean you might read what he says and think oh my god he was hysterical he was an alarmist
and all that but i don't know if you look around at the art i see these days i don't say it's got
much better uh than when it was when um barfield was writing he was concerned so it's very important
what we actually imagine it's not it's not any old imagination will do and this is a distinction
courage makes as well it's really important the difference between what he calls true imagination
and and fancy or fantasy and a simple distinction is with fancy or fantasy you take things that
are already made and you put them together in strange ways so you put some wings on pigs
you have flying pigs you don't see them they're a product of imagination but they're not truly
original or truly creative because you're taking stuff that's already been made and just putting
it together in a strange combination whereas for courage for Blake and the others the product of
true imagination it may not seem original or novel in the kind of sense that we want to see
things novel but it's it's truly original because it goes back to the origin it it it's an echo and
uh a product of the origin which is this true imagination which for Blake for Coleridge for
barfield um so many of the others we're talking about here is at the root of the the phenomenal
world i mean you have to turn it around completely i mean we tend to think in the modern world
imagination is just something that we kind of tack on to make life a little bit you know
better to make it a little more bearable whereas they're saying no it's at the it's at the fundamental
