1. **Barfield's Perspective**: Owen Barfield offers a unique perspective that integrates history, language, and consciousness into a narrative of human development. His ideas are particularly relevant for understanding the human condition in relation to broader cosmic consciousness.

2. **Participative Narrative**: Barfield suggests that humans participate in a story that is much larger than themselves. This narrative involves an evolutionary journey where humanity returns to a oneness with the divine, or what he refers to as "the one."

3. **Ontological Commitment**: Barfield posits that consciousness is fundamental and that our individual consciousness is a reflection of a wider, ontologically prior conscious reality. We are, in a sense, mirrors of this greater consciousness.

4. **Engaging with the Narrative**: By understanding Barfield's narrative, we can engage with life as whole people, integrating our will, desires, and knowledge. This holistic approach allows us to address contemporary issues with a sense of purpose, passion, and informed understanding.

5. **Language and Words**: Barfield emphasizes the importance of language in conveying soulfulness and the depth of human experience. Words not only express meaning but also resonate with layers of consciousness from different times.

6. **Creative Potential**: Older forms of consciousness contained within words offer creative potential for us to rediscover and engage with, enriching our own understanding and connection with the world.

7. **Learning from Reality**: When we study reality, we constrain ourselves in a way that allows it to speak back to us. This is akin to an instrument like the Aeolian harp, which responds to the wind, or a camera capturing a moment in time.

8. **Upcoming Work**: The speaker is working on a book set to be released in August 2019 that aims to explore Barfield's ideas through the lens of Christian consciousness, particularly within the Western context.

In essence, the speaker is inviting us to consider a more holistic and historically informed approach to understanding human consciousness and our place in the universe, one that draws from Barfield's insights into language and narrative as keys to unlocking a deeper sense of connection with all of reality.

1. **Imagination and Originality**: The session emphasized the importance of true imagination, which is at the foundation of all things, according to thinkers like Coleridge, Barfield, and others. This form of imagination is not just a creative addition to life but the very source from which reality springs forth.

2. **Courage for Blake**: The session highlighted the courage demonstrated by poets like Blake in expressing their visions, which were rooted in deep imagination rather than combining existing ideas.

3. **Imagination and Redemption**: The power of imagination was described as not only personal redemption but also the redemption of the world. It's about how we perceive and envision the world, which can lead to tangible changes in our environment and ecology.

4. **Struggle and Bewilderment**: The process of engaging with these ideas involves struggle and bewilderment, which is a crucial part of the journey towards a spiritual imagination. This struggle is not something to be feared but embraced as it is through this process that growth and new insights can emerge.

5. **Resources for Exploration**: Resources such as a glossary of terms provided in the program were offered to help participants navigate these complex ideas. Additionally, participants were encouraged to engage with each other during breaks and discussions to foster mutual understanding and growth.

6. **Panel Discussion**: The second part of the day would involve a panel of four individuals with different perspectives on these concepts. This diversity in viewpoints is crucial for achieving a 'transcendent function,' where new ideas and syntheses can emerge from the interaction of differing perspectives, much like Jung's concept of individuation.

7. **Emergence of New Insights**: The facilitator encouraged participants to be open to the possibility that their participation in the day's events might lead to unexpected insights or a new understanding that emerges from the collective interaction of diverse ideas and perspectives.

8. **Closing Note**: The session concluded with gratitude to Gary Lachman for setting the foundation for understanding the importance of imagination in our lives and for inspiring participants to consider how their own imaginations can contribute to the world's redemption and transformation. The facilitator expressed hope that participants would leave the session with their minds and imaginations stimulated and excited for further exploration.

1. **Final Participation in Meaning**: This is the process where we move beyond abstract moral codes to a living wisdom that adapts to the fluid nature of reality. It's about being present and engaged with the world, understanding that context matters and what is appropriate at one time may not be at another.

2. **The Move from Morality to Virtue**: This involves cultivating character and virtues that enable a deeper perception, moving from a rule-based ethical system to one that is more dynamic and responsive to the situation.

3. **Living Wisdom**: This is characterized by practical intelligence, an ability to navigate reality with both flexibility and discernment. It's about knowing when a rule applies and when it doesn't, providing the next stepping stone in life's journey and illuminating new pathways.

4. **Freedom**: This is the overcoming of fear, whether it's the fear of nihilism or the fear of losing peak experiences. It's about moving into a fearlessness that characterizes true freedom, where one is no longer bound by the fear of death or the cycle of seeking new experiences.

5. **The Cultivation of a Sharing Ego**: This involves shifting from possessiveness to a praise-centric approach to love and relationships, where the ego seeks to share rather than to dominate or control.

6. **Practical Playfulness with Reality**: This is the recognition that the old law-based approaches must give way to a practical intelligence that can play with the rules of reality, adapting as necessary to what life presents us with at any given moment.

7. **Overcoming Existential Fear**: This is about moving past the fear of nothingness or the abyss, as described by thinkers like Nietzsche, into a newfound joyfulness and freedom with life. It's a transition from dread to delight, from a focus on the void to an embrace of the fullness of existence.

In essence, these points describe a journey from the constraints of rigid moral codes to a state of authentic freedom and wisdom, where one can engage with the world in all its richness and complexity. This journey is central to the human experience and is key to resolving the meaning crisis that many feel today. John Vervaeke, in his series "Awakening from the Meaning Crisis," and others like Owen Barfield, contribute to this understanding by exploring how we can live more fully and meaningfully within the world.
