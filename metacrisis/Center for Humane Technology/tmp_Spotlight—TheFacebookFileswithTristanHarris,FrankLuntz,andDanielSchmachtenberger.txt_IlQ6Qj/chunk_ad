or become oppressive but we'd say civilizations typically teeter between the civilization is
how do we get a lot of people to participate in some way that creates order we can get the
order through imposition and it becomes increasingly oppressive or we fail to get the order and it
becomes chaotic and it fails on either side. The idea of democracy is that we can have emergent
order rather than imposed because we can all make sense of the world together and make sense of
each other's values and have some basis for shared choice making. This is ultimately cultural.
I promise to focus on kids and I've actually got a young person who's watching this right now
I'm going to read her question. I'm a senior in high school inspired after watching the social
dilemma and spending a year researching practical ways for young people to limit the use of social
media. I'm curious to know your view in the following how do the tactics to curb social media use
differ by age youth groups specifically pre-teens, teens, and college? What advice,
what guidance would you give her as she seeks to understand the difference between those three age
groups? Can you say the age groups again? Pre-teen, teen, and college? Pre-teen, teen, and college.
Pre-teen, teen, and college. I mean I will say that I'm actually I don't consider myself an expert on
the developmental psychology of children at these different ages. What I can speak of is
so long as the business model of TikTok and Snapchat and Instagram is I have to race down
your brainstem and create artificial social obligation and artificial social reciprocity
that you feel the pressure of getting likes if the other guy doesn't and you don't get it.
That thing is just not compatible with children's development. It turns kids into validation seeking
machines and it creates social pressure and anxiety that's simply not it's frankly it's not good for
any of those populations right it's not good I don't feel good how you know none of us feel good
when we feel like you know frankly I'm sure you get this all the time so if you get a comment on
Twitter you post to Twitter a lot I follow you and you get 100 comments on a post that you make
and 99 of the comments are negative are positive and one of the comments is negative where does
your attention go? Of course of course but you've got 99 to 1 positive but our brain is not neutral
our brains focus where on the negative and do you think you're alone in this experience
or do you think that everyone feels that and do you think that children's feel it more than you
or less than you more than you so we what we have is essentially a system that creates
overwhelming pressure and negativity and and the conditions for just not psychological health.
Daniel has this nice line about how what would be how do you measure the health of a society
and it's a hard thing to measure the social health of the society but you could measure it as the
inverse of the amount of addiction in society and then I don't know if you want to riff on that but
I don't have an answer to your I would like to answer her question go for it because the thing
Tristan is saying relates to the question someone asked about boycotts earlier when you have a
trillion dollar organization with two billion people's behavioral data run by ai's and then you
have a person just the little person the asymmetry of that info war because the person wants to control
their own thoughts and behavior but Facebook wants to control their thoughts and behavior
but it is a many orders of magnitude asymmetric info war to control their thoughts and behavior
that's such a problem that you can't just say well let's leave it up to the individual person
it's like saying let's leave up to individual people turning their lights off as the solution
to climate change and environmental destruction it's like no that just really doesn't work this needs
solutions that are at the scale of where they're coming from and switching the burden of responsibility
from the joggernauts to the individual is just like a bad move both ethically and from effectiveness
so that's what Tristan's trying to get to but we have this person here who's asking a question
about what she can actually do so I want to speak to it and by the way this has been this has been
Jordan's focus now since you all created you got people agitated you got people focused
now you got to start to deliver for them what would you say to her
I'm not going to make a distinction between the three age groups I'm going to say what's true in
general and then the developmental application of it is something that you should totally work on
people are more susceptible to addictive things what we'd call a hypernormal stimuli stimuli that
gives more dopamine or hit faster whether it is sugar or drugs or social media type stimulation
or porn they're more susceptible to that when they're in a hypo normal environment meaning
they're less fulfilled than an evolutionary environment in an evolutionary environment
humans evolved to be part of a tribe where you were having a lot of rich social interactions a
lot of embodied movements a lot of time in nature you know those types of things so
the lonelier people are the more susceptible they're going to be to Facebook and Instagram
the less creatively fulfilled they are if you can find groups of friends groups of people and
create richer possibilities of offline engagement it's the thing that'll help them the most if
they can have a place where there's drum circles every Friday night and everybody's dancing and
having drum circles if there's musical things where they're getting together and having kind of
jazz fun stuff if there's craft places if there's places where they get to have circling to do
meaningful like sharing about what's going on for them if people feel a richer fullness and other
opportunities they will be less susceptible to that then you can actually start to have not
only are there more fulfilling other opportunities but there's actually social connectivity and status
associated with something else you've got seven minutes to go and there are more people on this
now than there were after 10 minutes I've never had that happen in any of these Jared Carney asks
the primary issue for me is not manipulation although it's a big issue it's surveillance
if Facebook's business model is predicated on conflict plus knowing everything and trying
to steer commerce how do you counteract that
I mean this is really the topic of Shoshana Zuboff's book Surveillance Capitalism that
when you control this much of people's lives and you can let's say someone builds an alternative
social platform funded by venture capitalists there's got some investors I'm sure on this call
many people might be wondering well what if we funded some alternative social network that because
we want to do it in a way that doesn't capture people's data well that will be funded by venture
capital venture capital expects you know big multiples of returns there's actually no way
to exit that except by getting acquired by one of the existing big surveillance capitalism
companies whether it's Google or Facebook etc you'd have to do it in some way where it's an
independent thing something more like a Wikipedia or a blockchain type project where the data is
kept separate somehow but you're not going to be able to transition these existing platforms
Daniel do you want to jump in you could you need something that is like the equivalent of HIPAA
so which is the medical privacy regulations so if I have a medical file so that I go into a
ICU somewhere they can pull up what I'm allergic to and those types of things it's very sensitive
information about me everything that's in my life medical file that information could be sold
to drug companies it could be sold to lots of places it would be interested in doing
stuff with it it's really really important that that isn't sold so there is state-based
governance of that data and how that data can be shared and not shared if and so when you're
saying manipulation is second to surveillance the purpose of surveillance is manipulation right
it's the gathering of the data is to use the data for a purpose and whether it's to affect how you
vote or to affect your market behavior or to affect how you affect the cultural zeitgeist
that will affect market behavior and voting of others or to be able to arrest you for things
that we decide later or seditious or whatever it was ultimately it's the control of behavior that
we're gathering the data for and so how do we create safety of the data and this is where the
question has been do we trust Facebook with it no do we trust Washington with it no do we want
there to be a place where there is data so that we know that it's a person and not a bot
putting the information out yes so do we need to create a better checks and balances and oversight
process to ensure the trustworthiness yes do technologies like blockchain do part of the
thing where you can do provenance on data and see how it moves and have things where the data only
becomes released if certain flags happen otherwise it's in a decentralized rather than the centralized
database there's partial solutions there and we could work on full solutions but like with the
hippo kind of thing it's that data there's a hippocratic oath that is saying that data is being
gathered by the doctor who has serving your interests not the pharmaceutical or anybody
else's interests in mind and we can see it's not perfect if Facebook's business model shifted
where the user was the customer and either that and or as a state say got made into being a state
utility so the interest of the state which would mean that people didn't take views in such
antipathy to each other in the state that was basically like second-order treason and sedition
but where the interest of the integrity of the state and the interest of the well-being of its
citizens were actually what was directing its AI and its use of that data as opposed to advertisers
and there was the appropriate privacy and protections on it and I got to adjust the settings
and say I'm interested in learning these things I'm interested in being exposed to these other
kinds of ideas here's the ways here's what I want my time on site to do of all the information here's
what I wanted to curate for me now we have a situation where the the behavioral data that
happens by the fact that I click on stuff I can't have technology where I click on stuff and not
gather behavioral data but who is storing it for what purpose and how is it being stored becomes
really critical and it could be stored where the legal binding of it kept it from being used for
purposes other than the ones that I am actually consenting to. It's like personalized learning
Frank I mean think about things like Khan Academy where it's your yes or your personalizing information
you're gathering lots of information about where people look like they're getting stuck or what lessons
they might want to learn more of but the purpose of Khan Academy isn't to manipulate you into click
bait and to make you hate the other political party it's to help increase learning right so you
could have that's the kind of thing that we're talking about is personalized in the interest of
helping society get wiser and more thoughtful not the direction of whatever gets their attention.
This conversation doesn't happen there is no news program that has a conversation like this
like I'm embarrassed I have to keep saying to Daniel to simplify I shouldn't have to do that.
Just like we said just like we said that the fourth estate has broken obviously so has education
because the idea in the founding of this country following the Enlightenment and modernity was
that everyone could be educated well enough to understand the issues that law was going to be
created that would affect and bind their life if I'm going to be bound by law I need to understand
the issues well enough to get a say in that if the people are not educated well enough to have a
say in the law that's going to bind their life it's not a democracy it's just a story or a simulation
of it in which case monarchies might actually be better and not have all the attention go to
flipping back and forth every four years and internal divisiveness if we really want it to be a
democracy an effective fourth estate and education are prerequisites at the level that is needed for
people to understand the issues well enough to participate now we have to say using AI and
attention tech and all of the modern technologies could we make new better educational systems
and better participatory governance systems where everybody can't fit in the town hall but
everybody can give input that now these AIs can semantically parse and help create propositions
that are not vested interest group propositions but that are saying what would the best proposition
that fulfills the interests of everyone look like and now we get to work on proposition crafting
we could use these same technologies that are destroying open societies to build better ones
that though has to become the central imperative of the time and it does require a new cultural
enlightenment it does require an educational rise to understand the issues well enough or it just
doesn't matter it's over like if congress and the public don't understand the issues well enough
then of course the corporate interests are just going to run and authoritarian nation states
employing exponential tech see both facebook and google on one side and china on the other side
are deploying exponential tech towards purposes but neither of them are open societies if the
open societies are not also developing and deploying where the power is then they will just
lose and what we're saying is that the open societies have to develop and deploy the full
suite of modern technologies to create new digital era open societies that can protect
against catastrophe but also protect against dystopias and that is the central imperative
okay i got one last central imperative which is to keep people alive during this at the hopefully at
the uh back end of covid and i don't know of any example that frightens me more or angers me more
than the crap that's put out against the vaccines and i go absolutely crazy and i read it and i
shouldn't because it makes my head explode help me here what can we do we are coming down to the
end of the vaccine process and we are not going to hit herd immunity and the us is not even in the
top 15 of vaccines anymore because of the crap that's coming that's being generated in america uh
about uh from social media how do we combat it when it comes to health because tristan
your idea that they're going to be able to create these stories with these reports i've read them
i've seen them they look real and i know they're not how do we combat it right now because we
don't even have a year to wait on this we have to do this right now it's a big question
they'll you sure um uh we're not going to that's just that just loses um in the same way that we're
not going to prevent climate change from creating droughts and uh affecting areas of poverty that
will create massive human migration there are a lot of impending catastrophes that will just
happen and we'll just lose that we we could have done a better job with this pandemic at a million
points and so this is why we're thinking a little bit more long range about what are the
even worst catastrophic things that we possibly have time to address and why do we why are we
doing so badly at all of them and what would it take to do a better job at all of them because if
we can't coordinate for for climate change or overfishing or biodiversity things or nuclear
deep proliferation or stopping ai arms races or stopping crisper arms races or getting misinformation
right we just fail at everything so ultimately we have to get better global coordination capacity
for global level coordination challenges if we get that we get all the other things otherwise we
don't and so you're talking here about a shared sense making of what is true what is base reality
but in a world where there's a breakdown of trust and a breakdown of trust and what is
legitimate authority you will not get shared sense making so then you either do have to become
china and say i don't care if you don't believe it and if you think it's terrible we're going to
force it on you or you have to say well we're going to just fail or you have to say oh we actually
have to be able to recreate legitimate authority and not just people's falsely falsely belief in it
but a good basis for it how do we do that how do we recreate a shared sense of sense making but
also not just that the social contract and social solidarity that if someone thinks something different
than me and they're a fellow countryman i don't just instantly have antipathy for them i try to
steal man rather than straw man what might be true what values might they hold in their perspective
because if i just go to a culture war with my fellow countrymen and china doesn't have that problem
but we get to amplify our net antipathy towards each other using exponential information tech then
our country's just destroyed it's over open societies there has to be a process of how
do we do better sense making but also better understanding of the partial truths and the
values in each other's perspective so that we can find new attractors together okay daniel
daniel if you're right we're screwed yeah if your conclusions are right because we're not
going to be able to do the things to address the challenges challenges that you lay before us
it cannot it will not happen not so not in the time scale of the issue you're focused on
for this now we're screwed uh just on you're gonna have the last word you do not have to
make people feel good i want you to end in 45 seconds with what you want people to take away
from this conversation don't screw it up i was i was just going to say that i think people think
that trust can't be recovered from where we are and i feel just to say something very concrete
is that if people were to communicate and feel like they're in a way that they reflected why
people distrust the cdc of the david show talked about and if those institutions came out and said
yeah we did flip flop on this and this they people need to feel like they're being told the truth
with earnestness and sincerity and not gaslet and i think the problem in communication is when
you communicate to large audiences and you feel like people aren't going to get it you simplify
the message and you say something that's not completely true but you force it down people's
throats and those who know that that's happening get rebellious and we're not going to create a
unified understanding until we come with sincerity and i think trust is the sort of the fuel that
