undergirds all of this conversation and i feel like sincerity and earnestness is the is the vehicle
to reestablishing that trust um and i feel like that's what we're we're trying to do now and just
to name one thing is daniel and i are and and some others are are really looking to see in
washington dc especially in the national security community who resonates and understands with
what we've laid out and we're not trying to be pessimists we're just very we're trying to be
very clear about the space space of problems and what it will take to actually look ahead so we
don't just you know have another covid and we in climate change we get we we mess those up too
um we have a chance right now to to not mess up some of the future tech that's impending dooms
that's coming um and we're looking for help so if you're interested um you know hope we can all
connect through uh through frank and i really appreciate frank you giving the opportunity to
have this conversation i think happy to do more i know we we kept this to an hour but um uh i think
it's incredibly important each of the issues go very deep i mean the teenage mental health stuff
versus the polarization and uh how do we deal with the exponential tech issues
well i i this is incredible and as harry clark says go see ben sass i need to find a way to
have the two of you sit down with him and you don't have to simplify it daniel you can say it
exactly as you say it right now and he'll be he'll be with you every step of the way you guys are
brilliant you guys are the way it should be uh your parents i'm sure were are proud of you
you got a great education this was probably the most important session i've ever done
and i'm grateful for you all for not pulling any punches for not dumbing things down
and the next time i will go to sleep will probably be never after all the things that you just said
