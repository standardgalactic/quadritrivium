in just starting wanted to um you know work on building stuff in association with thinking
but uh this talk is very central this conversation you and i are having is very central to the aims
of the conciliants project which is we're wanting to inspire inform and help direct a innovation
zeitgeist where the many different problems of the world start to get seen in terms of having
interconnectivity and underlying drivers and that the forcing function of the power of exponential
tech is taken seriously that says in order to become good stewards of that requires
evolutions of both our social systems and our culture the wisdom to be able to guide that power
a recoupling right of wisdom and power in that adequate to what is needed so how do we innovate
in culture the development of people and how do we innovate in the social systems the advancement
of our coordination both employing the exponential tech and being able to rightly guide it and so
we have a really great team of people that are doing research and writing basically the
types of things we're talking about here in more depth explaining what is the role of
the various social systems like what is the role of education to any society help understand
fundamentally what that is understand why there is a particularly higher educational threshold
for open societies where people need to participate not just in the market but in governance
understand how that has been disrupted by the emerging tech and will be disrupted further by
things like technological automation and then envision what is the future of education adequate
to an open society in a world that has the technology that's emerging and we don't necessarily
know what the answer is but we know examples and we know criteria so then it's like innovate in
this area and make sure you factor these criteria and the same thing with the fourth estate the
same thing with law the same thing with economics and so the goal is not how do we take some small
group of people to build the future it's how do we help get what the criteria of a viable future
must be and if people disagree awesome publicly disagree and have the conversation now but if
we get to put out those design constraints someone says no we think it's other ones at least now
the center of culture starts to be thinking about the most pressing issues in fundamental ways and
how to think about them appropriately and how to approach them appropriately so fundamentally our
goal is supporting an increased cultural understanding of the nature of the problems that
we face a clearer understanding rather than just there's lots of problems and it's overwhelming
and it's a bummer and so either some very narrow action on some very narrow part of it makes sense
which is most of activism or just nihilism we want to be able to say actually because there are
underlying drivers there is actually a possibility to resolve these things it does require the fullness
of our capacity applied to it and with the fullness of our capacity so it's not a given but with the
fullness of our capacity applied to it there is actually a path forward and so we're writing these
papers that basically would be kind of like a a meta curriculum for people who want to be
engaged in designing the future and some of them have to do with current public culture and how to
be able to change patterns of public culture that leads to better conversation better sense making
better meaning making and choice making so that there's an on ramp into higher quality conversations
meaning higher quality process of conversation and then some of them are things like what are the
design criteria of the future social systems and how could how could we build those things then
not everybody will read those some people who have the ability to help start building them will
but we hope that other people will take that and translate it on podcasts and into animations and
in whatever other forms of media so that those topics start to become increasingly present in
people's awareness then of course the next part is what groups start emerging wanting to address
those and what can we do to help facilitate good solutions in those groups and this is where you
know you and I I've learned a lot from you about the the social media issues in particular and how
central they are to the breakdown of sense making because obviously without good shared sense making
there is no possibility for emergent order you either just get chaos or you have to have imposed
order if you want emergent order that means emergent good choice making that means emergent
good sense making and so you know we we've learned a lot and discussed these things for a long time
and obviously also not just you and I there's a whole network of people that we're connected to
that had been thinking deeply about these things that we continue to try to think about what adequate
solutions could look like and I think what CHT did with the social dilemma took one really critical
part of this meta crisis into popular attention maybe in a more powerful way than I have seen
done otherwise because as big a deal is getting climate change and public attention is it's not
clear that climate change is something that is making that is driving the underlying basis of
all the problems but a breakdown in sense making and the control of patterns of human behavior that
kind of downgrade people like oh wow that really does make all these other things worse so I see
that as a as a very powerful and personal on ramp for those who are interested to be able to come
into this deeper conversation and some some of them it'll simply help them be like okay
now I know what I was intuitively feeling somebody's put it into words and I at least
feel more oriented and that's the extent because they don't necessarily have the ability to build
new blockchain systems or whatever it is and they should be doing the nursing or education
or whatever really other important social value they're doing some people will be able to say
this actually really resonates I can translate this to other audiences
and get more people engaged and some people say I can actually start innovating and working with
this stuff and all of those are good yeah I I agree and I think what we've essentially been
outlining here and you sort of hit it at the end is going back to the the Charles Kettering quote
which I learned from you and I've learned so many things from you over the years
which is that a problem not fully understood is unsolvable and a problem that is fully
understood is half solved and I just want to maybe leave our listeners with that which is
I think people can look at the long litany of problems and feel overwhelmed or get to despair
and a hurry I think is your phrase for it and I think that when you understand the core generator
functions for what is driving so many of these problems to happen simultaneously there's a
different and more empowering relationship to that and you've actually offered a vision for how
technology can be consciously employed these new technologies can be consciously employed
in ways that should feel inspiring and exciting I mean I want that transparent blockchain on a
budget for every country in the world and we can see examples like Estonia and Taiwan moving in
this direction already and we can see Taiwan building some of the technologies you mentioned to
identify propositions of shared values between citizens who want to vote collectively on something
that previously would have driven up more polarization so we're seeing this this thing
emerging and I think what we need is to sort of have this be seen as a necessary upgrade to
let me do that again I think we need to see this as not just an upgrade but but the the kind of
cultural enlightenment that you speak of that so many different actors are in a sense already
working on you know we used to have this phrase that everyone is on the same team they just don't
know it yet and once you understand the I think degree to which we are in trouble if we do not
get our heads around this and and identify the kind of core generator functions that we need to
be addressing once we all see that I'll just speak to my own experience when I first encountered
your work and I encountered the kind of core drivers that that drive so much of the danger that
we are headed towards I immediately I was kind of already in this direction already but I reoriented
my whole life to say how do we be in service if this not happening and and of creating a better
world that actually meets and addresses these problems and I know so many other people whose
work and whose lives and whose daily missions and purpose have been redirected by I think hearing
some of the core frames that you offer and who I hope and who are you know many of whom are already
working on active projects to deal with this and those who are not are supporting in other ways
and I just hope that our audience takes this as an inspiration for how can we in the face of
stark and difficult realities as part of this process gain the kind of cultural
strength to to face these things head on and to orient our lives accordingly because I have
while you know bearing periods of time hit probably low you know low grade despair myself
I actually feel more inspired than ever the amount of things in the number of people who
are waking up to these challenges and I'll just say that that I think when you face these challenges
alone and you feel like you're the only one seeing them or you have a weird feeling in your stomach
it can feel debilitating and when you realize the number of people who are also putting their
heads up to say how can we change this that's what feels hopeful and that's where I derive
my optimism so Daniel thank you so much for for coming on it's an honor to have you your work has
touched the lives and work of so many people who may not always say so publicly but I know that you
had also a huge hand in inspiring some of the themes that emerge in the social dilemma which
has impacted so many people as well so thank you so much really wonderful that we get to have this
conversation thanks just on absolutely
you
