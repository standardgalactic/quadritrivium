anyone would say we have not been the best stewards of power and technology is increasing our power
exponential tech means tech that makes better versions of itself so you get an exponent on
the curve you get a and we're now in a process where that's a very very rapid computation
gives the ability to design better systems of computation and computation in ai applied to
biological big data and protein folding gives the ability to do that on biotech and on and on right
so we could say the central question of our time is if we've been poor stewards of power for a long
time and that's always caused problems but the problems now become existential they become
catastrophic we can't keep doing that how do we become adequately good stewards of exponential
power in time right how how do we develop the good decision-making processes the wisdom necessary
to be able to be stewards of that much power I think that's a fair way to talk about the central
thing now if it's okay the thread we were about to get to I think is a good one which was the
history of catastrophic risk coming up to now is that before world war two catastrophic risk was
actually a real part of people's experience it was just always local but an individual kingdom
might face existential risk in a war where they would lose and so the people faced those kinds
of reality and in fact one thing that we can see when you read books like the collapse of
complex societies by Joseph Tainter and just any study of history is that all the great
civilizations don't still exist which means that one of the first things we can say about
civilizations is that they die they have a they have a finite lifespan on them one of the interesting
things we can find is that they usually die from self-induced causes they either over consume the
resources and then stop being able to meet the needs of the people through unremovable
environmental dynamics and that's old or they have increasing border conflicts that lead to enmity
that has more you know arms race activity coming back at them or they have increasing
institutional decay of their internal coordination processes that leads to inability to operate
quickly in those types of things so we can say that it's the fundamentally most all civilizations
collapse in a way that is based on generally self-terminating dynamics and we see that even
when they were overtaken by armies oftentimes they were armies that were smaller than ones they had
defended against successfully at earlier peaks in their adaptive capacity okay so catastrophic risk
has been a real thing it's just been local and it wasn't till world war two that we had enough
technological power that catastrophic risk became a global possibility for the first time ever
and this is a really important thing to get because the world before world war two in the
world after was different and kind so fundamentally and this is why when you study history so much
of what you're studying is history of warfare of neighboring kingdoms and neighboring empires fighting
and uh because the wars were fundamentally winnable at least for some right they weren't
winnable for all the people who died but at least for some and with world war two and the development
of the bomb became the beginning of wars that were no longer winnable and the that if we employed
our full tech and continued the arms race even beyond the existing tech it's a war that where
win lose becomes omni lose lose at that particular level of power and so that created the need to
do something that humanity had never done which was that the major superpowers didn't war the whole
history of the world they the history of the thing we call civilization they always did and so
we made an entire world system a globalized world system that was with the aim of preventing world
war three so we could have non-kinetic wars and we did right the increasingly you can see from
world war two to now a movement to unconventional warfare narrative and information warfare economic
diplomatic warfare those types of things resource warfare and you could if you were going to have
a physical kinetic where it had to be a proxy war but to have a proxy war that also required
narrative warfare to be able to create a justification for it but also to be able to prevent the war so
so the post-world war two Bretton Woods mutually assured destruction united nations world was a
solution to be able to steward that level of tech without destroying ourselves and it really was a
reorganization of the world it was a whole new advent of social technologies or social systems
just like the US was new social technologies or social systems coming out of the industrial revolution
the industrial revolution ended up giving rise to kind of nation-state democracies the nuclear
revolution in this way kind of gave rise to this ideal intergovernmental world and it was predicated
on a few things mutually assured destruction was critical globalization and economic trade was
critical that we if the computer that we're talking on and the phone that we talk on is made
over six continents and no countries can make them on our own we don't want to blow them up and
ruin their infrastructure because we depend upon it so let's create radical economic interdependence
so we have more economic incentive to cooperate makes sense and let's grow the materials economy
so fast through this globalization that the world gets to be very positive GDP and gets to be very
positive some so that everybody can have more without having to take each other stuff that was
kind of like the basis of that whole world system and we can see that we've had wars but they've
been proxy wars they and cold wars they haven't been major superpower wars and they've been
unconventional ones but we haven't had a kinetic world war three we have had increase of prosperity
of certain kinds 75 years give or take now we're at a point where that radically positive some
economy that required an exponential growth of not of the economy which means of the
materials economy and it's a linear materials economy that unrenewably takes resources from
the earth faster than they can reproduce themselves and turns them into waste faster than they can
process themselves has led to the planetary boundaries issue where it's not just climate
change or overfishing or dead zones in the ocean or microplastics or species extinction
or peak phosphorus it's a hundred things right like there's all these planetary boundaries so we
can't keep doing exponential linear materials economy like that that thing has come to an end
because now that drives its own set of catastrophic risks we see that the radical interconnection
of the world was good in terms of will not bomb each other but it also created very high fragility
because what it meant is a failure anywhere could cascade to failures everywhere because of that
much dependence so we can see with the easy example yeah we had what was a local issue
to an area of china but because of how interconnected the world is with travel it became a global
issue at the pandemic level and it also became an issue where to shut down the the transmission
of virus we shut down travel which also meant shut down supply chains which meant so many things
right and very fundamental things that weren't obvious to people at first like
that country's agriculture depends upon the shipment of pesticides that they don't have
stored and so we got these swarms of locusts because of not having the pesticides which damaged
the food supply and shipments of fertilizer and shipments of seed so we end up seeing a drive
of the food insecurity of extreme poverty at a scale of death threat that is larger than the
covid death threat was as a second order effect of our problem we were trying to solve the problem
of don't spread covid and the solution had these massive second third order effects that are still
playing out right and that was a relatively benign pandemic a relatively benign catastrophe compared
to a lot of scenarios we can model out so we can say okay well we like the benefit of interconnectivity
so we're not invested in bombing each other but we need more anti fragility in the system
and then the mutually assured destruction thing doesn't work anymore because we don't have two
countries with one catastrophe weapon that's really really hard to make and easy to monitor
because it's there's not that many places that have uranium it's hard to enrich it you can monitor
by satellites we have lots of countries with nukes but we also have lots of new catastrophe
weapons that are not hard to make that are not easy to monitor that don't even take nation states
to make them so if you have many many actors of different kinds with many different types of
catastrophe weapons how do you do mutually assured destruction it's you can't do it the same way
and so what we find is that the set of solutions post world war two that kept us from blowing
ourselves up with our new power lasted for a while but those those set of solutions have ended
and they have now created their own set of new problems so there's kind of the catastrophic risk
world before world war two the catastrophic risk world from world war two till now
and then the new thing so the new thing says we have to have solutions that deal with the
planetary boundary issues that deal with global fragility issues and that deal with the exponential
tech issues both in terms of the way exponential tech can be intentionally used to cause harm i.e
exponential tech empowered warfare and unintentionally i.e exponential tech empowered externalities
and even just totally unanticipated types of mistakes the facebook google type problem
multiplied by agi and things like that and so when we talk about what the catastrophic risk
landscape is like that's the landscape the metacrisis is how do we solve all of that and
recognizing that our problem solving mechanisms haven't even been able to solve the problems
we've had for the last many years let alone prevent these things and so the central orienting
question it's like the un s 17 sustainable development goals there's really one that
must supersede them all which is develop the capacity for global coordination that can solve
global problems if you get that one you get all the other ones if you don't get that one you don't
get any of the other ones and so we can talk about how do we do that but that becomes the
central imperative for the world at this time so you're saying a whole whole bunch of things and
one thing that comes to mind here if i'm just reading back some of the things you've shared
the development of the let's call one of the first exponential technologies which is the nuclear bomb
led to a new social system which was sort of the post breton woods world of trying to stabilize
that one exponential technology in the world in a way that would not be catastrophic and even there
we weren't able to sort of make it all work and i think people should have maybe a list of some of
the other exponential technologies because i want to make sure that phrase is defined for listeners
and there's a lot of different ways that we've now not just created more exponential technologies
but more decentralized exponential technologies and i think people should see facebook and google
as exponential attention mapping or information driving technologies that are shaping the global
information flows or the wiring diagram of the sort of global societal brain at scales that are
exponential it's sort of a nuclear nuclear scale you know rewiring of the human civilization we
couldn't do that with newspapers we couldn't do that with the printing press not at the scale
speed etc that we have now so do you want to give maybe some more examples of exponential technologies
because i think that's going to lead to we're going to need a new kinds of social systems to
manage this different landscape of not just one exponential nuclear bomb but a landscape yeah
indulge me as i tell a story first that leads into it because it'll be a relevant framework
obviously the bomb was central to world war two and the world system that came afterwards and what
motivated our activity getting into it but it was not the only tech it was one new technology
that was part of a suite of new technologies that could all be developed because of kind of the
level science had gotten to and basically like physics and chemistry had gotten to the point
that we could work on a nuclear bomb we could start to work on computation we could get things
like the v2 rocket and rockets and a whole host of applied chemistry and one way of thinking about
what world war two was it's not the only way of thinking about it but it's useful frame and i think
it's a fair frame is that there were a few competing social ideologies at the time primarily kind of
uh german fascism fascism socialism whatever you want to call it uh soviet communism and
western liberalism something like that um and that this new suite of technologies whoever kind
of developed it and was able to implement it at scale first would win uh that social ideology
would win because it's just so much more powerful if you have nukes and they have guns you're going
to win right and uh germans were actually ahead of both the us and the soviets because of some
things that they did to invest in education um and and tech development and but that led both
the soviets and the us to really working to catch up as fast as they can and uh when the us finally
figured it out which we were actually a little bit slow to right einstein actually wrote a letter
the einstein solar letter that went to the us government saying now the science really does
say that this thing could happen and the germans could get it and you should focus on it and at
first they didn't take them up on it wasn't till the private sector actually uh non-profit supported
advanced it further that then the manhattan project uh was engaged in but then it was engaged in when
they recognized the seriousness that there was an actual eminent existential risk to the nation and
and the whole western ideology and whatever then it was an unlimited budget right it was a let's
find all the smartest people in the world and let's bring them here and let's organize however
we need to to make this thing happen and let's do it for all of the new areas of tech we're going
to get the enigma machine and crack the enigma code we're going to get a v2 rocket we're going to
figure out how to reverse engineer that and advance rocketry we're going to do everything needed to
make a nuclear bomb and then more advanced ones it was the biggest jump in technology ever in the
history of the world in recorded history as we know it and it wasn't actually done by the market
right it was done by the state that's a very important thing this idea that
markets innovate and states don't innovate is just historically not true here though
these this was state funds and state controlled operation in the same way that the
apollo project coming out of it was and a technological jump of that kind
hasn't happened since so it's an important important thing to understand but um
um we can say though this is not a totally fair thing to say we can say that the us came out dominant
in that technological race the us and the ussr both had a lot of capacity so that was the cold war
and then finally the us came out and so the world post-world war two system was a us led system
right the breton the un was in the us the breton wood system was pegged to the us dollar um
um what i would say is that so it wasn't one type of tech it was the recognition that science had
got to a place where there's going to be a whole suite of new tech and the new tech meant more
power and whoever had the power would determine the next phase of the world and if we didn't
like the social ideologies that we're going to be guiding it of course we can also think of it as
who wanted to win at the game of power but from the the philosophical argument if we didn't
like the social ideologies then we had to have another social ideology get it what i would say
is that there is an emerging suite of technologies now that is
much more powerful in the total level of jump technological jump than the world war two suite
was in fact orders of magnitude more and only those who are developing and employing exponential
tech will have much of a say in the direction of the future because just from a real politic
point of view that's where the power is and if you don't have the power you won't be able to oppose it
and so what do we mean by exponential tech there's a couple different ways of thinking about it
just exponentially more powerful is a very simplistic way and in that definition nuclear
is exponential tech but what we typically mean with exponential tech is tech that makes
it possible to make better versions of itself so that there is like a compounding interest
kind of curve the the tech makes it easier to make a better version which makes it easier to
make a better version and so we see that starting with computation really in a fundamental way
because computation allows us to advance models of computation how do we make better computational
substrates how do we get more transistors in a chip how do we make better arrangements of
chip so we get GPUs and those types of things and so in this new suite of technology the center of
it is computation the very very center of that is AI is kind of a self-learning computation
on large fields of data the other kind of software advances like advances in various
meaningful advances in cryptography and big data and the ability to get data from sensors and
you know sensor processing image recognition all like that is a part of that central suite
and the application of that to the directing of attention and the directing of behavior by
directing attention which you focused on very centrally then the next phase is the application
of the tech the application of computation to increasing computational substrate so this
is now the software advancing the hardware that can advance the total level of software and you
see the recursion so that's not just continuously better chips it's also quantum computing photo
computing dna computing those other types of things and the other types of hardware that need
to be part of that thing ie sensor tech in particular so that you can keep getting more
data going into that system that can do big data machine learning on it then it's the application
of that computation in and AI specifically to physical tech so to nanotech material sciences
biotech and even things like modeling how to do better nuclear and you know robotics and automation
and so when you start thinking about better computational substrates running better software
with more total data going in with better sensors in better robots you start getting the sense of
