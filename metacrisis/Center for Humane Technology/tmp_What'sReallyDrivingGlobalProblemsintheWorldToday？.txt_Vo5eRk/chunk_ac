what that whole suite of things looks like um so that's that's the suite of things that I would
say is what we would kind of call exponential tech and the the the reason why the term exponential
is important is we we don't think exponentially well our intuitions are bad for it because we
think about how much progress was made over the last five years we imagine there will be a similar
amount over the next five years and that's not the way exponential curves work right and so it's
very hard for us our intuition was calibrated on the past and it's going to be miscalibrated
for forecasting the total rate of change and the magnitude of change
so to link this for one much more narrow aspect for our listeners who are familiar with social
media and the social dilemma and you're talking about sort of self-compounding systems that improve
recursively like that um if i'm tiktok or if i'm facebook and i have i use data to figure out what's
the thing to show you and that's going to keep you here for longest since going to bypass your
prefrontal cortex and go straight to your limbic system your lizard brain um well the better it gets
at doing that and succeeding at that the more data it has to make a better prediction the next time
but then a new user comes along who it's never seen before but hey they're clicking on exactly the
same pattern of anorexia videos that we've seen these other two million users have that turn out
to be teenage girls and it just happens to know that this other set of videos that are more anorexia
videos are also going to work really really well so there's sort of a self-compounding loop that's
learning not just from one person and getting a better sort of version of hijacking your nervous
system but learning across individuals and so now you get a new person coming in from some
developing countries never used tiktok before and they're just like barely walking in for the front
door the very first time you know it's sort of like when coca-cola goes to southeast Asia for
the first time and you get diabetes 10 years later because you refined all the techniques of
marketing so effectively but now happening at scales that are automated with computation so what
you're talking about is the impact of computation and learning on top of learning data on top of data
and then cross-referencing lookalike models and all of this kind of thing you could apply to the
domain at least that social dilemma uh watchers and people who are familiar with our work uh might
be able to tie into yeah the more people you have in the system and the more data per person
that you're able to harvest the more stuff you have for the machine learning to figure out patterns
on which also means that the machine learning can provide things that the users want more
even if it's manufactured want right even if it's manufactured demand which means that then more
users will come and put more data in and it can specifically figure out how to manufacture the
types of behavior that increase data collection and so you do get this recursive process on how
many people how much data how good are the machine learning algorithms you know that kind of thing
and this is one of the reasons that we see these natural monopoly formations within these categories
of tech and this is another reason that's important to understand like uh these types of self-reinforcing
dynamics and things like network effects like Metcalf's law didn't exist when the Scottish
Enlightenment was coming up with its ideas of capitalism and market and the healthy competition
and markets and why that creates checks and balances on power they didn't exist uh Adam Smith
did not get to think about those things and so when you have a situation where the value of the
network is proportional to the square of the you know people coming into the network then you're
incented to keep it free up front maximize addiction drive behavior into the system and then once you
get to the um kind of uh breakaway point on the return of that thing it becomes nearly impossible
for anyone else to come in and overtake that thing so you get a power law distribution in each
vertical you get one online market that is bigger than all the other online markets one video player
that's bigger than all the other video players one search one social network one and that's not
because of a government monopoly that's because of this kind of natural tech monopoly this also
means that when we created the laws around monopolies they don't apply to this thing and yet
this this thing still has the same spirit of power concentration and unchecked power that our
ideas of monopoly had but it's able to grow much faster than law is able to figure out how to deal
with it or faster than economic theory can change itself right and so one of the things that we see
is that our social technologies like law like governance like economics are actually being
obsolete by the development of totally new types of behavior and mechanics that weren't part of the
world they were trying to solve problems for right and so the Scottish Enlightenment was the
development of new ideas of how to problem solve the problems of its time the uh the constitution
was trying to figure out how to solve the problems of its time I would say they were good thinking
right they were good work the Bretton Woods world was none of them are adequate to solve
these problems because these are these problems are different in kind and even where they're just
an extension of magnitude when you get enough change in magnitude sometimes it becomes a
difference in kind like as you're getting more and more information to process once you get
past what humans can process infosingularity type issues okay well now it's a difference
in magnitude that becomes a difference in kind which means you need a fundamentally different
approach so I would say this is where it's important to recognize that those social technologies
that we loved so much because they seem so much better than all the other options we had at the
time like markets and like democracy these are not terminal goods in and of themselves
the terminal goods were things like human liberty and justice and checks and balances on power and
opportunity and distribution of opportunity and things like that these were the best
social technologies possible at the time the new technologies both kill those things they don't
work anymore right you can't have the social technology of the fourth estate that was necessary
for democracy which is why founding fathers said things like if I could have perfect newspapers
and a broken government or perfect government broken newspapers I take the newspapers because
if you have an educated populace it all understands what's going on they can make a new form of
government if you have people that have no idea what's going on how could they possibly make good
choices if their sense making is totally broken so we had this idea that the fourth estate was a
prerequisite to a participatory governance but that was based on a very narrow limited capacity
for print right and again it was the technology of the Gutenberg press that was one of the things
that actually ended feudalism and so the founding fathers were employing that new tech both because
it upended the previous tech and it made this new thing possible same with guns that they needed
guns and second amendment to make this new thing possible um but once we get to a internet world
where you don't have centralized broadcast you have decentralized and then there's so much stuff
that you can never possibly find at all in search of whoever coordinates the search the content
aggregators which is the facebook the youtube whatever are doing it with the types of business
models we have the fourth estate is just dead forever that old version there's no way to recreate
that version so does that either means democracy is dead forever or anything like a well-informed
citizenry that could participate in its governance in any form or you have to say what is a post
internet post social media post info singularity fourth estate that creates an adequately educated
citizenry that's thinking about the way that our social technologies our social systems have to
upgrade themselves in the presence of the tech that obsoleted the way they did work but we can
also see and we can give examples of this how the new tech also makes possible new things that
weren't possible before so we can do something better than industrial era democracy or industrial
era markets which is why I say they aren't a terminal good they're a way to deliver certain
human values that really matter and the new technology that obsoletes those can actually also be
facilitative in designing systems that also serve those values but it's not a given that it does
that has to become the kind of central orienting mission so so now just to make sure we're linking
this back to the start of this conversation we started this conversation by saying the way
that we are going about solving problems let's say using the legacy systems of law making in a
congress or using the legacy systems of a town hall to vote on a proposition or trying to you
know pass laws as fast as social media as rewiring society the lines don't match and so what you're
saying is that and just for listeners because I know that you use the phrase social technology but
I think you're really sort of talking about a social systems ways of organizing you know democracy
or technology in the most fundamental sense of the word of something humans design to facilitate
certain kinds of activity or outcomes so like language is a technology or democracy is a technology
so social systems social systems yeah and so if the kind of old world approach of you know
some people might be hearing this and say to themselves now hold on a second so we have all
these institutions we have all these structures we live in a democracy and we live in a system that
that you know is working the way it does it has its courts it has its attorney generals it has its
litigation procedures it has its law making bodies if you're saying that we can't use those
things because they're not adequate or they won't help us solve those problems we need to have new
social systems um maybe you could give us some hope about why that might be feasible and instead
of feeling uh impossible because this is actually precedent in in our history when new new technologies
show up and then new social systems emerge to make room for those technologies functioning well
because you you kind of briefly touched on them but I think it's important to give listeners a
few concrete examples yeah there's a number of kind of good academics and disciplines of
academics that look at the history of evolutions and physical technology and the corresponding
evolutions in thought and culture and social systems um Marvin Harris the cultural materialism
did a kind of major opus work here where he specifically looked at how changes in social
systems and cultures followed changes in technology there are other bodies of work that
will look at the social systems as primary or the cultures as primary and we can say they're
interfecting um but uh but for instance you know the vast majority of human history was tribal was
you know however much 200 000 years of humans in these small kind of Dunbar number uh villages
there was a social technology social systems that mediated that that had to do with how the
tribal circles worked and um and the nature of how resources were shared right it was a very
different kind of economic system a very different kind of judicial system a different
educational system it had all those things it had a way of education meaning intergenerational
knowledge transfer of the entire knowledge set that was needed for the tribe to continue operating
the development of certain technologies particularly the plow but baskets and a few other things
um absolutely did that thing because all of a sudden it made possible big amounts of surplus
that made reason for much larger populations to emerge those larger populations were going to
win in conflict against the smaller populations and so you can see that then the emergence of new
social technology to facilitate large groups of people empire types uh civilization technology
emerged you can see and that there were a few other shifts in technology that evolved the types
of empires that were there and then you know the next one that people talk about a lot is the
industrial revolution from the printing press specifically and then steam engine the gun powder
revolution was part of it that kind of ended feudalism and began the nation state world
and so you can see like what is the thing that the founding fathers in the us were doing well
they weren't trying to keep winning at feudalism right there there was a game that had been
happening for a long time and they were saying like nowhere we're all people who are in of the
type of people who could do well at that system and rather than do that we recognize that there are
are fundamentally things wrong with this system and fundamentally new possibilities that hadn't
been previously recognized so we're going to actually try to design a fundamentally different
system that we think a more perfect union that makes life liberty in the pursuit of happiness
better for everybody and increases productive capacity and things like that so that was fundamentally
an advance in social technology or social systems that both utilized new physical technology
and was enabled by it right um in the current situation there are groups that are advancing
the exponential technologies and what that means whatever social systems that they're
employing are the social systems of the future if we don't change it and that's what I want to get
to in a moment but like who is working to invent to implement any of the new emerging
tech for better social systems that are aligned with social systems we want
you've had uh Audrey Tang on the show do you want to just briefly describe an example of
what she and what they have done there because if people aren't aware of it that's a pretty
prime example of for this particular iteration sure well um so just and maybe just to go back
briefly um because you gave this example in one of our earlier conversations that um you know that
the printing press could have been used by the the feudal lords for consciously reinforcing
feudalism but instead this and actually this new technology the printing press gives way
to new ways of organizing society and we can actually have things like a fourth estate or
newspapers or you know things like that um it was happened what you're both happen yeah right
but then then the new thing theoretically has to win out over over the old thing
um at least the one that we want that holds the values that the society wants correct so um I think
a lot of people can hear our conversation we've had this riff before actually following our last
episode after my senate testimony speaking about a frame that that you you have offered and know
well which is that we can notice that digital authoritarian societies right now like china
are consciously using exponential technologies to make stronger more effective digital clothes
and authoritarian societies and in contrast digital open societies democracies like the
united states are not consciously using technology to make stronger healthier open societies
instead they've sort of surrendered uh what they are to uh private technology multinational
corporations pursuing self-interest to shareholders and are are profiting from the degradation and
dysfunction of democracies and so um when we say all this and we talk about um how do we build the
kind of next social system and audrey tang and in her work I think people get chipped up in thinking
that what we really mean is we have to make some kind of 21st century digital democracy in fact
I probably said those words but what we're really talking about here is some new concept that preserves
the principles of what we meant by a democracy yes um but instantiated with the new technologies
you know our version of the new printing press which is um you know networked information environments
and um you know all of the new capacities that we have in 21st century with um you know mobility
where everyone's connected to everywhere and everything all at once so what is that system
that new social system that leverages the current technology and makes a stronger healthier open
society and I think audrey tang's work I mean I would probably send listeners back to listen
to that episode I think it's one of our most listened to and most popular episodes for a
reason because in Taiwan she's essentially built an entire civic technology ecosystem
in which people are really participating in the governance of their society oh we need masks we
need um better air quality sensors we need to fix these potholes um there are processes by which
every time you're frustrated by something you actually get invited into a civic design process
where whether it's the potholes or the masks you can actually participate in having a better
system uh you're complaining about the tax system and filing your taxes and maybe it's
an inefficient form or something like that you get brought into a design process of what would
make it better and so the system is participatory but not in that kind of 18th century way of hey
there's a physical wooden townhouse and we're going to walk into it and we're going to hang out there
for three hours and I'm going to yell and scream about issues that are more local within you know
10 15 miles of where we are because we were existing in a world before automobiles
we're now talking about how do you do an open society social system
but in a world with all of the new technologies that are not just here today but emerging and
so do you want to talk a little bit about what the prince how will we even navigate that challenge
and why is some new social system like that um necessary for dealing with these problems that
you've sort of laid out at the beginning because I'm sure people would like to feel less anxiety
about those things uh uh hanging around for longer
yeah I think I think what Taiwan has been doing and what uh
Audrey Tang in the digital ministry position in particular has been leading
is probably the best example certainly one of the best examples in the world of this kind of
process and thinking and does it apply in the or could it apply in the exact same way to the U.S.
no of course not like we we know that uh because of the relatively small geography and
high speed train transportation you can get across Taiwan in an hour and a half
and so when you're mentioning the small scale of local government at the beginning of the U.S.
