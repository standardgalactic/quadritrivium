fields where we can take everybody's sentiment on a topic and actually generate a proposition that
is at the semantic center or take everybody's sentiment and abstract from it the values that
they care about and create values taxonomies and say we should come up with a proposition that meets
all these values then can you have digital processes where you can't fit everybody into a
into a town hall but everybody who wants to can participate in a digital space that rather than
vote yes or no on a proposition that was made by a special interest group where we didn't have a say
in the proposition or even the values it was seeking to serve so it was made in a very narrow
way that like we mentioned earlier benefits one thing and harms something else which is why
almost every proposition gets about half of the vote and inherently polarizes the population
well people are so dumb and so rival risk the process of voting with bad propositions and
and bad representation process is inherently polarizing and downgrading to people so what if
there's a process by which there's a decision that wants to be made you start by identifying
what are the values everybody cares about and then we say the first proposition that meets all these
values well becomes the thing that we vote on and then instead of just a direct vote do we
engage types of qualified and liquid democracy together where you have to show that you understand
the basics of that topic to be able to vote on it but the education is free and you can keep
retesting and the basics don't show leaning one way the other just shows you understand the stated
pros and cons so that massive populism doesn't happen but if you don't want to come to understand
it you can cede your vote to someone else who has passed that thing these are that type of liquid
democracy that type of qualified educated democracy where it doesn't have to be educated
across everything it can be per issue and where you're not just voting on a thing you're helping
craft the propositions these completely change the possibility space of social technology and we
could go on and on in terms of examples but these are ways that the same type of new emergent physical
tech that can destroy the epistemic commons and create autocracies and create catastrophic risks
could also be used to realize a much more pro-topic world so I love so many of those examples and I
especially on the blockchain and corruption one because I think as you said something that the
left and the right can both agree on is that our systems are not really functional and there's
definitely corruption and defection going on and just to add to your example imagine if citizens
could even earn money by spotting inefficiencies or corruption in that in that transparent ledger
so that we actually have a system that is actually profiting by getting more and more efficient
over time and actually better serving the needs of the people and having less and less corruption
and so there's actually more trust and faith and that's actually a kind of digital society
that when you look at let's say the closed China's digital authoritarian society and you look at this
open one that's actually operating more for the people with more transparency with more
efficiencies you get more SpaceX Elon Musk type cheap ways of sending rockets to the moon and
becoming a multi-planetary civilization as opposed to more bloat and more mega monopolies defense
contractors that are not taking us to where we need to go that's just an inspiring vision and I just
I hope people listen to what you shared and kind of go back because there's a lot of different
aspects there I think the question on many people's mind right now is going to be
how do we get from where we are to the world that you're talking about what are the steps that are
in between obviously I don't know nobody knows there's gonna like which projects emerge and
first and start really making success that there's a lot of different possible paths
I can say some of the things that could happen and some of the things that I think need to happen
so we take all the catastrophic risks that exponential tech makes possible and the dystopic
attractors and we say okay so we need to solve all those problems but we're not doing really good
at solving those problems right now so our problem solving processes need upgraded and
that means new institutions and when we say institution we usually think of a pretty centralized
thing and with things like decentralized governance emerging the institution might be a decentralized
one but it's individual people aren't going to solve all of that right so it's new
institutions centralized and decentralized that have the right capacities to solve these types
of problems need to come about all right well who develops those institutions and who empowers them
and this is where the democratic idea of the power of government coming from the consent of the
governed is one of the key ideas to what we would think of as the values of an open society let's
say that there's a small number of people who think we understand these problems we understand the
solutions it must happen everybody else doesn't get it so we're going to make this thing happen
and because we have the power we can just kind of implement it by force and so that becomes
its own dystopia right and implement it by force might be well the people think they need to be
free so we'll implement it by attention hijacking them so that they participate with it or don't
even realize that it's happening and they just keep doing whatever's next the cultural element
why we talk about the need for a new cultural enlightenment is of course when we look at
like the founding of the US we can see all that was super wrong with it right I mean just to mention
like how when Churchill said democracy was the worst form of government ever saved for all the
other forms there's when when Socrates talked about in in the republic when Plato was discussing it
why democracy was a dreadful idea the arguments are good arguments right like do you want
do you want people who understand seafaring to man the boat or just the general population who
knows nothing about it to man the boat well that's not a very good idea do you want the general
population that knows nothing about it to build the nasa rocket or do you want people that know
what they're doing well why would we think people who have no idea what they're doing are going to
be good at figuring out how a civilization should be run what should our nuclear first strike
policy should be how should we deal with the stability of the energy grid against Carrington
events and so what does it take to have a population educated enough and yet then if we say okay
but then the other problem is if we say the people are too uneducated and maybe too irrational
and rivalrous to be able to hold that power so it needs to be held by some how do we ensure
non-corruption and who is a trustworthy authority to be able to hold that power and not have vested
interest mess it up and so this is why I think it was a Jefferson quote of the ultimate depository
of the power must be the people and if we think the people too uneducated and unenlightened to be
able to hold that power we must do everything we can to seek to educate and enlighten them not
think that there is any other safe depository and so even with that we take the the U.S. formation
and you've got some founders who had read most of the books of the time right read most of the
books of philosophy knew the history of the Magna Carta and the Treaty of the Forest and all these
kinds of things thought and talked deeply spent many years were willing to die fighting a revolutionary
war were not going along with winning at the current system but really trying to do a fundamentally
different thing to develop a new system not everybody who was participating in the U.S.
was doing that thing they weren't all doing systems architecture right but they were all
basically saying we agree to this kind of systems architecture and we want to learn
how to participate with it adequately we'll read a newspaper we will do a jury duty we'll come to
the town hall that kind of thing so in Taiwan's example I think their population is 23 million
people and their online citizen engagement platform has something like five million people
engaging that's pretty awesome right that's not everybody and and no one should be forced to be
engaging and one of the critical things when we think deeper about is it a democracy is it a
republic is it a is it a epistocracy is it a we want to think about the values not the previous
frames for them and the values exist in dialectics and we need to be able to hold those together of
course we want individual liberty but we don't want individual liberty that gets to harm other
people and other things so we want also you know law justice collective integrity how do you
relate those things one of the core things is the relationship between rights and responsibilities
so there if I have rights and I don't have responsibilities there ends up being like tyranny
and entitlement if I and we can see that that's kind of rampant the entitlement thing if I have
responsibilities and I don't have any attendant rights at servitude neither of those involve
the healthy just society so if I want the right to drive a car the responsibility to do the driver's
education and actually learn how to drive a car safely is important and we can see that some
countries have less car accidents than others associated with better drivers education um
and so increasing the responsibility is a good thing we can see that some countries have way
less gun violence than others even factoring a similar per capita amount of guns based on more
training associated with guns and mental health and things like that so if I have a right to bear
arms do I also have a responsibility to be part of a well organized militia train with them and
be willing to actually sacrifice myself to protect the whole or sign up for a thing to do that do I
have to be a reservist of some kind those are the right responsibility if I want the right to vote
is there a responsibility to be educated about the issue yes yes now does that make it very unequal
no because the capacity to get educated has to be something that the society invests in making
possible for everyone and of course we would all be silly to not be dubious factoring the previous
history of these things but this is what we then have to insist upon because do we want people who
really don't understand the issues but think they do voting now that's a dreadful system
but do we want people who know something to have no avenue or who care do we want people who know
something to have no avenue to input that into the system or people who care to have no opportunity
to learn no that's also dreadful so how do we make the on ramps to learning available for everyone
not enforced but we're actually incentivizing can we use those same kind of social media behavior
and sending technologies to increase everyone's desire for more rights and attendant responsibilities
so that there's actually a gradient of civic virtue and civic engagement yeah we could totally do that
um so this is where the cultural enlightenment layer is of course not everyone is going to
be working on how do we develop AI and blockchain for these purposes but they can certainly be saying
I am going to make sure that my representatives are talking about these issues I want all the
presidential candidates to be talking about these issues I'm going to pay attention to and support
candidates who really do in earnest ways I'm going to invest in companies that are doing those
things I'm going to divest from companies that are doing the other things there is a cultural
enlightenment that is needed to be able to create the demand and the support for where those projects
that are earnestly working on and have the capability start to emerge
so you've painted a compelling vision of some of the ways that a open society could consciously
employ some of these technologies to revisit and re-fulfill some of the original values
for which they were intended how much of this how does this work with the existing institutions
that we have how much is this going to rely on transforming the existing digital leviathans
into something new how much is going to depend on blockchain projects how much is this going to
depend on existing institutions would be the the brookings institution or the new york times
can you speak to the role of new and future institutions in making this transition possible
yeah it's interesting when we look at institutions that emerged to try to solve some social or
environmental problems or nonprofits in particular and some government branches that are associated
with that there's this kind of structural perverse incentive that if i am an organization
which means i'm people in an organization that have some that have job security and some actual
power and access and whatever because of this position and my job is to solve a problem if
i fully solve the problem i would obsolete my job and obsolete myself so then there's this
kind of perverse incentive to continue managing the problem continue manufacturing the narrative
that we're needed to manage the problem continue manufacturing the narrative that the problem is
really hard and is hard to solve and so we got to keep you know doing this thing and so one of the
fundamental dispositions of systems is that they want to keep existing and so and yet they might no
longer be fit for purpose they might even be antithetical to the purpose we have to be very
careful about this um with regard to the new institutions we need to what degree could existing
institutions reform themselves to a degree does it need to be new ones it's kind of up to them
like it's kind of up to the the depth of realization of the need and the sincerity and then the
coordination capacity of people in current institutions how much role they could play
we can see the way that going into world war two coming out of the depression the us up regulated
its coordination capacity so profoundly so could we have a manhattan project like level
organization by organization i mean uh in the capacity to organize not a singular thing
that was oriented to how do we instantiate the next model of civilization how do we
instantiate the next model of social systems and social technologies what is the future of
education what's the future of economics what's the future of uh the fourth estate of law etc
that are that fulfill the values that are meaningful and are antifragile in the presence
of the current technologies and that can actually compete with the other applications of those
technologies towards things that serve different values and or aren't antifragile um i would love
to see the us make that a central imperative manhattan project level to be able to do that
not just how do we create a more powerful military but how do we create a more powerful
a healthier fundamentally a healthier society that up regulates and engages collective intelligence
in its own problem solving and innovation better i would like to see lots of countries do that i
think there are countries that uh did not yet transition to democracy are interested in it and
completely bypass the industrial era democracies and go directly to better systems i think networks
of small countries you see what taiwan is doing estonia is trying to do some interesting things
i think networks of small countries could start sharing best practices and sharing resources so
they don't all have to develop the stuff from scratch which could start to lead to coalitions
of countries like the e u saying let's do some fundamentally better things i think it will happen
also not at the level of nation states where like decentralized groups blockchain type groups say all
right let's really earnestly take on what these primary problems are and work on developing
these solutions in these capacities uh for the tech companies to do so would be very hard because
while it could be
still profitable long term it would not be profit maximizing short term relative to the
current thing they're doing as we said winning at the current game and building a new game are
different things and winning at a current game that self terminating is a very short sighted thing
to want to keep doing so if facebook or google or whatever were to cut its ad model it would
have a hard time being able to meet its fiduciary responsibility to shareholders a different way
but could it in conjunction with a uh participatory government regulatory process that wanted to help
change its fiduciary responsibility um where it's became more of a social utility start to
actually redirect its technology and redirect its decision making process yeah it could that would
be super interesting um so i would like to see that as we mentioned earlier i'd like to see the
un recognize that the level of progress that it has made at the sustainable development goals
nuclear deproliferation and other types of international things like economic equality
globally writ large and uh preventing arms races and tragedy of the commons that well it hasn't
done nothing what it's doing is not converge it's it's not adequate it's not converging on
eventually solving the problem set it needs not just more of that approach it needs a different
approach and so to say okay well clearly we don't know how to facilitate coordination of global
problems well enough so let's have a the superseding focus be innovation towards better methods of
global coordination that becomes our new number one goal because we know we only get all the other
goals if we get that and you can see that during world war two when we had to crack the enigma
machine and figure out computation and whatever we got touring we got von Neumann we got all of the
smartest people from countries all around the world engaged in solving those problems i would
like to see the us the un i would like to see other countries and i'd like to see private sector
taking seriously the actual problemscape we have and innovating not for just short-term advantage
or narrow in-group advantage but for long-term advantage of the whole how do we since we have
global effect how do we build global coordination adequate to what is needed to me that has to
become the central zeitgeist and and whatever groups figure out how to do it effectively will
be the groups that can direct the future muted sorry and i know that this is the work that you
are working towards with the conciliants project do you want to talk just about how you are working
towards that with with your work and how we're collaborating yeah i mean we're with the very
very beginning the conciliants project has a site update is not even a beta yet just because we
