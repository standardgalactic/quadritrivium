war with the US a kinetic war but it's very easy right now to engage in supporting narrative warfare
where you turn the left and the right against each other increasingly and where you do long-term
planning where the US can't do long-term planning of those kinds and so we can see
that the government of the US and not just the US but like we can see that open societies are not
innovating in how to be better open societies for the most part more effective ones where they're
using the new tech to make better open societies that's happening in the market sector the market
is making exponentially more powerful companies a company's not a democracy it's not a participatory
governance structure in general it's a kind of very top-down autocratic type system and so we see
that there's more authoritarian nation states that are intentionally doing long-term planning
of the development and deployment of exponential tech to make better nation states of that kind
and we can't even blame them when they look at I mean China had the benefit of getting to see
both where the USA failed and where the USSR failed and try to make something they didn't
fail in either of those ways and there's some things that are very smart about those approaches
so we see though exponentially empowered more autocratic type structures and the emergence of
one natural monopoly per tech sector and then the interaction of those that kind of becomes like
oligarchic feudalism tech feudalism neither of those have the types of jurisprudence
or public accountability or whatever that we're really interested in so the two attractors right
now is the emergence of social systems that are deploying the exponential tech that will probably
not preserve the social values that we're interested in and not be maximally desirable
civilizations probably pretty dystopic ones or not even guiding it well enough to prevent catastrophic
risk and catastrophic risk those are the two major types of attractors we want a new attractor which
is how do we utilize the new exponential technologies the whole suite of them to build new systems of
collective intelligence new better systems of social technology how do you make a fourth
estate that can really adequately educate everyone in a post Facebook world well does
the same way that we're trying to optimize control patterns of human behavior for market
purposes to get them to buy certain things and to direct their attention could that be used
educationally of course it could if it was being developed for that purpose and the AI tech that
can take a bunch of faces and make a new face that is merged out of those could it take semantic
fields of people's propositions and values and create a proposition that is kind of the
semantic center of the space and then could we use we can't all fit into a town hall but can we
engage in digital spaces where we can have better processes of proposing refinements to the propositions
of course we can could we use blockchain and other types of uncorruptible ledgers to solve
corruption which is something that universally everybody thinks is a good idea should all
government money be on a blockchain the movement of it so you have provenance so you can see where
the money is actually going and if someone wants to be a private contractor they have to agree that
the accounting system as if they want government money goes on the blockchain so we can see the
entire provenance of the taxpayer money so that they're really you can't have representation if
there isn't transparency of how it happens so there's a whole bunch of when you start to think
about attention directing technology and what its pedagogical applications could be when you start
to think about AI and how it could actually help proposition development and parsing huge amounts
of information to make a better epistemic commons when you start to think about blockchain and could
we actually resolve corruption using uncorruptible ledgers and making the provenance of physical
supply chains and information and money all flow across those totally new possibilities start to
emerge that never emerged before that were never possible before but if it doesn't become our
central design imperative to develop those that those are not the highest marketed opportunities
for those right now the highest market opportunity for blockchain is speculative tokens that have no
real utility and for AI is things that actually drive ads and purchasing and you know on and on
and for attention tech it is the same thing so you've sold me on the idea that we have
two dystopian attractors that we don't want and the third attractor that we're trying to develop
here is some kind of open society that is consciously using all the modern technologies
towards the values that we care about can you give some concrete examples of what it would look like
to use you know AI and attention driving tech and click driving tech and blockchains and all
these things but in a way that would make a stronger healthier open society yeah totally
so let's say we take the attention tech that you've looked at so much that when it is applied
for a commercial application is seeking to gather data to both maximize time on site and maximize
engagement with certain kinds of ads and whatever that's obviously the ability to direct human
behavior and and direct human feeling and thought in a way that is both emerged out of capitalism
and has become almost a new macroeconomic structure more powerful than capitalism because even more
powerful than being able to incent people's behavior with money is being able to direct what
they think and feel to where the thing that they think of as their own intrinsic motive has actually
been influenced or captured so if we if we wanted to apply that type of technology and we figured
out how to make the kind of transparency that made institutions that were trustworthy enough
that we could trust them with this and already we have institutions that have it that we have
no basis to trust with it could that same tech be used educationally to be able to personalize
education to the learning style of a kid or to an adult to their particular areas of interest
and to be able to not use the ability to control them for game-theoretic purposes but use the
ability to influence them to even help them learn what makes their own center their locus of action
more internalized right we could teach people with that kind of tech how to notice their own
bias how to notice their own emotional behaviors how to notice groupthink type dynamics how to
understand propaganda media literacy so could we actually use those tools to increase people's
immune system against bad actors use of those tools totally could we use them pedagogically in
general to be able to identify rather than manufacturing desires in people or appealing
to the lowest angels of their nature because addiction is profitable can you appeal to the
highest angels in people's nature but that are aligned with intrinsic incentives and be able
to create customized educational programs that are based on what each person is actually innately
intrinsically motivated by but that are their higher innate motivators everybody can have a
reward circuit that is based on you know chocolate cake and sloth but the immediate spike that comes
from the chocolate cake ends up then having a crash and increased weight and inflammation
and whatever where the baseline of their happiness goes down over time even though every time they
eat the chocolate cake they get a spike the exercise reward circuit is maybe not that fun maybe even
kind of painful and dreadful in the moment but then creates a higher baseline of energy and capacity
and endurance and self-esteem and you start to actually have the process become more fun you
get a new reward circuit and the baseline goes up so of course i can appeal to the lower reward
circuit and say hey i'm just giving people what they want yeah but if you have a billion dollar
or a trillion dollar organization that is preying upon them and you discuss this very well all the
time the vulnerabilities that make people's life worse to then have the plausible deniability to
say yeah but they wanted it yeah but it was a manufactured demand and a vulnerability where's
the no bless oblige where's the obligation of having that much power to actually be a good
steward of power a steward of that for other people where if there are reward circuits that
decrease the quality of their life reward circuits that increase it that we're trying to appeal to
one rather than the other could we do that yeah totally we could could we have an education system
as a result that was identifying innate aptitudes innate interests of everyone and facilitating
their development so not only did they become good at something but they became increasingly
more intrinsically motivated fascinated and passionate by life which also meant continuously
better at the thing well in a world of increasing technological automation coming up both robotic
and AI automation where so many of the jobs are about to be obsolete
our economy and our education system have to radically change to deal with that because
the core of like one of the core things an economy has been trying to do forever was
deal with the need that a society had for a labor force and that there were these jobs that
society needed to get done that nobody would really want to do so either the state has to force them
to do it or you have to make it to where the people also need the jobs so there's a cemetery and so
kind of the market forces them to do it well when you technologically automate those jobs and it
happens to be that the things that are the most wrote are the least fun for people and the easiest
to program machines to do and so if you keep the same economy where if people don't produce
they don't have any basic needs met then people want those crappy jobs right but if you make it
to where they have other opportunities then of course having those jobs be automated is fine
but what does it mean to really be able to have other better opportunities so
if one of the fundamental like axioms of our all of our economic theories is that we need to figure
out how to incent a labor force to do things that nobody wants to do an emerging technological
automation starts to debase that that means we have to rethink economics from scratch because
we don't have to do that thing anymore so maybe if now the jobs don't need the people can we remake
a new economic system where the people don't need the jobs can we start to create commonwealth
resources that everyone has access to where people's access does not isn't based on possession that
automatically limits everyone else's access if you get around transportation wise with a car
based on owning that car where the vast majority of the life of the car it's just sitting not being
used for you to have access to the car you have to have possession of it which means that it's a
mostly underutilized asset i don't have access to the thing that you possess now what we see with
uber of course is a situation where your access is not mediated by your possession so now turn that
into electric self-driving cars and now make the entire thing on a blockchain so you disintermediate
even the central business make it a commonwealth resource and everyone has access to transportation
as a commonwealth resource it'll take a 20th of the number of cars to meet the same level of
convenience during peak demand time so much less environmental harm it'll actually be more
convenient because i don't have to be engaged in driving the thing and there's less traffic because
the coordination and better maintenance and there isn't a desire for an incentive for designed
an obsolescence in that system you can see a situation where okay can we make it to where the
wealth augmenting capacity of that technologic automation goes back into a commonwealth because
we don't have to have the same axioms of needing to incent the people oh yeah but if you don't
incent the people there'll all be lazy welfare people nonsense einstein didn't do what he did
based on economic incentive and neither did mozart and neither did gondian and none of the people
that we are most inspired by through history were doing that and what kids will who will spend so
much time doing where they ask questions about why this why this why this and building forts and
whatever is intrinsic motive it's just we don't facilitate the things that they're interested
in we try to force them to be interested in things they aren't interested in that's what ends up
breaking their interest in life and then they just want a hyper normal stimuli and play video
games whatever what if you had a system that was facilitating their interest the entire time now you
have a situation where you can start to decrease the total amount of extrinsic incentive in the
system as a whole use the technology to the automation to decrease the need for extrinsic
incentive and make an educational system and culture that's about optimizing intrinsic incentive
because if my needs are already met getting stuff there's no and everybody's needs are met
through access to commonwealth resources there's no real status conferred that there's only status
conferred by what i create so now there is a any status is bound to a kind of creative imperative
that's an example we can look at blockchain tech even more near term and say
but just to come back to this technological automation thing so obviously it makes possible
changing economics and changing education but also what is the role of humans in a post AI
robotic automation world because that is coming very very soon and what is the future of education
where you don't have to prepare people to be things that you can just program computers to be
well the role of education has to be based on what is the role of people in that world
that is such a deep redesign of civilization because the tech is changing the possibility set
that deeply so at the heart of this are kind of deep existential questions of what is a meaningful
human life and then what is a good civilization that increases the possibility space of that
for everybody and how do we design that thing we come back to blockchain and we say well blockchain
is an uncorruptible ledger well one thing that the left and right and everybody agrees on is
that we the corruption happens and it's bad for the society as a whole we don't like it we just
disagree on who does it is it possible that that tech could make possible decreasing corruption
as a whole actually decreases the possibility set for corruption yeah in order to do corruption
i have to be able to hide that i did it right i either have to to break enforcement or break
accounting and mostly it's break accounting and so what if all government spending was on a blockchain
and doesn't have to be a blockchain it has to be an uncorruptible ledger of some kind
hollow chain is a good example there that is pioneering another way of doing it but
uncorruptible ledger of some kind where you actually see where all taxpayer money goes
and you see how it was utilized the entire thing can have independent auditing agencies and the
public can transparently be engaged in the auditing of it and if the government is going
to privately contract a corporation the corporation agrees that if they want that government money
the blockchain has accounting has to extend into the corporation so there can't be
you know very very bloated corruption everybody got to see that when Elon made SpaceX all of a
sudden he was making rockets for like a hundreds to a thousands of the price that Lockheed or
Boeing were who had just had these almost monopolistic government contracts for a long time well if the
taxpayer money is going to the government is going to an external private contractor who's
making the things for a hundred to a thousand times more than it costs we get this false dichotomy
sold to us that either we have to pay more taxes to have better national security or if we want to
cut taxes we're going to have less national security what about just having less gruesome bloat
because you have better accounting and we make the rockets for a hundredth of the price and we
have better national security and better social services and less taxes well that's oh everyone
would vote for that right who wouldn't vote for that thing well that wasn't possible before
uncorruptible ledgers now that uncorruptible ledger also means you can have provenance on
supply chains to make the supply chains closed loop so that you can see that all the new stuff is
being made from old stuff and you can see where all the pollution is going and you can see who
did it which means you can now internalize the externalities rigorously and nobody can
destroy those emails or burn those files right what if the changes in law and the
decision-making processes also followed a blockchain process where there was a
provenance on the input of information well that would also be a very meaningful thing to be able
to follow so this is an example of like can we actually structurally remove the capacity for
corruption by technology that makes corruption much much much harder that forces types of
transparency on auditability what if also you're able to record history you're able to record the
events that are occurring in a blockchain that's uncorruptible where you can't change history later
so you actually get the possibility of real justice and real history and multiple different
simultaneous timelines that are happening that's humongous in terms of what it does what if you can
have an open data platform and an open science platform where someone doesn't get to cherry
pick which data they include in their peer reviewed paper later we get to see all of the data that
was happening we solve the oracle issues that are associated and then if we find out that a
particular piece of science was wrong later we can see downstream everything that used that output
as an input and automatically flag what things need to change that's so powerful like the least
interesting example of blockchain is currency creation these are actual like
the capacity for the right types of accounting means the right type of choice making right
let's take ai well with ai we can make super terrible deep fakes and destroy the epistemic
commons you know using that and other things like that but we can see the way that the ai makes the
deep fake by being able to take enough different images of the person's face and movements that it
can generate new ones we can see where it can generate totally new faces averaging faces together
somebody sent me some new work that they were just doing on this the other day i found very
interesting they said we're going to take a very similar type of tech and apply it to semantic
