questions. All right, well if I could just say things like that and it would just happen.
Okay so this is from Max Peacock in Canada. So how can the next generation of entrepreneurs
redesign social media to better assist collective sense-making? What might future business models
look like? Tristan, that might be a yeah for you to run with that. Well we can we can both do it.
I mean clearly we're going to go with the advertising business model. It tends to produce the best
sense-making at scale, has the best effects on society, also funds you know the creation of
really good future sense-making and so I think that we need to actually rethink the incentives
at such a fundamental level. I've been trying to learn more about how different countries are
doing this. I think social media that's powered more by payments or micro payments where there's
more of a peer-to-peer incentive system and money flows that are flowing in the direction of what we
later endorse. I think one of the things we have to fundamentally do is decouple the click
from value. We've actually joked in the past that if there were to be a book on this topic,
the title of the book might be the click, the mistake that turned the world upside down,
which is to say that the click, which is basically just a pairing to the lower parts of our limbic
system, that signal, think about what are the signals that enter into a social media environment?
If we're just mining for what did people click on, that signal by itself as the primary input for
how would we re-rank the deck chairs in the Titanic with just clicks? Well all the deck chairs in the
Titanic, if they're clicks, it's just not going to be a good signal. How do we do more retrospective
reviews? One of the things that actually Facebook did in its research was asking people on retrospect
of the things that they saw, what would they say was quote unquote good for the world and they
actually created a new news feed that people looked back on the things that they clicked on
and said the things that they thought not just that they were happy about that made them happy
or something like that, like a skateboarding video that I liked in the moment that I actually
really liked later I didn't regret. That's one way to kind of deepen the signal of value,
but a different one is what would actually be good for others and they found a direct conflict
actually between what was engaging for Facebook and what was bad for the world and so they actually
ended up continuing to show people things that were bad for the world because that was most
engaging for Facebook. So I would just say that we need better research and actually Daniel,
I know one of the things you've talked about in terms of new metrics for what would make
more healthy social media is a new metric for how would you measure the well-being of a society
and I think you have a really interesting metric that maybe you can talk a little bit.
Yeah, that model that you're referencing take a minute to discuss.
But the question the way it's framed how would an entrepreneur work on this?
Probably what they mean by entrepreneur has the assumption of within the for-profit sector
within capitalism so assuming those constraints and that's actually a really key thing to assume
because the social media is a method of incentivizing patterns of allocation of human
attention at massive scale and so then what the platform is incentivized to do is going to be
determining how it develops kind of incentive tech and as we know Facebook and Google both have
more users than China and the US have people combined right and much more total time interacting
with them than we are interacting with our governments these are extraordinarily powerful and
someone was asking a question something like but isn't the click of social validation isn't that
stuff that we want there are higher and lower angels of our nature and we can appeal to either
and when we have trillion-dollar organizations appealing to the lower angels of our nature
it's just a bad direction right like we all know that we can be in environments where based on who
were around we're more likely to gain weight get out of shape drink more whatever it is especially
where we have those susceptibilities we know that we can be in another environment that makes it
easier to stop drinking to get healthier based on do I live with three triathletes or do I live
with other people who have my worst habits you know so so yeah it's easy to have the drug dealer
provide drugs to young kids who are upset and then get them addicted and then say I'm just providing
what they want right this is voluntaryism I'm just providing the supply it's their authentic
demand but yeah it's demand after in the same way that hostess is doing voluntaryism it's just
providing what people want except it's providing what the weakest most addicted vulnerable part of
them wants that actually makes their life comprehensively worse makes them hate themselves
and what other parts of them totally don't want but that they don't have good control over so if we
have as much asymmetric power as a mcdonald's or a hostess or even more a facebook or a google
and I'm in parts conflict which part of me do I hope it's appealing to
for my own growth and well-being and then the well-being of a society based on people that
either have the worst parts of themselves or the better parts of themselves being the basis of the
business model and so just the idea people wanted is neglecting manufactured demand and pretending
that the homo economicus is a real thing and we just make rational decisions based on a coherent
self and all the information and that we aren't making decisions based on addictive tendencies
biologic tendencies status hijacked dynamics very easy to make someone really want something they
never wanted or even knew existed before and that actually comprehensively makes the quality
of their life worse overall and so and then have the plausible deniability to say well
I was just providing them what they want yeah after ensuring that they wanted it using highly
effective manipulative asymmetric supply side tools so so then we have to say is capitalism
itself of adequate incentive system for us to answer these questions this is the entrepreneur
question or if your goal is profit maximization and profit is an extractive metric how much
more did I take out fiscally from the system than I put into it and I actually have let's say
as an entrepreneur I'm going to try to get venture capital and the venture capital wants a
raise to raise to raise to exit plan this means I'm going to move into a model of fiduciary
responsibility to shareholder profit maximization this means that those who make the choices would
actually be breaking the law to not maximize profit maximize profit means that whatever the
profit metric is I have to maximize it are there any activities that another person can make that
I can profit from where their life is best by me maximizing it if I have really significant influence
over them no because healthy life is mostly about balance for something that is good for them in one
dose is really bad for them in another dose and so can I make a profit without maximizing it sure
when I'm doing something good if I maximize it like can we have a food company that makes money
but that doesn't make the maximum money that making the maximally addictive stuff would
so this is where we have to say can a company that has fiduciary responsibility to shareholder
profit maximization does it even have the governance possible to do healthy social media no does not
you can operate within capitalism but you can't do profit maximization so the governance of it
has to be different to begin with the incentive structure which might mean you aren't taking
venture capital it's some other thing do we even need to assume that it's private sector doing this
or could you have co-ops right where in the same way that linkedin or wikipedia or whatever is not
operating from just a for-profit model could and blockchain is an example of communities looking
at this could we have a system where instead of the value of the network being owned by someone
who's extracting profit the value of the network is owned by the community of everyone who's
participating so there is no extractive metric the whole benefit of the network flows back into
the network yeah technologically we can do stuff like that it requires innovation and there are
no examples that are good enough yet in the same way that when the founding fathers were thinking
about the us the question well who's done constitutional republics adequately so far
there's just like no we're innovating we're trying to do something that has not yet been done
and so there are no systems that of governance that are adequate to the technological power
and complexity of what we need to govern there's good work being done in parts of it but there is
not a holistic consideration set that is adequate that's what people need to be inspired to engage
in and they have to question the axioms like is this something a state should fund is this
something a co-op should fund is this something that doesn't have to have individual ownership in
the same way at all because partial attribution through things like decentralized ledgers can
make a totally different model than we had before and actually have the value of the thing flow back
to the network if it's going to be a company could it be a company that has b-corp laws or
not for-profit where the profit flows back in so there isn't an extractive metric even if there
is a revenue model those are really key questions to be asking because otherwise the axioms or the
assumptions you're bringing in are probably a major part of what made the design flaws in the
first place yep so okay so for all the entrepreneurs out there right it's not just the thing you build
it's building it in a way that changes the entire playing field it's on which you're operating good
luck with that just kidding uh that's what we're here to help us all envision um
you know one last thing because i know we're gonna switch into breakouts in q and a and
in just a little bit but there's one of the a first call out uh zebras unite which is an
organization that does funding um and really concern with the funding models of new technology
and um this comes after the naming and nomenclature that silicon valleys usually after the unicorns how
do you hit a billion dollars in a few years and that's all we're funding is those unicorns and we
need zebras which are something that's more balanced and manfred max knief is a chilean economist um
someone uh many people in our community look up to and came up with this notion of synergistic
satisfies talks about you know trees don't grow indefinitely into the sky you know trees grow
and then they stop growing and they continue to develop and have deeper roots and if you've listened
in the conversation that daniel and i had we talked actually in that episode and also with the
uval harari episode on your individed attention about a human development oriented um uh tech
ecosystem i also want to call out vel van heren is on this chat right now and working on something
called potential how do we have human development oriented technology where the goal and incentive
is not to maximize no thank you sorry um sorry and someone popped in um uh and we had um human
development oriented uh technology and i think that's that's a place where you don't want anything
to be maximizing growth indefinitely um and daniel's talked about this many times and so
Daniel i wanted to tee up with one one thing that just to make sure we're not hitting people with
i think the the thing that people hear when you talk in these terms of this unprecedented nature
of what we're talking about that it hasn't happened before can leave people into feeling like this
isn't possible do you want to talk a little bit about the times in history where something
unprecedented is actually the very precedent that we're talking about the very thing that has
happened um i know you have some wait i mean your your tnl the conversation we've had before
which is like when i do a long history analysis the big questions in science and philosophy
mostly have to do with the emergence of new things that didn't exist before like aviagenesis
the beginning of life our best models are that you had an earth that had no life for a pretty
long time a billion years or so and then life emerged and you could say that in 12 billion
years of universe existing in a billion years of the earth existing it had explored the search
base and life just wasn't a thing right like that that that wasn't a thing and and then it was and
then it actually becomes the most interesting uh characteristic and then similarly you have like
a billion years where the life is only single cellular before it becomes multi cellular and
then the multicellularity explodes and then the same thing until like it's nervous systems and
central nervous systems all the way back to you know a very long period of time before
classicality even emerged from purely quantum dynamics and so when i look at the long arc of
universe evolution is the emergence of fundamentally unprecedented stuff right like stuff that is and
i don't mean biologic evolution i mean the broader case of the increasing ordered complexity of
universe and we see this throughout like literally all of physics cosmology biology the emergence of
ordered solar systems and galaxies out of what was much more just chaotic early mass and structures so
and then when we look at human societies you've got depending upon your model
150 to 300 000 years of homo sapiens never getting bigger than small tribes like
going to all the continents exploring all the spaces doing all the things never getting
bigger than small tribes like it would seem that the search space of possible ways of human
organizing had been played out and there was no precedent at all that we would get these
larger things and then Sumeria and other early civilizations and we start going to instead of
150 people 100 000 and a million people very quickly like why did that not happen for hundreds of
thousands of years before and then you know we can look at each of those steps and again it's like
the world the world was all like very dominated post empire by conquest big empires trying to
get more space and conquer the other ones you like watch those visual maps of the history of
empires and it's really impressive so the the largest empire is always war physically war
world war two comes along we get nukes we can't physically war because everybody will die
that's an unprecedented thing in the history of the world the major empires now can't war
they're like what do we do with that well we'll do globalization and mutual sure destruction and
stuff that we never did before like totally new stuff so i would say it's like it is the precedent
of universe to keep doing unprecedented stuff and this is why all of you know Einstein's comments
about the importance of intuition and imagination and kind of creative thinking being as important as
intellect it's why there were all these early nonsense ideas about that humans could never
go faster than the speed of sound or some thoughts of like couldn't even go faster than the speed
of a running horse and it's amazing how easy it is to have the search space of possibility
because there's a lot of stuff that is unknown but we don't even know that we don't know it's in
the unknown unknown so we can't imagine it as possible so we constrain our imagination to the
space of existing possibilities the people who do that will definitely not be innovators like
so you're just not going to innovate new stuff if you use history as the precedent of what can be
done you need to be well informed by history so that you aren't being dumb and trying to innovate
in spaces where the solutions don't exist it has to account for what is already known has to account
for those types of patterns but also has to fundamentally look into novelty sweet well that
is a hopeful hopeful thought the that the precedent the precedent is in and of itself just
unprecedentedness um let's let's maybe so i should have actually mentioned this for folks so that
folks know so we're actually gonna gonna break out into breakout groups that are on 315 so let's
let's take one or two more questions uh from the crowd okay so what is the grand and by the way
i'm reading this for the folks who are just listening what is the grand narrative in you've
all know a harari's words the story that will cohere people together in this cultural renaissance
what is its central value what should we call it what do communities built around it look like
Daniel i want to tee you up to answer this question because one of my proudest moments
was getting to organize a dinner between you and you've all about a year and a half ago and would
love to hear what here we have to I'll tell you the first thing that arises for me is any
answer to this question will definitely be wrong it'll be wrong and the fact that someone answered
it isn't itself wrong at the level of the how independent of what the what is
um we've got the new narrative we're the ones who see we're the ones who know we've got the
new narrative you guys need to catch up and kind of get with it that's not actually the way the way
forward there is a narrative it's unifying everybody's going to buy into it if you don't buy
into it you're there's something wrong with you or we have to do something about you like we know
that story throughout history we know the great religions doing it we know the kind of um patriotic
identities doing it so I don't think um somebody figuring out the grand narrative and trying to
utilize the tools of propaganda to get everybody on board is actually it that's one of the self
destruct things happening because as soon as you realize the power of that then various people
compete for who has the better narrative and now you have narrative warfare and then you find out
that just like with facebook and hostess or mcdonald's the narratives that succeed more are the ones
that appeal to people's fear and their in-group identity and out-group fear and that kind of
stuff and so now the narrative warfare becomes a race to the bottom rather than a race to the top
and that's the world we're in the the narrative of the left is so obviously the right one and the
narrative of the right is obviously the right one to the people that already have certain kinds of
susceptibilities and it requires straw manning the other side and requires making false equivalencies
on your side and the same with previous communist capitalist or you know liberal soviet or whatever
it is kinds of stories so I'm much more interested in people having trans narrative capacity the
