ability to live in someone else's narrative see the world through that eyes feel it and feel the
meaningfulness of it be like yeah I can actually like I would love to see someone who has very
traditional values who could feel into an lgbtq activist and be like wow I can actually feel how
oppressive the world that I feel is right feels to them I can feel how much they can't find themselves
in it I can feel how much their desire for self-expression and freedom and authenticity is like
feels like the most profoundly meaningful thing I there's stuff in there that is real that I want
for them and I can see that I'd like for that that activist to be able to feel into the other
side and be like wow they're holding something that I held as oppressive as sacred they're holding
it as the willingness to sacrifice some things for other things and a maturity and a responsibility
that's willing to do that aligned with a higher sense of what is meaningful and sacred that they're
feel loyalty to they have the sense of loyalty that is different like I want people to be able
to inhabit different values different perspectives and different narratives and so it's not here's
the one narrative to unify them all it's each of the narratives will be partial it'll have it'll
a specific narrative will draw on cultural backgrounds the the new cultural renaissance
won't be the same for Islam and China and India and African nations in the west that would make no
sense it has to draw on their history their values their identity now any cultural enlightenment
to be an enlightenment has to have certain things in common all the dialectics where there are values
that seem to be an opposition but that all matter where if you hold them as an opposition you hold
one as partial you try to make this one win so now the other side is either oppressed or has to
fight back and you stand more all the values have to be held together in synthesis and you have to
realize that there is a continuous tension of managing synthesis so is it about the rights of
the individual or is it about the responsibilities of the individual to the collective if you have if
you think of it as an or you failed at this thing it's not a cultural enlightenment yet there is a
pairing of rights and responsibilities there's a pairing of freedoms and duties there is a
there's a pairing of we are we do are we saying that the society is made by individuals who are
individual agents and actors so we want to maximize individual freedom and agency so the people because
the more agentic the people are the better the society will be or are we saying that actually
individuals are conditioned by the environments they're born into if you're born into Darfur
versus versus born into Finland you're gonna have a very different life statistically it's
straightforwardly clear based on health care of nutrition and education and the things you're
exposed to and the amount of violence you're exposed to so if the individuals are actually
conditioned by the collective don't we want to make prioritize making a collective that itself is
actually conditioned best individuals well of course the truth is that the individuals are
influencing the whole the whole is influencing the individuals that the health of the body is
based on the health of its cells but also unhealth at the level of the body as a whole makes it
harder for individual cells within that system to be healthy there's a recursive relationship
between top down and bottom up dynamics in connected systems so for a cultural enlightenment
to actually be a cultural enlightenment whether it is going to be a uniquely Islamic one or a
uniquely Indian one or uniquely Western one it has to have a virtuous relationship between
the development of the individual their freedom liberty and their agency and the development
of the groups that they're part of and their integrity and coherence where the integrity
and coherence of this of the group is supporting the individual the agency of the individual
supporting the group and a virtuous cycle between them and you can fail on either side right and
it's a chaos or oppression type failure on either side so to be a cultural enlightenment to be a
narrative worth having at all it has to be at the level of the synthesis of the partial values
now could we do that a lot of different ways like are there going to be a lot of different
aesthetics and cultural versions of that and do we want that do we want the richness of that
absolutely so does that mean that we want people who can actually inhabit the different aesthetics
and it's like can I appreciate really beautiful Victorian architecture yeah can I appreciate
really beautiful Moroccan architecture yeah can I appreciate really beautiful Balinese art like
if it's done well and like that's just I can't say anything's more beautiful that's
fucking beautiful right um and so do I want all of art to be one thing no do I want all of culture
to be one thing no do I want that it is all aligned with life thriving and not just for that
little group but for everything because all the groups affect each other so much because of the
level of our tech and our globalization yes so uh we don't want a narrative we want trans narrative
capacity and we want that all the narratives are good for the group and the group's relationship
with the rest of the world not just the rest of the human world but also the rest of the living
and that they operate at the level of dialectic and then we actually want maximum diversity of them
that has richness and people that are oriented to move across them amen Tristan do you want to
speak to that or should we take one last question before we go to break it um let a million flowers
bloom yeah maybe we could just do one last last last question and uh all right so Magnus
Helled in Sweden is asking in a world where people hate change if they do not understand
why and where we're going how do we thread and yarn the change we need at the speed we need
and I think this might have been what the person who previously asked the question that
you know you've all in a story for humanity one one way to see that is kind of my reaction to
what you're sharing Daniel is obviously to say this is the master's story is basically creating
the oppression attractor so to reinforce that that narrative um and yet I think what this next
question is getting at is let's say you have a society that doesn't understand say the timelines
for certain climate uh and related sort of second or third order effects of climate
effects if a society is living inside of um impacting those global effects but not recognizing
it maybe what are the ways that we kind of deal with that or relate to that and that doesn't have
to be one master's story but a certain sense of what we're inhabiting a situation awareness and
this is all built into the things that we've talked about uh already on the podcast but maybe
you want to respond to some of that and then we can hand it over I don't think people hate
change um I don't think anybody hates change I actually think that everyone hopes for a future
that is in some ways better than the one they have which is necessarily change I think that
almost everyone feels good when they feel growth happening I think people get passionate when
they're voting even if they're voting for something they think is aligned with traditions
is because they want to change things or they they want to believe that a certain kind of
change happening I think people have a hard time with change that they think is going to go
badly or that they don't understand or that creates a sense of increased uncertainty or that
threatens something that is really important to them or that they feel they'll be responsible to
in a way that they they can't be um I think there is a dialectic between stability and growth
that matters where we could maximize the rate of growth including through processes that actually
mess up the quality of life now uh we could optimize quality of life now in a way that
doesn't increase the quality of life over time right more kind of hedonistic Dionysian on one side
or excessive uh logos telos with no aliveness on the other side I think for a long time
philosophy has thoughtful people have acknowledged how do we increase the quality of life now and
the growth rate of the quality of life over time is an important thing um I think
I think nobody when they started using Facebook thought that they were going to change the world
or the world was changing or that they were being asked to change their values would change they just
liked tagging photos they liked being tagged in photos it was a very simple feature they liked
seeing their friends it didn't feel like change it felt like it felt like people's faces and then
connected to people now it happened to be that because it met some need that people care about
there was massive adoption and then because of the architectures of it it was actually
changing the world in very significant ways so I think honestly there will be some people who
are really oriented to think about how to design new systems and not everybody most people
like someone who's oriented to be a musician or who's oriented to do nursing or to figure
out mathematical problems might not be thinking about social systems all that much um and that's
great that's fine they will engage with systems that meet that seem like it meets their needs better
so a lot of what happens at scale will happen through some people
building things that actually are effective and then the effectiveness creating a strange
attractor where you go from fast adopters to medium and other adopters and have scaling coefficients
there's a lot more we could say about that but I think it's time
great Tristan do you want to say anything else before we break out
um no I just want to um thank everybody for coming for coming for coming and listening
to this conversation and I know that many people who are in the chat are actually working on many
of these issues the point of this next section is so that many of you can connect with each other
I know people feel when they look at these issues or watch the social dilemma or you know overall
think about them it can feel really overwhelming and I hope that this space you know that David
and Stephanie are creating and hosting as we continue to do these sessions helps bring some
solidarity and some sense of what can happen as we as we navigate so just want to really
thank everyone for coming all the people that are doing this work every day and look forward to
you all getting to connect with each other and thank you so much Daniel for for coming and

to episodes to date it was really fun to be here I'm glad that Stephanie has joined the team and
I look forward to hear what uh people who are here I've seen some things about that
because we're going to share this thread and find a discord and I look forward to hear what comes

work and uh Daniel if you if you want to stick around if you can't stick around that would be
great and then after the breakouts we'll all we'll all come back together and close so over to you
David thank you so much um thank you for uh Daniel and Tristan for the fantastic conversation I have

without them um and thanks to everyone sharing phenomenal resources doing great work in the
chat um now is the part of podcast club where you all will get to connect with one another
and uh there when we pause the session in just a moment you'll see a series of tables the tables
have labels on them that are sort of soft suggestions we want people working on humane tech startups
to be able to meet one another people interested in particular topics to be able to meet one another
but consider them a a gathering point not a um not a criteria to be met uh and you can either
connect in those tables stay in chat um and uh or connect one-on-one in the speed networking
section um you also in the side of your screen will be able to private message anyone if you
run into um I strongly encourage you to share contact information if there's someone you find
yourself gelling with and want to follow up with um and my uh last request is just that you when you
get to your tables um please make sure that everyone at the table has just at least uh 45
seconds to introduce themselves share a little bit of what brings them to this conversation
before you dive into what I'm sure are um a lot of thoughts that are brewing after the discussion
today thank you all um again so much for coming uh we will move into this breakout uh I'll be
moving around the tables to check in um we won't have a formal close so feel uh while the event
runs technically for another 15 minutes feel free to stay in conversation for as long as you'd like
