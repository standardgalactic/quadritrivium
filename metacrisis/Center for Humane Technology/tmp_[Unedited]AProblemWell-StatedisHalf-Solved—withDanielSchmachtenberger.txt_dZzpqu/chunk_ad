whoever coordinates the search
the content aggregators, which is the Facebook, the YouTube, whatever
are doing it with the types of business models we have
the fourth estate is just dead forever
that old version, there's no way to recreate that version
that either means democracy is dead forever
or anything like a well-informed citizenry
that could participate in its governance in any form
or you have to say what is a post-internet, post-social media, post-infosingularity
fourth estate that creates an adequately educated citizenry
that's thinking about the way that our social technologies
our social systems have to upgrade themselves
in the presence of the tech that obsoleted the way they did work
but we can also see and we can give examples of this
the new tech also makes possible new things that weren't possible before
so we can do something better than industrial-era democracy
or industrial-era markets
which is why I say they aren't a terminal good
they're a way to deliver certain human values that really matter
and the new technology that obsoletes those
can actually also be facilitative in designing systems
that also serve those values
but it's not a given that it does
that has to become the kind of central orienting mission
so Dan just to make sure we're linking this back to the start of this conversation
we started this conversation by saying
the way that we are going about solving problems
let's say using the legacy systems of lawmaking in a congress
or using the legacy systems of a town hall to vote on a proposition
or trying to pass laws as fast as social media as rewiring society
the lines don't match
and so what you're saying is that
and just for listeners because I know that you use the phrase social technology
but I think you're really talking about it
social systems, ways of organizing democracy
technology in the most fundamental sense of the word
of something humans design to facilitate certain kinds of activity or outcomes
like language is a technology
or democracy is a technology
social systems
and so if the kind of old world approach of
some people might be hearing this and say to themselves
now hold on a second
so we have all these institutions
we have all these structures
we live in a democracy
and we live in a system that is working the way it does
it has its courts, it has its attorney generals
it has its litigation procedures
it has its lawmaking bodies
if you're saying that we can't use those things
because they're not adequate
or they won't help us solve those problems
we need to have new social systems
maybe you could give us some hope about why that might be feasible
instead of feeling impossible
because this is actually precedented in our history
when new technologies show up
and then new social systems emerge
to make room for those technologies functioning well
you briefly touched on that
but I think it's important to give listeners a few concrete examples
there's a number of good academics and disciplines of academics
that look at the history of evolutions and physical technology
and the corresponding evolutions in
thought and culture and social systems
Marvin Harris, the cultural materialism
did a kind of major opus work here
where he specifically looked at how changes in social systems and cultures
followed changes in technology
there are other bodies of work that will
look at the social systems as primary
or the cultures as primary
and we can say they're inter-affecting
but for instance
the vast majority of human history was tribal
however much 200,000 years of humans
in the small Dunbar number villages
there was a social technology
social systems that mediated that
that had to do with how the tribal circles worked
and the nature of how resources were shared
it was a very different kind of economic system
a very different kind of judicial system
a different educational system
it had all those things
it had a way of education
meaning intergenerational knowledge transfer
of the entire knowledge set that was needed
for the tribe to continue operating
the development of certain technologies
particularly the plow
but baskets and a few other things
obsolete that thing
because all of a sudden it made possible
big amounts of surplus
that made reason for much larger populations
to emerge
those larger populations
were going to win in conflict against
the smaller populations
and so you can see that then the emergence
of new social technology
to facilitate large groups of people
empire types
civilization technology emerged
you can see
and that there were a few other shifts in technology
that evolved the types of empires that were there
and then the next one that people talk about a lot
is the industrial revolution
from the printing press specifically
and then steam engine
the gunpowder revolution was part of it
that kind of ended feudalism
and began the nation state world
and so you can see like
what is the thing that the founding fathers
in the US were doing
well they weren't trying to keep winning at feudalism
there was a game that had been happening
for a long time
and they were saying
like no we're all people who are in
of the type of people who could do well
at that system
and rather than do that
we recognize that there are
fundamentally things wrong with this system
and fundamentally new possibilities
that hadn't been previously recognized
so we're going to actually try to design
a fundamentally different system
that we think
a more perfect union
that makes life liberty in the pursuit of happiness
better for everybody
and increases productive capacity
and things like that
so that was fundamentally in advance
in social technology or social systems
that both utilized
new physical technology
and was enabled by it
in the current situation
there are groups that are advancing
the exponential technologies
and that means whatever social systems
that they're employing
are the social systems of the future
if we don't change it
and that's what I want to get to in a moment
but like who is working to
implement any of the new emerging
tech for better social systems
that are aligned with social systems we want
you've had Audrey Tang
on the show
do you want to just briefly describe
an example of what she
and what they have done there
because if people aren't aware of it
that's a pretty prime example
of for this particular iteration
sure well
and maybe just to go back briefly
because you gave this example
in one of our earlier conversations
that the printing press
could have been used by the feudal lords
for consciously reinforcing feudalism
but instead this new technology
the printing press gives way
to new ways of organizing society
so we can actually have things like
a fourth estate or newspapers
or things like that
both happen
but then the new thing theoretically
has to win out over the old thing
at least the one that we want
that holds the values that the society wants
so
I think a lot of people can hear our conversation
we've had this riff before
actually following our last episode
after my senate testimony
speaking about a frame
that you have offered and know well
which is that we can notice
that digital authoritarian societies
right now like China
are consciously using exponential technologies
to make stronger more effective digital
closed and authoritarian societies
and in contrast digital open societies
democracies like the United States
are not consciously using technology
to make stronger healthier open societies
instead they've sort of surrendered
