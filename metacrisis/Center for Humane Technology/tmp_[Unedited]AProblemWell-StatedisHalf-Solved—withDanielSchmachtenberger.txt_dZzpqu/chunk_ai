can you give some concrete examples
of what it would look like to
use you know, AI and attention
driving tech and click driving tech
and block chains and all these things
but in a way that would make a stronger, healthier open society
Yeah, totally
So let's say we take
the attention
tech that you've looked at so much
that when it is applied
for a commercial application
it is seeking to gather data
to both maximize time on site
and maximize engagement with certain kinds of ads
and whatever
That's obviously
the ability to
direct human behavior
and direct human feeling
and thought
In a way
that has both emerged out of capitalism
and has become
almost a new macroeconomic structure
more powerful than capitalism
more powerful than being able to
incent people's behavior with money
as being able to direct what they think and feel
to where the thing that they think of
as their own intrinsic motive
has actually been influenced or captured
So
if we
if we wanted to
apply that type of technology
and we figured out how to make
the kind of transparency
that made institutions
that were trustworthy enough
and already we have institutions that have it
that we have no basis to trust with it
could that same
tech be used educationally
to be able to personalize education
to the learning style
of a kid or to an adult to their particular
areas of interest
and to be able to
not
use
the ability to control them
for game-theoretic purposes
but use the ability to influence them
to even help them learn
what makes their own
center
their locus of action more internalized
we could teach people
with that kind of tech
how to notice their own bias
how to notice their own emotional behaviors
how to notice groupthink type dynamics
how to understand propaganda and media literacy
so could we actually use those tools
to increase people's immune system
against bad actors' use of those tools
totally
could we use them pedagogically
in general to be able to identify
rather than manufacturing
desires in people
or appealing to the lowest angels of their nature
because addiction is profitable
can you appeal to the highest
angels in people's nature
but that are aligned with intrinsic incentives
and be able to
create customized educational programs
that are based on what each person is actually
innately intrinsically motivated by
but that are their higher innate motivators
everybody can have a reward circuit
that is based on
you know chocolate cake and sloth
but the immediate spike
that comes from the chocolate cake
ends up then having a crash
and increased weight and inflammation
and whatever where the baseline of their happiness
goes down over time
even though every time they eat the chocolate cake they get a spike
the exercise reward circuit is maybe
not that fun maybe even kind of painful
and dreadful in the moment
but then creates a higher baseline
of energy and capacity
and endurance and self-esteem
and you start to actually have the process become
more fun you get a new reward circuit
and the baseline goes up
so of course I can appeal to the lower reward
circuit and say hey I'm just giving people
what they want
but if you have a billion dollar
or a trillion dollar organization
that is preying upon them
and you discuss this very well all the time
the vulnerabilities that make people's life
worse to then have the plausible deniability
to say yeah but they wanted it
but it was a manufactured demand
and a vulnerability where's the no bless
oblige where's the obligation
of having that much power to actually be
a good steward of power a steward of that
for other people where if there are
reward circuits that decrease the quality
of their life reward circuits that increase
that we're trying to appeal to one rather than the other
could we do that yeah totally we could
could we have an education system as a result
that was identifying innate
aptitudes innate interests
of everyone and facilitating
their development so not only did they
become
good at something but they became increasingly
more intrinsically motivated fascinated
and passionate by life
which also meant continuously better at the thing
well in a world of
increasing technological automation
coming up both robotic and AI automation
where so many of the jobs are about to be
obsolete
our economy
and our education system
have to radically change to deal with that
because
the core of like one of the core
things an economy has been trying to do forever
was
deal with the need that a society had
for a labor force
and that there were these jobs that society
needed to get done that nobody would really want to do
so either the state has to force them to do it
or
you have to make it to where the people also need the job
so there's a cemetery and so kind of the market
forces them to do it well when you technologically
automate those jobs and it happens
to be that the things that are the most
wrote are the least fun for people
and the easiest to program machines to do
and
so
if you keep the same economy
where if people don't produce
they don't have any basic needs met
then people want
those crappy jobs right
but if you make it to where they have other
opportunities then of course
having those jobs be automated is fine
but what does it mean to really be able to have
other better opportunities
so
if one of the fundamental like
axioms
of all of our economic theories
is that we need to figure out how to
incent a labor force to do things that nobody
wants to do
and emerging technological automation starts to
debase that
that means we have to rethink economics from scratch
because we don't have to do that thing anymore
so maybe if now the jobs don't need the people
that need the jobs can we start to create
commonwealth resources that everyone has access to
where people's access
isn't based on possession
that automatically limits everyone else's access
if you get around
transportation wise with a car
based on owning that car
where the vast majority of the life of the car
it's just sitting not being used
for you to have access to the car you have to have
possession of it which means that it's a
mostly underutilized asset I don't have
access to the thing that you possess
now what we see with Uber of course is a situation
where your access
is not mediated by your possession
so now turn that into electric
self-driving cars and now make the entire
thing on a blockchain so you disintermediate
