how a civilization should be run what should
our nuclear first strike policy should be how should
we deal with the stability of the energy grid
against Carrington events
and so what does it take
to have a population educated enough
and yet then if we say okay
but then the other
problem is if we say the people are
too uneducated and maybe
too irrational and rival risk to be able
to hold that power so it needs to be held by
some how do we ensure non-corruption and
who is a trust
worthy authority to be
able to hold that power and not have vested
interest mess it up and so this is why I
think it was a Jefferson quote of
the ultimate
depository of the power must be the people and if
we think the people too uneducated not enlightened
to be able to hold that power
we must do everything we can to seek to
educate and lighten them not think that there
is any other safe depository
and so
even with that
we take the
US formation and
you've got some founders
who
had read most of the books of the time
read most of the books of philosophy knew the history
of the Magna Carta and the Treaty of the Forest
and all these kinds of things thought and talked deeply
spent many years were willing to die
fighting a revolutionary war were not
going along with winning at the current system
but really trying to do a fundamentally different thing
to develop a new system
not everybody who was participating in the US
was doing that thing they weren't all doing systems
architecture right
but they were all basically
saying
we agree to this kind of systems
architecture and we want to
learn how to participate with it adequately
will read a newspaper we will do a
jury duty will come to the town hall that kind of
thing so
um
in Taiwan's example I think their population
is 23 million people in their
online citizen engagement platform has something
like 5 million people engaging
that's pretty awesome right that's not everybody
and no one should be forced to be engaging
and one of the critical things
when we think deeper about is it a democracy
is it a republic
is it a epistocracy is it a
um we want to think about
the values not the previous
frames for them and the values exist
in dialectics and we need to be able to hold those
together of course we want individual liberty
but we don't want individual liberty that gets to harm
other people and other things so we want
also you know law justice collective
integrity how do you relate those things
one of the core things is the relationship between
rights and responsibilities so
there
if I have rights and I don't have
responsibilities there ends up
being like tyranny and entitlement
if I and we can see
that that's kind of rampant the entitlement
thing if I have responsibilities
and I don't have any attendant rights
at servitude neither of those
involve a healthy just society so
if I want the right
to drive a car the responsibility
to do the driver's education and actually
learn how to drive a car safely is important and we
can see that some countries have less car
accidents than others associated with better
drivers education um and so
increasing the responsibilities a good
thing we can see that some countries
have way less gun violence than others
even factoring a similar per capita
amount of guns based on more training
associated with guns and mental health
and things like that
so if I have a right to bear arms
do I also have a responsibility
to be part of a well organized militia
train with them and be willing to actually sacrifice
myself to protect the whole or
sign up for a thing to do that to have to be a
reservist of some kind those are the right
responsibility if I want the right to vote
is there a responsibility to be educated
about the issue
yes yes now
does that make it very unequal no
because the capacity
to get educated has to be something that the
society invests in making possible for
everyone and of course we would all be
silly to not
be dubious factoring the previous
history of these things but this is what we then
have to insist upon because do we want
people who really
don't understand the issues but think they do
voting now that's a dreadful system
but do we want people who know
something to have no avenue or who care
do we want people who know something to have
no avenue to input that into the system or
people who care to have no opportunity
to learn no that's also dreadful
so how do we make the on-ramps to learning
available for everyone not enforced
but we're actually incentivizing
can we use those same kind of social media
behavior and sending technologies to increase
everyone's desire for more rights
and attendant responsibilities
so that there's actually a gradient
of civic virtue and civic engagement
yeah we could totally do that
so this is where the cultural enlightenment
layer is of course not everyone is going to
be working on how do we develop AI
and blockchain for these purposes
but they can certainly be saying I am going
to make sure that my representatives are talking
about these issues I want all the
presidential candidates to be talking about these issues
I'm going to pay attention to and support
candidates who really do in earnest ways
I'm going to invest in
companies that are doing those things I'm going to
invest from companies that are doing the other things
there is a cultural
enlightenment that is needed
to be able to create the
demand and the support for
where those projects
that are earnestly working on and have
the capability start to emerge
so you've painted
a compelling vision of
some of the ways that a open
society could consciously employ
some of these technologies to
revisit and
re-fulfill some of the original
values for which they were intended
how much of this
how does this work with the
existing institutions that we have how much is
this going to rely on
transforming the existing
digital Leviathans into something new
how much is going to depend on blockchain projects
how much is going to depend on
existing institutions would be the Brookings
institution or
the New York Times can you speak
to the role of new
and future institutions in making this transition
possible
yeah
it's interesting
when we look at institutions that emerged
to try to solve some social
or environmental problems or nonprofits
in particular and some government branches
that are associated
with that there's this kind of structural
perverse incentive
that if I
am an organization which means
I'm people in an organization
that
have some that have job security
and some actual power and access and whatever
because of this position
and my job is to solve a problem
if I fully solve the problem I would obsolete my job
and obsolete myself so then there's this kind of
perverse incentive to continue managing
the problem continue manufacturing the narrative
that we're needed to manage the problem continue
