the capacity for the right types of
accounting means the right type of choice making
right let's take AI
with AI we can make
super terrible deep fakes and destroy
the epistemic commons you know using that
and other things like that
but we can see
the way that the AI makes the deep fake by
being able to take enough different images of
the person's face and movements that it can generate
new ones we can see where it can generate totally
new faces averaging faces together somebody
sent me some new work that they were just doing on this
the other day I found very interesting they said
we're going to take a very similar type of tech and apply
it to semantic fields where
we can take everybody's sentiment on a topic
and actually generate
a proposition that is at the semantic
center or take everybody's
sentiment and abstract from it the
values that they care about and create
values taxonomies and say
we should come up with a proposition that meets
all these values then
can you have digital processes where you can't fit
everybody into
into a
town hall but everybody who wants
to can participate in a digital space
that rather than vote
yes or no on a proposition that was made by a
special interest group where we didn't have a say
in the proposition or even the values it was seeking
to serve so it was made in a very
narrow way that like we mentioned earlier
benefits one thing and harms something else which is
why
almost every proposition gets about half of the
vote and inherently polarizes the
population well people are so
dumb and so rival risk the process of voting
with
bad propositions and
and bad representation
process is inherently polarizing
and downgrading to people so
what if there's a process by which there's
a decision that wants to be made you start
by identifying what are the values everybody cares
about and then we say the
first proposition that meets all these
values well becomes the
thing that we vote on and then instead of just
a direct vote do we engage
types of qualified and liquid democracy
together where you have to show that you understand
the basics of
that topic to be able to vote on it
but the education is free and you can keep retesting
and the basics don't show leaning one way or the
other just shows you understand the stated pros and
cons so that massive populism
doesn't happen but if
you don't want to come to understand it you can seed
your vote to someone else who has passed that thing
these are that type of liquid
democracy that type of qualified
educated democracy where it doesn't have to
be educated across everything it can be per
issue and where you're not just voting
on a thing you're helping craft the propositions
these completely change
the possibility space of social technology
and we can go on and on in terms of
examples but these are ways
that the same type
of new emergent physical tech
that can destroy the epistemic
commons and create autocracies and create catastrophic
risks could also be used
to realize a much
more
pro-topic world
so I love so many of those
examples and I especially on
the blockchain and corruption one because
I think as you said something
the left and the right can both agree on is that
our systems are not really functional and there's
definitely corruption and defection going on
and just to add to your example
imagine if citizens could even earn money
by spotting inefficiencies or corruption
in that transparent ledger
so that we actually have a system that is
actually profiting
by getting more and more efficient over time
and actually better serving the needs of the people
and having less and less corruption and so there's
definitely more trust and faith and that's actually
a kind of digital society
that when you look at let's say the closed
China's digital authoritarian society
and you look at this open one that's actually operating
more for the people with more transparency
with more efficiencies you get more
SpaceX Elon Musk type cheap
ways of sending rockets to the moon and becoming a multi-planetary
civilization as opposed to
more bloat and more mega monopolies
defense contractors that are not taking us
to where we need to go
that's just an inspiring vision and I just hope
you share it and kind of go back because there's a lot
of different aspects there
I think the question on many people's mind right now
is going to be
how do we get from where we are
to the world that you are talking about
what are the steps that are in between
obviously I don't know
nobody knows
there's gonna like
which projects emerge
and
first and start really making success
that there's a lot of different
possible paths
I can say some of the things
that could happen and some of the things
that I think need to happen
so we take all the catastrophic
risks that exponential tech
makes possible and the dystopic attractors
and we say okay so we need to solve all those
problems but we're not doing
really good at solving those problems right now
so our problem solving processes need upgraded
and that means new
institutions
and when we say
institution we usually think of a pretty centralized
thing and with things like decentralized
governance emerging
the institution might be a decentralized one
but it's individual
people aren't going to solve all of that right
so it's new institution
centralized and decentralized that have the right
capacities to solve these types of problems
need to come about
alright well who develops those
institutions and who empowers them
and this is where
the democratic idea of
the
power of government coming from the
consent of the governed
is one of the key ideas to what
we would think of as the values of an open
society let's say that there's a small
number of people who think we understand these
problems we understand the solutions that must happen
everybody else doesn't get it so we're going to make this
thing happen and because we have the power we can
just kind of implement it by force and so
that becomes
its own dystopia right
and implement it by force might be well the people think
they need to be free so we'll implement it
by attention hijacking them so that they
participate with it or
don't even realize that it's happening and they just
keep doing whatever is next
the cultural element why we talk
about the need for a new cultural enlightenment
is
of course when we look at like the founding
of the US we can see all that was
super wrong with it right
just to mention like how when Churchill said
democracy is the worst form of government ever
saved for all the other forms
there's when when Socrates
talked about in
in the republic when Plato was
discussing it why
democracy was a dreadful idea
the arguments are good arguments right like
do you want
people who understand
seafaring to man the boat or just a general
population who knows nothing about it to man the boat
well that's not a very good idea do you want the general
population that knows nothing about it to build the NASA
rocket or do you want people that know what they're doing
well why would we think people who have no idea what
they're doing are going to be good at figuring out
