but they're both things and we have to
overcome both meaning we have to
have choice making processes in our new system
of coordination and like this sounds
like maybe hippy stuff
until you take
seriously the change of context
oh we have to have problems of choice making that
consider the whole that sounds like
unrealizable hippy stuff
until you realize
but we're making choices that affect
the whole
at a level that
can even individually be catastrophic
and is definitely catastrophic cumulatively
so if we aren't factoring
it
then the human experiment self terminates and maybe that's
the answer to the great filter hypothesis
right and so
our
well yeah
I think people don't have an intuitive grasp of
what it means that each of us
are walking around with the power of
gods to influence huge enormous
consequences I mean
I could give a few examples every time you
enact with the global supply chain and hit buy on Amazon
you invisibly enacted
shipping and planes
and petroleum and wars in the middle east
there's a whole bunch of things that we're
sort of tied into when you are
posting something on social media and have
more than a million followers you're
influencing the global information ecology
and if you're angry and biased about one
side of the other of the pandemic is real
or it's not real or something like that you're
externalizing more bias into the commons
of how keep the rest of the world understands
things so we're walking around with increasing
power but I don't think the increasing power
that we've granted is intuitive
for some folks did you explain
some more examples of that there's both
cumulative effect and
like cumulative long-term
and fairly singular short-term
and cumulative long-term
I mean you go back to
early
US settlers coming into the
US moving west
and they're being buffalo everywhere and there had
been buffalo everywhere for a very long time
and then there's no buffalo in whole areas that
were forested with old growth forest became
deforested and it was
like no it's impossible we could never get rid of all the
buffalo like I we could never
cut down all the trees but the cumulative effect
of lots of people thinking that way we're individually
I have no incentive to leave the buffalo alive
and I do have an incentive for my family individually
to kill it but everybody thinking
that way and
increasing our
desire for how much we consume per capita
our technology that allows us
to consume more per capita
and developing more capital
more total people well
then you start getting
environmental destruction and species extinction at scale
and that's a long time ago
right like that's much lower tech and much less
people and it's
distributed action it's a
cumulative effect issue
and obviously we see that with
nobody's intending to fill the
ocean with microplastics
but everybody's buying shit that is filling the
oceans with microplastics and
so everyone is participating with systems where
the system as a whole
is sociopathic the system is self-terminating
the system doesn't exist without all the agents
interacting with it all the agents feel like
their behavior is so small
that that justifies everybody doing
that thing right so that's what we
mean by cumulative kind of catastrophic risk
but it's
also true that
whoever made
that
thermite bomb and hooked it to a drone and hit
the Ukrainian munitions factory a couple years
ago that caused a billion dollars
in damage exploded munitions factory
the effect of a bomb as big
as the largest
nuclear bomb the U.S. arsenal has an incendiary bomb
this is a home
that was a homemade little bomb in a
drone right and
so and crisper gene
drives are
cheap and easy and it doesn't take
that much advanced
knowledge to start working with them and
so that that starts to look
like
individuals and small
groups with real catastrophic ability
not long-term and cumulatively
the increase in our tech
gives us both issues via
globalization and the overall system you
get these cumulative long-term effects
and with the exponential
tech creating decentralized catastrophic
capabilities one
of the core questions we have to answer is how do we
make a world that is anti fragile
in the presence of
those kind of catastrophic capabilities that are
easy to produce and thus
decentralizable
and so
how do we do that
what are the social systems that we need
to employ to bind some of these
bad
facts and ways that the natural
inclinations of self-interested actors
will drive things in that direction just
to link this to the social media space for people
if I know that I can get
a little bit more attention and a little bit
more likes and clicks and follows and shares
and so on if I exaggerate the truth
by five percent just to use a little bit
more of an extreme adjective
you know I know that that in the long
run would be bad if everybody did that
but for me right now I can win a few hits
and I can get more influence and I'm an Instagram influencer
and I'm making ten thousand dollars a month and if I don't do it
I'm noticing everyone else's do it and if I don't use
the filter everyone else is using the filter
and so everyone ends up in this sort of another race
at the bottom sort of situation
that has that kind of cumulative degradation
or cumulative
derangement where there's increasing distance
between what is true and what people believe
because we've all been subtly exaggerating it
to make our point and gain influence and so on
and so
just to give another example
maybe for listeners in kind of the space that they're
more familiar with
but going back I mean the whole premise
of this is as we gain more
exponential technologies that have
more capacity and more hands
so instead of having just the US and Russia having this
you have
whether as you mentioned CRISPR gene drives or
some of the drone things that are out there
more and more people have access to these things
how can we bind
those kinds of forces and what are the
social systems that we need to make that happen
yeah I want to go back
as you were describing this
I was thinking about how many people
who
listen to your show
who maybe work in technology who might have
they work in technology
because they see the positive things technology can do
and have more of a kind of techno-optimist
point of view and this overall conversation
might sound very techno-pessimist and
like did we not
read Pinker and watch Hans Rosling and
you know those types of things
and
so I want to speak to that briefly
first this is a meta-point
but it's worth saying right now
particularly in on this podcast
and in the kind of post-truth
post or fake fact
