they just don't know it yet
and once you understand the
degree to which we are in trouble
if we do not get our heads around
this and identify the kind of
core generator functions that we need to be addressing
once we all see that
I'll just speak to my own
experience when I first encountered your work
and I encountered
the kind of core drivers
that drive so much of the danger
that we are headed towards
I
immediately
I was kind of already in this direction already
reoriented my whole life to say
how do we be in service if this is not happening
and of creating a better world
that actually meets and addresses these problems
and I know so many other people
whose work
and whose lives and whose daily missions
and purpose have been redirected
by I think hearing some of the core
frames that you offer
and who I hope
and who are many of whom are already working on
active projects to deal with this and those who are not
are supporting in other ways
and I hope that our audience takes this as
an inspiration
for how can we in the face of
stark and difficult realities
as part of this process
gain the kind of cultural
strength to face these things head on
and to orient our lives accordingly
because I have
while bearing periods of time
hit probably low grade despair
myself
I actually feel more inspired than ever
the amount of things and the number of people
who face these challenges
and I'll just say that
I think when you face these challenges alone
and you feel like you're the only one seeing them
or you have a weird feeling in your stomach
it can feel debilitating
and when you realize the number of people
who are also putting their heads up to say
how can we change this
that's what feels hopeful
and that's where I derive my optimism
so Daniel thank you so much for coming on
it's an honor to have you
your work has touched the lives
who may not always say so publicly
but I know that you
had also a huge hand in
inspiring some of the themes that emerged
in the social dilemma which has impacted so many people
as well so thank you so much
really wonderful that we get to have this conversation
thanks just on
absolutely
