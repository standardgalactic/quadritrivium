manufacturing the narrative that the problem
is really hard and is hard to solve and so we got
to keep doing this thing
and so one of the fundamental
dispositions of systems is that
they want to keep existing and
so and yet they might
no longer be fit for purpose they might even be
antithetical to the purpose we have to be very
careful about this
with regard to
the new institutions we need to what degree could
existing institutions reform
themselves to what degree does it need to be new ones
it's kind of up to them like it's kind of
up to the the depth of
realization of the need and the
sincerity and then the coordination capacity of
people in current institutions
how much role they could play we can
see the way that going into World
War II coming out of the depression the U.S.
up-regulated its
coordination capacity so profoundly
so could we
have a Manhattan project like level
organization
by organization
I mean
the
capacity to organize not a
singular thing
that was oriented
to how do we
instantiate the next model
of civilization how do we instantiate the next model
of social systems and social technologies
what is the future of education what's the future of economics
what's the future of
the fourth estate of law etc
that are
that fulfill the values
that are meaningful and are antifragile
in the presence of the current technologies
and they can actually compete with the other applications
of those technologies towards
things that serve different values
and or aren't antifragile
I would
love to see the U.S.
make that a
central imperative Manhattan project level
to be able to do that not just how do we create a more
powerful military but how do we create
a more powerful a
healthier fundamentally a healthier
society that up regulates
and engages collective intelligence
in its own problem solving and innovation better
I would like to see lots
of countries do that I think there are countries
that did
not yet transition to democracy
are interested in it and completely bypass
the industrial era democracies
and go directly to better systems
I think networks
of small countries you see what Taiwan
is doing Estonia is trying to do some interesting
things I think networks of small countries could start
sharing best practices and sharing
resources so they don't all have to develop the stuff from
scratch which could start to lead
to coalitions of countries like the EU
saying let's do some fundamentally better
things I think
it will happen also not at the level of nation
states were like
decentralized groups blockchain
type groups say all right let's
really earnestly take on what these primary
problems are and work on developing
these solutions these capacities
for the tech companies
to do so would be very hard because
while
it could be
still
profitable
long term it would not be profit
maximizing short term relative
to the current thing they're doing as we said
winning at the current game
and building a new game are different things
and winning at a current game that self
terminating is a very short sighted thing
to want to keep doing so
if Facebook or Google or whatever
were to cut its ad model
it would have a hard time being able to meet
its fiduciary responsibility to shareholders a different
way but could it
in conjunction with
a
participatory
government regulatory process that wanted
to help change its fiduciary
responsibility
where it became more of a social utility
start to actually redirect its technology
and redirect its decision making process
yeah it could and that would be super interesting
so
I would like to see
as we mentioned earlier I'd like to see the UN
recognize that the
level of progress that it has made
at
the sustainable development goals, nuclear
deproliferation and other types of
international things like
economic equality
globally writ large
and
preventing arms races and tragedy of the commons that
well it hasn't done nothing
what it's doing is not converging
it's not adequate, it's not converging on
eventually solving the problem set
just more of that approach, it needs a different approach
and so to say
clearly we don't know how to facilitate
coordination of global problems well enough
so let's have the superseding focus
be innovation towards better methods of global
coordination, that becomes our new number one
goal
because we know we only get all the other goals if we get that
and you can see that during World War II
when we had to crack the enigma machine
and figure out
computation and whatever
we got touring, we got von Neumann
one of the smartest people from
countries all around the world
engaged in solving those problems
I would like to see the US, the UN
I would like to see other countries and I would like to see private sector
taking seriously the actual
problemscape we have
and innovating not for
just short-term advantage or narrow
in-group advantage
but for long-term
advantage of the whole, how do we
since we have global effect
global coordination adequate to what is needed
to me that has to become
the central zeitgeist
and whatever groups figure out how to do it
effectively will be the groups
that can direct the future
and I know that this is the work
that you are working towards with the conciliance project
do you want to talk
just about how you are working towards that
with your work and how we are collaborating?
yeah, I mean we are
we are at the very very beginning
the conciliance project
has a site up that is not even
a beta yet
because we
in just starting wanted to
work on building stuff
in association with thinking
but this talk is very
central, this conversation you and I are having is very central to the aims of the conciliance project
which is
we are wanting to
inspire, inform and help
direct a innovation zeitgeist
where
the many different problems of the world
start to get seen in terms of
having interconnectivity
and underlying drivers
and the forcing function
of the power of exponential tech
is taken seriously that says in order to become
good stewards of that requires
evolutions of both our social
systems and our culture
the wisdom to be able to guide
that power, a recoupling
of wisdom and power in that
adequate to what is needed
so how do we innovate in culture
the development of people
and how do we innovate in the social systems
