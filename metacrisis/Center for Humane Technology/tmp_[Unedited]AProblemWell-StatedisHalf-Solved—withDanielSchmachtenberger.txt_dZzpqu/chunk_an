the advancement of our coordination
both employing the exponential tech
and being able to rightly guide it
and so
we have
a really great team of people that are
doing research
and writing basically the types
of things we are talking about here in more depth explaining
what is the role of
the various social systems like what is the role of education
to any society help understand
fundamentally what that is
understand why there is
a particularly higher educational
threshold for open societies where people
need to participate not just in the
market but in governance
understand how that has been disrupted
by the emerging tech and will be disrupted further
by things like technological automation
and then envision what is the future
of education adequate to an open
society in a world that has the
technology that's emerging
and we don't necessarily know what the answer is
but we know examples and we know criteria
so then it's like innovate in this area
and make sure you factor these criteria
and the same thing with the fourth estate the same thing with law
the same thing with economics
and so the goal is not how do we take
some small group of people to build the future
it's how do we help get
what the criteria of a viable future
must be and if people disagree awesome
publicly disagree and have the conversation now
but if we get to put out those design constraints
someone says no we think it's other ones
the center of culture starts to be thinking about
the most pressing issues
in fundamental ways and how to think about them
appropriately and how to approach them appropriately
so fundamentally our goal
is
supporting an increased
cultural understanding of the nature of the
problems that we face a clearer understanding
rather than just there's lots of problems and it's overwhelming
and it's a bummer and so
either some very narrow
action on some very narrow part
of it makes sense just most of activism
or just nihilism
we want to be able to say actually
because there are underlying drivers
there is actually a possibility
to resolve these things
it does require the fullness of our capacity
applied to it
and with the fullness of our capacity so it's not a
given but with the fullness of our capacity applied to it
there is actually a path forward
and
so we're writing these papers
that basically would be kind of like
a meta-curriculum
for people who want to be engaged in designing the future
and
some of them have to do with current
public culture and how to be able to
change patterns of public culture that lead to
better conversation, better sense
making, better meaning making and choice making
so that there's an on-ramp into higher quality
conversations meaning higher quality process of
conversation and then some of them are things
like what are the design criteria
of the future social systems and how could
we build those things then
not everybody will read those
some people who
have the ability to help start building them
will but
we hope that other people will
take that and translate it on podcasts
and into animations and in
whatever other forms of media
so that those topics start
to become increasingly
present in people's awareness
then of course
the next part is what groups start
emerging wanting to address those
and what can we do to help facilitate
good solutions in those groups
and this is where you and I
I've learned a lot from you about
the
social media issues in particular and how
central they are to the breakdown of sense making
because obviously without good shared sense making
there is no possibility for emergent order
you either just get chaos or you have to
have imposed order if you want emergent
order that means emergent good choice making
that means emergent good sense making
and so
we've learned a lot and discussed these things for a long time
and obviously also not just you and I
there's a whole network of people that we're connected to
that have been thinking deeply about these things
that we continue to
try to think about what
adequate solutions could look like
and
I think what
CHT did with the social dilemma
took
one really critical part of this metacrisis
into popular attention
in a more powerful way than I have seen done
otherwise because as big a deal
is getting climate change and public attention is
it's not clear that
climate change is something that is making
that is driving
the underlying basis of all the problems
but a breakdown in sense making and a control
of patterns of human behavior that kind of downgrade
people like oh wow that really does make all these
other things worse
so I see that as a
as a very powerful and personal
on-ramp for those who are interested
to be able to come into
this deeper conversation
and some
of them it'll simply help them
be like okay now I know
what I was intuitively feeling somebody's put it
into words and I at least feel more oriented
and that's the extent because they don't necessarily
have the ability to build new blockchain systems
or whatever it is and they should be
doing the nursing or education or whatever really
other important social value they're doing
some people
will be able to say this actually really resonates
I can translate this to other audiences
and get more people engaged and some people say
I can actually start innovating and working with this stuff
and all of those are good
yeah I
I agree and I think
what we've essentially been
outlining here and you sort of hit it at the end
is going back to the Charles Kettering
quote which I learned from you
and I've learned so many things from you over the years
which is
that a problem not fully
understood is unsolvable
and a problem that is fully understood is half
solved and I just want to maybe
leave our listeners with that which is
I think people can look at the
long litany of problems and
feel overwhelmed or get to despair
in a hurry I think is your phrase for it
and I think that
when you understand the core generator functions
for what is driving
so many of these problems to happen simultaneously
there's a different
and more empowering relationship to that
and you've actually offered a vision
for how technology can be consciously employed
these new technologies can be consciously employed
in ways that should feel inspiring and exciting
I mean I want that transparent blockchain
on a budget for every country in the world
and we can see examples like Estonia and Taiwan
moving in this direction already
and we can see Taiwan building some of the technologies
you mentioned to identify
propositions of shared values between citizens
who want to vote collectively on something that
obviously would have driven up more polarization
so we're seeing this thing emerging
and I think what we need is to
sort of have this be seen as
a necessary upgrade to
let me do that again
I think we need to see this as
not just an upgrade but
the kind of cultural enlightenment that you speak of
that so many different actors are in a sense
already working on you know we used to
have this phrase that everyone is on the same team
