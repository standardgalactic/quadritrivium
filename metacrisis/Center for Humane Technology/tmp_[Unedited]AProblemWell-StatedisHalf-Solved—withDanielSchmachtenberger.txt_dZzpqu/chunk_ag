world where then so much
of the emphasis has gone into we need fact
checkers and we need real
facts
obviously it's possible
to have an epistemic
error or even intentional error in the
process of generating a fact
is there corruption in the institutions
and that kind of thing but let's even say that wasn't
an issue and the things that go through the right epistemic
process as facts are facts
can you lie with facts
totally can you can you mislead
with facts yeah because nobody
is going to make their choice on one fact
they make their choice based on a situational assessment
based on a narrative based on a gestalt
of a whole thing that's lots of different facts
well which facts do I include and which facts do I not
include and
am I de-contextualizing the fact
so
the quality of life has gone up
so much because we average person lived
on less than a dollar a day in the US in 1815
and now they live on this many dollars
a day which inflation adjusted means higher quality
of life yeah but in 1815 most
of their needs didn't come through dollars
they grew their own vegetables they hunted
so I'm de-contextualizing
the facts to compare something that's really apples
and oranges so even if the fact is quote unquote
true the de-contextualization and
recontextualization makes it seem like it means
something different than it means
and the same with the cherry picking
of facts and I can very easily
say oh there's a lower percentage of people in extreme
poverty but I might also be changing the definitions
of extreme poverty I can also
rather than focus on percentage say well there's more
total people in poverty than there were total people
in the world before the industrial revolution so like
so there's the
abilities to de-contextualize
and recontextualize facts there's the ability to
cherry pick facts and there's
the ability to lake off frame facts
and put particular kinds
of sentiment and moral valence
on it and so am I talking about them as
illegal aliens or undocumented
workers and I get a very different kind
of sentiment so talking about it
as a pre-owned car or a used car
everyone loves a pre-owned car no one wants
a used car and so these
very simple semantic frames
contextual frames cherry picking
of the things means that I can
make a narrative
where all the facts went through the most
rigorous fact checker and yet the narrative
as a whole is misleading
and so fact checking is necessary
but it is not sufficient for a good
epistemic and good sense making and not
only is it not sufficient it's even weaponizable
this is a very important thing
to understand because if you are not
pursuing that
you're if you're not recognizing
that you might be believing
nonsense thinking that you're using
epistemic rigor
okay so the techno pessimists
and the techno optimists both cherry pick
and they both lake off
frame and
this is true with
all the difference in almost every
political ideology the woke and the
woke the
the pro socialist
pro capitalist you'll notice that the way
they do their arguments the
systemic racism is really really terrible
no there's not that bad the systemic racism
they both have stats
but this is actually you can almost think
of it as statistical warfare as a tool
of narrative warfare and
so this is where
a higher level of earnestness
rather than a particular
bested interest or bias a higher willingness
to look at biases a higher level of rigor
you know ends up being critical to
actually overcome any of these things
so
can I cherry pick stats that make it look like everything is getting
better totally those things are true
and nobody wants to go back to a world
before novocaine when you have to do dentistry
and
nobody wants to go back to a world before
penicillin when basic bacterial infections go around
and like there's totally good stuff that has
emerged
and are there all
kinds of
ubiquitous
mental illnesses and
chronic complex disease
that didn't exist before and
increase in the total
number of addictive type behaviors within populations
and
and a radical
increase in the catastrophic risk landscape
and negative effect to environmental metrics
so things are getting better and things are getting worse at the same time
it's important to understand that depending upon what you pick
it's just that the things that are getting worse are heading
towards
tipping points that make the whole thing no longer viable
and so that we're not
denying that there are things that are getting better we're
saying that for the game to continue
at all right to have it
be an infinite game that gets to keep continuing
there are certain things that have to not happen
and you can't have the things that are getting worse keep getting
worse at the curve that they are
and have the things that are getting better be able to
continue at all so I just want to
say that so
naive techno optimism
can actually
make you a part of the problem because
then you do things like develop
a solution to a narrowly
defined problem and externalize harm to other areas
because you weren't taking seriously enough
not doing that
but techno pessimism also
makes you a part of the problem
or at least not a part of the solution because
because the world is the future
is not going to be determined by Luddites
it's not going to be determined by people who aren't developing the tools of power
so if you aren't actually looking at
how do we develop a high
tech world that is also a fundamentally desirable
in terms of a high nature and high touch
world then you really
aren't thinking about it in a way that ends up
mattering and so we are
techno optimist but
not naive techno optimist we go through the
totally cynical phase of man tech
is a serious issue and then you go to a post
cynical phase of
if I want to be techno optimist
and not be silly
what does it take to imagine a world
where humans have that much power
and we are good stewards of it
meaning that we actually tend to each other
well and we don't create a
dystopic world that has
exponential wealth and equality
and an underclass that nobody in the upper class would want to trade places with
and that doesn't cause catastrophic risk
right now the amount
of power of exponential tech
makes two attractors most likely
catastrophic risk
of some kind
or social systems
that do not preserve
the values that we care most about
that are the ones that are currently most
working to develop and deploy that technology
and to just give a very brief
recap of the frame that Tristan
you gave on earlier as you mentioned
China is not leaving 100%
of its technology
development to the market to develop however
it wants even if it harms the nation state
they are happy to bind technology
companies that are getting too large
and in ways that would damage the nation state
as we saw with Ant Corporation
and they are doing a lot of
very centralized innovation
as well
