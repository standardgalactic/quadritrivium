even the central business make it a commonwealth
resource and everyone has access to
transportation as a commonwealth resource
it'll take a 20th of the number of cars
to meet the same level
of convenience during peak demand time
so much less environmental harm
it'll actually be more convenient because I don't
have to be engaged in driving the thing
and there's less traffic because of the coordination
and better maintenance and there isn't a desire
for an incentive for designed
an obsolescence in that system
you can see a situation where
can we make it to where
the wealth augmenting capacity
of that technologic automation goes back
into a commonwealth because we don't have to
have the same axioms of needing to incend the people
oh yeah but if you don't incend the people
they'll all be lazy welfare people
nonsense
Einstein didn't do what he did based on
economic incentive and
neither did Mozart and neither did Gandhi
and none of the people that we
are most inspired by through history
were doing that
and what kids will
who will spend so much
time doing where they ask questions
about why this why this why this
and building forts and whatever is intrinsic motive
it's just we don't facilitate
the things that they're interested in
we try to force them to be interested in things
that's what ends up breaking their interest in life
and then they just want a hypernormal stimuli
and play video games whatever
what if you had a system that was facilitating
their interest the entire time
now you have a situation where you can start to
decrease the total amount of extrinsic
incentive in the system as a whole
use the technology
to the automation to decrease
the need for extrinsic incentive
and make an educational system
and culture that's about optimizing intrinsic
incentive because if my needs are already
met getting stuff there's no
and everybody's needs are met through access
to commonwealth resources there's no real status
conferred that there's only status
conferred by what I create so now there is a
any status is bound to a kind of creative
imperative that's an example
we can look at blockchain
tech even more near term and say
but
but just to come back to this technological
automation thing so obviously it makes possible
changing economics and changing education
but also
what is the role of humans
in a
post AI robotic automation world
because that is coming very very soon
and what is the future of
education where you don't have to prepare
people to be
things that you can just program computers
to be
well the role of education has to be based on
what is the role of people in that world
that is such a deep redesign of civilization
because the tech is changing
the possibility set that deeply
so at the heart of this are kind of
deep existential questions of what is a meaningful
human life and then what is a good civilization
that increases the possibility
space of that for everybody and how do we design
that thing we come back to
blockchain and we say
well blockchain is an uncorruptible ledger
well
one thing that the left and right and everybody
agrees on is that we did corruption
happens and it's bad for the societies
at home we don't like it we just disagree
on who does it
is it possible
that that tech could
make possible decreasing
corruption as a whole
it actually decreases the possibility set for corruption
yeah in order to do corruption
I have to be able to hide that I did it
right I either have to
to break enforcement or break accounting and mostly
it's break accounting
and so what if
all government spending was on a blockchain
and doesn't have to be a blockchain
it has to be an uncorruptible ledger of some kind
all a chain is a good example
that is pioneering another way of doing it
but uncorruptible ledger of some kind
where you actually see
where all taxpayer money goes and you see how
it's utilized the entire thing and have independent
auditing agencies and the public can transparently
be engaged in the auditing of it
and if the government
is going to privately contract a corporation
the corporation agrees
that if they want that government money
the blockchain accounting has to extend
into the corporation so there can't be
very very
bloated corruption everybody got to see
that when Elon made
SpaceX all of a sudden he was making
rockets for like a hundreds to a thousands
of the price that Lockheed or Boeing were
who had just had these almost monopolistic government
contracts for a long time
well if the taxpayer money
is going to the government
is going to an external private contractor
who's making the things for a hundred to a thousand
times more than it costs
we get this false dichotomy sold to us that
either
we have to pay more taxes
to have better national security
or if we want to cut taxes
we're going to have less national security
what about just having less gruesome
bloat because you have better accounting
and we make the rockets for a hundredth
of the price and we have better national
security and better social services and less
taxes well that's
everyone would vote for that right
who wouldn't vote for that thing well that wasn't
possible before uncorruptible ledgers
also means you can have provenance
on supply chains to make the supply
chains closed loop so that you can see
that all the new stuff is being made from old stuff
and you can see where all the pollution is going and you can see
who did it which means you can now internalize
the externalities rigorously
and nobody can destroy those
emails or burn those files right
what if
the changes
in law and
the
decision-making processes
also followed a
blockchain process where there was a provenance
on the input of information well that would also
be a very meaningful thing to be able to
follow so
this is an example of like can we actually
structurally remove
the capacity for corruption
by technology that makes
corruption much much much harder that forces
types of transparency on auditability
what if also
you're able to record history
you're able to record the events that are occurring
in a blockchain that's uncruptible where you can't change history later
so you actually get
the possibility of real justice and real history
and multiple different simultaneous timelines
that are happening that's humongous
in terms of what it does
what if you can
have an open data platform
and an open science platform where
someone doesn't get to cherry pick which data
they include in their peer reviewed paper later
we get to see all of the data that was happening
we solve the oracle issues that are associated
and then if we find out that a particular
piece of science was wrong later we can see
downstream everything that used
that output as an input and automatically
flag what things need to change
that's so
powerful like the least
interesting example
of blockchain is currency creation
these are actually
like
