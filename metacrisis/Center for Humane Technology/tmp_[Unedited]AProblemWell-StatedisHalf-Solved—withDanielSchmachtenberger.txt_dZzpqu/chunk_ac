or the wiring diagram of the sort of global societal brain at scales that are exponential
it's sort of a nuclear scale rewiring of the human civilization
we couldn't do that with newspapers we couldn't do that with a printing press
not at the scale speed et cetera that we have now
so do you want to give maybe some more examples of exponential technologies
because I think that's going to lead to we're going to need a new kinds of social systems
to manage this different landscape of not just one exponential nuclear bomb but a landscape
indulge me as I tell a story first that leads into it because it'll be a relevant framework
obviously the bomb was central to World War II and the world system that came afterwards
and what motivated our activity getting into it but it was not the only tech
it was one new technology that was part of a suite of new technologies that could all be developed
because of kind of the level science had gotten to
and basically like physics and chemistry had gotten to the point that we could work on a nuclear bomb
we could start to work on computation
we could get things like the V2 rocket and rockets and a whole host of applied chemistry
and one way of thinking about what World War II was
one way of thinking about it but it's useful frame and I think it's a fair frame
is that there were a few competing social ideologies at the time
primarily kind of German fascism fascism socialism whatever you want to call it
Soviet communism and Western liberalism something like that
and that this new suite of technologies whoever kind of developed it and was able to implement it at scale first would win
that social ideology would win because it's just so much more powerful
if you have nukes and they have guns you're going to win right
and Germans were actually ahead of both the US and the Soviets
because of some things that they did to invest in education and tech development
but that led both the Soviets and the US to really working to catch up as fast as they can
and when the US finally figured it out which we were actually a little bit slow to right
Einstein actually wrote a letter the Einstein solar letter that went to the US government
saying now the science really does say that this thing could happen and the Germans could get it
and you should focus on it and at first they didn't take them up on it
it wasn't until the private sector actually nonprofit supported advanced it further
that then the Manhattan Project was engaged in but then it was engaged in when they recognized the seriousness
that there was an actual eminent existential risk to the nation and the whole Western ideology and whatever
then it was an unlimited budget right it was a let's find all the smartest people in the world
and let's bring them here and let's organize however we need to to make this thing happen
and let's do it for all of the new areas of tech we're going to get the enigma machine and crack the enigma code
we're going to get a v2 rocket we're going to figure out how to reverse engineer that in advanced rocketry
we're going to do everything needed to make a nuclear bomb and then more advanced ones
it was the biggest jump in technology ever in the history of the world in record history as we know it
and it wasn't actually done by the market right it was done by the state that's a very important thing
this idea that markets innovate and states don't innovate is just historically not true here
this was state funds and state controlled operation in the same way that the Apollo project coming out of it was
and a technological jump of that kind hasn't happened since
so it's an important thing to understand but we can say though this is not a totally fair thing to say
we can say that the US came out dominant in that technological race
the US and the USSR both had a lot of capacity so that was the Cold War and then finally the US came out
and so the post-World War II system was a US led system
the UN was in the US the Bretton Wood system was pegged to the US dollar
what I would say is that so it wasn't one type of tech
it was the recognition that science had got to a place where there's going to be a whole suite of new tech
and the new tech meant more power and whoever had the power would determine the next phase of the world
and if we didn't like the social ideologies that were going to be guiding it
of course we can also think of it as just who wanted to win at the game of power
but from the philosophical argument if we didn't like the social ideologies then we have another social ideology
get it
what I would say is that there is an emerging suite of technologies now
that is much more powerful in the total level of jump
technological jump than the World War II suite was
in fact orders of magnitude more
and only those who are developing and employing exponential tech
will have much of a say in the direction of the future
because just from a real politic point of view that's where the power is
and if you don't have the power you won't be able to oppose it
and so what do we mean by exponential tech?
there's a couple different ways of thinking about it
just exponentially more powerful is a very simplistic way
and in that definition nuclear is exponential tech
but what we typically mean with exponential tech is tech that makes it possible to make better versions of itself
so that there is like a compounding interest kind of curve
the tech makes it easier to make a better version which makes it easier to make a better version
and so we see that starting with computation really in a fundamental way
because computation allows us to advance models of computation
how do we make better computational substrates
how do we get more transistors in a chip
how do we make better arrangements of chip so we get GPUs and those types of things
and so in this new suite of technology the center of it is computation
the very very center of that is AI
is kind of self-learning computation on large fields of data
the other kind of software advances like advances in various meaningful advances in cryptography
and big data and the ability to get data from sensors and you know sensor processing image recognition
that is a part of that central suite
and the application of that to the directing of attention and the directing of behavior by directing attention
which you focused on very centrally
then the next phase is the application of the tech
the application of computation to increasing computational substrate
so this is now the software advancing the hardware that can advance the total level of software
so that's not just continuously better chips
it's also quantum computing, photo computing, DNA computing, those other types of things
and the other types of hardware that need to be part of that thing
i.e. sensor tech in particular
so that you can keep getting more data going into that system that can do big data machine learning on it
then it's the application of that computation in AI specifically to physical tech
so to nanotech, material sciences, biotech and even things like modeling how to do better nuclear
and you know robotics and automation
and so when you start thinking about better computational substrates running better software
with more total data going in with better sensors in better robots
you start getting the sense of what that whole suite of things looks like
so that's the suite of things that I would say is what we would kind of call exponential tech
and the reason why the term exponential is important is we don't think exponentially well
our intuitions are bad for it because we think about how much progress was made over the last five years
and we imagine there will be a similar amount over the next five years
and that's not the way exponential curves work, right?
and so it's very hard for us, our intuition was calibrated on the past
and it's going to be miscalibrated for forecasting the total rate of change and the magnitude of change
so to link this for one much more narrow aspect for our listeners who are familiar with social media
and social dilemma and you're talking about sort of self-compounding systems that improve recursively like that
if I'm TikTok or if I'm Facebook and I use data to figure out what's the thing to show you
and that's going to keep you here for long since going to bypass your prefrontal cortex
and go straight to your limbic system, your lizard brain
well the better it gets at doing that and succeeding at that
the more data it has to make a better prediction the next time
but then a new user comes along who it's never seen before
but hey they're clicking on exactly the same pattern of anorexia videos
that we've seen these other 2 million users have that turn out to be teenage girls
and it just happens to know that this other set of videos that are more anorexia videos
are also going to work really really well
so there's sort of a self-compounding loop that's learning not just from one person
and getting a better version of hijacking your nervous system
but learning across individuals
and so now you get a new person coming in from developing countries
never used TikTok before and they're just barely walking in for the front door the very first time
it's sort of like when Coca-Cola goes to Southeast Asia for the first time
and you get diabetes 10 years later because you refined all the techniques of marketing so effectively
but now happening at scales that are automated with computation
so what you're talking about is the impact of computation
and learning on top of learning data on top of data
and then cross-referencing look-alike models and all of this kind of thing
you could apply to the domain at least that social dilemma
watchers and people who are familiar with our work might be able to tie into
Yeah, the more people you have in the system and the more data per person that you're able to harvest
the more stuff you have for the machine learning to figure out patterns on
which also means that the machine learning can provide things that the users want more
even if it's manufactured want, right, even if it's manufactured demand
which means that then more users will come and put more data in
and it can specifically figure out how to manufacture the types of behavior that increase data collection
and so you do get this recursive process on how many people, how much data, how good are the machine learning algorithms
you know, that kind of thing and this is one of the reasons that we see these natural monopoly formations
within these categories of tech
and this is another reason that's important to understand like
these types of self-reinforcing dynamics and things like network effects like Metcalf's law
didn't exist when the Scottish Enlightenment was coming up with its ideas of capitalism
and market and the healthy competition and markets and why that creates checks and balances on power
they didn't exist, Adam Smith did not get to think about those things
and so when you have a situation where the value of the network is proportional to the square of the
people coming into the network then you're incented to keep it free up front, maximize addiction, drive behavior into the system
and then once you get to the kind of breakaway point on the return of that thing
it becomes nearly impossible for anyone else to come in and overtake that thing
so you get a power law distribution in each vertical
you get one online market that is bigger than all the other online markets
one video player that's bigger than all the other video players, one search, one social network one
and that's not because of a government monopoly, that's because of this kind of natural tech monopoly
this also means that when we created the laws around monopolies they don't apply to this thing
and yet this thing still has the same spirit of power concentration and unchecked power
that our ideas of monopoly had but it's able to grow much faster than law is able to figure out how to deal with it
or faster than economic theory can change itself, right?
and so one of the things that we see is that our social technologies like law, like governance, like economics
are actually being obsolete by the development of totally new types of behavior and mechanics
that weren't part of the world they were trying to solve problems for, right?
and so the Scottish Enlightenment was the development of new ideas of how to problem solve, the problems of its time
the constitution was trying to figure out how to solve the problems of its time
I would say they were good thinking, right? they were good work
the Bretton Woods world was, none of them are adequate to solve these problems
because these problems are different in kind
and even where they're just an extension of magnitude, when you get enough change in magnitude
sometimes it becomes a difference in kind, like as you're getting more and more information to process
once you get past what humans can process, infosingularity type issues
okay, well now it's a difference in magnitude that becomes a difference in kind
which means you need a fundamentally different approach
so I would say this is where it's important to recognize that those social technologies that we loved so much
because they seemed so much better than all the other options we had at the time
like markets and like democracy
these are not terminal goods in and of themselves
the terminal goods were things like human liberty
and justice and checks and balances on power
and opportunity and distribution of opportunity and things like that
these were the best social technologies possible at the time
the new technologies both kill those things
they don't work anymore, right?
you can't have the social technology of the fourth estate
that was necessary for democracy
which is why founding fathers said things like
if I could have perfect newspapers and a broken government
or perfect government and broken newspapers, I'd take the newspapers
because if you have an educated populace that all understands what's going on
they can make a new form of government
if you have people that have no idea what's going on
how could they possibly make good choices if their sense making is totally broken
so we had this idea that the fourth estate was a prerequisite
to a participatory governance
but that was based on a very narrow limited capacity for print
and again it was the technology of the Gutenberg Press
that was one of the things that actually ended feudalism
and so the founding fathers were employing that new tech
both because it upended the previous tech and it made this new thing possible
same with guns
they needed guns and second amendments to make this new thing possible
but once we get to a internet world
where you don't have centralized broadcasts
you have decentralized and then there's so much stuff
that you can never possibly find at all in search
