associated with long term planning
long term planning is a key thing
in the US
term limits make long term planning very hard
as does a highly rival risk
two party system that is
willing to damage the
nation as a whole to drive party wins
so in that system
almost all the energy
just goes into trying to win
you spend at least a couple years
but even the years before that are fundraising
creating alliances to just try to win
then you are not going to invest in anything
heavily that has return times
longer than four years because it won't get you re-elected
so no real long term planning
and then
whatever you do do in those four years
will get undone systematically in the next four years
for the most part
that system of governance
will just fail comprehensively
in relationship to a more
to a system that
doesn't have that much internal infighting
and that has
the capacity to do long term planning
and there is a million examples we can look at
but just when did high speed
trains start? they started
we saw them emerge in Europe
we saw them emerge in Japan and in China
we started to export them all around the world
and the US still doesn't have any high speed trains
and it's like what happened?
and we can see
that the US innovated in fundamental
tech in the Manhattan project
kind of through the Apollo project
but then it started to privatize almost everything to the market
the market started to develop in ways that really
were not advancing the technology
in a way that increased the coherence
of the nation
and the fundamental civic values and ideas of the nation
even the World War II thing
increased our military capacities radically
but that didn't mean we actually really advanced the ideas
of democracy or those values of
do we make a better system
to educate the people and inform them
and help them participate in their governance
do we make better governance?
this is why the US military is so powerful
but the US government is so kind of inept
which is why nobody wants to fight a war
with the US, a kinetic war
but it's very easy
right now to
engage in
supporting narrative warfare
where you turn the left and the right against each other
increasingly
and where you do long-term planning
where the US can't do long-term planning of those kinds
so we can see
that the
government of the US
and not just the US but like we can see that
open societies are not innovating
in how to be better open societies
for the most part, more effective ones
where they're using the new tech to make better open societies
that's happening in the market sector
the market is making exponentially
more powerful companies
a company is not a democracy
it's not a participatory governance structure
in general, it's a kind of very top-down
autocratic type system
and so we see that
there's more authoritarian
nation states that are
intentionally doing long-term
planning of the development and deployment of
exponential tech to make better
nation states of that kind
and we can't even blame them
they look at
trying to have the benefit of getting to see both where the USA
failed and where the USSR failed
and try to make something they didn't fail in either of those ways
and there's some things that are very smart about
those approaches
so we see though exponentially empowered
more autocratic type structures
and the emergence of
one natural
monopoly per tech sector
and then the interaction of those that kind of
becomes like oligarchic feudalism
tech feudalism
neither of those
have the types of jurisprudence
or public accountability or whatever
that we're really interested in
so the two attractors right now
is
the emergence of social systems
that are deploying
the exponential tech
that will probably not preserve
the social values that we're interested in
and not be maximally desirable civilizations
probably pretty dystopic ones
or not even guiding it well enough
to prevent catastrophic risk
those are the two major types of attractors
we want a new attractor which is
how do we
utilize the new exponential technologies
the whole suite of them
to build new systems of collective intelligence
new better systems of social technology
how do you make a fourth estate that can really adequately
educate everyone
in a post
Facebook world
well the same way that we're trying to
optimize control patterns
of human behavior for market purposes
to get them to buy certain things
and to direct their attention
could that be used educationally
of course it could if it was being
developed for that purpose
and the AI tech
that can take a bunch of faces
and make a new face that is merged out of those
could it take semantic fields of people's propositions
and values and create a proposition
that is kind of the semantic
center of the space and then could we use
we can't all fit into a town hall
but can we engage in digital
spaces where we can have
better processes of proposing
refinements to the propositions
of course we can, could we use blockchain
and other types of uncorruptible ledgers
to solve corruption which is something that universally
everybody thinks is a good idea
should all government money
be on a blockchain
the movement of it so you have provenance so you can see
where the money is actually going and if someone wants to be
a private contractor
they have to agree that the accounting system
if they want government money
goes on the blockchain so we can see the entire provenance
of the taxpayer money so that
you can't have representation if there isn't
transparency of how it happens
so there's a whole
bunch of when you start to think about
attention directing technology
and what its pedagogical applications could be
when you start to think about
AI and how it could actually help
proposition development
and parsing huge amounts of information to make a better
epistemic commons when you start to think about
blockchain and could we actually resolve corruption
using uncorruptible ledgers and making
the provenance of physical supply chains
and information and money all flow
across those, totally new possibilities
start to emerge
that never emerged before, that were never possible
before
but if it doesn't become our central design imperative
to develop those, those are not
the highest marketed
opportunities for those right now
the highest market opportunity for blockchain is speculative
tokens that have no real utility
and for AI is things that actually
drive ads and purchasing
and you know, on and on
and for attention tech it is the same thing
So you've sold me on the idea that we
have two dystopian attractors
that we don't want and the third
attractor that we're trying to develop
here is some kind of open society
that is consciously using
all the modern technologies
towards the values that we care about
