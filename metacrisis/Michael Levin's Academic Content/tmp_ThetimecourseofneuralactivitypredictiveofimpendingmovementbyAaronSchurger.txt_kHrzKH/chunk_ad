because this kind of sample where you align
to the onset of a movement is biased.
And so moving forward, what we're trying to do
is to look at this data in a very different way.
And this is a technique that we've been developing,
which is to rather than so that you
can think of every point in time in this readiness
potential where you just take the average time
lock to movement, every point in time at the readiness
potential reflects the distribution of the probability
of the signal now given a movement
at a specific time in the future.
And what we want to do is look at that the other way around.
We want to look at the probability of a movement
at various times in the future given the state of the signal
now or in the recent past.
Something more like building a weather forecast in a sense
or a forecasted trajectory of a hurricane
where you out x number of days in the future,
you're predicting where it's going to be
or what its state is going to be.
And the nature of that distribution
can actually tell you something about the degree to which
the process is still drastic or deterministic.
So that's where we're at right now.
I just wanted to share this work with you
and hopefully start a discussion on these kind
of general topics.
But I do want to point out that I started, at least I
started this work back when I was working in Neurospin
and I had funding from the European Research Commission
and an ERC starting grant.
And I obviously have since continued the work now
here at Chapman at the Brain Institute.
So thanks for your attention and I open it up to discussion.
