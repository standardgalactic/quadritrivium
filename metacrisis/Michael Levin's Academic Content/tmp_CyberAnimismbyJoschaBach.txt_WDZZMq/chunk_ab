now if you look at this one it's I think it's a very beautiful example of generative AI maybe
some of you have seen it and what I find fascinating about this thing it is basically the result of
the prompt of a hundred cat making its owner is when you see this for the first time it looks
pretty realistic right if if you see it for the second time maybe it does too
okay let's look at the left one paw of this cat
oops
let's check this left one paw
if this cat has two left one paws and if you see this video for multiple times you also see
that this handle is connected to the body the face is changing shape and so on and it's fascinating
that on the first like two or three views you don't notice this only after your attention is
saturated because you captured the savings of the scene do you have now capacity to look in all the
details and notice the inconsistencies in the scene and it's very interesting that this thing makes
mistakes that a human brain or human mind wouldn't make when it generates such a scene he would probably
not get to the same level of perceptual fidelity but we would have a overall more consistency in
the scene and this inconsistency is because this model is integrating over very short time frames only
so if you only look at the jason frames they've called it to nation between the jason frames is
probably fine most of the time it's just the overall interpretation of the scene over a long
enough time spent doesn't make sense that's why the cat falls apart in this way and so there is
something that is happening in these learning systems that despite using enormous amounts of
training data and more compute that is available I suspect during our own learning they don't arrive
at models that have the same degree of coherence it could be that this radical frestonian perspective
that you are just trying to minimize deviation from prediction in your model is not sufficient
and there's something else that our brain is doing that it basically focuses on maximizing
coherence and this in the limit gets to the same idea as maximizing prediction error but it
leads to models that are more coherent with less data and less compute
so yeah it's different between the current AI algorithms and minds our AI algorithms use an
outside in design whereas our minds use an inside out design basically our mind is organized from
the bottom up the individual cells are sensitive to reward and form an organization across each
other and there's no global control they will think and all the agency in the system is emergent
over the drive of the data that is contributed by the individual components in the system similar
to an organization that is driven by the people from the bottom up and there is an attentional
agent basically that imposes coherence in there if we compare this inside out versus outside in
perspective the technological design you have a workspace that you know everything you control
everything and then you use that known reality to extend it by basically building a small corner
on your workbench that has additional functionality and now extends your controlled world into that
space and this is how we design technology with using deterministic structure that you can control
from the outside and when you look at biological systems and social systems they basically need
to live in a chaotic reality that the chaos of the environment is being changed into a structure
that can be controlled in a coherent way so it's in some sense a colonizing principle that yet
the seed that is working on the interdynastic environment changes it into something that it
can deal with that it can administrate and in the mindset of the organism that also works because
you have neighbors that play by the same rules as you do and you can link up with that so you start
out with this seed that is able to copy itself and then finds an organization together with its
environment and sure this is something that everyone in this lab has thought deeply about
and is aware of and these principles of organization work differently and probably are
aware of how individual neurons are actually single-celled animals that try to make it work
that are basically locked up together in this dark box and only if they find the right way to
organize themselves can they survive and this perspective of looking at distributed processes
to lead to self-organizing computation has always been one of the threats in AI but it's probably
the least visited threat and in a way it started with a truerings work on models of reaction diffusion
models that he tried to get to compute and he sort of potentially models of understanding how
computation could work in the mind he didn't get very far yeah we'll probably know the work of
Alex Mortimer himself he also built a reaction diffusion model that he made of a reaction
diffusion process that leads to the emergence of structure and the idea of cellular automata has
been very powerful in this context the cellular automata is there for instance implemented in
one way famous game of life are completely discrete systems that only create stable patterns
under very narrow conditions but it's possible to make these automata continuous and make them
more robust to work over a very large range of circumstances and this idea of whose automata
is something that's been strongly influenced by this lab and that to work in Blaise Aguirre's team
at Google and Alex Mortimer himself that Zurich implemented some models of this and I think it's
unfortunately stopped relatively early as nobody has ever used this for actual learning as far as I
know in advanced regime and this work is you can see this on distal platform like as many of you
probably did is learning bitmaps and as we're creating them but it would be very interesting to
learn arbitrary functions and to connect them into a fluid architecture
and so you can use those neural cellular automata to produce very very complex dynamic
representations of basically arbitrary structure and so far we know relatively little about how
that works. So there's a hypothesis that I would like to posit to you unless it's been
noticed that humans don't learn while they're not conscious and that we don't get conscious after the
PHD but before we can try the finger consciousness might not be the result of extremely complex
mental organization but it's prerequisite so maybe consciousness emerges first in the
mental organization and then it's basically the primary learning algorithm for a self-organizing
system rather than the other way around that there are simple mechanisms that are eventually
culminating in consciousness and you find analogies for instance in the way in which society is
organized complexity in a society is not what leads to the emergence of government it's
very much the other way around that some individuals discover the secret of government
which is recursively bullying people and once you recursively bully people you basically
organize society into some structure that can be controlled and then you can impose a shared language
and a shared reward system and shared goals and impose control and algorithms on that society
and get it to scale beyond an individual tribe and this secret of recursively bullying people
has been discovered in many many cultures independently right because it's some invariance
that is not that hard to discover and once it exists you have this group of people that
refuses to be bullied by others unless they have absolutely no choice and that they're
going to reapply this principle over and over and compete with other organizations that have
discovered the same idea and have differences in the implementation and the idea that something
like this would happen in the brain is quite interesting so we observe that humans learn
only when they are conscious if we don't ever become conscious in our life we remain vegetables
and consciousness is more simple than perception and maybe it's quite ubiquitous in nature maybe
it is really a relatively simple function it's not completely trivial it's not completely
intuitive how you get this self-observing observer but maybe it's to prerequisite for
getting more of the complex stuff in your mind and I have a pet theory that this actually has
been known for quite some time if we look at the book of Genesis in the bible it's this
I think mistranslated by the Christians as the creation of a physical universe by a supernatural
being it doesn't make a lot of sense because the story is much older than the invention of physics
by Aristotle back then people lived in a dream world they know that the world that you experience
is a dream that is somehow has imbrances in it and is intersubjective but it's a representation
that can change when your beliefs change and the way in which your perception works change
and so the objects of that dream are being created and they're not created by some kind of supernatural
being but they are created by your consciousness and this story is probably more than 3000 years old
as at some point being introduced in the religious scriptures of the Hebrews and
then being translated into some kind of chant so you get the six-day structure and so on but I
think it might easily be a six-stage theory of how the mental organization works in the mind of an
infant so it starts out with the notion that consciousness is the perfect fit it forms before
anything else in the mind before the structure of the world model is created and then it creates
dimensions of difference and then it separates world model and mental stage because the 3d world
is the plane of the best at round and populates with solid and big volumes creates objects and
categories and makes it invariant against changes in lighting and temporal development
in models agency and creates a personal self and so if you look at these individual states basically
starts out with this creative spirit consciousness hovering over the substrate
and the world is without form and void and to overbrew and then it creates a boundary between
the world model and the sphere of ideas that in this text are called heaven and birth or heaven
and world and this sphere of ideas is what Descartes calls rest cogitans with this no sphere this
space in which thoughts and emotions and so on happen and the other one is the stuff in space
rest extensor that's our world model it's the game and attracts reality and this boundary is
quite fundamental in our own mind and it's interesting that unlike western philosophy we
right now recognize that this dualism is not a dualism in the physical universe in the substrate
reality but it's a dualism inside of our mind right we have these two types of representation
the stuff in space representation in which we have a world model that we can touch and it integrates
over our perception and the space of ideas that is asynchronous to it where you can hold a thought
for as long as you want and imagine something independently of what's currently being perceived
the next thing it does it is able to create contrast and we now know it's probably some kind
of new oscillator the intensity of this contrast is associated with brightness with the color of
the day and the flatness of the contrast is dark with the absence of light or data and now we have
that continuous dimension and using dimensions you can create arbitrary objects in an embedding
space and the first object that created is space so the first space that it builds is by combining
two dimensions you get the plane and the plane gets associated with the ground and infants start
thinking in 2d most of the observe this when you see and during development that infants typically
have difficulty to build towers and not because they can't physically because they cannot really
reason it's 3d yet so initially they really like to arrange stuff on the ground and then at some
point they can conceptualize 3d and the way in which objects are represented in 3d and at this point
this is sufficient to deal with the entire photonic space in which you are interact and then we create
liquids and solids and from them we build objects and we learn how light changes over the time and
objects remain invariant against it we discover the rich of light sources and then we create all
the plants and all the animals and you give them all their names and it's all this population of
the game and it's not the creation of a physical universe these are not physical entities these
are categories that we form by interacting with the world and then we also realize that the
purpose of the exercise is to build a control model for the interaction between an organism
and its environment so we create a model of that organism in its environment and put it into the
simulated world and we find that for the first two to three years infants typically refer to
themselves in the third person and I suspect it's not because I is such a complicated word or because
they never hear anybody using it but it's because they don't perceive themselves in the first person
they perceive this person as something that is inside of them it's a model of that person
that is being generated in their mind and we notice that a certain amount of change in personality
once at a certain age we drop into being mostly in the third person that we no longer realize
that we are creating reality and dreaming it but we basically experience ourselves as inhabitants
of this reality and he had this dear childhood in Egypt and I suspect it might be related to the
fact that once we conceptualize ourselves in the first person we re-index our memories
and then you have children you will notice this thing that they have perfectly fine memories
during their first year of life and second year of life and they can remember in their second
year of life what they did in their first year of life but somehow after their third year of life
they forgot everything that was before it's pretty weird and it's interesting in Marian's and most
children and I think that's easy to associate our personal self this is one just first person
perspective and once I stumbled on reading Genesis in this wave made total sense and I could not
unsee it anymore because this original interpretation that after God creates the world creates humans
in God's own image it don't really look like anything that hovers over the face of the waters
and makes light and darkness right and it creates it as man and woman and I think what happens is
that this outer mind creates another spirit another consciousness that is another model of
being that is put inside of this world and thinks of itself as man and woman that thinks of itself
as a human being that experience itself as a person that is I think expressed in here and I
think it makes total sense to put this text first to explain our own nature to us and our own way
of experiencing reality and relating to it so consciousness is creating a self-perpetuating
intelligent recovered information transformer abbreviated spirit I suspect that spirit is
basically the word that our ancestors used to describe self-organizing software agents
and self-organizing software is relatively ubiquitous in societies and organisms and
it's basically the operating system that controls our organism as a software agent that runs from
our body and controls its functions and the hierarchies of software agents if individual
cells also run software that is controlling the cell right down to the molecular level the individual
molecules that move around because the software of the cell wants it to and it's a very interesting
perspective when we think about organisms that a true invariance is not the shape of the organism
or the individual molecules that are contributing to it or even the individual mechanisms that are
being implemented the invariance is the software right it's the set of principles that are being
implemented by the mechanisms so if you want to understand this notion we basically central is
self-organization that structure is being built from the inside out itself reinforcing and energy
optimizing that it's software software and its nature is not physical it is virtual it exists
as if as a pattern in physics but it's an invariant pattern that is able to enforce and replicate
itself and in a sense it's not a thing ontologically software is not an object it's a physical law
it's when you say i have a word processor running on my laptop what you say is whenever i take a
bunch of transistors and put them in this state the following thing is going to be observed wherever
you are in the universe right this this invariance is what we call software software is just a
very specific physical law and the same thing is true for the software that runs on ourselves
right it's basically a law like structure that says when you arrange a matter in this in this way
then you are in force grain it in a particular way so you look at it from a certain perspective
with a certain resolution then you're going to observe the following succession of events
and that's an invariance and this invariance is what we call software and when we talk about the
word agent what we simply mean is a control system for future states so unlike a thermostat
it only controls the present an agent is a control system that is able to model the future to some
degree and is optimizing for future states instead for present states and once we introduce this
condition that the control system is optimizing the future we have the simplest definition of
agent that i could come up with so far because all the features like beliefs desires and tensions
fall out of system that models the future and tries to optimize some future state because
now you have decision making you have intentions and beliefs in the system in some sense in
functional sense so what we notice is the consciousness would be the principle that
organizes information process in grains could be the same principles or similar principles
that work across other cells as well when the organism organizes itself in its information
processing what we notice is that all cells can send conditional messages to neighboring cells
right not only humans can do this and so why is it that only brains are able to think and
perform operations that allow brains to model reality and interact with it maybe other cells
can do that too right is this a revolutionary idea for most cultures it's not for newer
sense it is because newer science knows only humans can compute for some reason i don't know why
and all the other cells that are adjacent to the neurons do not really contribute very much
on the other end we notice that even the ones of the other guns don't run in simulations
