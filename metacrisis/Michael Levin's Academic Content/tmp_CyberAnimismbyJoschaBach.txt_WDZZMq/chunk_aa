Thank you very much for inviting me.
My own research has always been about how a human mind works and that's why I entered
academia in the first place and studied several fields and found that I did not get that much
out of the way in which psychology works today and also I found that neuroscience, for some
reason, didn't seem to make a lot of progress and was quite uncurious about how minds work,
what consciousness actually is and how it relates to the processes that are implemented and I also
found that psychology is largely a history of ideas, philosophy is largely a history of ideas and
that I could make the most practical progress on this cognitive science project in the context
of artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence is of course mostly automating
data processing and in the current moment it's mostly machine learning, mostly deep learning
and it's very successful but it always has been a philosophical project as well and this
philosophical project was always a tiny fraction of what happened in practice but when Minsky and
McCarthy and others started to feel they saw themselves in the tradition of a philosophical
question and this philosophical question is how can we naturalize the mind that is how to map it
into the world in which we exist, how can we understand how it's implemented in reality and
our own culture seems to have a problem there and this is often called this hard problem of how to
relate mind and reality with each other and what I find fascinating is that a lot of other
countries don't seem to have that problem in the same way, it's a problem that might have to do
specifically with our own metaphysics, with our own way to basically structure the basic
reality and how we make sense of it and because we don't have a meta-metaphysics that allows us
to conceptualize our own metaphysics and the metaphysics of other cultures and contexts,
we have difficulty to debug that and also to translate contexts between different cultures
and I noticed this one day when somebody tried to explain animus into me and I said I see Japanese
mythology believes that everything in the universe is alive and conscious and I said this cannot be,
I'm pretty sure that Japanese people have noticed that when you hit the person on the head the person
can become unconscious, when you hit harder the person can even die and they will not say that
everything in the universe is alive and conscious except an unconscious person or a dead person and
so this word means something different from what you make it out to be, you're mistranslating it
into your own metaphysics but the referent is something different and so we need to look back
from first principles in this culture of what are these concepts that are being used to make
sense of reality and so what I find is that psychology is not building systemic theories
for methodological reasons and neuroscience is committed to focusing on the shenanigans of
a single cell type only and the AI is mostly focusing on statistical learning algorithm and
philosophy has lost the plot in some sense in the 1920s and what is the plot basically it's
the actualization of the mind is the greatest philosophical project and if we succeed it
then it by mechanizing the mind by building a system that works mind-like it's also the last
human philosophical project because from then on philosophy will most be done by machines
that are no longer human or by systems that are no longer human and this project was in many ways
started by Elvis Tottle and in earnest it was pursued by lightness who basically had this
insight that we need to methodize the light and translate it into some kind of mathematical
machine and this was then taken on by people like Frager who built a calculus in which he
hoped to be able to express thoughts and Tarski who made a progress and fixing the issues with
logic that Aristotle didn't see yet and Wittgenstein would try to basically to turn English into a
programming language so we could do philosophy in a formal language and fail doing this for the
same reasons as Minsky did 30 years later but Wittgenstein in some sense preempted Minsky's
logistic program for AI and I think he led this led to devastation in philosophy because most people
in philosophy did not think in terms of programming Wittgenstein already knew that you can represent
all logic using NAND gates and so in some sense he could already see true universality
was this pupil but he didn't see the need to prove it yet and discuss it and this is a stream of
thought that philosophy had really picked up on philosophy mostly didn't understand the significance
of the greatest insights of the last century and I think the biggest philosophical insights of the
last century was first of all this discovery of Wittgen. You cannot build a mathematical machine
that is able to run the semantics of mathematical mathematics without breaking
and this was this thing that shocked him very much that you cannot
build stateless mathematics if you have the stateless nature of mathematics in which you are
able to describe affinities in continuum which is a benefit of having stateless mathematics
that doesn't doesn't work step by step then you lose a lot of the description of reality
that physicists and mathematicians hope to have and instead you are forced to use different languages
and the languages that you can use that don't lead into these contradictions that will discover to
be inevitable are computational languages your CPU and your computer is never going to be in an
illegal state it's never going to break right it's just going to come step to step to step
just the question is what does this represent what this thing is doing is a different one
than what you might want to express in your logical language so you can say things in a classical
language that cannot be translated into computer code because those will not lead to a running
program and this means that your semantics are wrong the semantics of the computer are never
wrong or the semantics of your brain are never wrong your brain just goes into the next state
and what it represents and so on is just the functional representation of how these
the manipulations are happening in the system
and the second big insights are related to the nature of computation itself so the practical
ways of performing computations we've discovered a different ways of formalizing computation and
basically in this way language itself because we now realize that all representations are built
over automatized languages and but then we had information theory and learning basically how
we can express things how we can build systems that make models of reality the nature of a model
itself theory of modeling and the idea of functional approximations deep learning in some sense has
been invented multiple times and one of the first ones was a alexander ifanenko but you know that
things are being named after the person who last discovered skin so a lot of things in deep learning
are last discovered by people like geoffrey hinton and yandekun but there are many many
before them who already discovered them and i think the other big discovery on the philosophical
side is universality which means all these computational systems have the same power until
there are not of resources and so under the assumption that your computer has unlimited memory
and you have unlimited time to wait until it is done all the computers can do the same stuff
of course this is an assumption that is not true in reality in reality the systems that you implement
have different powers so they can solve different problems but very often there is a way to compile
between those solutions but this is a very nice result because it means it doesn't really matter
which computational language you are using to describe reality you just use the best one for
the problem the power is going to be the same so this leads us to a position that it would call
strong computationalism and strong computationalism basically is this idea that we can describe
representational systems from within using automata and that every implementable language
is has to rest on automata that no implementable language can do more than a finite automaton
and this means that hyper computational objects cannot exist because you cannot refer to them
you cannot talk about them you cannot observe them you cannot conceptualize them only things that
are computable in a sense are things that you can refer to in any kind of language
and so all realizable systems can be described using non deterministic or stochastic Turing machines
but is this also true for consciousness isn't consciousness a big mystery that
cannot be conceptualized as such a system and so when we talk about this question of course
we have to first agree on what we mean by consciousness and it actually when we pointed
it in a similar way as biologists pointed at living systems before they knew that we're pointing
at cells we can point at consciousness and what we see is first of all this reflexive
nature of consciousness it's not just that's a content present but there is the perception
that we're perceiving that content it's a second order perception that is distinctive for consciousness
i suspect there's a particular reason for this because it's implemented a self-organizing process
and for this process to regulate itself to stabilize itself it needs to observe itself
observing right so it's basically an observer that is self-stabilizing in our own mind and to
ensure that it's an observer it needs to test for whether it's observing and as you see this
especially for instance when you are exhausted imagine you're driving a car you have difficulty
to focus because you're tired and you remind yourself that you're observing you check whether
you're still there and if you don't do this and make an interval so you go to space out fall asleep
it will be not conscious and will possibly crash your car right and so this this is an edge condition
where your brain is basically resisting being colonized by your consciousness and being controlled
by it and where you basically have to reinforce it the other thing is consciousness is always
happening now it creates this bubble of knownness and this in this bubble of knownness you perceive
a coherent reality you cannot perceive incoherent things like that your bubble of reality might
shrink or grow depending on how much you can make clear and in your current working memory context
but you can only perceive this coherent bubble and this seems to be the content of your consciousness
and when you are very calm and when you're in synthesis your environment and you can track everything
then this bubble increases but it's it's not static it's not a single moment it's something like
for me if usually it's around three seconds long this is the moment in which i'm it's dynamic it's
stuff moving it's basically a region in which i can fit the curve to my sensory data to make a
perceptual interpretation so functionally i think that consciousness is an operator in mental states
the purpose is probably the creation of coherence that's already somewhat of a hypothesis not just
an observation so it could be something like the consensus algorithm if you have ever looked at
for instance crypto you know that the blockchain needs to synchronize over all the instances of
the blockchain so there is an algorithm that allows them to reach a state in which no constraints
are violated across all the different local representations of the blockchain and maybe
we can think of consciousness as something a consensus algorithm and working memory we are
all the features that are being observed are made compatible with all the other features that are
being observed and it facilitates a spreading organization in the mind and it acts like the
conductor of a mental orchestra and so if you think of your brain everywhere roughly as instruments
where every instrument is a function that models one area of the domains of cognition
then they are listening to each other to the neighbors and phone processing streams and your
consciousness might be seen as one of those instruments it doesn't have superpowers in the
sense that it's able to hear all the instruments at high resolution at the same time instead it's
going to focus on disharmony in this orchestra and then resolves those disharmony by focusing on
individual instruments and then finding solutions to remove them and if you don't have if you're not
conscious you can still perform things right here if you are a sleepwalker you're some numberless
you can get up at night and you can maybe walk out of your bed and open the fridge and cook dinner
but when you talk to a sleepwalker there's nobody home there is no rhyme and reason to what they're
doing it's that they are just executing routines that they've learned while they are conscious
and this is another observation that we are basically not learning while they are not conscious
so introspectively consciousness is reflexive they can order perception that creates a bubble
of anonymous functionally it's an operator that creates or increases coherence it's a
conductor of mental orchestra and you find this is a convergence of different perspectives so it's
this is very much compatible with bars global works based theory or denets and brushless
movement of a pratigian theater or Gracianos attention schema or menacing us perspective on
how awareness works or georgia of angios idea of a consciousness prior a function that basically
parameterizes your modeling in such a way to that you can achieve a low energy state in tracking
reality but if consciousness is not the same thing as intelligence which i think is the ability to
make models or sentience which i use as a term to describe the ability of a system to model itself
in relationship to the world so it can know what it's doing agency which is the ability to control
the future or having a self it's a first person model of your own agency or empathy the ability
to experience the mental states of others sometimes these words are used somewhat interchangeably but
i think it makes sense to keep them apart and we notice that different cultures use different
terminology to describe physical and psychological reality and i think the big problem is the
heart problem in our own culture is that we don't have that distinction clear
basically we are in a scientific tradition physically monist which means we do subscribe
to physicalism to this idea that base reality is a possibly close mechanical layer and everything
emerges over that layer so basically everything in the physical universe is a mechanism on everything
that we look at interact with is a mechanism as well everything is mechanical in sense and
the modern version of this mechanism is it's some kind of computation that is implemented somehow
in physics that matter energy its base time our base to talk about information and how information
is moving around between observable locations right on the other hand we observe exponentially
that there is the world that we can touch the stuff in space which you take to be the physical
world and there's another domain which is thoughts ideas emotions and our own consciousness
that is some more separate from this and what we in our own culture often fail to acknowledge
is that the world that we touch is not the physical world right we don't touch quantum
mechanics what we touch is a representation in our own mind it's a game engine that's representing
our own mind both our consciousness and the stuff in space well that we touch our representations
existing in the mind that is implemented in physics according to our best theories so
because of this confusion that we have difficulty to relate this to each other and don't realize
that consciousness is a representation that it's virtual that only exists as if in the patterns
of activations in neurons or in the patterns that exist in physics right that leads to confusion
and so consciousness is virtual it's physical objects cannot be experienced right in the physical
universe you cannot be conscious neurons are probably not conscious but it would be very useful
for all these cells in your body to know what it would be like if there existed a person that
perceives and cares and so they create a simulation partially a simulacrum of this that and of what
it would be like if there was a person that cared and then they use the output of that simulation
to drive the behavior of the organism and you happen to be the content of that simulation
so when you perceive reality as something but around you you don't have access to physical
reality you're on a trance state in which you believe that the stream that your brain is
generating about reality is real so there's still this big question can you compare digital
computers that are our best model of what we can do with representations to what brains are doing
and brains much much more complicated and so if you ask yourself how many computers would
it take to emulate a brain and you look at the complexity of a single cell in your brain it's
very daunting right you would need giant amounts of compute to do this but there's another perspective
that people often don't discuss in the sequence how many brains would it take to emulate a computer
because your brain is very noisy and most of the cells contribute not very much to the computations
that are happening in the brain for most of the time it's similar to people working for a large
corporation if you are an employee of microsoft then probably 99% of your cognition doesn't go
into microsoft but it's maintaining your own organism and your immediate relationship to
your environment and similar things are probably true for cells right so the available compute
that the individual unit contributes to the global system is relatively small especially
since everything needs to be implemented as our correction and many others which requires the
system to be highly redundant and so the thing that shocked me in a way was when the rates for
stable diffusion were released that you have a two gigabyte model that contains a visual universe
that is much richer than what every one of us has is a visual universe because it contains
every celebrity every artist every plant every historical period and so on is represented it
can be generated as this model and if this is 80 percent what your brain is doing and it's much
richer than what your brain can do and it's only two gigabytes it's very humbling in a way because
it means that the capacity of our minds is probably a lot smaller than humanity wants us to think
or we could also say two gigabytes is a lot more than most people think it is
