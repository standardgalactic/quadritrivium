non-productive for studying it and i guess my institute is also in a similar situation in many
ways that it's trying to do things that normally should be done by newer scientists or biologists
but are not yeah eric oil has a who used to be here at Tufts he has a really good essay on this
it's called uh neuroscience is pre pre paradigmatic uh chance is wide yeah so
i suspect that what happens when we started going into neuroscience is already post-paradigmatic
because it doesn't care about a paradigm anymore it's just methodological right exactly that's
putting talks about yes okay so but i think this is adding to your point about some kind of
institute or or structure or framework that lets you kind of draw from these different fields
together under a shared language in that case right i mean maybe you could say a shared language
natural language or or mathematics or whatever but how do you get people neuroscience and psychology
physics and and biochemistry and all these different fields to come together and collaborate
in an effective way i think santa fe has done a pretty reasonable job with that but i think there
is more to be done and i think we have to also have a structure that takes into consideration
the nature of having a different perspective because let me ask you this do you feel like
when you start to seek agreement with things you're already kind of shooting yourself foot
don't understand that question when you when you if i'm seeking to agree with something
that's basically saying i'm trying to target something to fit into this puzzle maybe that
puzzle is incorrect and that's been interpreted differently and you should be going another route
but because you're kind of getting this television of oh i have to solve it this way no me this way
or this is a problem maybe you have to step back refresh your mind a little bit reinterpret that
say maybe this is an puzzle piece but this is actually rubik's cube or something else
have you ever noticed when we look at uh evil super scientists in movies that they're actually
not scientists but they are engineers yeah but there is usually no control room there's no peer
reviewed study instead there is somebody who tries to get something to work and i suspect that uh
in the time when science was most productive in this modernist era which ended roughly in the 1970s
and so on most scientists in the major engineers they tried to get things to work and it's also
what i found to be a very productive stance in computer science that when you want to understand
exporting you can make theories about sorting but eventually you need to write testable algorithms
and what you discover is very often you think you found the optimal but you did not and you
often need to do experiments in this way and the experiment is usually not about how can i apply
my known sorting algorithm in many many ways and pretend it's the best one but it's basically it
always works like i think it's a pretty good idea please everybody shoot it down and this is how you
make progress so it's not trying to agree it's the way to disagree and i think that's most valuable
at science is not so much the answer it's this uncertainty discovering new uncertainty is super
valuable because uh finding uh answers to question is often much much easier right there are methods
for this or you can develop them and somewhat straightforward but finding productive questions
that you can actually meaningfully answer that give you useful insights that you can then apply
to a better model of reality that gets you back better on it and let's you understand deeper
what you want to know uh that i think is the job that you have to do if you develop your
experiments what do you think is the main driver about why people don't like to combine fields
together oh yeah it has to do with career considerations it seems that the phd is designed
as a great filter some of people who manage to get through the phd and enter tenured positions
feel that thinking is frivolous it's just a self-verifying masturbatory activity that you
should not actually engage in instead should have learned that your job is about applying methods
and so you learn how to do this and uh the questions are limited to the things for which
you already have good methods because this is what makes you productive which increases your
impact factor which allows you to publish in the existing communities and existing journals on the
existing topics that are reviewed by your existing peers and so it's a normal dynamic that can only
be broken if something comes in from the outside and says uh oh you need to understand that academia
has the card and sometimes you need to uproot the region of the garden and plant something here
and if you just let the garden grow by itself then it's going to replicate what's already there
this is this is just look at the look into the field of meta science because it's really a systemic
issue in how scientists funded and the short-term major grants and the program managers overseeing
those grants are coming through the same system where they're developing myopic short-term research
so um uh this is this is why I think meta science is really important and uh I'm gonna say just gonna
say um it's also important that somebody actually cares and if you look at the system right now it
does not seem that there are many adults left at the top at the end nobody really seems to care about
keeping the civilization afloat and keeping it on course in an organized way and so there is no
money there who can tell the universities now you need to change in a way that makes you productive
again and make some progress on those questions I remember I was gonna say one solution is funding
people not France so just funding really really people giving them some leeway for several years
or or funding institutions or groups
this is there's many many good ideas on how to improve science it's just
reforming any you know system is is hard yes so I suspect that now we mostly identify no longer as
individuals who develop ideas or develop theories or intellects that you interact with but you are
part of teams of large groups that apply certain methods certain paradigms and so on and is the
individual becomes exchangeable in this whole thing and in this perspective it's much harder to
make progress on the paradigms it's fascinating that when uh fun and uh came up with this notion
of normal science and so on that normal science didn't exist yet we see next door um somebody
like uh minsky was creating uh ai and chomsky was creating linguistics and everything was still
paradigmatic and pre-paradigmatic and this idea of normal science was also a new paradigm
it's an interesting question to which degree there was a self-fulfilling prophecy or just
a very prescient anticipation of what was going to happen
it does seem like the things have become more locked in
and the interval between paradigm shifts is growing some people think that's usually
less willing but yeah I remember studying psychology is an undergrad and seeing that
the way in which they did statistics would not possibly work like this idea we remove all the
outliers and we repeat the experiment for as often as we need until we get a good p-value
and the p-value is that thing that decides that it's good and you will always find what you predict
in your study otherwise you cannot publish it and then there comes this famous replication crisis
and the outcome of the replication crisis somebody describes it as you learned that
there was an airplane crash and 50 000 of your loved ones have died in this airplane crash
and the depressing thing is that nobody bothers to even idea them nobody cares which ones don't
replicate which parts are now invalid because nothing depends on anything it's an entirely
only an employment program that has it yeah so I don't know really what to do about this
and it's not that science before that was ideal and non-defective right it's a it's a evolving
enterprise and there's always stuff going to be decaying and there's also probably stuff going
to innovate and happen in new ways and I think we are now in a very happy circumstance because AI
seems to be working surprisingly well uh we have the deficit of understanding what it does
and what it does to us and the present level of discourse is mostly Emily Bender and the
New York Times versus some arguments blog which is abysmal if this is the last then or best in
intellectualism against the machines and the statistical models right this is not the level
at which it should be and I think uh optimistically this will be a wake-up call for us to reinvent
the vigorous science and philosophy that is able to deal with these new challenges
yeah so I suspect what we should probably be doing is to build an industrial network
that is working not just across the US but starting maybe here and in the Bay Area
and is connecting a lot of places to basically get us to reinvent the sciences of the mind
okay thank you very much for your attention
