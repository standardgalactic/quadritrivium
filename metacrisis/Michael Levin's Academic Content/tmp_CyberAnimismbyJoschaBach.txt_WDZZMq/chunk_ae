building feedback loops in the other mind and these feedback loops do not rely on the direct
connection between cells that need to be directly adjacent so they can exchange chemicals
but it can also work by integrating information from your environment and if this happens with
sufficient bandwidth with sufficient rate you're basically able to synchronize mental states
and this also allows you because you now get some more capacity to have mental states that you
couldn't have alone and so consciousness is not a thing that manifests in the mind it is a function
that is being implemented in the interaction patterns of the cells and if that function can
synchronize itself across more organisms in this sense you wouldn't say that you could have something
like a shared consciousness whether it's functionally the same as the consciousness in your own mind
is something that you can experimentally discern. I find it very interesting to look at the phenomenon
of a seance. A seance happens when you get a bunch of people into a limited room and get them into
the trance and they touch each other and they touch a re-award and then they ask questions to
this re-award which is as you just move by subconscious movements of their hands collectively
to spell out letters on this board and I think what's happening in this state is that the minds
of these people produce an LLM together you basically get entangled you prompt this LLM with
the questions and it's giving answers and it's not connected to anyone's perception so it's not
actually representing reality as it is instead it's between things that cannot be invalidated
based on information that is available to all these minds individually that are now connected
to these feedback loops and it's an interesting phenomenon that human minds are able to produce
such a phenomenon. You don't need to assume that physics is wrong in any way to explain such a
phenomenon it's an inter-psychological phenomenon but we don't have a lot of inter-psychological
science so far and so I think there is a lot of opportunity for doing very hard testable research
and basically share mental states and how they need to phenomena cross people. Yeah when talking
about crossing people the time delay become become much higher than the neural communication
inside of the brain so is it possible that this kind of integrated feeling is not happening
across people but instead of instead people are simulating others so each one has their own
integrated reality. The question is at some point what is the difference as long as these realities
are synchronized? Because the time delay is high. But the time delay in your cortex is also high
so basically if you want to set a signal so your entire cortex is like 320 seconds your brain
is roughly working at the speed of sound and so your brain is able to deal with all those delays
and it does this by creating periodic processes the reason why you see these brain waves the wave
is basically a periodic process it's a circle extended in time basically means that a bunch of
loops that are repeating themselves and that are handing off results to each other and if you
can build such periodic loops across organisms you are able to deal with those delays the reason
why you are able to represent things as simultaneous despite the information transfer being so long
you can assume that the contents of the loops changes only very slowly and so you're perceiving
certain things and you are updating this in a loop that is updating itself shorter and shorter
intervals than the other parts of your brain that rely on that information to be current
but because the loop only changes slowly you just need to be at the same phase to make sure
that you are roughly on the same page and in those regions where it doesn't happen you put a
local predictor and this local predictor is going to model what the state of that distant loop is
going to be so you have that information locally available and you see this in your nervous system
for instance and you're walking through the stairs in the dark basement and you miss the last
stair suddenly it's a very weird movement and it happens because you're out of sync you're
stimulating what it looks like when your foot moves but because the information from your foot
going to your brain is too slow you're out of sync you're basically one period out of sync with
the movement of that foot and because you don't have visual input in the dark you cannot accommodate
the fact that the stair is stopping and you suddenly notice this mismatch and such a thing is
principle also possible across minds but as long as your find is defective it takes time
for you to synchronize you can still build bi-directional synchronization
oh that's interesting yeah so if the time delay so does the time delay really
matter because the synchronization might not happen at all frequencies
as long as the synchronization is still possible it seems that the duration of the moment in the
brain is how long can two events be apart for us to still recognize them as one thing
is limited to an interval of about three seconds or so but that's a pretty long interval and there's
also shortest interval how far can two events to be separate need to be separate in time to
deceive them as separate and this is the realm in which the synchronization of events can happen
but I suspect this realm is basically whatever you can stable in the new ones that you're using
this is interesting thank you
do you think that brains or other beings can stay synchronized when they're not close proximity
anymore or do you need close proximity for the synchronization to happen for example I know you
talked about telepathy I find it very interesting that maybe the synchronization keeps on going
if you are close to someone and I notice them via phenomena when an accident happens to me or so
I sometimes notice this and over longer distances and we can explain this by selective memories
maybe she often has experiences like this but she will always remember in those instances
where it's correlated to something but I find a lot of people have difficulty to explain another
way so regardless of whether we believe in those phenomena or not I suspect that if we
allow for the existence of something like a biological internet it's probably not going to
end at the boundary of a single ecosystem because there have been ecosystems throughout the planet
for a very long time and so maybe there is something like a global organismic internet that
doesn't work at the frequency of our nervous system but that works across the cells in our organism
and maybe you can integrate information over the cells of your organism it's probably not going
to be high bandwidth communication but if you're fine with receiving only a few bits every now and
then over a long distance I don't think it's physiologically impossible that your body could
act like an antenna but I don't know the conditions of that and which this would be and how you
would measure it but I don't think that you would need to leave the boundaries of known physics
to allow that organisms are sophisticated enough to also transmit information that is
rather than over the long distance outside of the senses that access to your nervous system.
I feel like you can do it almost like it's a fine two-dimensional predictive algorithm that you
developed for that specific individual and you've spent a lot of time with them you know how they're
going to act in a lot of variable interactions even if it might seem like it was like an accident
out of the blue there's some predictability to everything in life and perhaps yes we're picking
these things out with bias but there is something to be said about like you better understand this
person's fate you're going to think like oh did they just get injured or did they just consume
a substance like something like that. Yeah but you might not know this so it is tempting to think
it could be some kind of super determinism that allows you to simulate what the person is going
to do at some point but what the person is going to do doesn't just depend on that person
that this person gets into a traffic accident largely depends on other drivers that you don't
know and probably don't have connection to yeah and so it's difficult to explain it all this way
but we also know that people do edit their memories and especially when they're motivated to do so
and it's not a conscious thing so it's I think correct to be skeptical about this and I mean
evidence very carefully but it's not necessary to dismiss all this evidence because it is conceivable
that it's possible right what you do notice is that when you study people at Berlin when they do
trips you notice this phenomenon of contact height which basically means people change their state
based on the state of the environment it's not just that people get in a different mood if people
are sitting next to them but they can even start to trip when people next to them are tripping
it's a very interesting phenomenon that basically people have this physical resonance in their
substrates that can be so strong that their mental representations start to resonate and go out of
vague in the same way and if you also notice this with I say mothers and babies I have sequences of
pictures of my wife and the baby looking exactly in the same direction having the same facial
expressions this out looking at each other over a longer period of time it's quite interesting
and it's very tempting to think what happens when she holds that baby is that they're physically
resonates so much that their mental states interact I mean that baby did also come from her like for
a while their identities were entangled yes but their nervous systems are no longer physically
connected right so they're not looking at each other yeah so they're basically integrated information
over each other in such a way that their mental states get synchronized to a large degree and this
is also what mothers very often report that they basically feel what the baby is feeling and now the
question is how much can you take them apart without that phenomenon completely breaking down
and so the idea here would be that if you have people in the same room without physically touching
each other it's still possible for them to have that degree of a certain degree of synchronization
so you can feel the emotions of other people in the room without even looking at them and it could
also work outside of the room as long as there is enough information crossing physically between
the bodies of these people in such a way that it eventually can be interpreted
they were siblings that have never met each other but they named their their dog the same
this is another interesting phenomenon but this suggests that there is a lot more determinism
in the the structure of the phenotype based on genetic heritage and I think that's
it's probably a sample of environment and individuals who basically to name give the dog
the same name they also go up in the same culture yeah but even given the same culture they're
seeking out the same stimuli yeah the point that I would add to that is when you have a shared
ecosystem that's essentially a shared language you're sharing the same alphabet and grammar you're
sharing you know what we're all doing right now right for example is there are these noises coming
out of our mouths okay all right these noises don't necessarily have an inherent meaning
we have a shared hallucination a shared agreement that this means this and that's yeah what is your
question no my question to that that point is that is would you agree that you can very much if you
have people um had different points in space and time have enough similarity in their their timeline
of things that they do that they could essentially be synchronized they're not physically linked to
each other with the both but they're actually you know abstractly doing the same thing because
there's enough similarities that's why if you spend enough time with somebody adding to their points
you start to think like each other or you share you're sharing an abstracted structure together
in the way that you communicate things and think about things you do that long enough
and then then you get these things called cultures where everybody in this clip when you create a
category or a group correct you're creating a shared perception of reality in front of you
that's by nature separate from some other perception of reality to another group
and how do you get those ones into a category here how do you get those groups a and b to be
synchronized even though they're different i think a culture does not mean that people think the same
thing so maybe you could say they do but then it's a different thing from people naming their dog the
same or people having the same emotion at the same time despite doing different things and being in
separate rooms right these are different phenomena and i i think it makes sense to treat them a
separate phenomena and describe them with a separate terminology because a culture can exist
there's very different individuals that don't agree in the perception of the world but they
are complementary in some way and can meaningfully interface with each other interact with each other
and that's not the same thing as thinking the same
so earlier you were talking about your your experience
would you characterize that as like going back to earlier when you characterize
the six plus the zero level of consciousness would you characterize that as like another
level of that and if so why does it not naturally occur for most people and it requires training
typically you only pay attention for the things that don't work and the parts of your mind that
don't work don't attract your attention that work don't attract your attention so the reason
why most interesting people had interesting childhoods is because don't get attention in things
that always work for you you don't question your personality you don't question your interactions
with the environment if they work and if your instincts constantly fail you you might be forced
to reconsider the entire architecture of reality in some sense that's my own story and i guess the
story of many scientists that i'm born with worse priors than most people and we see born much more
stupid than the average person and as a result i needed to put attention on building a model of
reality that worked for me whereas other people don't have that need i noticed this when i gave
it a TEDx talk and MIT asked me to prepare this with the local toast masters a group with normal
real people instead of crazy MIT students that i normally had in my class and they
gave me very different feedback than MIT students would have given me the first one was
you need to speak more slowly you need to reduce the rate of ideas by a factor of about at least 30
second you need to explain why this is what this is good for why would you need to understand
consciousness that's this happy to cure cancer but solve depression right and that is a very
interesting thing most people don't have that issue there is no need to solve consciousness
because it works right why would you need to figure out what that is and it's only when you feel
oh my god i'm born into a monkey and in this kind of universe and you might disagree with your
government but i fact myself disagree with the entire universe what's going on here why am i
uploaded into a monkey now that's the same verb
and so you basically need to get attention or something that's a mismatch between how things
are and how things should be and all your attention arises over disagreements with how the universe
works so attention is all you need
yeah so the thing that currently interests me most is how can we make progress on understanding
these questions more productively and an issue that i found while i was working in academia
especially while i was in germany was that students were super interested in all this stuff and
i was studying mostly AI but also all the other subject that was interested in and then
students asked me where we can we actually i have actual AI lectures because we got lectures in
machine learning or case-based reasoning but not in artificial intelligence and so i realized
oh we need to re-read society of mind and the PRJ and cognitive architectures and put our own
curriculum and most of that was stuff that was more as form and there were a few people
busy in the field of AI that were still working on those questions and it was not because these
questions are not interesting but because most people agreed that you will not be able to resolve
them in this space of grand proposal and so when i proposed working on topics like understanding
agency and about the agent paradigm and so on it was always the question what is the thing that you
can answer within the time frame of one and a half or maybe three years because otherwise that's
not findable and the same thing is that tenure positions are built around series of such projects
and so i realized that all the professorships that were open to me that i was offered was things like
a semantic map or cognitive robotics and so on and i felt semantic map is going to go away
by what you want to undertake semantic this xml that's going to be a non-issue in a few years from
now right and it was but at the time because it was a fashionable topic you could get a job
doing this and i guess there's still professors working on this stuff because they got a job for
this and at the same time many of the topics that we are interested in the practice intro
science are not being worked on and how can we create spaces and methodologies to do
paradigmatic work in this region and i suspect if you want to work on consciousness you currently
cannot do it in neuroscience most neuroscience is actually not curious about how this works
and because they don't have methodology to address it it's not even a very scientific notion for them
in ditto and psychology right it's that's a very big issue to me because it is a question if i think
we can make progress on and then you have to work on but how would you actually do this how can we
develop a methodology and terminology and so on and a discipline to actually need to work on it
and so at the moment i suspect that we need to create some institution similar to Santa Fe Institute
for complexity science for studying consciousness and the computational paradigm that is integrating
over neuroscience and psychology and AI and philosophy and is taking ideas from all these
fields but it's not committing to any of the existing methodologies because they are all
