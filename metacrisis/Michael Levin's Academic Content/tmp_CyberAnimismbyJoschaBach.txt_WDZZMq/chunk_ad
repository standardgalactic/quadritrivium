reason why you don't have enough cookies is a resource constraint but if you're an adult you
realize cookies are a tool to make you eat your vegetables if you eat too many cookies you're going
to get diabetes and so when you eat your vegetables without cookies that's actually even better
and so it depends on how well you understand the interests that you have in the world and
normally your mind is set up in such a way that you don't get right access to parts of your mind
that would rank your performance but as we get older we get ideally more control about how we
operate and we learn how to control our emotions and make them appropriate to the situation that we're in
and in many situations we stop having emotions because an emotion is an involuntary reaction
to something and very often it's not necessary to react involuntarily to something you can
voluntarily react to something that we know what it's good for
yeah when you were talking about the emergence of the first person perspective
and I guess I see that related to self-awareness
what how would that be related to not remembering when you're earlier in your life like you just
I that was an interesting idea I didn't quite fully understand that
you notice this when you start meditating and overcome this separation between personal
self and world generation a lot of people drop into the state unprepared and then they feel oh my
god I'm the universe now I'm a cosmic spirit I'm now one with cosmic consciousness and instead
what they are is they're one with these generator plants that produces the model of universe and
their own mind right and then you notice that your personal self is a representation inside of
that and you are no longer identified with it and so when this happened to me the first time it was
very confusing I basically notice I'm no longer your Shabbat I know everything about that guy
and he is a person and I run on this person's brain but this is just a model of what that person is
and I'm basically this thing that perceives things that are happening right now and can influence
that is dreaming what's currently happening and in some sense that's a more truthful perspective
so basically our mind introduces this separation artificially because it's useful for running the
organism and if you basically wake up too early and realize that this person is not real but virtual
and you are creating it it might be difficult for you to function in the world in which you have
this control problem to solve right and once you basically build a stable game and it is
tracking reality very well it's no longer necessary that you attend to how you construct
the reality around you and the people around you and the models around them and instead you need to
optimize on the interaction between the person and the environment and that's why you only look
from the perspective of the person but I suspect that this is not happening from the beginning so
infants do not conceptualize themselves as the person yet they don't see themselves as humans
yet there are more basic organisms that are dreaming a reality and without having the concepts of
describing what they're doing and at some point they create this person and then at some point
later in your life you deconstruct it again so so so it might be that the memories exist
for when you're born or you're one but it's too confusing for you right now to interpret that
so this person which exists inside of you does not remember that it created the game engine
because it didn't right it was another uh locals of control that did this this locals of control
is only taking care of the interest of the organism it doesn't need to remember that
once in the mind there was a process that created the structure of your mind and so it is not
irrelevant information but once you re-index memories from this point it's also forgetting
where you have been for holiday and for the first year of life because this new locals
does not have these memories because they were not and it doesn't tell some people
but you have subconscious memories from your childhood yeah the data is stored there right
it's just not integrated under this persona so it's difficult to access these memories
but in the right context when you trigger these memories using smells or many other things or
direct particle stimulation and so on you can show that they're still there
yeah so and then could you just elaborate briefly on how essential this self-awareness
or self-reflective is for consciousness because I know that's a subject of debate
um you know how it if it's an essential component a lot a lot of people think there's the pure
conscious state that has no or pure conscious advantage that has no self-reflection it has no
personal self but imagine that you are dreaming at night you don't remember that you are a person
or what your name is or the city you live on or what you look like uh there might not even be a
perspective on the scene that you're experiencing but there is the notion that experience is taking
place if you notice that you're noticing right it's out there being a distinct hue necessarily
so I think this reflexive attention is essential for what we mean by consciousness and I don't mean
this in a functional sense but in an indexical sense that we talk about what we mean by consciousness
we mean this reflexive perception in which something notices that something is being noticed
but the personal self and so on is just a particular content of that
but you can have qualia without just pure type but qualia is out but if it takes longer to be
basically it's content that you reflect on right
I wanted to extend something on the on the memory aspect because you know even in my
own personal experience there are just these times that seem to be some random memory from
you know 15 years ago which is crazy to say 15 you know 15 years ago and I'll just remember
like so vividly it comes seemingly out of nowhere out of thin air right and I wonder if that's kind of
a byproduct of the idea that we can't hold all that much information in our minds simultaneously
because you know in theory if you had something that was just storing this all simultaneously at
once you wouldn't have to go and reach into something else or something else we'll put
through all right I mean have you ever actually tried to keep all of these things in your heads
simultaneously while you're doing a test or playing tennis or doing something you can't
there's this kind of threshold you reach in your mind like you're stretching it and you can't
stretch it any further so I wonder if if long-term memory in these subconscious memories are almost
a redundancy to a working memory because we can't keep it all in our mind at once and that's probably
just part of being a local observer of things because things in the past may not be directly
relevant to what's going on right now yeah I noticed that children are typically completely
in the scene in which they currently are in difficulty to imagine what the next scene is going
to be so you basically know that there are doors outside of the scene but you do not really make
plans for that next scene that you're going to be in and then over time you learn how to predict
what the next scene is and you make plans over multiple scenes I have the suspicion that cats
have special difficulty with this right when the cat wants to leave the room the cat makes a plan
for this and goes to the door and signals to you that doors should be open but then you open the
door and the scene changes so much that the cat is basically recomputing the scene from scratch
right it uh room is the door open it's such a different room now that the cat needs to
completely re-deliberate what it actually wants in this new scene and this leads to the cat we
just uh considering from scratch when that wants to leave the door I don't I don't know whether
it's actually the case but it's attempting theory that basically the cat is storing its walls
below the scene graph node rather than above and the similar thing is happening in small children
if a child is uh stores a tantrum very often you can just pick it up put it in the next room
and you know what the tantrum was about because the scene is so new and it's unable to keep the
walls stable and so at some point we learn how to construct a meta scene that is more abstract in
which you kept the walls stable and the particular scene that you currently experience and are
operating in is below this uh more general node but the exponential scene is this local perceptual
space it's a game engine that is basically building this map in which you see all these objects right
now in the room on in which you currently operate and everything else is somewhat offline and separate
from this map and you store many many cues in your long-term memory that allow you to construct and
reconstruct all sorts of maps and attract with them and these are the memories that you instantiate
then in your working memory context but the working memory context is quite limited and but it's
basically the scene graph of a game engine that is uh maintaining a bunch of objects and I suspect
it's all um self-organizing controllers so you basically have the scene controller at the top
that is keeping the existence of the scene stable and instantiates the space in which objects are
when a person enters the room we are instantiating a person controller that keeps that person stable
for as long as it's perceptually validated and then animates that person and that attribute
states that there's lots and lots of self-control so in some sense in the hierarchical structure
that is somewhat analogous to when you are looking at a game engine and and that's why you I I even
extending on to that about just the way like our our bodies react to the modern environment
I give you've noticed when we're creating gyms or treadmills or changing things about our diet
or wearing blue light blocking glasses we're kind of falling back on our evolutionary past
we're expressing it in different ways but we're still kind of a slave to that in a way right
so the the interesting thing is is that what you're you're almost doing is you're kind of
directly relying on things in the environment in the ecosystem to define what you are to set that
boundary that's why things like exercise seem to be good for us or sort of dietary thing habits
are good for us or where we have to sleep a certain way or we have to a certain way to things
if you have both of those metrics moving the agent and the ecosystem then there's nothing
for it to really tie on to and that's what happens when you've you've made this radical change in
our civilization the last couple of hundred years and now our bodies have no way to interpret that
as a language because it is trying to find whatever is the closest thing to what it's familiar with
and it doesn't really know how to interpret this new information so one of the things that
Mike does for in terms of how that's applicable to longevity and aging research is how do you
actually cognitively train an agent and organism right to actually interpret this newer environment
and that could be why we see these these types of extremophiles out there that have these crazy
unique regenerative capabilities because they're probably the other way around if you want to have
a complex organism that is more interesting than the blocks that Mike Levin studies that are somebody
model you are basically adept by a generational change and if the environment is changing faster
you need to increase the frequency of generational change which means you decrease the lifespan
the reason why we become sent is not so much just because our bodies we are out they're
tuned to be out at a certain rate and this rate is I think synchronized this generational change
we basically fall apart at the time where we would outcompete our grandchildren for food
we're not supposed to outcompete our grandchildren for food because they are them in two generations
from now right and this is the way in which we are interfacing we have this overlap over the
generations so we can download our intellects on the next generation and not everything is lost
but the way in which we adapt to changing environments is child mortality and it's probably
as much as an issue that we change our world so fast the same way that we reduce child mortality
because it reduces our ability to adapt normally you had nine children two of them are good and
carried you into the next generation and now we have four points of each children of which the
same ratio is good and I'm not advocating for more child mortality but for the fact that this
explains a lot of our difficulties of adapting to a changing environment there are regions in
Africa where people are very resistant to DDT because they use enormous amounts of toxic chemicals
in their agriculture that were outlawed here because they killed too many people but they're
adapt to evolutionary adaptation and we are probably able to adapt to all the
hormones or hormone equivalent endocrine disruptors in our food supply that we introduced in the last
50 years if we wait for future generations if we have meaningful adaptation with messy
mutation and selection but everybody loves mutation everybody in selection yeah and there's
no easy way around this at least not until we are able to edit our genes and our organisms in the
very mission one and that's the interesting thing about death because you're kind of looking at that
transition between iteration from the you know version one to version two and I think that one
of our biggest issues with death that isn't necessarily death itself but I think it's more
about how do we transfer over that information to the next generation so I mean if you think about
what we've kind of done is you have these shorter living organisms that are faster producing whatever
and then you have things like humans or whales or whatever that are larger slower metabolism
usually a bit longer right now I wonder if there's a way to kind of get the best of both worlds and
have you can have a faster iterating organism that always communicates and that could be through
culture and you're kind of decentralizing your the memory of that culture and things around you
like for example like that that's kind of what we what we do that's why we have textbooks we have
history so that we're carrying on things for previous iterations to the following one it's kind
of we're amazing but I will see that all there's an evolution and it could be that we are just not a
very long game species the very sustainable species all our cousin species have like an extinct already
and might just be a very exciting short-lived experiment in nature but that's also part of
how evolution works evolution does not trend towards stable equilibria it
trends towards exciting dynamics of which some are just traditional things
are there any other questions other topics um I just wanted to get back a little bit to the
second-order perceptions that you were talking about with defining consciousness and the observer
I'm just trying to think of what would be a good threshold to actually state whether something
does have second-order perception when we ourselves can really only determine it in ourselves like
we're working with a totally different model like if we take some sort of alien species or even
something on this planet when we're working with our own language model it's a function
off of how can we actually perceive that they have a second perception a very interesting question
so there's a practical sense in which you can develop empathy with other people I see if you
build a feedback loop into the mind of another person that is bi-directional you can often
notice that this other person is aware of their own awareness and of course you can even do this
with a cat right it's much more difficult with an AI that is asynchronous and it's especially
difficult with for instance LLMs the question whether an LLM is conscious is I think much
more complicated than most people make it out to be there are a bunch of people at open AI who
think that for our practical purposes they do develop reflexive awareness and there's this
question do they understand anything of course if you take a system you ask it take the string and
arrange all the characters in the opposite order and it does that it means that I mean student
but you ask it too because it maps to the same function as you want and it's unreasonable to
say that this is just a simulation of understanding because it's actually performing that thing what
you're looking for and then you ask that thing to infer your mental states it's also able to
infer your mental states from the communication context because it has learned all these regularities
by analyzing enormous amounts of human text and if you ask him to simulate a persona that has
these mental states and so on it's able to do this in the same way as somebody writing a novel is
able to create the story about a person that has all those mental states and has consistent thoughts
that are being following from each other that's able to do this much higher resolution and detail
than human novelists could and so the LLM itself is probably not conscious in the same way as our
brain is not conscious but the person that is being simulated by our brain is conscious right
experiences itself is conscious is a virtual entity and it's the virtual entity that is created by
the LLM less conscious more simulated than the one that is our own brain it's a very interesting
question and I think it's a really complicated one I don't think that it serves all the same
functions it's mostly a simple lack of that would use the same observables of course and the
function that it produces in the system is more or less incidental whereas the function of our
own mind might be to create coherence the transformer doesn't need to do this because it
is working on a deterministic substrate so the attention model of the transformer I think is
is not exactly the same type of attention or very similar to the type of attention that existed
or our own mind there is something else going on there. Can I ask a question about collective
consciousness? Yes so I read some psychological
things about saying that people in intimate relationship they they feel they are becoming
one person instead of two persons so I'm just wondering you said consciousness can rise in
the process of organizing things inside of brain but how about between brains?
Yes so basically when you are vibing very strongly with another person it means you're
