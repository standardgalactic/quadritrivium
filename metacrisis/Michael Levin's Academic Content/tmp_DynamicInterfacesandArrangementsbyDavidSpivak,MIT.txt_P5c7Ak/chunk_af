it and like that's kind of rude to compliment your own thing but this really isn't my thing polynomial
functions have been studying studied by mathematicians for a really long time and it's they're
considered well not really long say 40 years and they're considered really beautiful and well
functioning and all that's new here is that I think they can be useful outside of pure math
in a field like morphology so this sort of thing can account for everything from control
theory to deep learning but I think it can account for much more I think even though I don't have the
account it's an accounting system for for things I'm seeing in your guys work
so if it if that's right then it would let us talk coherently and precisely about the stuff I've
been saying like changing interfaces and dynamics and how things communicate and how those communication
patterns change as information is exchanged so I've heard some talk about anatomical compilers
the thing is that compilers aren't free right they're a ton of work you write something in a
high-level language and it's reduced into machine code and but yet you want to be able to debug
and you can because you can you can look deeply into the trouble spots you can kind of zoom in there
and that works because the code structure is really precise language like math like
python based on c based on assembly based on machine code
based on transistors is like all super well understood and the language is like mathematically
precise so everything has been composed modularly and so I think that polynomial
functions they can account for the stuff in computers but I'm aiming it at living systems
things that can change their wiring diagram where like I want to be able to offer this same
level of the same high fidelity language ability but to a more interesting case namely you know
protein folding and ways that things change based on what's going on like if I'm near hydrophobic
if I'm near this chaperone thingy my protein folds this way and if I'm near that enzyme my
protein folds that way how the interaction affects the positions of the protein so I'm
proposing this math as like some something like maybe it'll work as some kind of anatomical
programming language I don't have any idea what the program should be that would be more like the
account and I don't have a tool you can even use so it's really or at a very basic level here but
if it's interesting to you I'm claiming though that like I'm going to hold the position and be
able to convince you as we continue that the math is really elegant and articulate and my hope is
that one day it could be a ground I guess is a little stronger than I mean but I think it will
be but I'm betting that's what this talk is this talk is a bet that it will be could be a ground
for computational biology so to summarize applied category theory which is what I'm using in the
background here is for tracking interlocking structures like formalizing analogies it's not
about how much of something there is it's about how it's arranged what the structures are and this
sort of thing has been useful in quantum information theory so people use it in like the
in quantum compiler a state-of-the-art stuff computer science math material science linguistics
physics but in each case it's not focusing so much on the numerics or the analysis but more on
like the structural questions and I'm interested in the structure of interacting dynamical systems
how we interact right here on zoom how we can change how we're interacting you know by disconnecting
turning the speaker off based on on what's flowing between us and again I don't have these
specifics but I have this accounting system of polynomial functions that accounts for dynamic
arrangements and my claim is that I think it might be useful as a framework for morphology and
behavior and I'd like to prove that well it would be cool if one day we could prove that by
building an anatomical compiler I think that'd be a lot of fun so that's that's it thanks
very cool thank you for the presentation I guess oh I have a like a needier question
what I guess the benefit of something like this is your claim that it's it's beautiful and
mathematically pretty nice as compared to something like temporal network theory which already aims to
do something like talking about how networks of interactions change as a function of time
so like that I would say that field especially applied to biology is you know attempting to answer
I think similar questions than this is like what would be the the benefit of using something like
this rather than something like that or with or would network temporal network theory give you
the model that you would then put your thing on top that's what you're gonna say isn't it
yeah that's what I'm gonna say yeah I'm guessing that temporal network theory which I had not
heard of before you mentioned it would be the sort of like given some sort of account that you could
put on top of this okay what this is is um there might be some other theory that isn't temporal
network theory but that also explains how networks are formed I don't know uh but that both of them
would fit into this accounting system and is there any way this system you really need to have
an idea of how something is working ahead of time I couldn't use this for example to figure out
could you somehow use this backwards start from here to drive new hypotheses that I could
experimentally test or that we could computationally test yeah so what I do what I do is I um
I have certain guesses about you know about free will or something I don't know about about how
what could it mean that I'm able to take my experience and turn it into language and that
language can affect somebody what is it like what is this translation system or I have certain
ideas about something so let's suppose that we were hanging out and you had certain ideas about
something then what this would do is kind of keep you on guard rails so that like the things you
were saying I could like write them down and and I would have questions for you like wait
do these two things could they always happen at the same time or is there like it feels like
from what you're saying there should be or the math is saying that like something is missing right
here and you'd say oh that is a good point um and and so that that sort of thing is how it would help
more on like making sure that your ideas stay on the rails as you as you explain them okay
it's not generative it's except yeah it's not generating new hypotheses for you it's checking
that your hypotheses type check if you know what I mean by that yeah no that makes sense that that
tracks so one nice thing about this mathematical framework is that it could be used to understand
how the wiring can change right the how how the arrangements can change so in that perspective
it could be used as a nice tool to understand norphogenesis where we start again as a nice as a
way as a nice tool to understand norphogenesis right so like you start with this fixed set of
components and in biological norphogenesis things can rearrange themselves and this is a great tool
to understand such a phenomenon but I wonder if it could also be used to understand development
where things start from a single cell and it can grow into a very complicated structure so what changes
there is also the number of polynomials the numbers of p and q so I feel like there must be
to explain that kind of phenomenon you would also need a meta polynomial or a functional
of sorts it can generate a new polynomial itself like a new entity like a new variable do you think
it is mathematically possible or the mathematical tools to do something like this yeah so what this
gets to is when you which interface like where you draw your boundaries so what actually would be
happening there is that you would have this cell and you would also have um phosphates and calcium's
and uh what else sodiums and carbons in your environment and this cell would start to use
its little flippers to flap around and like start to eat these things and as it did um
like the number of of the amount of stuff in the world is not changing you're just not considering
you know the carbon atom over there to be another one of your polynomials but actually we need to
for that to work and so the things that you know the mother eats in order to have the baby
inside of her there's some arrangement happening that creates the baby and then there's this
separation event but that separation event is in terms of the amount of material there it's
actually the same it's where you draw the boundaries so you know the the like the abortion question
or something is like you know is asking where we draw the boundaries and when we draw those
boundaries and that that is not something the math tells you but I don't yet know of why
why we draw boundaries the way we do except that it helps us compute
approximations or guesses about how things will behave so in terms of the math you really can't
see the difference between a cell and a bunch of like when it divides it's really just a point of
view that you instead of grouping p1 and p2 together using the tensor product and thinking
of it as one thing we've thought of it as two different things um does that make sense yeah so
so I guess I guess uh there's a sort of constraint required that's something like conservation of
mass or something like that so your q should the square the outermost square should consider
something inside it yeah and there might be other things that are interacting with q and and why we
drew the boundary around q in terms of the ship of thesius we might uh if you know that parable
so like we we put a different plank in the ship and then a different plank and we change the steering
wheel or whatever um well is it still the same q I mean there might be like pq might have some
wire out to some other steering wheel over here and come back in because we didn't use we used to
not consider that steering wheel to be part of q and now we do and so the what you count as the
right um interface might change through time like you might say uh you know I've been tracking this
for a while and now what I was calling my interface is this all wrong a bunch of those
cells have left this the society and a bunch of new cells have entered and I want to regroup
and say this is my interface now um so that sort of activity of how you group things is not um
is something that feels like an open question to me let's see yeah I wonder how it um if you
talk to a physicist about it I'm not sure if you have how they might take it because their view of
life is it's like life is a non-equilibrium system which always exchange this matter of energy with
the environment so things are always in flux and things need not be conserved over time like even
mass or whatever so I think physicists view that as as a central part of what defines
of what characterizes life so yeah I don't know they allow themselves to like think of the body
they don't have to think of the body as like eating or maybe you're saying they do but I think like
there's a lot that they may be uh statistically defying if that's a word um making statistical
that this is like the statistics are not in this model yet the fact that like we have a million
things flowing in and a million things flowing out and statistically they're aggregated like this
um this is a much more kind of um simulation sort of model where you you actually have to
watch the things going in and out statistically yeah there could be a statistical theory on top
of this that like physics would be more something like a probabilistic category theory or something
like that and there is probabilistic category theory but it's not incorporated in this yet
I see let me continue this line of thing
I definitely see how this kind of view and theory is working well in neural network for example
on um mechanical systems are determined they are much much more deterministic
my my feeling again I'm not biologist I'm more computer scientist but my feeling
in biologists that there's some level of it and I'm not sure what caused to that kind of
phenomena but in some level things are not deterministic as they think they are they are
much more probabilistic manner to which process happened and which process not happened termed in
nuance in the brain or nervous system nuance can spontaneously spike and no one really know
why they trigger to be spiking and and they can spike to an input in one time and another
than doesn't spike to the same input and and so and again I'm not sure if it's really the
measurement issue or or there are or it's really a statistical probabilistic system
and not deterministic as it is and I think that something is missing here in order to
determine or to describe biology system in that in that ways yeah I don't think it is I think
this will work fine what's going on in in that is it so in the in let's talk about the neuron
quickly and then move on to just more general case the internal state of the neuron effects
whether it fires based on the input or not so that's certainly here we don't it's a feature of this
that these are dynamical systems which mean they're not completely just functions they're
functions with an internal state and so if I if you know the RNA and my neuron is different now
than it was or if something's going on in terms of how healthy the cell is or whatever's going on
some internal state of the cell which is a very complex living being that could easily affect
whether the inputs cause it to spike or not so that's in this model but then there's also just
the noise question about probability and so what that looks like is if you have some some
let's say you have a probability of one sixth there's something six six of those
you could imagine a limit cycle a dynamical system going in through a limit cycle
and it's going around and around and it's outputting one you know it's outputting
one two three four five six one two three or it's outputting some crazy you know take a
random number generator a pseudo random number generator and that's a dynamical system just
run that thing through time now now depending on where it is you might not have access because
it's going too fast it's like a dice running around but now now you hit it with an input and
the exact moment you hit oops the exact moment you hit it with the input it flows that way
so it's moving around and around and you hit boom it flows that way right so it would look
stochastic if you didn't have access to where you were in the limit cycle exactly so it looks
stochastic but even even diffusion reactions in simulation that they are stochastic you
cannot return to the same position every time so that's not stochastic in that sense and most
biology work exactly like that but I mean at least in the level that I'm I'm dealing with
my claim is that for any probabilistic or stochastic or random or noise field system
my claim that I would have to defend and I have not proven but my claim that I would try to defend
is that I could find some dynamical system where if you didn't have access to the internal state
you would see it as acting randomly or noisefully in that way and that the behavior of the total
system when you receive that noise input would be the one that you were expecting
you also mentioned that this framework is not generative is more for model checking
is that right because I feel like you could also use it as a generative model I mean it's really
it could be really powerful in that way well maybe you could tell me about that because I would
prefer to be able to say it's generative well like you mentioned you know there's rails so if I think
something is going to work like x and it I think it's going to work like y according to this you
know this operation should be possible and I should be able to look for that somehow it's
generated in that sense that it's making you triple check your theory and potentially building
no you're right you're right like a new experimental hypothesis like when you when you
make the constraints called basketball then you get to see basketball getting played
and you made no constraints there's just 10 guys or whatever on a on a field you wouldn't get to see
the interesting stuff so this does keep you on certain rails and gives you certain rules and
regulations that enables certain things and not others yeah yeah and it might be rules and regulations
that hadn't been considered right so in that sense it's generative okay yeah if that makes
Santosh is not what you're thinking yeah exactly it's not like small world graphs or whatever
networks where you know it's like here's how the internet gets formed or something there's
something in it that isn't producing hypotheses it's more because the rails are really you know
tightly because it's very articulate you can you get to move in certain ways and not others
that generates things and checks your new philosophy or whatever yeah there's something
that it doesn't do that I don't really know how to say yet I guess so at the end of the day
it is a mathematical model right and which means that you have a set of axioms and perhaps a set
of initial conditions and if you have these two you can always generate that prediction
by composing the the relations over and over you get an article I think that's what any
dynamical model would do and the way I understand it at least so far it looks to me it's it's like
a very general dynamical model with the general operations that's right yeah so from that perspective
the only thing is if we use such a such a model is is it learnable or is it evolvable that's I
think that's a very different kind of question traditional neural networks this could be a
special case of this and they are learnable slash evolvable because of the mathematical
properties of the arithmetic operators they are differentiable and that that kind of makes it
learnable in a specific sense yeah are these operators differentiable or these operators
learnable is something I think that's a very different question and that's maybe interesting
when you have research as well I don't know
yeah yeah I don't know where where the kind of gradient descent level
you know idea about how life could exist or something is going to come from
like how you're gonna how one would find something as you know that you can just run
like gradient descent algorithms but but yeah I think I mainly agree with what you said and
