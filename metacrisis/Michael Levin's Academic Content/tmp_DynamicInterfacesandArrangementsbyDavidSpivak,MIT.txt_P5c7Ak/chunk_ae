of how information passes between interfaces.
That's the arrangement.
So this yellow stuff here.
We can make it much more general where there's no perfect wires but in fact P is kind of
information, you know, has some noise in the way that it gets to all these different other
guys.
We can also make the information sharing change so that like who's connected to who can change
in time and all of that will be written in terms of polynomial functors.
So we'll have these polynomials P1 through P5, these interfaces here, we have this interface
Q and what's called a natural transformation in category theory will encode this arrangement.
So interfaces will be polynomials and natural transformations will be what are called natural
transformations.
The category theory will be called will correspond to or denote or account for arrangements.
So I told you that an arrangement is a natural transformation but that's a category theory
word and I'm not even expecting you to have any idea about so why am I doing that?
I'm again just trying to show you kind of what the math looks like and how it feels.
Yeah.
So what I'm talking about is about interfaces and how you manipulate them, arrange them,
nest them, how interfaces have outputs and inputs, they're captured as polynomials which
aren't supposed to be thought of as functions but as data structures and then we can manipulate
these polynomials to like get new interfaces, get new arrangements, get new dynamics, all
from the old ones and now that I'm like here I'm kind of wondering I don't know whether
to just blow through these slides and like I'm wondering if I do do a part two how I'll
like kind of skip right to this part without like reminding you everything up to it.
So well I think right before the next one we could either I mean we'll just take a look
at the recording or you could have one or two slides before the next one just to remind
us.
I think it's okay.
Okay well then maybe I'll stop here.
I cannot wait to see the end I want to see the rest right now but I'll leave it to the
rest.
Well I mean if there is enough interest I could do it now what should we I don't know.
It's fine as long as there's a few people staying keep going and then you can have a
discussion and then I'll keep the recording on and then everybody else can do it.
All right let's let's just do that and if we want to do meet again one day we'll figure
that out.
Okay so I'll just keep going then I'll just go at the same pace approximately and just
people who want to leave just will leave and if there's zero people left I'm going to stop.
Okay so right so we've got all these arrangements and these the dynamics and the interfaces so
we're looking at this thing suppose you had a dynamical system in each of these p's in
each of these interfaces this dynamical system was out was in a current state it's outputting
some position along these wires so I so something is visible to the outside world and those
visible things arrive to other dynamical systems as like part of their input so it's seeing
p2 is seeing what p1 is doing and it's hearing something from the outside world and maybe
it's like got an echo of its own it kind of hears itself somehow.
And then so what arrives affects the internal state so if you're sad and you see something
you're affected and become into a new state whereas if you're happy you might go into
a different new state even though the input was exactly the same so that's a dynamical
system it's a discrete dynamical system we could also be using ordinary continuous dynamical
systems or systems of ODE's the math works either way so I mean it's slightly different
map but the same sort notion of arrangement and dynamical system and interface are all
persisting through that change so yeah so that's what this is a picture of.
Mathematically a dynamical system is a natural transformation from one thing set of states
s y to the s some weird polynomial s y to the s to p to your interface and again what
is a natural transformation I have not told you why is it s y to the s I haven't told you
but what I have told you is that like whether we're talking about dynamics like this stuff
or we're talking about interfaces or we're talking about arrangements we're all going
to be doing it in terms of these polynomial functors and the natural transformation between
them so we can compose so I'm saying the math is working I'm not proving that to you I'm
just claiming it but then I'm saying that if we had a dynamical system each of these
we would get a dynamical system in this whole thing by a kind of variable sharing formula
that says like well this guy's outputs become this guy's inputs and we're just we're just
going to take the states of all of them and kind of put them all together to get the states
of this big system so given a dynamical system an open dynamical system that's able to change
based on inputs in each of these five things and given this arrangement we will get a dynamical
system in Q so this is the last math slide I want to think about dynamics a little bit
more so we were talking about operations you can do on polynomials so a dynamical system
on P plus Q as some set of states and for every state it's either outputting a P output
or it's outputting a Q output and then it receives the sensorium some some sensation
or force or whatever in that in whatever position it was in so if it's exhibiting caterpillar
behavior then it's receiving some caterpillar input and when it's outputting butterfly behavior
it's receiving some butterfly input a dynamical system on this interface P times Q is outputting
both I haven't seen this one as useful so you might not find it that useful or maybe
you have a really great case of this it's kind of it's outputting both P and Q so imagine
you can see both the P and the Q at the same time this is no longer butterfly caterpillar
I don't know what it would be it's outputting both at the same time but you're only allowed
to send it one or the other and why am I making that rule because I'm literally multiplying
the polynomials and telling you what it does when you when you multiply polynomials it
literally receives kind of a plus upstairs in the exponent whereas there's another
operation on polynomials that no one's ever heard of outside of like some math areas called the
Dirichlet product where you multiply exponents instead of adding them so you have two polynomials
and lo and behold you can like do this weird thing where y to the third tensor y to the fourth is y
to the 12th and that sort of machine that sort of interface a dynamical system there will be
outputting both output of P and an output of Q and receiving both at the same time so it's kind
of like you've got legs and you've got arms and so you can output a leg position and you can output
an arm position and you can feel what's happening on your leg and you can feel what's happening on
your arm and that that is what P tensor Q does as an interface and P composed Q as an interface will
be dynamical system that outputs a P and a strategy for whatever input you get on P what Q it will
output so that's way more like a protocol that you might find in like in like how you connect to
the internet or something like that not so much an animal that I know of but it'd be pretty interesting
if you could find this in an animal some kind of it might be in the cerebellum if I had to guess
anywhere where like you have prescriptions for hitting a tennis ball or something that are like
your state is not going to get is going to go through like P and then like a strategy of moving
through P then Q based on based on stuff but it's very kind of ballistic or something so that's
what I think P composed Q might be and then the last one that the last operation I think is important
that I haven't told you anything about is what's called the internal harm and what this dynamic
a dynamical system on this will do is it will output arrangements from P that put P inside of Q
so this thing is an interface for arranging little guys inside of a big guy so this thing
is a new polynomial I haven't told you the formula for it but just like you can add polynomials and
tensor polynomials and multiply polynomials and compose polynomials you can do this operation
to them and when you run a dynamical system on this polynomial interface what it does is it outputs
positions for the P1 through P5 inside of the Q sorry outputs arrangements meaning it outputs how
they are connecting how they're receiving from each other and what it inputs is what's flowing
between them so like the the current what I've output here has determined what I'm seeing of you
guys and so the arrangement is using my output like this machine is like zoom is this sort of thing
zoom where these five people or however many there are in this meeting here Q is the external
interface of zoom and like the way we're sending each other data is the current arrangement and
zoom is a dynamical system that takes our outputs like what I say like hey zoom please update to
mute my microphone and it decides based on what flows whether to change the arrangement or not
so like me saying that did not work but if I press a button it will work and change how my information
is flowing to you guys so zoom is one of these things controlling how we're talking to each
other and I feel like probably in the you know it's been a while since I've watched
uh you guys talks but um I feel like somewhere in the tadpole there's gonna be something like
this happening maybe there's an electric field that's kind of affecting the arrangement so like
that's the sort of place that that would live so in terms of yeah sorry can can you go back
real quick I want to make sure that I understand like I guess when you have p plus q you can have
things switching between p mode and q mode and I guess would in a could an arrangement help govern
that as well yeah um well are you saying like I'm thinking of this p as itself sometimes having
like two inputs and one output and sometimes having three inputs and five outputs or something
and that's controlled by the arrangements here sorry that's controlled by the okay of p
that would be controlled by the internal state of this one switching among these guys
but now okay the arrangement might be sending p something that says like hey p go into butterfly
mode um you know um morpho morphologically sends it some signal that says hey stem cell move into
being an adult cell or something it permanently changes its interface because of what it received
okay okay so it switched just a dynamical system that sometimes is in p and sometimes in q
mode but because of what it received through the arrangement with its other with the other cells
in this soup uh it received a signal that permanently put it in q mode say okay that that
helped uh that helps clarify the what I was thinking through okay cool thank you and as it sends out
some new signal the arrangement itself might learn that p is kind of fixed there and like start to like
develop new neural connections or sever connections or whatever and that severing that thing that's
deciding the arrangement of all these guys is living in this um this operation you can do to
polynomials so there's some interface that controls this yellow this orange stuff here
okay so um digital circuits for example and control systems fit neatly into this
formalism so a computer is a nested arrangement of dynamical systems you can take two transistors
and get an AND gate you can wire them together through and you get an OR gate you know you split
this and you get a NOT gate you split you get NOT gate you do this you get an OR gate and you can
keep doing that and get adder circuits etc and all the stuff I've been saying works it's just that
this is a really easy case because the arrangement is soldered in it's fixed for all time that's not
like a more full of morphological situation really um the dynamics are super simple because the state
is like unnecessary there's no memory in these guys and AND gate just runs and to build it like to
build a flip flop or a memory unit I need to use feedback which I can but the little systems inside
have no memory so they're all very simple and then but with enough nesting of these you know
feedback circuits and adders and all this stuff you get a computer so this is a very like
very powerful language in the sense that you can build very complex things with simple things
using the same sort of pictures and mathematical rules with polynomials and that sort of stuff
as I've been talking about control systems have complicated dynamics but again they're still
in this fixed arrangement so yeah in this one there's no memory and in this one there might be
some memory in a control system like a thermostat or cruise control or whatever but still there's
usually a fixed arrangement of how things are wired together thermostat is receiving from the room
the furnace is receiving from the thermostat and the room is receiving from the furnace
deep learning is also another case of this so the interface there it's also a little bit very
very simple in a certain way namely all the interfaces are the same so here I have a little
one of these interfaces here another one here another one here's another one and the arrangements
so every one of these is outputting a reel and inputting a reel the output reel is kind of its
guess for what's going on right now and the input reel is its is its loss function is called and
so but the arrangement are all very simple they're just these activated sums weighted sums so like
what I'm going to put out here is some non-linear function of 3.2 times whatever's coming out here
minus 1.5 times whatever coming out here and 0.7 times whatever coming out here and so when you
train these guys a training of a neural network will be something where the arrangement the weights
and biases that tell you how one neuron is built from smaller neurons usually they they this looks
like in and out usually they draw these things to the left and this one to the right but I kind of
put them in and out to make it look the same as other ones in this slideshow so far but what I was
saying is that like at what flows along these wires just like what flowed you know when the stem
cell said I'm now an adult cell but flows along these wires and what kind of flows into the outside
world affects the arrangement affects these weights and these weights then affect how the outside world
sees the activity of what's inside. Okay so I think that's basically what I said here.
Question here so kind of back to the the switching that you mentioned like some of those
polynomial operators is that basically how you envisioned how like that switching is accomplished
by basically setting like if you wanted to switch between that the plus operator between one input
and the other but he said one of them to zero based on some internal state or how would that be
accomplished I wasn't confused by that. There would be a dynamical system so a set of states
and in one state I would be outputting something in P and then when I receive something from that
sense element of the sensorium some image I get there it might send me to a new state that went
into Q. Now what I heard you say was something like zeroing things out and plus and you were
thinking I think you were thinking of the plus from from back here as a kind of numerical thing
whereas this is all data structures so in computer science a data structure may not look
the way that the data is housed in the computer as a heap or a you know a binary tree or whatever
is not really of the same nature as like what the person's using it for and in the same sense I think
that you're confusing this plus as a kind of data structure operation with addition in terms of
like how you might accomplish or how you might like write out the dynamical system.
Okay yeah I know I'm not giving you enough information to actually use any of this I
am hoping to give you enough information that you it's like a calling card like if this is interesting
you know where to find me or something like that right so here the interface the arrangement is
dynamic like as the loss comes in and is just and is sent to these different things as like loss
by the chain rule for them to deal with that loss function is also affecting how much trust
or the weights that it gives to the outputs of these different systems. Same with that like a
prediction market a prediction market is also a case of this where like the amount of wealth everybody
has is updated based on how well they do in their predictions so the arrangement is changing
based on what's flowing through the wires. There's a big gulf between circuits and control and
artificial neural networks in circuits and control theory there's interesting wiring
but the arrangement is fixed forever whereas in artificial neural networks the arrangement is
dynamic but there's no communication between these peer nodes and in this this point is really
difficult to make to machine learning experts that there's actually a ton of room that is not
being used at all between control theory and artificial neural networks that you could do
all sorts of interesting things in neural networks even though they think that they can have really
cool arrangements like recurrent and convolutional and intentional layers and all the stuff
none of it gets far in the direction I'm talking about this direction I'm talking about is more
like the sort of thing you guys do so let's see so many people think of math as a number I'm not
sure I need this slide we're building up bigger things from littler parts we're talking about
interfaces dynamics and arrangements this is a really nice language I know I'm like complimenting
