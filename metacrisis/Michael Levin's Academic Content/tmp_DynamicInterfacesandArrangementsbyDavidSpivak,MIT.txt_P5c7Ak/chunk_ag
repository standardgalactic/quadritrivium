you know I feel like I've lost a bit of it by now an interesting thing for me if I can
continue to pester you is this slide is actually perfect and it reminded me of what I wanted to
say so you have the thing that's you know something is giving the arrangement correct
yeah it's a dynamical system that outputs arrangements and then given the arrangement
it sees what flows on this on throughout the thingy and uses that to update the arrangement
right so I guess another way this could be generative if you pick like some biological system
what the hell is keeping this arrangement like where does this sit can I find it uh
yeah you know we could there's a thousand things I can think of to where like I can very roughly
slap this picture on and think about how it could be working in biology but it you know
it might it could be interesting to to look for something like that like for example I don't know
if you ever heard of like coherence in the brain or oscillations but that was the first thing that
came to my head when you showed the slide because you have p plus q can switch between p mode and q
mode and there's a lot of work in neuroscience where despite the structure in your brain not
changing very quickly like you know your neurons don't rewire on the scale of seconds but you can
have different functional architectures so let's say you know you have you know 100 neurons and in
one instant you have some subset that are doing this wild and crazy thing and none of the connections
change but all of a sudden in the next instant boom you have a different subset they're doing
something entirely different um and a lot of people think that these larger scale oscillations are
somehow part of this kind of dynamical switching so like that this idea kind of fits nicely onto
here but now I'm you know it still begs the question of anytime you find a model you know
something you would explore in biology uh where should I look for the arrangement like who controls
like you know what controls it is the self-organizing you know like you know criticality or something
or should there be a theme that holds this um fascinating I don't know um yeah I was hoping
that like maybe just the way our universe works is that it's just one big arrangement and then it's
like kind of practically happening all the way down something something yeah like um uh yeah
there's something called the Construct a Law by Adrien Vijon there's something by Eric Smith
from Santa Fe Institute who talks about um non-equilibrium thermodynamics and how life evolved on
earth and things like this and like when I try to think about the question that I feel like you're
asking which is like what's controlling the arrangement what is it that like made it so that
I arranged into some bunch of neurons and cells and tissues and I'm able to talk to you right now
like that physics did that without you know help like it helped itself to to this and and like in
order to understand like what's controlling the arrangement I'm I'm like completely out of loss
but I have in other words I have like it's a philosophical question that can be translated
into math if we had good philosophical ideas about that okay okay still this is very very cool
and I don't know I think you probably know where my brain immediately went you know I have neurons
that are each a dynamical system uh so to describe the experiment that I'm doing because I think it
already arranged itself in a in a very specific topology yeah so I grow neurons on this dish
so you know I have like 30,000 cells chilling in this dish they have an arrangement there are
connections between them and those weights can change of course but interestingly I like personally
I'm very interested in how organisms interact with their environment so I receive a lot of
environmental signals but it's hard to know like which ones are important to what I'm doing now
in biology that's called the umvelts sometimes like what's the world what's the world to me
right and it's different from the world to you and so I have these neurons growing in a dish
and I can stimulate a lot of them if I want to in very specific ways if I needed to so it's
I immediately thought about trying to slap some of this ideology on the top to see if
that would help me understand kind of what's what's going on here so that could be a potential
application because it's it's uh it's not so simple as a you know a neural network and a
computer right um and it's not so complex as the brain because that's too hard and I quit
um but this is a nice in between yeah and you might hope that if you figured it out for 30,000
I forget what you said 30,000 cells and yeah what other 60,000 30,000 other cells and 30,000
other cells and then you kind of wired them together so like you know some part of of this
group was now connected to some part of this group you might hope that the analysis um of like how
your simulations from the outside affect what goes on in the network that those analyses could be
also composed yeah that would kind of be the sort of thing we would hope for here yeah so that was
kind of my kind of like a driving scientific question for me is that there's some kind of
fundamental like laws of engagement that you could find at this in a simplest system that I
can think of neurons in a dish uh that I could then apply to like ever more complicated systems
and figure out it's the same rules just kind of repeated in different ways yeah and my feeling
was like things sever and improve their connections where they flap their little flippers and move
away is seems kind of similar um based on like their fit so like we might we you know people say
evolution is survival the fittest and then they think of fit as a quantity but fit could also
be considered a quality which is like how much do you want to stay in this conversation right now
and how much I do is some something related to like how much it fits us how much you think you
have to contribute and how much you think this has to contribute to you and like I wouldn't be
surprised if somehow like that seems to be happening socially all over the place and social is like
the place that I'm have most access to as an intuitive being but I wouldn't be surprised if
like in in cell cultures or something if they were able to like move away from places where
they thought they weren't exchanging energy properly like the profile energy profile what
they're able to process was was incorrect for that area yeah um so so I was wondering kind of
is it possible that like everyone's trying to move into where they fit the best and fitting
is somehow that you are relevant to your scenario your surroundings and your surroundings are relevant
to you somehow yeah very one of us trans uh to point he actually has an active influence model
kind of illustrating exactly what he said where cells start from different positions and they
just click into their places based on their beliefs or of what where they have to be
yeah and then there's another guy here that does something where rather than saying fit you know
essentially cells or biology can feel stress you know so like if I have some kind of set point and
I'm far from it I'm very stressed and I distribute that stress to my neighbors to a certain degree
and their self-organization of stress in such a way that the goal is achieved or something like
yeah but there's also like this if if this was boring to you you'd also want to leave
so I'm kind of like thinking if the neurons just receiving no data maybe it dies or maybe it um
like if it just didn't get anything on its dendrites it just wouldn't wouldn't hang out anymore
but like if you're to sell at least as a person I kind of travel to a place where I think I can't
be energetically useful and I don't know whether that's um I don't know whether that's something
we find in other systems but it's something I would look for just because like I mean everything
that lives has to prove it's worth I feel like yeah things want to be relevant they want to be relevant
yeah I guess the active inference idea of that of the neuron cases if the neuron is receiving
something that it's not expecting to then it probably so everything has an internal expectation
and uh it this it would treat inputs based on what it wants to do with this expectation
that it wants to fit the inputs according to expectation or does it want to change the
expectations to fit the inputs right that's the active inference idea yeah and so all it can do is
you know paddle send things out send out positions you know move its legs or or yell something
and it's hoping that by doing that it can um it can start to expect things better or something
start start to be better at predicting um yeah all these ideas are very interesting and none of
them has quite none of them have I quite been able to encode and that my my feeling is like
the frist and stuff um there's a lot of kind of hand waving that I can't do in this in this
system yeah but it's promising nonetheless like there's something about it that feels right so
now I think the kind of frameworks that you're building is would be very useful to the field
because uh some of this I think at the end of the day if we have a good uh if you're able to
interpret the theories well that would be much much useful right and and I think category theory
obviously a logical basis it's a discrete sort of framework and uh I think it's more relatable
in that way uh more the continuous theories or the dynamical models and stuff like that are there
they're pretty they may be pretty good in but they're they could be very hard to interpret
and uh what's lacking is that it's a clear logical boolean logical basis and I think category
theory would offer that and so in that perspective it would be a very useful framework I think
cool I'm glad I don't know if there's some I don't know how a conversation like this will
continue but um uh if if at some point you feel like you have questions or if you think there's
some opportunity for a grant or something um I have no expectations but I think it would be I
would enjoy um working on something like this with someone so and you said you you're no I mean
I know you're still at MIT but you're now in central time zone which MIT is not oh I'm currently
in Austin at a retreat um okay so I should actually probably go back to that in a few minutes but
yeah um and I'm based in Berkeley now so I'm okay a research I was at MIT in the math department
for a little over 10 years and now I'm a research affiliate in their lids department
lids lab lids uh laboratory but uh I'm not paid by them anymore I'm at a place called
topos institute which is a category theory think tank or something like that in not cool in the
bay area okay I know Mike is interested in all the stuff so I'm pretty sure I'm sure he will
read yeah he will probably reach out to you after watching the rest of this recording so I would
expect things from him cool and then potentially us as well yeah yeah well thanks for your questions
it was really fun to hang out afterwards yeah yeah thank you for the thank you and feel free to email
if you have a oh can you can you put your the the best email in the chat um that way
I think Mike also sent an email yeah okay yeah that's that's all of them go to the same place so
whatever email he sent I think he sent the math.mit.edu one but this works okay perfect
all right thank you so much thank you take care great see you bye
