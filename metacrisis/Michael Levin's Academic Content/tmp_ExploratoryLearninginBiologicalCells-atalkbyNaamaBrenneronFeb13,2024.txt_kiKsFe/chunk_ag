For example, protein is for me,
for example, temperature, they have the, I don't know.
I don't have particular mechanisms.
I just kind of rely on the fact that stress causes
a lot of things in cells.
It triggers a lot of behaviors.
So I guess saying that a cell can kind of monitor
its own stress level is not something new.
It's not something very new.
And so I think earlier you said that
there was like an already known established generic
stress response.
Yeah, a universal stress response.
But that is mapped.
That is kind of, there's a group of genes,
I don't remember several thousand genes
in one or something.
And they start, they can read inputs
from several different kinds of stresses.
Yeah, but that's still, that's, I mean,
people have mapped out what this stress module
can respond to.
We have not found evidence that this is the one
that's being used here, although we looked for it.
And, but again, I have to, you know,
there's a caveat again about the measurement.
These measurements are not, you know,
if you don't have single cell, you don't have many,
you know, this was done a while ago
and I would be really interested to begin
with water technologies and tests
to make expression questions.
