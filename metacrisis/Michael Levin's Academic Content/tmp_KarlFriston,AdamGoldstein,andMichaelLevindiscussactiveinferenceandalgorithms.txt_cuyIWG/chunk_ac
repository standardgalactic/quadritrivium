whatever I can see and what I can see is my neighbor's value and it has to be a neighbor I
can't see but you know the one for yeah I can't see something along the way away so that defines
the input and the output is my particular number that's what I broadcast but I only broadcasted
in a loop in a local sense so when you're starting to express things in terms of a
a tealogy of self-organization of the kind that people use in you know in the free energy
principle I think you're then you're quite licensed to say well this is just a description for
example of electrochemical signaling you know it there's a magic is this is this is this is the
mechanism it just means that there has to be a local signal that reports or has some morphism
between my state and and you know everything that is not me and we find multiple instances of this
in in biology at different temperance spatial scales and you know the more you drill down the
more you actually specify what it is the more mechanistic you know it will become but you know
at the end of the day that's just the mechanics you're talking about so if you you know if you
wanted to describe self-organization of massive bodies that had no dissipative aspects to them
you know the motion of the planets for example if you if you take yourself back and pretend you
Kepler and you know what is the mechanics of motion of the heavenly bodies they're Lagrangian
conservative mechanics they inherit from the principle of least action that you know has a
relatively simple form before Einstein came along and in terms of you know energy conservation
and you know and all that is implicit in a pattern a path of least you know the least action least
action principle so that would be his kind of mechanics and you start to invent things like
gravity and mass and you know and talk about the teleology of massive bodies being attracted to
each other and that would be you know quite comfortably received as an intuitive mechanistic
explanation for the thing at hand which in this instance is a the motion of heavenly bodies
you know I I don't see there's any real problem from your point of view you've already told the
story you've already got the mechanics it's just you know a question of showing how universal this
kind of mechanics is and universal in the in the special context of local interactions
and all the all the consequences of having a principle or the principles that would apply
to self-organising systems out of equilibrium or non-equilibrium self-organisation, biotic
self-organisation what kind of mechanics must be in play and then you can give particular
exemplars and talk about gravity or cell intercellular signaling or you know and the
locality of that does that make sense yeah yeah yeah yeah and I guess Adam did you want to say
anything before I because I've got another okay so so this is kind of the the really
kind of far out thing and feel free to tell me that this is not a good analogy and you know
kind of too too too far out but I was thinking I was thinking about the analogy of us trying to
analyse these algorithms and what it is that what what are the causes of their behavior as we observe
them and trying to analogize to in a in a you know biological or maybe in a psychological
slash psychiatric context where you have what you think is the algorithm and maybe that's what
your subject thinks is the cause of their actions and maybe that's what you think is the cause of
their actions but it turns out that there's this underlying dynamic that is it's an extra goal
that you didn't know because you couldn't you you didn't see it in the in the steps of the
of the policies that they're supposedly following and I wonder if this is a sort of really basal
kind of I don't know I just just a really basal kind of behavioral analysis that might be important
for the larger and more complex systems in the sense of finding underlying goals for for
for complex behaviors that are not to be found in the by enumerating the mechanisms that you
know that are there which is you know like it basically basically looking at the tendency to
cluster as a as a hidden motivation for their behavior if I can use this kind of like psychological
term what do you think about that Zachary is that silly or are there oh no no I think that's
exactly the application of these principles and the attendant mechanics you know in terms of say
voting dynamics or geopolitical and or just a spread of information on the internet you know
I think some really important deep questions there and things you know why is it
that almost inevitably whenever you look at some ideological political or theological commitment
everybody's 50-50 you know Trump versus Biden Brexit versus stay you know wherever you look
the only evolutionary stable strategy on or for energy minimizing not an equilibrium steady state
is you know usually a 50-50 because that can be subdivided within what this this 50 percent
there's another 50 percent in a sort of self-similar way all the way down so there's some must be
something generically very important universal about that and I would imagine that's you know
you will see that kind of clustering it's interesting I didn't realize I didn't read
it Kevin have to realize you have this sort of the actual order wins out at the end of the day
so you get the increase and then the decrease in clustering that was interesting
I would be if I was a young man working for you as a PhD student I'd like to put a bit of
noise on the numbers and just see if you can keep it alive and dynamic and see that clustering and
that chimeric behavior look at its dynamics and you know something in dynamical systems
theory called frustration that you get in these in these chimeric situations when
you've broken detailed bounds like this which may be a good metaphor for voting dynamics for
example and so I think it's a very sensible idea I'm just reminded have you read that paper by
Connor Hines and if not I'll send it to you so he's he's he he was making an analogy between
Gibbs energy and free energy in terms of exchanging ideas as a model of
collective behavior and it may be you'll find some interesting ethological references
references to that yeah interesting that you know the thing about the thing about them being
pulled apart at the end so so one way one of the things that we did was to ask okay how how
strong would this tendency to cluster be if you if you didn't have this super overlying
being a basic physics of this world that eventually is just going to yank you apart
and and one way to do that is to allow repeat numbers so if I allow repeat numbers then you
can have a long run of fives and the first half of them could be one I'll go type the second half
could be the other and the actual sorting algorithm would be perfectly happy to keep them as is because
the fives are between the four yeah so so we did that and and when you do that you find out that
yeah if you let them do that it actually goes higher the the tendency to cluster is actually
higher that you know so there's this like competing you know and and again looking at it it almost
it almost provides a very minimal model of of the existential sort of I don't know way of life
facing living systems right that the physics of the world are like you're trying to grind you down
but but in the meantime you can do some interesting things that are not incompatible
with them there's no magic I mean it does the algorithm there's no you know there's no errors
but but but yet not quite what what the you know what what the end goal is going to be
according to the actual physics of the system yeah
