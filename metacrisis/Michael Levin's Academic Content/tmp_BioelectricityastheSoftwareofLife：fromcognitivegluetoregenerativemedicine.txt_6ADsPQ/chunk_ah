who are nowhere on the tree of life relative to you.
That is their origin story and their composition
is no longer a good guide
and their kind of place in the evolutionary web
is no longer a good guide to how to relate to them.
They're going to be truly alien bodies and minds
with different degrees of cognition.
And that means that we really need to develop
some new ethics around a kind of synthbiosis
where you can coexist and flourish by interacting
with beings that are very different from us
and the old ways that we used to figure out
how we relate to plants and animals and ecosystems
and each other in terms of what are you made of
and what do you look like?
Did you come out of a factory or were you evolved
and do you look like me?
And do you have the same kind of brain?
All of those things are out the window.
None of those are good guides anymore.
I mean, they were never good
but they kind of served while things were pretty primitive.
Those things are out the window.
We're going to have to come up with an entirely new way
of understanding diverse intelligences.
I'm going to stop here and just say that
if you're interested in any of these topics
you can follow up with these or many other papers.
And I want to thank the students and the postdocs
that did all of the work that I showed you today
and our various support personnel,
lots of collaborators to thank various funders here.
Again, the disclosures here are three companies
that fund our work.
And most of all, I always thank the animals
because they do all the hard work really.
So thank you very much.
