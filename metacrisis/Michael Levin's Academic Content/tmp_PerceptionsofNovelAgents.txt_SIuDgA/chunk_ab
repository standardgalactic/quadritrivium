just you who looks at it, just the more informed we all are as a society about these sort of
things, the better everything's going to go in the future.
Here is some acknowledgments.
We had just a great amount of help from Dustin Erdash.
Mike Eleven was really a key member of this, we couldn't have done it without him.
And the funding which we used to pay the people on EmTurk, we got from the Diverse Intelligence
Summer Institute.
And if you have any questions, feel free.
