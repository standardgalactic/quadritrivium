much simpler representation of doing things in finite dimensions.
The downside of that, it means that, that all of continuous mathematics,
like differential equations, becomes an approximation on the dynamics that's
conceptually simpler, but, but from a computational point of view, much more
Yeah, it's, it's really hard to grasp.
When I studied this stuff, I always imagine space time to be some kind of
cellular automaton, where you have like your little space grids and well,
communicating with each other with the speed of light, something like this,
that being the clock time of the, of the automaton.
But it feels like it's much more dynamic and space is really emerging and more
like a property you assign to particles or anything that distinguishes them
from each other and allows you to build correlations on top of other degrees of freedom.
So, yeah.
