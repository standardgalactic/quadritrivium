of that you know as well you chase you chase the the the moving target morphology as an embryo
and eventually you reach your adult form and so sort of that's it you've caught you've caught up
and so now the name of the game is to defend against tiny local um defections of cancer
and degeneration and and so just you know cells getting old and so on but but but if once you've
given up uh once you've given up that you're on a trajectory for some kind of construction project
maybe you know that that's it if you if you if you're stuck in a rut of exploit and you're
really not exploring anything that may be when things start to go to pot I don't know I mean
you know the the the kind of uh familiar folk example is you know the people who who retire
from from their job and then immediately drop dead be right so that's the right that that's just
kind of a but but maybe something like that is going on um on a on a on a cellular level
where basically you know uh when there's nothing pulling you there is no more of that uh the forces
which is what we study during development that pull you from stage to stage at that point then
then then things things start to go downhill I don't know yeah um I noticed in your um
acknowledgments which was a fascinating list I read it um Bernardo Castro was in there yeah
tell me about I'm talking to him tomorrow I've never met him oh yeah yeah we've yeah we've had a
I've had a couple of conversations with with Bernardo online and you know a bunch off uh
yeah super interesting dude um computer science uh kind of background philosophy um you know he's
got this uh kind of idealist model um yeah I think he's very interesting I you know he did a he did a
cool uh session with uh Rupert Spira and they sort of talked about this notion of uh all of us being
dissociative altars of the great cosmic mind and things like that um yeah I think I think you'll
have fun I think he's he's a very smart guy I think you'll have fun I fun I'm reading his book
right now he's a new book uh that he sent me a copy of um the epistemology piece seems very
persuasive I mean the more we learn about active inference and the fact that we're constructing
our perceptions are limited by our cognitive equipment and the world we're seeing is mental
to a greater extent than we realize um but then he goes to the next step that what's really there
is mine and that's I don't understand that he he sort of asserts it without arguing it um well
he's got he's got I think five other books uh that yeah I know he's probably leaning on and I'm
not I'm not going to try to um uh kind of make his argument for him because I think I'll butcher
it he'll he'll do a much better job of it himself you can ask him to just like say it but uh you
know I I think that fundamentally I I like that idealist position in the sense that
I think what actually propagates through evolution through the universe I think the the fundamental
um pieces are perspectives so I don't think it's genes I don't think it's bodies I think it's um
I think it's uh I think it's perspectives and so what what I mean is that that any any agent uh
you can't you can't afford to um you can't you can't afford to try to see the world as it is in the
sense of uh like a Laplacian demon you can't afford to track microstates because if you
if you try to track microstates by the time you figure out what's going on you'll be long dead
any any biological system that in the real world has constraints of energy of time uh
so so what that means is you're going to core screen you're going to decide what am I ignoring
what am I paying attention to I'm going to take all these kinds of observations and I'm just going
to lump them all together and I'm going to call the you know and and I don't mean this is not just
humans doing this is every cell every bacterium everything's doing this so what you really have
there then is a perspective it's a commitment to it's a set of choices that say here's what I'm
paying attention to and here's um uh how I make sense of it here's what I think it means you know
it's a it's a it's an interpretation so so that's what I think is perpetuating through the universe
and being selected on and you know altering with time and all that is is a set of perspectives
a set of a particular vantage point of saying uh here's how I make sense of my world and and
once we understand that that every cognitive being is limited every finite every real being
is finite we're all limited we all have to choose a perspective that ignores all kinds of other
stuff and it's not just about only being able to sense a small um narrow band of the spectrum
it actually I mean that's true too but but it's much more than that it's cognitively not just
perceptually that we're limited uh then I think uh you know then then yeah then it's then it's all
about uh what we're talking about perspectives in the in the in the minds of living things
or are you talking about perspectives at large I'm talking about perspectives I mean I we can
talk about what living things are but I think that any agent that has to whether we would call
it living or not I mean any any kind of robotic thing any any kind of uh uh system that solves
problems in in a world of some sort is going to have to have a perspective on that world
and the more right for a rock you don't worry too much about its perspective although you
with potential energy and things like that you almost kind of get there but but but for most
things things that have a significant inner perspective we call those things living typically
but doesn't have to be uh and and yeah and whatever world they you know you can you can ask like
gene regulatory networks what's the world that they navigate it's not the physical
three-dimensional world it's the it's a high-dimensional transcriptional space that they
live in and I think from that from from uh no pun intended from that perspective
what you put it what what ends up being emphasized a lot more is what choices are you making about
your uh cognitive uh uh framing of your world and a lot less about some uh objective world
existing out there somewhere and uh yeah I think I think that's how you get to idealism is just
is just by recognizing that all um uh real real agents are going to be finite and limited and
therefore what you're really talking about is uh an inner world that you're building for yourself
it's it's your own self model that's that's that's a play here not not some objective thing
and that your self model may or your model of the world may or may not be compatible with mine
um you know yeah so in your view though I'm I'm assuming something but I could be wrong
um the prerequisites of self and the and the process you're describing do you think that
that can be embodied in a computer yes but computer has to I mean again whether something
in order is a computer is in the eye of the beholder what what what we what uh what we mean
when we say something is a computer is that I have a set of uh conceptual tools that I bring
to the table here that come from computer science and I'm claiming that those tools are useful
that that's all that's all it means and um do I think that uh some of those tools are useful to
understand cognition yes you know for example reprogrammability and software I think is extremely
useful uh do I think the von Neumann architecture and the sharp distinction between data and the
machine are particularly useful no I think we'll have to dump those uh do you know do I think that
at some point we could make synthetic uh beings that have the right features absolutely I don't
see any reason why it seems completely backwards to me to say that the the blind meanderings of
the evolutionary process can create real minds but but but intelligent engineers who understand
how minds work can't do it that that seems crazy to me so so I think that that for sure once we
understand and I think we're getting there I think we understand that you know a few of the
key features um I I don't see any reason why we couldn't uh re-implement them in a synthetic substrate
sure yeah but you'd need a substrate that as you've said is not at all like a von Neumann
correct correct I yeah I think you need a number of things and the and the thing is that um
I started I started writing those things down I started writing a paper this was
months ago I started writing a paper to say look these are the things we've learned from
biology if you just do these things you will have uh you know a real a real agent and then
then I stopped and and although I don't think this is going to solve it because somebody else
will of course do it but I didn't want to be responsible for it because I think that to whatever
extent that's on the right track it may or not be but but if it is then what that means is that
it makes it very easy to make trillions of other uh beings that are I have um that have more that
deserve moral consideration and I'm not really interested in being the cause of that but I'm
sure that's where we're going I'm sure I'm sure this will get figured out and this is what will
happen yeah other people are working on oh yeah including including Mark Psalms by the way yes
yes that's that's right and that's right and I would say it's very simplistic and it's and it's
using you know computers as as they now exist yeah I think that um I think of of anybody's
project that uh that I think has a chance of doing something like that I think is at the top
of the list I actually think you could do it yeah amazing amazing well thank you are you writing a
book a general a trade book uh I am uh I'm currently I'm Oney Pagan and I are writing a book on
bioelectricity and uh it doesn't it doesn't have any of this stuff in it it's just straight up bio
electricity uh but the next book if I you know if I get there the next book will be all of this
stuff basically great yeah evolution cognition all that stuff and are you going to do that for a
general audience I don't you know I don't know I I'm I'm still we're still um so Richard Watson
and I are probably going to do it together or or maybe we'll do two books we we haven't been able
to like maybe it'll be two books back to back or something we'll have you know maybe inverted like
the way that um uh that was done for the Plenaria Journal and and and all that uh I don't I don't
know um I'm having a really hard time figuring out what is the best thing to do here because on the
one hand I could do a book for a for a general audience and I think what would happen then is
that a lot of these there will be a set of people from let's say the alternative sort of you know
new age kind of community who would read these things and they say oh yeah no kidding we've
known this for a long time and we they you know they don't they don't need uh you know they don't
need um uh you know scientific uh you know sort of experiments to prove it whatever they they're
already in in for it um and then there will be the science community who will say well there's not
enough uh meet here to convince me of any of these crazy things right so so I so I worry about that
issue for the trade book I you know I it sounds like that could miss uh the impact on the other
hand on the other hand if we do a you know an academic press book where you where you go into
detail on on all of this stuff uh yeah I'm not sure you know I'm not sure I'm not sure which of
my colleagues have time to read something like that uh you know who's gonna read it I don't know
so so I still haven't figured out what the right yeah I mean I think you've got a really interesting
book around some of these ideas and um I think it'd be of interest to a lot more than new age
people um I really do um do you have a literary agent I do yeah I do yeah um I mean it's a conversation
to have with that person is it who is it Brockman's shop it is yeah yeah yeah Dan introduced me to
Brockman yeah yeah yeah we'll have a con I mean I mean he obviously wants a trade book all right so
now the other thing is you know they don't which which is kind of wild they don't like
images and they certainly don't like color I have I have some amazing color illustrations
and I don't know that feels weird to me in this modern day and age with computer like do we even
need a book couldn't I just put it all on a website like why do we need a book I don't
you know and you know and somebody's gonna tell you not to use color I'm like I don't know yeah um
yeah well good luck with that I I just think that these ideas would be of interest to a lot of
people in a lot of different fields they're very interdisciplinary ideas and um so uh I think the
right trade book would reach your colleagues or colleagues and other you know in philosophy and
computer science um anyway it's all it's just fascinating stuff well thank you I appreciate
that I'll I'll be in touch because I will definitely want to pick your brain when it comes to I'm happy
to read a proposal if you do that or whatever yeah I'd love any kind of suggestions um that'd be
super useful thank you good and I'm going to be in Cambridge this fall so uh awesome awesome yeah
you can get together in person definitely yeah we'll hang out
