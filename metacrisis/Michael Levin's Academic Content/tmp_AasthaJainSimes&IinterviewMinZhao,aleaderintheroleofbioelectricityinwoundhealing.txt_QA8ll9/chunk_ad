this neutrophil actually release part of this cytoplasma as a little particle or little fragment
to in combat the infection so I went to his lab and I'm trying to to do that the experiment
it turned out it's quite difficult to get enough self-fragment from neutrophil
so we never been able to get a conclusive result and later on when we were in Aberdeen and the
Julie Theoret lab has this from the other lab at the show the other group showed that
the fish cretocytes are very big so when you treat them with certain chemicals the part of
the cell body comes off and this little fragment is still able to move around so we were thinking oh
so this this is a good example and together with Alex Munguna that time he was at University of Aberdeen
oh no University of California Davis later on moved to NYU and so we we talked with Dr. Sun
and they said well let's capture the cells and to see generate this fragment put them in
electrocute and the result is kind of we never expected so the fragment to come off actually
move in opposite direction from the mother cell and so this so it looks like the the sensor and
the response and decision making are kind of different part of the the whole process so the
cell can sense it and the cell can respond it to to to electrocute field but the cell also can
make a direction to see whether they want to go left or right or to grab the work acid so this
this makes me thinking more about that what Donald Ingevers saying that maybe the whole system is
a sensor it just doesn't use a single piece of molecule and I sense it I responded it's like
it's it's coordinate itself and make the decision to go to the cassette or to the
anode so yeah thank you Mike for bringing that really mind boggling experiment up you know we
could never ever sort the result like this we would just think the the the the fragment come
well move together with the mother cell but no they didn't move to the opposite direction
yeah for me you know we spend a lot of time thinking about collective intelligence and how
the preferences of the collective emerge from the preferences of the parts you know how the
scaling works and here you showed us a great example where the parts have a certain preference but
the collective once you put them together the the collective actually has a quite different
quite different preference for its action so I think that's a I think that's a powerful
example yeah well thank you thank you so much you know I this is this is a real pleasure I mean
Min you and I have known each other for a long time but I really I think your work is amazing I
think it's the closest probably to the clinic of any of us in the field right now and yeah it's
it's just yeah it's beautiful well thank you so much well thank you so much man really appreciate
you taking the time this has been amazing yeah yeah much appreciated well so it's a great pleasure
and I hope this field keep moving forward in something we'll see a kind of a new horizon
