Well, it knows how to be a boring two-dimensional layer
on the outside of the embryo.
But that's because the other cells
are basically bullying these cells,
behavior-shaping these cells into doing that.
On their own, left to their own devices,
this is what they actually do.
This is the default behavior.
So you can imagine evolution as searching this space
of behavior-shaping signals
that cells will send each other to get them to do
what they want, to get them to do something adaptive.
This is the default behavior of those cells.
And the final thing is this.
When we think about why does a certain organism
have certain shapes, behaviors, properties,
the answer is usually well evolution
because eons of selection have given
at these particular goal states in anatomical space,
in behavioral space, in morphological space, and so on.
But actually, there's never been any xenobots
and there's never been any selection to be a good xenobot.
So there's no straightforward selection story
that explains these behaviors.
So we have to start thinking differently
about where goals in these spaces come from.
I think that's very interesting.
And we don't know what the cognitive capacities
of these guys are yet.
We're working to understand what can they sense,
what are their preferences, what can they learn, and so on.
So I'll just stop here by saying that all of this
is the conceptual stuff is discussed in these papers,
which I'm happy to send to anybody.
I wanna thank the postdocs and the students.
