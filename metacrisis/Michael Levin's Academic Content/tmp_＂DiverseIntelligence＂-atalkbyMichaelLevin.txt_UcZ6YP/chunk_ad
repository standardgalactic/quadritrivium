side of of this of this of the structure and as a result it can it can swim so they can go uh
they can go in circles they can patrol back and forth like this they can have a collective behaviors
here's here's a bunch of them these two are interacting with each other these guys are
sitting there doing nothing this one is taking a kind of a long journey around the petri dish
here's one here's one navigating a maze um what you can see here the water is perfectly still here
it will move forward it uh takes a turn without bumping into the opposite wall and then at this
point for some internal reason that we don't know it decides to turn around and go back where it
came from this is a very uh simple example of uh spontaneous self-determined motion there's some
kind of process inside that that guides what it does it can take turns it can uh change change
direction and and go back uh if we scan the um if we scan the uh the physiology this is calcium
signaling so what we're imaging is is is calcium spiking in these cells what you see is that very
much like um you might see in uh in brains uh you see you see a bunch of calcium spiking
we're currently using all the same techniques that you might use in neuroscience to analyze
the information flows here uh in fact within the within each zenabot but also between zenabots who
knows maybe they're they're somehow talking to each other and you can detect that using information
theory approaches they regenerate if you cut it in half they will uh they will seal themselves
back up so here so here it's basically cut in half like this and then they'll seal themselves
back up to a norm to a new zenabot shape and then here's the most amazing part of all uh it was
noticed that when you simulate these bots with objects in their environment what you find out
is that um actually their their behaviors tend to tend to collect particles into little into
little groups and so what we decided to do based on this based on an AI kind of model of of
their morphogenesis and behavior is we decided to give them some actual other cells to play with
and what we found out was was something amazing uh what they do is so this white stuff here these
are these are loose skin cells and what the zenabots do is they run around and they collect
these skin cells into little balls and because we're dealing here not with a passive material but
with an agential material meaning with living cells the same material that evolution works with
so we as human engineers the zenabots and evolution all three of us work with this
kind of agential material and what that allows it what what that allows is that when they do make
these little little balls overnight the balls themselves mature into the next generation of
zenabot which then will run around and do exactly the same thing and you get the next generation
and the next generation and so on so think about what this means we've made it impossible for these
guys to reproduce in the normal froggy fashion it's just skin there's no neurons there there's
no reproductive machinery that's these are these are just balls of skin basically but what they've
been able to do is to fulfill von Neumann's dream which is to which is a robot that that
goes around and collects materials from its environment and makes copies of itself and
that's what it does and we call this kinematic replication so um so so the last the last bit
here is simply this let's let's think about this for a minute um there's been no genomic editing
here we didn't change the genome we didn't provide some weird nano material uh when you sequence the
genome here all you see is zenopus standard zenopus lavas so so when we ask what does the
zenopus lavas genome actually encode well it encodes cells it encodes a hardware machine
that under normal circumstances produces this it produces a set of standard embryonic stages and
then some tadpoles that can do this kind of behavior but under different circumstances
these same cells can solve the problem differently and they can become a zenabot with its own
weird developmental stage and then its own very unusual behavior so as far as we know no other
system does kinematic self-replication so so so here here are a couple of interesting interesting
things here um first of all this is engineering by subtraction we didn't add anything but what we
did do was we liberated these cells from the normal influence of the other cells so if you
look at a normal embryo in their skin cells and you ask what do they know how to do well you say
well all they could do is be this boring two-dimensional layer sitting on the outside of the animal
keeping out the bacteria but in fact uh what you find out by by by putting them on their own is that
yeah that's normally what they do when they're sort of behavior shaped or bullied by these other
cells into into having that role but on their own their default behavior is actually this so you
can start to think about evolution as a way of searching the space of behavior shaping stimuli
how do how do we get cells to tell other cells what to do and because you're dealing with an
agential material not uh not passive legos but an agential material these cells already have
certain capacities you can't just put them where you want and have them stay there you have to
you have to use various signals to get them to do to get them to change their their native behaviors
the other thing about this is that for any other living organism if you ask why does it have a
certain shape or a certain size certain behaviors the answer usually is well evolution the anatomical
goals come from evolution you've been selected for eons to be a specific kind of shape well there's
never been any xenobots there's never been any evolutionary of a pressure to be a good xenobot
all of this is completely emergent from the from the generic problem solving capacity of these cells
so one of the things we're working on is is understanding how it is that evolution makes
not just specific solutions to specific environments but actually problem solving machines
that have the capacity to do new things in new environments that they never had specific selection
for uh so um and and we're at the moment uh studying their their cognitive capacities we
actually have no idea what what what can they learn what do they sense what are their preferences
all of that remains to be to be determined so i'm gonna i'm gonna end here with two things first
just a um uh just a summary of of the kind of philosophical aspects of what i've told you
so so in my framework i think that we have to look at uh agency as a continuum not binary
categories uh and we have to really understand um how it is that these capacities change when
bodies and and minds change uh i think that persuadability is a useful engineering um way
to organize that axis which enables what i what i've shown you is that it enables uh important
it enables new discoveries and new capabilities in biomedicine and then so on by thinking about
how how to communicate with these cell groups and so on i think there's no privileged
substrate for cognition i think that there's nothing magical about uh about biological substrates
it's uh we're gonna have intelligences that are that are extremely um diverse uh we have this
notion of the self described by a cognitive light cone as the the size of the goal the largest goal
that it's capable of of pursuing with this idea of evolution and engineers pivoting these systems
through different problem spaces and it doesn't have to be three-dimensional space when when we
look at how intelligent we think a system is we're really taking an IQ test ourselves to ask
whether we've recognized uh the space that it's working in whatever goals it's trying to reach
and its competencies in reaching those goals those are not apparent immediately like as i showed you
for development it looks like it's always does the same thing but it's actually much more much
more clever than that i've shown you that developmental bioelectricity is a evolutionary
precursor of of brain dynamics and it's basically the physiological medium for the software of
multicellular life it's the it's the substrate in which the cognition the the proto-cognition of
the morphogenetic swarm intelligence is held and i've shown you the examples of reading and
rewriting the memories of that of that intelligent swarm and this is just the beginning these are
these are very early primitive kind of experiments still and that i think that we have a really
interesting implications for evolution here which is not only due to the multi-scale competency
of the organs you know you put a bunch of eye cells on the tail and they can still form an eye
they figure out how to connect and the whole thing still still sort of works if you have a
mouth that's off in the wrong place it will readjust itself so so this has many implications
for for evolution and and a really fundamental question of where do these goals come from if
it's not just selection and so the last thing i'm going to say is this that that when darwin
said the phrase endless forms most beautiful when he was interested in and impressed in the wide
variety of of shapes out there in the biological world all of that is a tiny corner of possible
space of agents because biology is highly interoperable it solves problems that it's never
seen before which means that any combination of evolved material designed material and software
is some kind of viable agent so we have hybrids and cyborgs and all kinds of different things that
many of these are already being made but but some of them will be in the future and we really need
a new kind of ethics to be able to relate to sentient beings that are very different from us
they have a different origin story they have a different composition and they have a different
kind of kind of intelligence so all of the details can be found in these in these papers which
i'm happy to send to you if anybody's interested i want to thank all the people that did the that
did the work these are the postdocs and the students that did all the all the hard work here
our support staff my many collaborators our funders so many people that have supported this work
and i thank you for listening
