and then by 45 days you've already got some toenail that you've got a toenail you've got some toes
and eventually a quite respectable leg and the leg is you can see here it's touch sensitive
and it's motile so the animal can use can use this leg okay so so again it's this idea of
communicating a very simple thing to the collective and then taking your hands off the wheel not
trying to micromanage what the stem cells do or or or what the gene expression is all of that is
handled top down the idea is to give the the appropriate information at the very beginning
and I have to I have to do a disclosure here because I'm David Kaplan and I are co-founders
of a scientific co-founders of a company called Morphosuticals which is trying now the same
technology in mammals and the idea is to ultimately go to limb and organ regeneration and human
patients someday so I want to go back to this to this amazing amazing creature which are these
these planarium and really think about uh try to try to really cash out this idea that that these
electrical uh much like in the brain this electrical network is really storing the uh
the the goals and the and the and the informational content of the collective intelligence
and so just to introduce you to this to this creature a little bit uh quite complex many
different organs a true brain you can chop them into pieces and every piece knows exactly what's
needed to form a perfect little worm in fact they are so good at maintaining the correct shape
that they do this all the time in their bodies and thus are immortal there's no such thing as an
old planarian they they don't age at the level of the organism they just keep going and and you know
that that that they have to have a very developed uh uh system of of global communication because
if you cut them in half this half becomes a tail this these cells up here form a head but these
cells were direct neighbors a moment ago so that decision to make a head or a tail can't be locally
determined in these cells they have to communicate with the rest of the body do we already have a
head which way is the one facing and then they make their decision so understanding this this
decision making process was really key for us um we developed a model of of of of of
bioelectrical signaling at the wound that appears to be involved in that head tail decision and that
allows you to do the following thing uh here's a normal planarian one head one tail it has normal
gene expression anterior genes in it turned on in the head and then when you amputate this guy you
get a hundred percent of the time you get a one-headed offspring from this from this middle
middle fragment but what you can also do is you can also take one of these again same thing
anatomically normal uh transcriptionally normal and it makes a two-headed worm this is not photoshop
these are real um real animals and you ask well why is it that I just told you that this was an
incredibly reliable process why did this guy form an ectopic head at the posterior because
having figured out this electrical circuit we were able to rewrite their pattern memory of
what a correct planarian is supposed to look like so here is what this animal represents
as a normal planarian one head one tail this is again voltage um voltage imaging but we were
able to and this is of course so somewhat messy but the the technique is is being worked out
we were able to change that electrical pattern by acting on the ion channels and the gap junctions
to be to store this two heads and then when you cut that animal it makes a two-headed worm
now this is really critical this electrical map is not an electrical map of this animal this
electrical map is a map of this perfectly normal anatomically one-headed animal that and this is
an electrical memory that is latent it's not doing anything this animal it doesn't match the anatomy
that the idea of I should be two-headed does not match the current state which is one-headed
it's late that memory is latent because we we rewrote it but nothing happens until you
injure the animal once you injure the animal and cut and cut off this middle fragment then it
consults that memory and then it becomes two-headed so this is if you're interested in neuroscience
and and our brain's amazing ability for what they call time travel the ability to store and imagine
states that are not true right now so either things that were true or things that might be
true later but they're not true right now I think this is a good example of a very basic
kind of primitive version of this because this tissue can store a bioelectrical pattern of
what it will do if it gets injured in the future it's a counterfactual memory it's not true right
now and so a single planarian body can store up to two different ideas of what a correct
planarian should look like and so I promised you earlier on that that I would show you that that
we can find and edit the the cognitive medium of this collective intelligence of morphogenesis
and here it is when we ask where is the information that guides what you build here it is it's it's
it's it's represented much like in the brain by stable electrical states in the in the tissue
that guide the activity and no doubt there's more than two but this is this is what we've
worked out now I keep calling it a memory why because we we we also found out that if you
take these two two-headed worms um and and here they are so you can see you can see the video
of them live if we take these two-headed worms and we continue cutting them in plain water no
more manipulation of any kind this middle portion will continue to regrow two-headed
worms even though their genetics is completely untouched so let me let me re-reiterate that
there's nothing genetically wrong with these animals we did not change the hardware at all
what we changed very was a using a very brief physiological manipulation of the electrical
state basically a stimulus right we we communicated to this collective intelligence with an with a
brief physiological stimulus of turning the channels on and off the way that it happens for
example in your retina when you see stimuli we've communicated the idea that there should be two
heads instead of one and once you do this the circuit holds that memory and in the future
with no more manipulation despite the wild type genetics it will continue to generate a completely
different anatomy and so the question but you know the deep question of what determines how
many heads you have you can't simply say DNA what the DNA does is gives you a hardware machine
a bioelectrical machine that by default generates a memory of a one-headed pattern
but it's rewriteable and if you rewrite it it will it will maintain so and so this has all
the properties of memory it's long-term stable but it's got some it's it's labile a little bit it
can be rewritten it has conditional recall which I just showed you it has discrete possible behaviors
so what we're doing right now is really trying to use some techniques for from from connectionist
machine learning and some other some other tools of of of dynamical systems theory and some other
things to really pull together what we know about the physiology of the electrophysiology of the
circuit and a state space of the circuit and the ability of the system to do amazing things like
regain specific states if it's pulled out of that condition and also to be rewriteable
the way that that memory in real and artificial neural networks is rewriteable now we can now
what's interesting is this is memory goes beyond the number beyond setting the number of heads
it also goes to the it also is involved in the in setting the shape of the heads so this is a
perfectly um normal uh du uh duizia doradoscephala with this nice triangular
head and uh what we can do without changing the DNA is cut off the head and then perturb the
bioelectric network topology of this of this creature by by blocking the gap junctions for a
little bit then you let it go and the system settles back down but when it settles back down it
can make flat heads like a pifalina it can make round heads like an s-mediterranean or it can make
the you know the the normal heads and so what you see is that and and by the way not only not
only the the head shape but actually also the the shape of the brain and the distribution of the
stem cells become exactly like these other organisms they are about 100 to 150 million
years evolutionary distance and so you can ask this the exact same hardware to make heads belonging
to other species so basically other attractors in the state space of this electrical circuit
correspond to other species so evolution can can can search the the space the state
space of this bio electrical circuit to derive these other species and it does not uh it does
not require a genetic change although of course it might become genetically assimilated that change
may become genetically assimilated and then become become heritable um okay and not only can you
find other species in that morpho space which Darcy Thompson gave us this idea of of of a
morpho space a mathematical morpho space in that uh in that morpho space you can find other things
that don't look like plenaria at all you can find these weird spiky forms you can find these
cylindrical things that aren't flat you can find combinations sort of hybrid um hybrid forms
all of this is done with exactly the same cells so um I want to take just uh just a a few minutes
now to uh go back to uh really thinking about the mechanisms of this collective intelligence idea
what I've shown you so far is that uh individual cells which are themselves competent to solve
problems in transcriptional space in metabolic space in a physiological space are bound together
in a multicellular organism to solve anatomical problems okay problems in anatomical morpho space
and then eventually evolution reused it to for to make brains to solve behavioral problems
and eventually linguistic space and so on so so I want to talk for a few minutes about
how does this scaling work how do these individual how do you go from from from numerous tiny little
little proto minds to one uh one larger cognitive system and so and so I want to show you some
hypotheses about that um in a uh in in evolution what we have through multicellularity is an
expansion of goal states so this this cell is very good at handling very local goals it's never
going to work towards any other sort of large-scale goal but together in a collective and I've shown
you some evidence that what binds that collective together is electrical uh communication and the
properties of electrical networks they can work on much bigger goals in a different space so so
here's the goal of making a limb and if you've made a limb and I deviate you from that goal
you will use uh as as the cellular collective you will use energy and very rapidly try to get back
to that state so so individual cells have no idea what a finger is or how many fingers you're supposed
to have or anything like that but the collective certainly does and it will keep implementing
this under under under various types of deformations so that is taking a bunch of low-level minds and
making um making something that's able to pursue large-scale goals in an anatom in a different
space in the anatomical space but that uh that set of mechanisms it has a failure mode and that
failure mode is known as cancer so this is human glioblastoma in culture and so what's happened
to these cells is that they have disconnected from each other electrically and when they do that
they roll back down to their unicellular past they no longer are able to be a part of a network
that perceives large-scale goals so they they go back to their early initial goals which were every
cell wants to become two cells and to go wherever life is good and that's and that's cancer and
metastasis so we need to understand this process of scaling up and and the various failure modes
and I think that basically what happens is simply um that that when you have single cells
they have a little bit of memory going backwards they have a little bit and this has been shown
in the field of basal cognition cells have the ability to anticipate future stimuli but it's
quite small right both in space and time it's quite small and when you join together into
larger networks you have more computational ability to store past memories you have more
ability to predict future states and you have a larger spatial perception you're able to
collectively measure things on a physically larger scale and so if this is how collectives form
we ought to be able to use this to address the cancer problem and in fact that's that's
that's what we've done is to say okay the oncogene is there we're not going to try to
edit the genome or to kill or to somehow kill those cells or to remove that that uncle protein
what we're going to do instead is force those cells to remain in electrical communication
with their neighbors regardless of what the oncogene says and so when you do that here's
the the uncle protein is labeled with red fluorescence it's very bright in fact it's all over the
place you can see this is the same animal there's no tumor because what we've done is we've co-injected
a particular ion channel that sets an electrical state that forces these cells into the normal
communication with their neighbors and they participate in normal morphogenesis they make
skin they make for the various organs instead of going off on their own and making a tumor
so this is another example of taking advantage of the of the decision making in this at the
software level to get a different outcome even though your hardware is is different right and so
that we've had in our lab many many examples of addressing these kind of hardware problems
at the at the at the software level by by exploiting this this this collective
phenomena so what we're interested in is how to what happens when when individual individual
cells which can do this kind of homeostatic loop how they scale up to be a collective
of coupled homeostats that can do very interesting things like navigate problem spaces and so on
and so what you really have here is an expansion of something I call the cognitive light cone
for any being and this is this goes back to my initial stated goal which is that we want a
framework where we can put anything we can compare anything in the same framework so whether it's
naturally evolved design whatever so in in any frame any any agent what what do all cognitive
systems have in common what do all agents have in common what they have in common is a certain
cognitive light cone which is the spatial and temporal size of the largest goal that they
can pursue so if you can only if you only care about the local concentration of some kind of
chemical and you have a little bit of memory and all all you're trying to do is optimize your local
constant chemical concentration you might be a bacterium or a tick as far as cognitive cognitive
light cone size is concerned so very small if you're a dog you have a bigger cognitive light
cone you have lots more memory going back you have some predictive ability going future
but you're never going to care about what happens three months from now in a town that's 10 miles
over it's just impossible for as far as we know it's impossible for for a dog to have that that
large scale of goals and so you have a bigger light cone but it's you know it's still delimited
if you're a human you might have you might be working towards goals that are planetary scale
for hundreds of years into the future in fact past your own lifespan and so you might have this
this enormous cognitive light cone and if you're some sort of an alien being or a future a future
human that has has a much bigger cognitive light cone you might you might be able to care for example
in the linear range about all the living beings on earth the humans can't do that we don't we don't
have the capacity to to scale our care linearly beyond us you know some some small number of
concerns but but but there could be potentially enormous minds that could that could literally
do that you know this kind of this kind of advanced form so so so all of us have these
cognitive light cones and evolution is a journey that of enlarging these light cones that that
then allow us to have bigger goals in different spaces and of course we are composite beings full
of other organisms other cells and and organs and cells all of which have their own different
sizes of light cones in different spaces so i'm going to end in a in a couple minutes with one
last thing i want to show you one one last thing which is a completely new organism and then and
then i'll and then i'll finish so i'm in after due disclosure again because josh bond guard and i
are scientific co-founders of fauna systems which works on computer design synthetic organisms
what we wanted to do was we wanted to ask how much plasticity do cells have to
navigate their various spaces okay and what could we could we um liberate wild type cells
from their normal normal environment and and ask them to reboot their their their multi-cellularity
what what would they do okay and so this is this is this is the experiment here and what happens
is that um this is uh we take um uh this is uh Doug blackistan and my group did did all the
did all the biology for this work and this was done in in collaboration with josh bond
guard's lab at university of vermont and his student sam kreigman did all the computational
aspects so so we take we take the uh the animal cap cells from this early frog and these are
skin these are these are fated to be uh to be epidermis of various types and we dissociate them
and then we put them in this little um this little depression and uh and we leave them overnight and
you want you wonder what might happen well they could die they could spread out they get away from
each other they could form a two-dimensional monolayer the way that cell culture does
instead what they do is uh overnight this is a time lapse they coalesce they come together
and they form this little um this little circular thing uh which has an interesting
property we call it a zenobot because zenopus lavis is the name of the frog and it's a biorebotics
platform so it's a biobot so we call it a zenobot what does this zenobot do well first of all it
swims uh on its own power we do not uh pace it or direct it in any way how does it swim you can
see that here it has little hairs these little hairs are normally used by the frog embryo to
distribute mucus on the surface of its body to to sort of keep the mucus flowing down
but but this thing these guys have figured out how to how to roll in opposite directions on either
