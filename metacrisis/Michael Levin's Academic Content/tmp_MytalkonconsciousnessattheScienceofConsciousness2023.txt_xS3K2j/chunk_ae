the more important thing?
And this is an example.
Midjourney is an AI system that I
asked to draw its vision of two synthetic organisms in love.
And this is what it drew.
So if anybody's interested, especially these two papers
are relevant, but there's a whole bunch of work on this.
And I want to thank all the people who
did the work that I showed you today
and all our many collaborators, of course, and our funders.
And I thank you for listening.
Thank you.
