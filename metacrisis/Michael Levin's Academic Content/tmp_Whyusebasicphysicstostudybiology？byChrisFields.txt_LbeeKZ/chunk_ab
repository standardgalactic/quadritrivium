representation of space time. Because it reveals the symmetries of space time, things like
translational invariance and rotational invariance and so on.
So a general question becomes, how does this work? How does this cycle work?
What sorts of systems can implement this cycle? Is it implemented by all living systems in some way?
And that's a large open problem. And if you look at phylogeny, and here I'm just showing
animal phylogeny, which is the tiny little edge of the whole phylogenetic tree, which is mostly
microbial. We only know anything about ontology, so we only know anything about the representation
of space time and objects, as far as I know, in three different parts of this huge phylogenetic
tree of animals. We know about them in the vertebrates. We know about them in the complex
cephalopods, like octopus. And we can know about them in some insects and spiders, for example,
honeybees. But we don't know anything about them, really, in almost all of phylogeny.
So this question of the extent to which living things employ a space time representation and
have some sense of what an object is, even a conspecific, for example, some way of tracking
objects through time, is a very open question. And it's hopefully a question that we can
address experimentally in more systems than just these three classes of systems where it's been
addressed so far. So with that, I think I'm actually close to out of time at least. I'll stop and just
say, if you find these issues interesting, there's the six hour version of this talk,
which is accessible through the Active Inference Institute. They're all on YouTube. Or it's an
explicit list of videos on my website, which is probably the easiest way to get to it. So thank
you very much. And I can answer any questions.
