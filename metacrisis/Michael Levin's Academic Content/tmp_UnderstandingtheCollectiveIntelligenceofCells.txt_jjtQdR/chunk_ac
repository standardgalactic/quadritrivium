to double back, but everything will move around until it lands in this correct orientation,
and then it stops.
So what evolution actually gave us is some kind of an error minimization scheme that
is able to make up for drastic defects.
This has massive implications for evolution, because it means that if you have mutations
that move your mouth off kilter or move your eye to your tail or do some kind of crazy
thing like this, it isn't necessarily the end.
And if they have other kinds of positive implications elsewhere in the body, now you get to explore
those, because these organs are fairly competent in getting where they need to go, connecting
up in the however they need to connect up and giving you some kind of functionality.
It tends to smooth the evolutionary landscape by a massive amount.
This whole kind of homeostatic process suggests that this basic emergent story that molecular
biology tells in the textbooks, basically that the standard view of things is this,
is that it's a feed-forward emergent process, basically that there are genes interacting
with each other, some of them make proteins that do things, they're sticky or they diffuse
or something, so there's this physics, and then there's this process of emergence.
So simple rules, executed in parallel over massive amounts of tiny agents give you an
emergent outcome.
And this is true, of course this is true, all of this does happen, but I think it's
massively incomplete, because one of the problems with this feed-forward kind of story is that
in addition to evolutionary issues, if you as an engineer or a bio-worker in regenerative
medicine, if you wanted to make a change up here, and this was truly a feed-forward process,
you would have no idea what to do back here, because reversing this is impossible, this
is a terrible inverse problem, and if you decided that you know I like this ax a little
but it's missing a leg, or instead I want it to be a three-fold symmetry instead of
bilateral symmetry, what genes would you change?
We have absolutely no idea how to reverse this, I don't think it's a solvable problem.
And as a result, the gains of things like genomic editing and CRISPR and so on, I think
are going to hit a glass ceiling, because for the vast majority of problems, we don't
know what to do down here.
So what we focus on in our group is these feedback loops, the idea that what's actually
going on here is that there are systems that measure error, they measure deviation from
a set point, and then they activate both at the genetic level and at the level of physics,
and this is what we'll talk about for the next bit, they try to get you closer to your
set point.
Now on the one hand, biologists of course know all about homeostasis and set points,
but there are two weird things going on here.
One is that the set point, unlike a typical biological set point, which might be metabolic
level or pH or temperature or something like that, this is a complex data structure, this
is some kind of anatomical descriptor of what this thing is supposed to look like.
How do you store that kind of set point?
The other thing is that it suggests that this whole system in a certain sense is goal-directed.
Now not magically so, but in a cybernetic sense, like a thermostat, but still, biology
doesn't, molecular biology and so on doesn't love discussing goals and things like that,
even though we now have a perfectly good engineering science of it.
What this kind of view does though is that it makes a very strong prediction, it predicts
that if we wanted to make changes up here, if this is all true and there is some kind
of a set point being stored and it's not purely feed-forward emergence, then what we
should be able to do is find how that set point is being stored, learn to read it, learn
to rewrite it, and then the cells would build something else without having to make any
changes to the hardware down here.
In other words, if it's true that there's some degree of reprogrammability, this idea
that the collective compares to a pattern memory, builds to that pattern, we could change
the pattern and not have to actually rewire the machine.
How general is this?
What else can these cells do?
You can see this now tying back into the themes that I started off with, touring and such.
For the next part of the talk, I want to show you an example of how this works because we've
been looking for this and we think we found it and we've started to learn to read and
write it.
The medium of all of this, maybe not terribly surprising for any neuroscientist, is bioelectricity.
How does this work in the brain?
Real quick, just the hardware looks like this, there's a collection of cells in the network.
They have ion channels which enable voltage states to exist and maybe propagate to their
neighbors via these electrical synapses known as gap junctions, so that's the hardware.
The commitment of neuroscience is that all of the electrophysiology that goes on, and
so this group made an amazing video of zebrafish brain activity in a live fish thinking about
whatever it is that fish think about, that the idea is that all of the memories, the
goals, the cognitive content of that mind is embedded in this electrical activity and
thus there's the idea of neural decoding.
If we understood the encoding, we should be able to read out the physiological activity
and then understand what the animal was thinking about or what its memories were and that kind
of thing.
It turns out that this same exact system works everywhere in your body, so this is an extremely
ancient set of tools that the evolution uses.
Every cell in your body has ion channels, most cells in your body have the exact same
electrical synapses, there are neural transmitter signaling in most tissues of the body and
so we can now think about a similar project.
What about neuroscience outside of neurons?
What if we could decode the electrical conversations that other cells were having with each other
and understand how this kind of electrical glue was functioning outside of the brain
and so this is an early frog embryo using very similar technology, we developed voltage-sensitive
dye imaging, so the colors are voltages, they're of course very slowly changing compared to
this, but you can, this is a time lapse over about 12 hours, you can see all the electrical
conversations that the cells have with each other and all the patterning that goes on.
Now we know what brains think about, they think about behavior in three-dimensional spaces
and maybe linguistic spaces, what does the rest of the body think about using that same
process?
Well, whereas in the brain what you have here is you have an electrical network issuing
commands to muscles to move the body through three-dimensional space, there's a very isomorphic
kind of picture where actually long before that what the system was doing was issuing
commands to individual cells to move the configuration of your body through morpho space, right?
So what we think evolution did was this was first and then what it simply did was to pivot
this whole thing to motion spaces instead of anatomical spaces.
So we started, we got our inspiration from neuroscience, we steal a lot of tools and
concepts from the neuroscientists and so here are some of the tools we use.
First of all, we can do the imaging to see what the electrical activity is, we do a lot
of quantitative simulation to understand how the voltages arise from the various ion channel
activity, here's what some of these things look like, this is an early frog embryo putting
its face together and one of the things you can see and so the grayscale here is the
bioelectric voltage potentials across the tissue and this is one frame from that tissue,
from that video, what you can see is that long before the genes turn on to actually pattern
the face and long before the face really appears, you can already read out a pre-pattern, a
bioelectrical pre-pattern of what the future face is going to look like, here's where the
mouth is going to be, here's where the eye is going to be, here are the placodes, I'm
showing you this one because it's the most obvious one to understand, there's other patterns
that we need a lot of decoding but this one's kind of simple, you can see exactly what it's
going to do and this pattern is functional, if I change the electrical properties of this,
if I draw using either optogenetics or other tools to draw on this, I can wipe out this
eye, I can put it somewhere else, I can change the location of the mouth, all of this is
actually determinative, this is the set point that guides future cell activity, so that's
a natural bioelectrical pattern, this is a pathological one, we'll talk about that momentarily
but this is the one, there's an incipient tumor which we injected a human oncogene and
before that tumor appears, you can already see the disruption where these cells are basically,
that oncogene causes them to electrically isolate from their neighbors and basically
at that point they're just amoebas treating the rest of the animal as external environment,
they just disconnect from everything, so we use the same tools that neuroscientists use
to control these electrical states, we can target the ion channels here, we can target
the gap junction, so we can control the topology of the electrical network, we can control
the specific states using optogenetics, using drugs, using ion channel mutations, no electric
fields, applications, no waves, no magnets, no electromagnetics, this is exactly what
neuroscientists do by controlling, by exploiting the actual interface that the system gives
us to manipulate the computations that it does, so how do we know this is of any use,
what happens when you do this, well there's one simple example, what we can do is I showed
you a bioelectrical pattern that tells the animal where to put its eye, so well we can
reproduce that pattern somewhere else by injecting ion channel genes, specific let's
say potassium channels somewhere else, and so you can introduce that pattern onto the
gut and that tells the gut cells, hey you need to make an eye here, and if you section
that eye you get all the right lens, right in the optic nerve, you get all that stuff,
now couple of interesting things, one is that the modularity is amazing because what we
actually introduce is a very low information content signal, we don't give all the information
that you need to know how to make an eye, what are all the 30 different cell types that
are inside the eye, we don't produce any of that, it's very modular, it's a subroutine
call, we say build an eye here and everything else, all the molecular cascades that actually
require to build an eye and make retinal cells and all that, all that's downstream, so that's
the first thing, it's highly modular, the second thing is that it has a really interesting
competency, one of them is that in this case what you're looking at, this is a cross section
of a lens, right here, sitting out in the tail somewhere of a tackle, and the blue cells
are the ones that we actually injected with our ion channel, so we told these blue cells
you need to make an eye, but there's not enough of them to make an eye, so very much like
ants in an ant colony, what they do is they know how to recruit their neighbors, what
they did is recruit a bunch of these brown cells which themselves were never touched
by us, they're completely normal body cells and they're able to say to these cells, we
need to make a lens here, there's not enough of us to make a lens, you're now going to
participate, and that same thing is studied by people who work on collective insects and
so on, this ability to gauge the sort of size of the project you're embarking on and recruit
other members of the swarm to work with you, so these cells certainly have the ability
to do that, you can make, using that same modulation we've discovered the code for things
like inner ear organs, so otocysts, hearts, so inducing ectopic hearts, extra forebrain,
extra limbs, here are some six-legged frogs here that you can see, and fins, now this
is interesting, tadpoles aren't supposed to have fins, that's more of a fish thing,
we'll get to that momentarily, and so one thing that we can do with this now that we're
starting to sort of uncover some of the native subroutines that are there is we can use this
in a regenerative medicine setting, so here's a frog, normally if a frog loses a leg here
by 45 days later there's nothing, frogs don't regenerate their legs at this stage on like
salamanders, but what we can do now is we can give it the signal that says hey you need
to rebuild this leg, and what happens here is that the way we do that is with a drug
that opens specific iron channels at the wound, it turns on the genes that you need to get
started on regeneration, by 45 days you've already got some toes, you've got a toenail,
eventually a very nice leg, which is touch sensitive and multile, so it's a very simple
approach to, again we're not reprogramming stem cells, we're not 3D printing any tissues,
this is that point about the programming I made earlier on, we do not want to interact
with the system at the lowest level by telling molecular pathways or cells what to do, we
want to discover the large scale subroutines and the large scale control structure that
allows us to say build a leg, so we are at this point in trials in rodents, I have to
do a disclosure here because this is Dave Kaplan and I are co-founders of Morphosuticals which
seeks to apply this kind of approach to regenerative medicine hopefully someday for humans, so
you can see that, that's kind of the applied side of the work, I want to switch to an amazing
example, which really is going to help us understand some more aspects of this, which
are that, these are the plenary, you can cut them into as many pieces as you want, I think
the record is like 275 or something like that, they're immortal, they have no lifespan limit,
they do not age, they're extremely resistant to cancer and they have the world's worst
genome, we can talk about what that means later on if we have time, but they have incredible
capacity for morphogenetic control, one of the interesting things is that, remember that
I promised you at the beginning that we would be able to look for the pattern memory, we
would look for that encoding of the set point, that anatomical set point that tells the cells
what do we build and when are we complete, so I want to show you a story where we can
rewrite that pattern memory and I've kind of shown you examples already, the thing with
the face and the eye is kind of an example, but I think this is even better, so here's
our plenary, it has one head and one tail, the anterior genes are up here, turned on
at the head, turned off at the tail, fine, and if I amputate head and tail, this middle
fragment reliably 100% of the time gives us a nice worm, now one of the things that we
did was to discover a bioelectric circuit that actually told the cells, this fragment, well
how many heads are you supposed to have, once the head and the tail are chopped off, which
end is the head or maybe both should be the head, how would you know, so we discovered
this electrical circuit and what we were able to do is to convert this perfectly normal
one headed animal to a state that once we cut it, it makes a two headed worm, this is
not Photoshop, these are real live animals and here's how it works, it's because if you
look at this fragment, it has this bio electrical pattern that says one head, one tail and that's
what the cells build, but what we can do is we can take using various ways to modulate
ion channels, we can convert this pattern to this pattern, now it's a little messy,
but you can see here the technology is still very much being worked out, but you can see
what's happening here, there are two, now the codes is two heads and sure enough, if
I now cut this animal, there he is, now here's a very important point that we need to understand,
this electrical map is not a map of this two headed creature, this electrical map is
a map of this one headed animal in which we have manipulated the electric circuit such
that the voltage looks like this, it sits there being one headed until it's injured
and at that point the cells consult this map and build this two headed worm, so the bio
electrical pattern is not a read out of the current anatomy, this is a, you can think
about this as a primitive counterfactual memory, this is a memory of something that is not
