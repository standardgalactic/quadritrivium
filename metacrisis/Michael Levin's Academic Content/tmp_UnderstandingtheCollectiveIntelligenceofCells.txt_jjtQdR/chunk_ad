happening right now, in fact may never happen, but if it does, if we get injured, this is
what a correct worm is supposed to look like and we will keep rebuilding until this is
the pattern we get, so this is an encoded set point, a single headed planarian body can
encode at least one of two different ideas of what a planarian is supposed to look like,
maybe no doubt more, we just said we found it, we found two, so this is very important,
this is the basics of counterfactual memory, this electric circuit can hold at least one
of two different representations of what correct planarian should look like and upon injury
the cells don't, this is their reference point, they have nothing else to gauge by, now why
do I keep calling it a memory, because like every good memory, it is not only rewritable
but it's long term stable, so if I take these two headed worms and now I amputate the head
and I amputate this other topic head and I leave just the nice normal mid fragment, no
more treatments of any kind, plain water, the genetics haven't been changed, we never
edited the genome, there's nothing wrong with the genetics of this animal, so you might think
that okay well once you've cut this off, now you'll go back to normal, and that's not what
happens, so these animals forever in perpetuity now generate two headed worms, so where is
the fact, where is it stored that they're now two headed worms, it is stored in the
electrical pattern distributed over the cells, that pattern has a memory property, once you've
changed it, it holds and in fact now we know how to change it back, so we can take that
pattern, change it back to a one headed and then you get a line of one headed animals,
so the answer to how, what determines how many heads Plinaria have is not really nailed
down by the genetics, what the genetics does is it gives you an electric circuit that by
default says one head, but that circuit is reprogrammable, you can change it to say two
heads and it will hold state as far as we can tell forever, and then you can sort of
flip it back and forth, so you can think of this as a distributed flip flop, and here
are these two headed Plinaria in their native habitat, so what we're doing now, so there's
a lot of computational work that needs to happen, one thing is that we're trying to map
out the bioelectric state space of that circuit to understand why certain parts of it correspond
to one head, two head and so on, and view that kind of regeneration as a kind of energy
minimization process, where basically what you're doing, and this will be familiar to
all of you who study this kind of stuff, to recover these pattern memories when they are
damaged, and so we really want to see if some of the tools of connectionist kinds of computer
science can help us understand what's going on here, the link between the physics of the
circuit and the information processing of memory, of recall, of energy minimization and so on.
Now, I want to show you how far we can go with this, so here I've shown you one head,
two head, I mean that's pretty cool, but these are normal heads that belong to these animals
anyway, but one thing you can do is you can push them into further attractors in that state
space that belong to other species, so I can take this triangular shaped worm with no genetic
change whatsoever, with completely normal hardware I can cause, just by disrupting that
electrical decision making when you cut off the head, they have to decide what the head
shape is, I can make flat heads like the Pifelina, we can make round heads like an S-Mediterranean,
or of course we can make the normal ones. The shape of the brain becomes just like these other
species, the distribution of stem cells in the brain becomes just like these other species,
they can access, a genetically normal set of cells can access other morphological attractors
if you push them that way along this bioelectrical interface.
You can even push them further and you can make, you can reach shapes that don't belong to
plenary at all, so you can make these kind of hybrid forms, you can make radially symmetrical,
you know sort of ski cap looking things, you can make these weird spiky forms, there's a tremendous
variety of anatomical forms that you can achieve if you interfere with the ability of these cells
to navigate morpho space, what they want to do is to reach this region of the morpho space,
and they're very good at it, but now that we found this electrical process by which they
navigate, we can push them into other areas. So what we're doing now is we're building some,
so we have a very biorealistic computational simulator of electrical activity, so we can
sort of look at the circuits at the tissue level, how do they rescale and all of that,
and then we're trying, the goal, long-term goal, is this kind of full stack model where we start
with the facts of which ion channels are expressed, so that's where the genetics plays out, and that's
your hardware, but then at the tissue level, what are all the voltage dynamics? They're really not
obvious because all of these channels, a lot of them are voltage gated, that's a voltage gated
current conductance, that's a transistor, so when you put these things into circuits,
all kinds of symmetry breaking loops, they have all, they can do memory as I just shown you,
they have all kinds of interesting computations, but very nonlinear, hard to predict, and so then
we want to understand this decision making of head versus tail versus what else, and to the point
where we get to an algorithmic model, so we're using some machine learning approaches to try and
extract actually kind of white box algorithmic models, so that then at this point we can say,
okay, but what would we need to do if we wanted a fatter worm or three heads or, you know,
somebody needed a new finger or a new eye or something like that? Okay, so for the last bit,
I'm just gonna finish up with a couple of things. I want to talk about very quickly
this idea of, because what I've shown you is the collective intelligence of individual cells
solving a very large-scale problem, they solve a problem that the individual cells don't have,
so I want to talk about this idea of scaling. This is what evolution does. Evolution takes
this kind of creature and enables them to connect with each other to solve problems
at the level of anatomical morphospace, so for example, if we don't have enough fingers,
we will know that the tissue knows that and can regenerate the right number of fingers,
then it stops. Individual cells have no idea what a finger is or how many fingers there are
or anything like that, but the collective does, and so what evolution does is this amazing scaling
up, but that process has a failure mode. That failure mode is known as cancer, so what happens in
cancer is that when individual cells disconnect from this electrical network, they go back to being
a single cell amoebas where their goals are now maximal proliferation and maximal metabolic gain
instead of having goals in anatomical morphospace, so this is human glioblastoma, these are cells,
crawling around in culture with no inclination to work hard towards these kinds of things.
So what happens is that the magic here is in these electrical connections, these gap junctions
that allow cells to share information very tightly, and in particular, their synapses,
they're called synapses because they are open and closed by prior experiences, meaning that
the information that moves through a particular synapse also feeds back because of their voltage
sensitivity to open and close that synapse, so you have this kind of activity-dependent memory,
and so that allows a tissue to have much larger cognitive light cones in terms of how much do
they remember, how much can they anticipate, how much can they measure than individual cells,
that's the scale-up, and so another biomedical application that we're working on is to force
that connection, so here is this, we inject an oncogene, so normally it would make a tumor,
here it is, the oncogene is blazingly expressed, in fact it's all over the place here,
but there is no tumor because what we've done is we've co-injected a very specific ion channel
that forces that cell to remain an electrical connection with their neighbors, so when you
force them, even if the genetics are screwed up, so I've shown you a number of examples where
the genetics is diverting from the actual outcome, what the hardware says is one thing,
but you can make changes, and we have lots of other examples of fixing birth defects and other
things in software by temporary electrical states that push the system in a way that
it normally wouldn't have done, and so this is a tumor normalization technology that we're also
trying to move to a medical outcome, so what we're trying, the big mystery here, what we're
trying to do now is to make computational models of local homeostatic loops that started out in
bacteria by managing pH and metabolics and things like that, and show how by connecting these, so
basically what you have is a network of homeostats, so you have a network of these things that are
able to control local variables towards set points, and by connecting them you are enabling the
collective to now do the same thing, but in a much much different space, and so this is the
kind of big area where we need to understand lots more, and so these are the kind of models
that we're thinking about. Okay, so for the last kind of couple of minutes, I want to talk about
this idea of novel organisms, so we wanted, oh, and I have to do another disclosure, this is we
also have a spin-off company for biorebotics called Fauna Systems, and this is all the work
with Josh Baumgart at University of Vermont, with whom we've started this thing, the Institute for
Computationally Designed Organisms. We wanted to ask a simple question, how far does this plasticity
go? I've shown you that normal embryos are able to adapt to changes of cell number, cell shape,
amount of DNA, but also you can push them to make, you can make worms with the heads that belong to
other species and worm bodies that are just not normal plenaria worms, so how far does that plasticity
go? And in particular, if you take cells away from their normal context, can they reboot their
multicellularity? What will they do? And so we did this experiment, I'm going to pause this right
here, so this is a frog embryo in cross-section, if you take off this top part here, these all of
these cells up here are going to be skin, they're all faded to be different kinds of epidermis,
and so we asked this question, if I take these cells, I disassociate them,
I put a little drop of them in a separate environment away from all of this stuff, so
I'm not, we're not adding any kind of, and by the way the person who physically does this is
Doug Blackiston in our group, he's a staff scientist who perfected a lot of these protocols,
we're not adding synthetic biology constructs, we're not changing the DNA, we're not putting
any weird nano materials, we're engineering by subtraction, we're taking away the instructive
signals from all of this stuff, and so what would they do? Well, they might die, they might spread
out and sort of crawl away from each other, they might form a two-dimensional monolayer like cell
culture, we don't know, but those are some things they might do, instead what they do is, so here
these are loose cells, this is time-lapse, so overnight they sort of come together and they
merge into this little thing, this little round thing, the flashes or calcium flashes, we'll talk
about that momentarily, what does it do? So this is a little ball of skin, what does a little ball
of skin do? Well the first thing it does is, it takes little hairs that are normally used on the
skin to move the mucus down the body of the animal, and it uses those hairs to swim, it rose
through the media by pushing the little hairs in opposite directions to the left and right of a
midline that it can organize, here you can see some behaviors, so they can go in circles, they can
sort of patrol back and forth, they can hear some tracking data on group behavior, so this guy's going
on kind of a long journey, these are interacting with each other, then sometimes they sit still
for long periods of time, they have autonomous motion, this is what they look like in a maze,
so this is a water maze, there's no flow, there are no gradients, it's just still spring water,
it goes down here, it takes the corner without having to bump into the outside wall, so it doesn't
have to bump into anything, it just follows the corner, and then around this at this point, let's
play it again, so remember this is just skin, there are no brain, there's no brain, there's no nervous
system, so it takes this corner, and at this point for some reason that we don't know, internal
behaviors, it turns around and goes back where it came from, doesn't want to keep going anymore,
so they have a range of behaviors, if you ask what does the calcium signaling look like, again no
neurons here, but the skin is actually very active with very brain-like dynamics, which we are now
analyzing using information theory and things like that, to see what's going on and whether they
might be talking to each other, they have regenerative capacity, so if I cut it in half,
they will try to fold up to their new xenobot shape, with the amazing force to the 180-degree hinge
that they have to deploy to fold themselves up, and the most amazing thing that they do is this,
this is, so Josh and his student Sam Creedman did computational simulations of these guys in a
virtual world with different shapes that we, you know, that Doug was able to actually make,
and we saw something very interesting that in the computational kind of simulation,
one of the things they do is they rearrange the particles in their environment
into specific shapes, that was a prediction of the simulation, so we tried, we gave them some
particles, what did we give them, we gave them cells, loose cells, this is the white stuff,
the snow here, that those are loose cells, and what you see is that the xenobots run around,
they corral these particles into little piles, and then they sort of continue to polish those
little piles until they become kind of these circular things, and then because what we did
was we gave them skin cells, these little piles became the next generation of xenobots, and so
guess what, when they matured, they went and did the same thing, and they created the next generation
of xenobots, so this is Von Neumann's dream, this is a machine that runs around and makes copies
of itself from particles that it, or the parts that it finds in its environment, the only reason
this trick works, of course, is because like evolution, and like us, it's working within a
gentle material, it's working with cells that are not passive pebbles, but are actually materials
that when you collect them into a little pile, they already have the competency of becoming
a xenobot, so it actually takes very little to get this reproductive cycle happening,
so the last couple of things I just want to say is this, we can learn some interesting things from
this, this is the standard Xenopus lavas genome, the standard frog, if you only observe standard
development, you are really lulled into a false sense of security, you're given the idea that,
well, acorns always make oak trees, frog eggs always make frogs, the genome determines morphology,
this is what they can make, they make an embryo that has a certain set of developmental sequences
and then a certain behaviors, that's what this hardware makes. Actually, if you liberate these
skin cells, so what do skin cells know how to do? Well, of course, they know how to be a boring
two-dimensional outer layer on this animal, keep out the bacteria, that's it, well, that's what
they do when the other cells sort of bully them into that role, the instructive interactions
from the other cells are what's constraining the capacity of these skin cells to sit quietly as
the outer layer and that's that. On their own, given the ability to escape these instructive
interactions, they're actually capable of much more, they make a xenobite, they undergo a
developmental sequence over the next two months, they become this thing, I don't know what the
heck this is, they have their own kind of weird developmental trajectory and their behaviors
are things like making copies of themselves via kinematic self-replication. Now, this is interesting
because for every other creature on earth, if you were to ask why does it have a certain shape,
a certain behavior, how does it be able to do whatever it is that it does, the answer is always
the same, well, years of selection, right, eons of evolutionary pressure to do this or that,
there's never been any xenobots, there's never been any evolutionary pressure to be a good
xenobot, to do kinematic self-replication to any of the behaviors that they do and the morphology,
there's never been any pressure for that. So, where does this come from, right, this plasticity,
this amazing fact that evolution gave us this genome that very reliably does this, but it also
can do this and who knows what else, right, I think we're just scratching the surface. So,
I'm going to end here and just say that the main points, I think, that are emerging from all our
work, including many things I didn't show you, is this. Evolution tends to build generic problem
solving machines, which because of this kind of compression of complex bodies into a single cell
during sexual reproduction, really enables some amazing hardware that exploits aspects of physics
and computation that doesn't try to pre-code everything. And development shows us that these
kind of agents in morphospace and in other spaces really have to deal with whatever they're given
at the beginning. They are not, in the large part, they are not tied to a very specific, very tight
set of initial conditions. And we can also talk about, there's this intelligence ratchet that's
formed because that competency actually hides a lot of genomic fitness information from evolution.
So, a lot of the effort goes into that competency, actually, as opposed to the hardware.
And the physiology, especially the bioelectrics, can navigate various problem spaces with all
kinds of competencies, all kinds of interesting competencies. And then, synthetic bioengineering
tells us that life, because of all of this, life is extremely interoperable. We can make any kind of
combination of hardware, software. This is one of my favorite kind of videos. This is an early
