Thanks to Dustin Erdash for helping with the DISI grant
application process, which would help expand the scope of our
survey to new participants.
So we can deal with one of those limitations that we mentioned and
get a wider range of people in.
And Mike Eleven for helping with the survey construction and
distribution.
That's all.
So if you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer.
