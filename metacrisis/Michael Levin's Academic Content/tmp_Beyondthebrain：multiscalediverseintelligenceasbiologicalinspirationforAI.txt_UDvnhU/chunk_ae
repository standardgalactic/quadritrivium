It can actually do six different kinds of learning including associative conditioning
So is it is it highly intelligent? No
Can it do associative learning and is associative learning a kind of intelligence somewhere on the spectrum of the kinds of things we mean?
I would say so, but we didn't know that until we did the experiment
We tried to train it and we observed what it can do. So when you brought up the weather
I think that's actually really interesting and I've made this this exact claim about the weather at the moment
We have no idea. Why because nobody's tried training the weather. It is I do not think we know right whether or not if you tried
Uh, certain kinds of behavioral kinds of paradigms things that come from
Behavioral science we we would then find out. No, actually the weather doesn't have any kind of learning capacity
So it's it's zero or extremely low or we would find that. Oh, whoa, it actually
Much like this genetic network that people these these biological
Transcriptional networks that people thought we hadn't had none of this in fact have some so I I you know
I kind of I just insist on two things one is that
Uh, we that this is a matter for experiment not for armchair kind of um
Yeah, I don't think we can have feelings about systems as to whether they should be intelligent or not
We have to do experiments which means you make a claim about what type of like like this is one
I have a different actually um a different scale that I came up with but this is this is wieners is fine, too
Uh, you you pick where you think it is on this and then you see whether your model gives you better prediction and control
Versus somebody else who picks a different spot on the spectrum
So, you know as long as we stick to to to empirical experiments then we can find out what kind of intelligence anything has
Thank you
