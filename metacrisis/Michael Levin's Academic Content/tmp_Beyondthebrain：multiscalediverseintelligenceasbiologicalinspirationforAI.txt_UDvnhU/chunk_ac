This is a map of this one-headed animal
So it's basically you can think about this as a primitive form of counterfactual memory the
A kind of very simple form in morpho space of what we like about brains
Which is this ability to time travel to to to have memories and predict and make predictions about things that are not true right now
So even though anatomically this animal has one head and one tail
If you were to look to see what is what is your idea of what the correct planarian looks like that's very clear
It's two heads. So if you get injured, that's what you'll do if you don't get injured nothing happens
It's a latent memory that doesn't get activated. So when I talk about
The collective of cells being a real a collective intelligence
This is what I mean the it we can literally read the memories that it has at least in in some cases
Such as this and we know now very much like in the brain that the same hardware
The same hardware is capable of having one of two different ideas of what a correct planarian looks like
It's it's a representation of a future
Morphological state the goal of its movement through morpho space if it's called upon to move through morpho space
Now I keep calling it a memory because
If you cut these animals, so so here's our two-headed worm you cut off the primary head
You cut off this crazy ectopic secondary head you take this middle fragment and you might think well
The genetics are untouched in plain water as you just go back to normal and make one head one tail
That's not what it does the circuit the electrical circuit that keeps this information
Has has memory. Um, in fact, it has all the properties of memory. It's long-term stable
It's rewriteable by experience not by not by hardware manipulation, but by experience
It has latency which I just showed you or conditional recall and it has two possible behaviors
So what happens is as far as we can tell in perpetuity once you make these two-headed animals
They stay two-headed even though their genome is wild type and and we now know how to make them go back
We can actually reset the circuit. So it's kind of like a
Almost a flip-flop where we can kind of go back and forth between
That circuit and coding one state one head or two head kinds of states and here you can see this is a video
You can see these these two-headed animals
Hang it out. So, um, not only can you can you take this this kind of machine and tell it how many heads it's supposed to have
You can actually tell it what kind of head to have
So here's uh, here's a planarian with normally a triangular head shape like this
What we can do is amputate the head
And then treat the rest of the tissue in a way that uh, basically using a general anesthetic that just all it does
So general anesthetics among other things uncouple gap junction
So they uncouple these electrical synapses and when you uncouple them what happens is the individual cells are still alive
But things like global kind of kind of global computations go away
And then when you pull them out of the the the um, when you put them out of the compound
They settle down, but they don't always settle into the same state
Actually, this is true in in for example humans as well
There are there are the reason that they don't like giving general anesthesia to people
Is that some people have psychotic breaks because the brain does not come back to the same state
It's actually to me kind of miraculous that it ever comes back to the same state if you sort of uncouple all the activity
But what you can do here with these guys is uh, when when when they come back
They sometimes come back flat headed like this pifalina
sometimes they come back round headed like this S. Mediterranean and uh,
The the the evolutionary distance here is between between these guys and the actual um species. It's about 150 million years
So without genetic change you can explore different attractors in morpheus space that other species
Live in naturally, you know and and maybe this this this may be how the speciation happened
We we we don't know and it's not just the shape of the head
It's also um
The shape of the brain and the distribution of stem cells are exactly the same as these other species
So you get you get the idea of this this incredible uh reprogrammability and plasticity that goes beyond the default
kinds of robust behaviors that um that that the standard
machine does after uh after development and um, not only that but you can explore regions of the latent space
Uh that are very far from normal plan areas. So here's your normal plan area
We can make these crazy spiky forms. We can make something that's cylindrical has a different
Kind of a symmetry body plant symmetry. You can make these these kind of uh hybrid forms
and the thing is that uh, a lot of biological uh kinds of um
Hardware is extremely reprogrammable. So this is these these kinds of things if you've ever seen them in the wild
these are called galls and
There's a there's a wasp embryo that's that's in there
But these are not made of the wasp cells. These are made of the leaf cells of the plant
So normally the these cells what they normally do is they make you this nice flat leaf and people who are focused on
On genetics and molecular biology will say well, that's what the genome encodes is is the ability to make these flat leaves
But in fact, it's very easily hacked by uh by this parasite that gives them signals
To form something completely different, right? So the morphology. So these leaf cells are in fact able to form something like this
It's just that they normally don't so um
I want to now start to start to pull back and try to really really talk about uh, what we mean by
A collective intelligence in whatever space it's acting in so this is what happens during evolution is that the
Components like this which are very competent at very local tiny little goals. So metabolic goals
Things that little the things that individual cells do
Using bioelectricity and other types of modalities including chemical signaling, of course by mechanical signaling
They scale up to systems that have much bigger goals. So this system has
Has the ability to try to reach this goal something like organogenesis
Despite all kinds of perturbations that i've shown you and so on so there's there's this scale up of there's a there's a flip
In space so so this now is in morpho space
And there's a scale up of the kinds of goals that it can achieve
But that process of course has failure modes and that failure modes is cancer
So this is this is human glioblastoma in a dish
What happens is that um individual cells when they electrically disconnect from their neighbors and that can be caused by a variety of factors
At that point they basically just revert back to their unicellular past. They are no longer
interested or capable of of understanding
What the the behavioral cues that?
Bind all of them towards these kind of larger scale construction projects
And they go back on their own at that point the rest of the animal is just amoeba
Is just an environment to these to these amoebas and that's metastasis and so um
there's a there's a
The utility of of these kinds of uh this kind of thinking where you think about um
These these cancer cells are not more selfish. It's just that their cells are smaller
The computational boundary has shrunk to the level of a single cell and that leads you naturally to some new therapeutics
So for example here you can see when you induce a human oncogene into these tadpoles
And they're going to make a tumor even before the tumor forms
You can already see these these bioelectrical
Disconnections of these cells from the network you know exactly where the tumor is going to be
And if you co-inject an ion channel that forces the cells
To remain in electrical communication doesn't kill the cells doesn't fix the the genetic mutation
And you can see that here the oncogene is blazingly expresses and it can be a nasty
K-RAS mutation or a p53 or whatever. In fact, it's all over the place
There's no tumor because what drives the whole collective outcome is uh is is the
The behavior of the of the network the the individual cells are are actually much less important here
And so you can try to re expand that sort of cognitive
boundary uh to
To to try to get the cells connected with each other and to pursue organogenesis and so on
So this this issue of these these cognitive boundaries between right the the the boundary between self and outside world
In a standard human you would think it's very simple, right? It's it's what there's our human
There's there's where the body ends. Although, uh, you know, this this idea of the extended the extended mind, right?
handy clerks and and and those kind of ideas are are already stretching that but but it's really it's really more fundamental
If if if you didn't already know what a human was and somebody
Somebody showed you a a brain, you know, this this, you know, this
Three and a half or whatever pound mass. Um, how many
Individual cells would you say are in there? You really don't know because we don't have a way of saying, you know per per pound
This is how many this is how much real estate it takes to make a self and the same thing is true of embryo genesis when you
This is this is a deep problem of of uh
an individual
an individual emergent system arising from a sea of uh components
This is this is an embryonic blasted arm, right? It's it's an early let's say 50 000 cells and you look at it and you say
Well, that's an embryo and when you look at it given that there's 50 000 cells you can ask yourself
Well, first of all, what are we counting?
What what is an embryo as as distinct from the the individual cells we're looking at?
And can we guess how many embryos are present in any particular blasted arm?
And usually the answer is one and so you might and just like usually there's there's seemingly one individual in a in a in a brain
But it doesn't have to be one and what can happen is this and
I used to do these experiments myself as a grad student
You can take an an avian or a mammalian blasted arm and you take a little needle and you make a little
You make some scratches in it and what happens is when you make these scratches
Each domain that can't temporarily because the scratches will heal well temporarily
Will self organize into a new embryo and when the scratches do heal you end up with conjoined twins
And so you will have these regions each of them as a separate embryo
Then there's some disputed zones, which is kind of interesting these cells that don't quite know who they belong to but
A particular blasted arm can give rise to zero one or several individuals
Now in the in the case of morphogenesis, what are individuals?
Well, they are collections of cells that are bound to a common purpose
They're going to make a specific thing meaning they're going to move to the right region of
Morphous space is going to have two eyes and then you know four limbs and then various other things
And that's what we're counting. We're counting independent goal following systems and in this sort of
Excitable medium there can be multiple depending on the dynamics multiple numbers of them. It's not genetically determined
I mean usually it's one but it doesn't have to be one and this is this is true in brains as well
Where we see split brain patients and various dissociative disorders. There's no guarantee that in that medium. There's one individual and so
What what we're interested in is is kind of merging
these ideas of understanding the the bioelectric circuitry and the
Attractors and the other the other kind of features of that of that state space and merging them with with ideas about
How memories are stored in electrical networks?
What it means when we can recover portion of that information after damage and and of course the dynamical systems approaches to this and so on
And so what we really need and this is this is very active kind of work in our lab now
Is to understand the scaling where we start with individual tiny little competent subunits
Which can do homeostatic things like keep pH and hunger level and so on so so individual cells
And then you bind them together into networks that have particular policies for spreading signals back and forth
and we can talk about what some of those important policies are and as a result of this what you get is a
um an increase in what we call the cognitive light cone the the size of the the maximal spatiotemporal size
Of the biggest goal that it can hang on to or they can that it can pursue
So individual cells pursue little tiny goals collections of cells pursue bigger goals and so on
Now now when we talk about these these kind of the size of these goals
Typically if we ask well, where do they come from and and this the standard answer is well evolutionary selection, of course
You get them you get them from evolution
But what about novelty and we have examples like this?
And I can show you much more on this but but I don't have too much time left
These are um what we call zenobots zenopus lavis is the name of the frog
And we can use frog skin cells to make something to make a biological robot or a biobot called a zenobot
These little these little things running around are just skin
They're just frog skin that was liberated from the rest of the animal rebooted into a new kind of
Critter with a new behavior. This is a very interesting. They have many new behaviors
But here's one if you provide them with a bunch of loose cells
What they will do is they will run around and
Collect these cells into little balls and sort of polish them like this and because the little balls are not passive
They're um, they're a gentle they're an agential material just like the original
They will mature into the next generation of zenobots and continue to do the same thing
So this is a kinematic self replicating system. This is kind of von Neumann's dream
You know a robot that goes around and finds um materials in the environment and builds copies of itself
But the the the the interesting thing here is that there's never been evolutionary selection to do this
No other animal does kinematic self replication
When you look at these skin cells in vivo, you might think well
The only thing they could possibly know how to do is to be this boring two-dimensional layer that keeps the bacteria out
You know on the on the on the outer side of uh, uh of these embryos
But in fact liberated from those instructive cues you get to find out that actually
They can do all kinds of things by themselves and they have uh within about 48 hours
They uh, they they exhibit reproductive behavior
That's completely different to how frogs normally reproduce because we've made it impossible for them to reproduce their normal way
This is just skin. I can't do any of that other stuff. So so this the the ability of all the parts to have coherent
Uh novel behaviors and to solve new problems that were not actually anywhere in the training set is is really interesting here and
um for that reason
This incredibly large option space, you know, all of all of the natural model systems of of biology are here
Including brains that that we like to get inspiration from but all this other stuff
So hybrids and cyborgs and hybrids of various kinds, you know, every combination of of cellular material
Designed engineered material and software is some kind of viable agent
So there's there's this huge kind of option space of of novel um intelligences that I think we really need to mine
Uh as in in addition to whatever uh insights we can get from from standard brains. And so um in the end
I'm just gonna close here with a couple of thoughts. Uh, this idea that um non neural bioelectricity
Is a kind of cognitive glue from for for collective intelligence in morphogenetic space
Exactly as it serves as the cognitive glue to neurons in the brain and in traditional behavioral space
Um, I I think it has some some interesting things uh to say to neuroscience in terms of the origins of the amazing things that neuroscientists study
And vice versa and we you know, we certainly benefit from from all of the uh from all the insights of the field
And the same thing with with AI, you know, I think that uh, there are some just this idea of diverse intelligence in
unconventional embodiments is a really powerful set of inspirations for um, creating creating novel robotics
No novel AI systems that are not specifically not neuromorphic that are looking at more basic
Fundamental principles and all of this kind of stuff. So so you know, we we kind of appropriate
A lot of ideas I could show you date on on perceptual by stability in morpho space
Plenaria that can't decide if they want one head or two and so they sort of shift back and forth and so on
Many many deep areas of intersection here among these three fields. And so from all this this this kind of these ideas about
These ideas about
How individual pieces come to to be a single coherent thing give us some suggestions for
