Well, thank you so much and thank you especially to the organizers for allowing me to share some thoughts with you all
This has been an amazing symposium for lots of interesting ideas
And in particular we've heard a lot about the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience
and so what I'd like to do is
Talk about some ideas of that borrowed from neuroscience and deployed outside the brain and in particular this idea that
Biology offers if we want to use biology and as an inspiration for AI
Biology offers many many interesting contexts that are not brains
And so I'd like to sort of pull us away from the neuroscience of the brain and think of some other things
And if anybody wants to reach me later all of the primary data the papers every software everything else is is here
so
Many many discussions still to this day
Take place in the context of this very old idea that this is of course
Adam naming the animals in the garden of Eden this idea that that there's a specific natural kind called the human brain
And it does various things and we would like to of course
You mind that for insights as to how we can create intelligence
But one of the things that is really critical to note is that if we take developmental biology and evolution
seriously all of us
began life as single-cells and
Whether on an evolutionary time scale or a developmental time scale
There's a continuum here and these and these this these transformations are very slow and continuous
Of course, we can try to pick out what we call great transitions and try to impose some sort of fate phase transition on these
But the underlying biology is very smooth and continuous and then of course now we have this additional axis of manipulations we can make
Where where we can step away from the standard human architecture and both with technological
hybrids and with with biological modifications make any sort of combination that you want and so
In our lab, we think very very very hard about these kinds of issues
Where does intelligence come from and how does it scale up through these kinds of?
transformations so the the important thing about us is that we and I think all
Intelligence is really our collective intelligence is so what you're seeing here. This is a single cell
This is what we're made of although this of course is a unicellular organism
We call the lacrimarium. There's no brain. There's no nervous system
But it's it's handling all of its local needs in in one cell
So you see, you know, if you're into soft robotics or things like this the level of control and morphological computation here
Is remarkable and all of us made this journey across the Cartesian cut
We all started life as quote-unquote just physics
So a little pile of chemicals a quiescent oocyte and then there's this slow and remarkable process of embryonic development
That produces something like this or perhaps even something like this and so at some point
You know, we have we have folks who will say that well
We we are certainly conscious and and we have certain level of cognition and of course
An oocyte many people will say is not and so then they they owe a story of how you get from here to here
Given how slow and continuous this process actually is and so what I want to do for the for the next couple of minutes
Is just talk about some interesting biology that isn't the standard thing that that we're all used to these are examples
That aren't usually covered in typical neuroscience AI kind of crossovers
So one thing that you should be looked at is this kind of example where you have a caterpillar
This is a soft-bodied robot. It lives in a two-dimensional world of crawling on and eating leaves
And then it needs to become this which is a hard-bodied robot
Which flies in three-dimensional space and has a completely different brain what happens in between is that the brain is basically
Taken apart most of the cells are killed off all the connections are broken everything is basically liquefied
rebuilt from scratch and
The amazing thing is that actually there's there's data showing that moths and butterflies
Retain the memories of the original caterpillar and so despite the fact that the medium is
radically
Radically altered the memories actually remain so that's an interesting fact about this biological architecture that
We have to keep in mind if we're going to try to make something similar that also raises interesting questions
You know never mind. What's it like to be a butterfly right for people who are into consciousness?
What's it like to be a caterpillar turning into a butterfly during your lifetime not just the evolutionary timescale
But actually during your lifetime a radical reconstruction of your cognitive medium. This is goes even further with plenaria
So these are flatworms
I'll talk about them more in a few minutes
But the salient fact about plenaria is that this this system can be cut into many pieces the record is something like I think
275 or something like that and
Every piece will will rebuild regenerate and give rise to a perfect little worm
So what McConnell discovered and we validated using modern techniques
Recently is that if you train a plenarian and plenaria have a centralized brain the same neurotransmitters that you and I do
If you train the plenaria on a specific task you amputate the head
The tail sits there doing nothing for about 10 days
Regrows a brand new brain at which point behavior resumes and then you can show that it still has the original information
So not only is the information stored
Somewhere else in the body possibly in some sort of distributed holographic form. We don't know
But it can also be imprinted onto the new brain as the brain develops
So you see this this this tight interaction between between morphogenesis the shaping of of the cognitive organs
And the information the behavioral knowledge that is spread and moves throughout
Throughout tissues and this kind of plasticity is not just for invertebrates
Vertebrates have it too. This is a tappel of the frog Xenopus lavas. Here's the mouth here the nostrils
Here's the brain the gut and what you'll notice is that it's missing the primary eyes
So we've we've made this particular embryo to not have any primary eyes
But we did put some eye cells on the tail not only do they go on to make a perfectly nice eye
Even though it's surrounded by muscle instead of next to the brain where it belongs
But actually these animals can see quite well
So we've made we've made a device that trains them on visual tasks and automates the whole process
And and we can see that even though this this eye does not connect to the brain
It makes an optic nerve that sometimes synapses on the spinal cord sometimes goes up here to the gut
But these animals can see so this this does not take
Long periods of evolutionary adaptation in in one generation this animal finds itself with a radically altered
Sensory motor architecture. No problem. It's getting
The brain is getting this weird these weird signals from some itchy patch of tissue on its tail
And it can treat that as visual data and learn in visual
Assays so so so remarkable and we'll get to the we'll get to this
This this notion that what evolution is giving us here is a kind of um
Problem-solving machine. It's not something that's just just knows how to do one thing
It can very rapidly adapt to novel configurations in morphological space
And so the the way that biology does this is that
Not only structurally but actually
Functionally we are all nested dolls at every level of organization from the swarm to the organ tissue cell and
molecular network level all of these layers are
Problem-solving types of processes. So so we so I call this a multi-scale competency architecture
with the idea that
Some of the same navigation policies are being used to solve problems in different spaces
Metabolic spaces transcriptional spaces morphological spaces and then of course the familiar
3d behavioral space of running mazes and then doing things like that. So so each each of these layers is its own
Kind of kind of problem-solving system
And this is this is why there's another talk that I give to students sometimes called why robots don't get cancer
And that's because we we don't have very many architectures yet
Where the individual parts have their own agendas and thus there's this failure mode whereby
They can be decoupled from the from the collective top-down agenda and sort of go off on their own and make a tumor and do other things
So so that that's that's the risk of this architecture. That's the failure mode
But but what you gain is is incredible plasticity and robustness
and so what i'm interested in as far as
understanding how these things help us to to recognize and to build
intelligences is
Something like like this to develop a framework where we can abstract the notion of intelligence and for this audience
I think I think that's very easy for for other audiences. This is this is a hard leap to make
Uh
Step away from the idea that intelligence is something that large
Large brains do and have a more kind of cybernetic approach where and i'm certainly not the first person to suggest this
You know, here's here's a rosin bluth wiener and bigelow trying for a kind of hierarchy of of of cognitive capacities all the way from passive
Behavior up to human level metacognition and so on so in in our group intelligence
We understand intelligence in the way that william james said which is
Roughly the ability to reach the same goal by different means and the degree of sophistication of those means and the degree to which
You can handle various perturbations along the way is is how you gauge
The type and the and the amount of intelligence and as as somebody said once um
It's sort of it describes the continuum between two magnets trying to get together and romeo and julia trying to get together
Right what what what mechanisms exist on all the different systems on that continuum to help them do what they need to do
so, um, of course, we're all very good at as many animals are at recognizing intelligence in
The three-dimensional world right so so medium-sized objects moving at medium speeds doing things
We very easily recognize as having agency and
And and having intelligence but actually there are many other spaces in which biology has been solving problems long before
Brains showed up and so imagine if if we had an innate sense of our blood chemistry
Or if we had an innate sense of various gene expression profiles, we would have no trouble at all
Intuitively recognizing our various organs our various cells as navigating those spaces with very significant competency and then right now
We you know, we just not we're just not primed for that. So i'm going to um
spend most of my time talking about this morpheus space uh the the behavior of a collective intelligence of cells in this morphological
space, but um one one idea that we've been playing with is that what basically has happened is that evolution
Has basically pivoted some of the same strategies
Across all kinds of different problem spaces all the way from metabolic and physiological spaces up through anatomical space
Classic behavioral space and then maybe linguistic uh be the linguistic space as well
And so i just want to show you a few examples of of what i mean by these unconventional
intelligences, so this is a sly mold
This is this is called the fissar and polycephalum and
What we've done is we've placed the sly mold here in the middle
By the way, the sly mold is unicellular. It's one cell. It can get very large, but it's just one cell
And what we've done is we've placed one disc one glass disc over here
Three glass discs over here and this is just one example out of out of a paper
Where where we did this many many times and it has a very interesting behavior
By the way, these glass discs are completely inert. There's no food. There are no gradients
Now they're just they're just glass and so so what happens is that uh for the first for the first few hours
It's sort of the sly mold sort of grows like this and at this point
There's no obvious indication that it's going to do anything other than continue symmetrically growing
But during this time it turns out that what it's been doing is gathering information about its environment
The way it does that is by gently squeezing it continuously pulses
The the the medium that it's on and reads back the strain angle of the signals that it gets
And what it does after that is it grows towards the larger mass and you can do all kinds of interesting tricks about stacking the
The glass discs one on top of the other you can you can you can get the thing tilted and do various things to confuse it
but this is what it does here it gathers information and
Boom at that point right right right right here's where you can now tell that it's decided what it's going to do
so this is this is kind of interesting these spaces that we talk about are
They're our abstraction right because behavior for this system is morphological change
So this is kind of a transitional form in which behavior and control of morphology are the same
But that's the sort of thing this single single celled organism can do
Here's another here's another type of intelligence
These we discovered something interesting in these planaria where if you put planaria in a
Solution of barium barium chloride what the barium does is it's a non-specific ion channel blocker a potassium channel blocker
To be to be more precise
And so what that means is that all the cells especially the cells in the head which have to exchange potassium
So all the neurons are extremely unhappy. They literally their heads literally explode in this barium
So overnight it's called deep progression to boom their their heads explode
But if you leave them in the barium something amazing happens and a couple weeks later
They will grow a new head and the new head is completely barium adapted doesn't care about barium at all no problem
So we asked a simple question. We took these barium adapted heads
We took the primary original heads and we simply
Asked what what gene expressions are different?
What what does this what does this new head do in terms of gene expression that's different from this head?
And there's only there's only a handful of genes that are actually different
And what they allow these cells to do is to do their physiological business despite not being able to pass potassium
That that's a pretty significant change, but there's only a handful of genes now the the kicker to all this is that
Plenarium never experience barium in the wild. That's that it's just not ecologically
realistic
There's never been an evolutionary history of of pressure for knowing what to do when you're hit with barium
And so I always think about this problem as kind of like being trapped in this in this
Nuclear reactor control room the things melting down there are you know, what 20,000 or however many genes there are buttons
And you're faced with this no novel stressor. How do you know?
Which thing is going to improve your physiological situation?
You certainly don't have the cells don't turn over very fast. So you don't have time to for to for random search
You don't really have time for gradient descent
We we don't know we don't know how this works
Maybe there's some sort of generalization from other types of things like epileptic
Excitotoxicity that that maybe they do have but it's it's an amazing ability to walk through that transcriptional space
In a way that efficiently allows you to solve for a completely novel
Physiological stressor so I've shown you a couple of examples of of problem solving in in these in these unusual spaces
But what I want to spend the most of my time doing is talking about morpho space morphogenesis
And it's and it's interesting this this idea of morphogenesis as being relevant to
The problem of intelligence is not new so
Obviously the Alan Turing needs no introduction. He was interested in problem solving machines intelligence through
plasticity reprogrammability and so on but you may or may not know that
He also wrote this he wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis
Now why would somebody who was interested in intelligence and machines
Be interested in the chemistry of spontaneous self-organization and morphogenesis. He didn't say much about this
But I think yeah, I think he was on to something very deep
I think he understood and and I think this is this is true that these are fundamentally the same problem
There's a there's a very strong kind of invariance between these two problems and we should um
We should investigate those so so let's talk about this
