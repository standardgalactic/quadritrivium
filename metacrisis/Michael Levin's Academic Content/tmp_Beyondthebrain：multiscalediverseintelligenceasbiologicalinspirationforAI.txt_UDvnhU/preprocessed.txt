Well, thank you so much and thank you especially to the organizers for allowing me to share some thoughts with you all
This has been an amazing symposium for lots of interesting ideas
And in particular we've heard a lot about the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience
and so what I'd like to do is
Talk about some ideas of that borrowed from neuroscience and deployed outside the brain and in particular this idea that
Biology offers if we want to use biology and as an inspiration for AI
Biology offers many many interesting contexts that are not brains
And so I'd like to sort of pull us away from the neuroscience of the brain and think of some other things
And if anybody wants to reach me later all of the primary data the papers every software everything else is is here
so
Many many discussions still to this day
Take place in the context of this very old idea that this is of course
Adam naming the animals in the garden of Eden this idea that that there's a specific natural kind called the human brain
And it does various things and we would like to of course
You mind that for insights as to how we can create intelligence
But one of the things that is really critical to note is that if we take developmental biology and evolution
seriously all of us
began life as single-cells and
Whether on an evolutionary time scale or a developmental time scale
There's a continuum here and these and these this these transformations are very slow and continuous
Of course, we can try to pick out what we call great transitions and try to impose some sort of fate phase transition on these
But the underlying biology is very smooth and continuous and then of course now we have this additional axis of manipulations we can make
Where where we can step away from the standard human architecture and both with technological
hybrids and with with biological modifications make any sort of combination that you want and so
In our lab, we think very very very hard about these kinds of issues
Where does intelligence come from and how does it scale up through these kinds of?
transformations so the the important thing about us is that we and I think all
Intelligence is really our collective intelligence is so what you're seeing here. This is a single cell
This is what we're made of although this of course is a unicellular organism
We call the lacrimarium. There's no brain. There's no nervous system
But it's it's handling all of its local needs in in one cell
So you see, you know, if you're into soft robotics or things like this the level of control and morphological computation here
Is remarkable and all of us made this journey across the Cartesian cut
We all started life as quote-unquote just physics
So a little pile of chemicals a quiescent oocyte and then there's this slow and remarkable process of embryonic development
That produces something like this or perhaps even something like this and so at some point
You know, we have we have folks who will say that well
We we are certainly conscious and and we have certain level of cognition and of course
An oocyte many people will say is not and so then they they owe a story of how you get from here to here
Given how slow and continuous this process actually is and so what I want to do for the for the next couple of minutes
Is just talk about some interesting biology that isn't the standard thing that that we're all used to these are examples
That aren't usually covered in typical neuroscience AI kind of crossovers
So one thing that you should be looked at is this kind of example where you have a caterpillar
This is a soft-bodied robot. It lives in a two-dimensional world of crawling on and eating leaves
And then it needs to become this which is a hard-bodied robot
Which flies in three-dimensional space and has a completely different brain what happens in between is that the brain is basically
Taken apart most of the cells are killed off all the connections are broken everything is basically liquefied
rebuilt from scratch and
The amazing thing is that actually there's there's data showing that moths and butterflies
Retain the memories of the original caterpillar and so despite the fact that the medium is
radically
Radically altered the memories actually remain so that's an interesting fact about this biological architecture that
We have to keep in mind if we're going to try to make something similar that also raises interesting questions
You know never mind. What's it like to be a butterfly right for people who are into consciousness?
What's it like to be a caterpillar turning into a butterfly during your lifetime not just the evolutionary timescale
But actually during your lifetime a radical reconstruction of your cognitive medium. This is goes even further with plenaria
So these are flatworms
I'll talk about them more in a few minutes
But the salient fact about plenaria is that this this system can be cut into many pieces the record is something like I think
275 or something like that and
Every piece will will rebuild regenerate and give rise to a perfect little worm
So what McConnell discovered and we validated using modern techniques
Recently is that if you train a plenarian and plenaria have a centralized brain the same neurotransmitters that you and I do
If you train the plenaria on a specific task you amputate the head
The tail sits there doing nothing for about 10 days
Regrows a brand new brain at which point behavior resumes and then you can show that it still has the original information
So not only is the information stored
Somewhere else in the body possibly in some sort of distributed holographic form. We don't know
But it can also be imprinted onto the new brain as the brain develops
So you see this this this tight interaction between between morphogenesis the shaping of of the cognitive organs
And the information the behavioral knowledge that is spread and moves throughout
Throughout tissues and this kind of plasticity is not just for invertebrates
Vertebrates have it too. This is a tappel of the frog Xenopus lavas. Here's the mouth here the nostrils
Here's the brain the gut and what you'll notice is that it's missing the primary eyes
So we've we've made this particular embryo to not have any primary eyes
But we did put some eye cells on the tail not only do they go on to make a perfectly nice eye
Even though it's surrounded by muscle instead of next to the brain where it belongs
But actually these animals can see quite well
So we've made we've made a device that trains them on visual tasks and automates the whole process
And and we can see that even though this this eye does not connect to the brain
It makes an optic nerve that sometimes synapses on the spinal cord sometimes goes up here to the gut
But these animals can see so this this does not take
Long periods of evolutionary adaptation in in one generation this animal finds itself with a radically altered
Sensory motor architecture. No problem. It's getting
The brain is getting this weird these weird signals from some itchy patch of tissue on its tail
And it can treat that as visual data and learn in visual
Assays so so so remarkable and we'll get to the we'll get to this
This this notion that what evolution is giving us here is a kind of um
Problem-solving machine. It's not something that's just just knows how to do one thing
It can very rapidly adapt to novel configurations in morphological space
And so the the way that biology does this is that
Not only structurally but actually
Functionally we are all nested dolls at every level of organization from the swarm to the organ tissue cell and
molecular network level all of these layers are
Problem-solving types of processes. So so we so I call this a multi-scale competency architecture
with the idea that
Some of the same navigation policies are being used to solve problems in different spaces
Metabolic spaces transcriptional spaces morphological spaces and then of course the familiar
3d behavioral space of running mazes and then doing things like that. So so each each of these layers is its own
Kind of kind of problem-solving system
And this is this is why there's another talk that I give to students sometimes called why robots don't get cancer
And that's because we we don't have very many architectures yet
Where the individual parts have their own agendas and thus there's this failure mode whereby
They can be decoupled from the from the collective top-down agenda and sort of go off on their own and make a tumor and do other things
So so that that's that's the risk of this architecture. That's the failure mode
But but what you gain is is incredible plasticity and robustness
and so what i'm interested in as far as
understanding how these things help us to to recognize and to build
intelligences is
Something like like this to develop a framework where we can abstract the notion of intelligence and for this audience
I think I think that's very easy for for other audiences. This is this is a hard leap to make
Uh
Step away from the idea that intelligence is something that large
Large brains do and have a more kind of cybernetic approach where and i'm certainly not the first person to suggest this
You know, here's here's a rosin bluth wiener and bigelow trying for a kind of hierarchy of of of cognitive capacities all the way from passive
Behavior up to human level metacognition and so on so in in our group intelligence
We understand intelligence in the way that william james said which is
Roughly the ability to reach the same goal by different means and the degree of sophistication of those means and the degree to which
You can handle various perturbations along the way is is how you gauge
The type and the and the amount of intelligence and as as somebody said once um
It's sort of it describes the continuum between two magnets trying to get together and romeo and julia trying to get together
Right what what what mechanisms exist on all the different systems on that continuum to help them do what they need to do
so, um, of course, we're all very good at as many animals are at recognizing intelligence in
The three-dimensional world right so so medium-sized objects moving at medium speeds doing things
We very easily recognize as having agency and
And and having intelligence but actually there are many other spaces in which biology has been solving problems long before
Brains showed up and so imagine if if we had an innate sense of our blood chemistry
Or if we had an innate sense of various gene expression profiles, we would have no trouble at all
Intuitively recognizing our various organs our various cells as navigating those spaces with very significant competency and then right now
We you know, we just not we're just not primed for that. So i'm going to um
spend most of my time talking about this morpheus space uh the the behavior of a collective intelligence of cells in this morphological
space, but um one one idea that we've been playing with is that what basically has happened is that evolution
Has basically pivoted some of the same strategies
Across all kinds of different problem spaces all the way from metabolic and physiological spaces up through anatomical space
Classic behavioral space and then maybe linguistic uh be the linguistic space as well
And so i just want to show you a few examples of of what i mean by these unconventional
intelligences, so this is a sly mold
This is this is called the fissar and polycephalum and
What we've done is we've placed the sly mold here in the middle
By the way, the sly mold is unicellular. It's one cell. It can get very large, but it's just one cell
And what we've done is we've placed one disc one glass disc over here
Three glass discs over here and this is just one example out of out of a paper
Where where we did this many many times and it has a very interesting behavior
By the way, these glass discs are completely inert. There's no food. There are no gradients
Now they're just they're just glass and so so what happens is that uh for the first for the first few hours
It's sort of the sly mold sort of grows like this and at this point
There's no obvious indication that it's going to do anything other than continue symmetrically growing
But during this time it turns out that what it's been doing is gathering information about its environment
The way it does that is by gently squeezing it continuously pulses
The the the medium that it's on and reads back the strain angle of the signals that it gets
And what it does after that is it grows towards the larger mass and you can do all kinds of interesting tricks about stacking the
The glass discs one on top of the other you can you can you can get the thing tilted and do various things to confuse it
but this is what it does here it gathers information and
Boom at that point right right right right here's where you can now tell that it's decided what it's going to do
so this is this is kind of interesting these spaces that we talk about are
They're our abstraction right because behavior for this system is morphological change
So this is kind of a transitional form in which behavior and control of morphology are the same
But that's the sort of thing this single single celled organism can do
Here's another here's another type of intelligence
These we discovered something interesting in these planaria where if you put planaria in a
Solution of barium barium chloride what the barium does is it's a non-specific ion channel blocker a potassium channel blocker
To be to be more precise
And so what that means is that all the cells especially the cells in the head which have to exchange potassium
So all the neurons are extremely unhappy. They literally their heads literally explode in this barium
So overnight it's called deep progression to boom their their heads explode
But if you leave them in the barium something amazing happens and a couple weeks later
They will grow a new head and the new head is completely barium adapted doesn't care about barium at all no problem
So we asked a simple question. We took these barium adapted heads
We took the primary original heads and we simply
Asked what what gene expressions are different?
What what does this what does this new head do in terms of gene expression that's different from this head?
And there's only there's only a handful of genes that are actually different
And what they allow these cells to do is to do their physiological business despite not being able to pass potassium
That that's a pretty significant change, but there's only a handful of genes now the the kicker to all this is that
Plenarium never experience barium in the wild. That's that it's just not ecologically
realistic
There's never been an evolutionary history of of pressure for knowing what to do when you're hit with barium
And so I always think about this problem as kind of like being trapped in this in this
Nuclear reactor control room the things melting down there are you know, what 20,000 or however many genes there are buttons
And you're faced with this no novel stressor. How do you know?
Which thing is going to improve your physiological situation?
You certainly don't have the cells don't turn over very fast. So you don't have time to for to for random search
You don't really have time for gradient descent
We we don't know we don't know how this works
Maybe there's some sort of generalization from other types of things like epileptic
Excitotoxicity that that maybe they do have but it's it's an amazing ability to walk through that transcriptional space
In a way that efficiently allows you to solve for a completely novel
Physiological stressor so I've shown you a couple of examples of of problem solving in in these in these unusual spaces
But what I want to spend the most of my time doing is talking about morpho space morphogenesis
And it's and it's interesting this this idea of morphogenesis as being relevant to
The problem of intelligence is not new so
Obviously the Alan Turing needs no introduction. He was interested in problem solving machines intelligence through
plasticity reprogrammability and so on but you may or may not know that
He also wrote this he wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis
Now why would somebody who was interested in intelligence and machines
Be interested in the chemistry of spontaneous self-organization and morphogenesis. He didn't say much about this
But I think yeah, I think he was on to something very deep
I think he understood and and I think this is this is true that these are fundamentally the same problem
There's a there's a very strong kind of invariance between these two problems and we should um
We should investigate those so so let's talk about this
so
We all we all begin as this this sort of collection of blastomers that
arises from from the fertilized egg and then eventually we become something like this
So this is a cross-section through a human torso. So look at this amazing order, right?
everything all the organs the structures everything is in the right place next to you know, the right thing and
Incredibly robust this this works correctly most of the time. So
The the the amazing thing is that is that uh, and so and so we can we can ask okay
Where does the information come from where people all say this all the time?
Where is the information encoded for this particular layout?
Well, of course, you might want to say dna, but of course we can read genomes now
dna doesn't say anything about this directly any more than it directly says anything about the shape of a spiderweb or the shape of a
of a of a termite colony
It it it provides the micro level hardware what the dna gives you are the protein sequences that every single cell gets to have
Once you have those protein sequences now comes
Physiology which happens which which I like to think of as a as a as a as a layer of software
that um is is executed by this machine which does some really interesting things and uh
The key is that even though this process is very reliable. It is not hardwired
So if you take an early mammalian embryo for example human
And you cut it in half you don't get two half embryos
What you get are two perfectly normal monosygotic twins
Each half recognizes the other half is missing and produces exactly what it needs
In fact, you can cut it into more pieces than that. So we have this notion
that
Regulative development in in animals which can do it which are most of them
um
Is a kind of navigation of morpheus space if I boil down
The shape of the the space of all possible anatomical configurations, which is a kind of quantitative morpheus space
What we want is we want to be able to reach a particular ensemble of gold states
So the target morphology of this particular species from different starting positions
Despite various local maxima and different different barriers and things like that, right?
So so we can think about morphogenesis as a navigation of this virtual space now. Here's an example
It's not just for for development regeneration does this too. So
Here's a here's a salamander known as an axolotl these guys regenerate their eyes their jaws
Their tails including spinal cord their limbs
Their ovaries
And you can see what happens in the limb if if they lose a portion of the limb and it doesn't matter where along the axis
It's lost the cells will very rapidly grow exactly what's needed and then they stop
This is the most amazing part is that they stop when do they stop
They stop when the correct salamander arm has been completed. So this means that what you really have here is a kind of
homeostatic
homeostatic process whereby
This this this this group of cells
Is able to navigate that morpho space from different positions to the right region?
Recognize that they got where they're going and then they can stop and so here's another here's another example
This is something that we discovered some years back where here's a tappel
So the tappel has the eyes the nostrils the mouth and so on
Tappels need to become frogs and in order to do that all the pieces have to move around
They have to rearrange and so you might think and people used to think that
This was somehow hardwired that every part of the face moves in a particular direction a particular amount
And then you get from being a normal tappel to a normal face
So we wanted to test this idea that this is some kind of hardwired process
And so what we did was we created these so-called Picasso tappels
So everything is is scrambled basically the eyes might be on top of the head the mouth is off to the side everything is
everything is is is messed up
and largely these type of animals result in pretty normal frogs because
All of these different organs will keep moving in novel paths
In fact sometimes having to double back if they go too far and eventually they stop when they reach the correct frog face
So what the genetics actually gives you is a kind of error minimization scheme
And we thought um really hard about
How is this possible? How is a collection of cells supposed to recognize this kind of stop condition?
Right. How does it how does it take measurements of what's going on now?
You know, how how what's the how does the attractor here work? What what's going on?
And we started thinking about um how goal seeking behavior because fundamentally that's what this is right in the cybernetic sense
This is a goal seeking system. There's a particular set of states that will expend energy to attain
Even if you try to deviate it and to push it off of that state. So how how does this work? Well, um kind of the obvious
Example is what happens in the brain and so and so in the brain we know what the hardware looks like
We know some of the behaviors of the of the software layer and there's this
There's this idea which several people have talked about today of neural decoding the idea that
If we understood how to decode the electrical activity
So this is a zebrafish movie um a movie of a zebrafish brain
in the living state as it's
Doing whatever whatever computations that it's doing if we understood how to decode this
The commitment of neuroscience is that that's where the cognition is we would know the memories the preferences the behavioral repertoire
We could we could somehow somehow decode that
Um, but the interesting thing is that this this kind of this kind of architecture is extremely ancient
And long before brains and neurons appeared you had exactly the same thing in the rest of the body
Whereas let's go back to uh to this for a second
Whereas the way this works is that the electric circuits make various decisions that are then
Used to control muscles to move your body in three-dimensional space
Where this comes from is a much more
ancient system where the same electrical circuits
Control various cell behaviors, not just muscles, but all cell behaviors cell movements cell divisions cell differentiation
Shape change and so on to move the configuration of the body in morpheus space
I think that what evolution did in in creating
Creating nervous systems is that it repurposed the system
And and of course sped optimized it because because the original system works at the scale of hours
Not milliseconds and also made some trade-offs of space for time in terms of what um what it what it measures
But what you can do then is you can think of the exact same kind of research program
That comes from neuroscience and say okay, could we use actually the all the same techniques to track the
Uh, the the physiological activity of this process and try to decode it
What what are the electrical networks of the body thinking about what memories do they have what behavioral repercussions do they have?
And so the fact is that every cell in your body has ion channels
Most cells have electrical synapses to their neighbors that selectively propagate electrical states
And and and so you can you can see here this whole this whole story of how we got to neurons from other cell types
but uh the interesting thing is that um
Most of the techniques of neuroscience in fact do not distinguish. I mean everything works
We've we've we've carried over many things from neuroscience into other contexts. And so
The kinds of things that serve as neural inspirations for ai and for for intelligence for
Consciousness a few people talked about consciousness the mechanisms of all this are in fact ubiquitous in the body. They're everywhere
There are there are very few
Of the kinds of things that certain theories of consciousness. Uh, for example, um
Talk about in the brain most of these underlying processes are actually ubiquitous
And so so that that may have implications for for for where we think consciousness could be could be found
So I want to show you just one one example. Uh, this is a
time-lapse video of an early frog embryo putting its face together
So here this is this is the the way we do the imaging is with a voltage sensitive fluorescent dye
Very similar to how you might look at the electrical activity in the brain
And one frame out of that video looks like this. This is a snapshot of an early
Uh of an early pre pattern that tells these cells where all the organs of the face are going to go
Here's where the first eye is going to go. Here's where the mouth is going to go the placards
This is this is a glimpse of a deco and the reason I'm showing you this is because this is one of the easiest to decode
In fact, it almost looks like a face. We call this the electric face
This is a snapshot of what the tissue is thinking as it prepares to turn on the various gene expression domains
That are actually going to build these various organs and we know it's functional
We it's instructive because if you move any of this if you change these states
The anatomy follows and I'll show you a few examples of that
So so so tracking this is all well and good, but we want to make
Changes we want to make fun. We want to be able to do functional experiments and for that
We don't use electric fields. We don't use electrodes really. We don't but no no magnetics. No em waves
We basically uh appropriate all the tools of neuroscience. So for these
electrical synapses these gap junctions we can
Change the topology or the connectivity of the network by opening and closing these things or introduce some new ones
For the actual and this this is similar to
Controlling the synaptic plasticity
This is the intrinsic plasticity where we can go in and directly change the voltage of individual cells
Either pharmacologically by opening and closing channels or quite specifically with optogenetics
So we can use light to to trigger specific voltage changes
And of course we can do we can do this at the neurotransmitter level as well
And so we have the ability to basically to do what people like tana gala do when they
Try to incept false memories into the brains of mice
We can incept false pattern memories into non neural tissues
And so all of the tool these kind of bench top techniques
Including the the kind of the conceptual stuff, you know perceptual control theory active influence
All these kinds of things we we use them routinely to address things going on in the in navigating morpheus space
So here's an example
I showed you that electric face. We showed you there's a there's a particular pattern that that controls where the eye goes
So we simply said okay, could we uh artificially establish that same bioelectric pattern somewhere else in the body
What what would happen?
And so here's what happens the way we do it was in this particular case
We injected RNA encoding an ion channel a potassium channel that
Established a little a little spatial domain and the and the code by the way is is is multicellular
It's not singles. It's not a single cell code. So we established a multicellular domain of the right voltage
And sure enough these cells build a complete eye
They can make this eye anywhere in the gut on the tail anywhere now notice a few interesting things about this first of all
It's extremely modular what we are not doing here
Is telling individual stem cells what to be we are not providing enough information to actually build an eye
We have no idea how to build an eye
It eyes have all of these complex structures inside what we're doing is providing a very high level
Subroutine call. It's a trigger that says build an eye here downstream of that are all the gene expressions the cell movements everything else
That is the implementation machinery
but the trigger that um that goal directed behavior that that that movement in morpheus space that causes
These these cells to move from from what?
They're their old kind of morphology was to a to an eye shape all of that is triggered by a fairly simple
Bioelectrical state it's it's almost a stimulus that causes a you know trigger that causes a complex behavior
Now the other amazing thing is this
This this right here is a cross-section through an ectopic lens
Like this that's sitting out in the tail of a of a tadpole somewhere that we induced the blue cells here are the ones that
Bear the ectopic ion channel this potassium channel and they're blue because of beta galactosidase label
So we can tell which cells we actually injected
All the rest of these cells that are participating in making this nice lens are not labeled
Now what happened here is that when we injected this we didn't get enough cells to make a proper lens
And so the first instructive interaction was when we told these cells
You should make an eye with our with our voltage signal
But then what they have the competency to do is to recruit their neighbors
They uh the the system can tell that there's not enough of these guys to make an eye
And so they recruit as many of their neighbors as needed to actually make this would make this uh complete organ
We didn't do any of that that's that's built in that's a built-in competency to the system
The plasticity of this of the system is ready to
receive large organ level uh information to rearrange that large scale structure and have new behaviors and by the way
trigger downstream
Cascades such as recruiting other other other cell types and and this of course is found in other types of collective intelligence
So so ants and termites will um
You know recruit their their buddies when when there's a task to be done
That's that's you know kind of requires more of them
So there's this there's this these amazing
interesting competencies
Now i want to show you i want to want to show you uh
Another way to uh to interact with these pattern memories. So so here here here are our plan area
So one head one tail. This is a normal normal worm. If you look at where the gene expression is
Well, the anterior marker of course is at the head telling you one head uh one tail and um
What what this what this guy will do if we if we chop off the head and the tail that middle fragment will give you a nice
One-headed worm 100 of the time. They're extremely uh robust with this
But what we notice now now you might ask so so there's this fragment. How does it know how many heads it's supposed to have?
right and how does it know
You know these cells up here will make a tail these cells here will make a head
But they're right next to each other when you cut them apart. How do they know what they're supposed to make?
So we looked and we found this this voltage gradient that basically this is a map of this of this animal telling us
Oh, yeah one head one tail and that in fact is what they built
So so what we did was we worked out a pharmacological way
And by the way, uh, some of these things uh are exactly uh mirroring. So so so um, so uh general anesthetics
Right if you want a bunch of cells to forget what they're supposed to be doing general anesthetic is a really good way to do that
um, so there's some nice, uh, there's some nice um
Analogies to to to the coherence of minds and so on so so what you can do is you can
Uh produce a different pattern that says two heads and this is this is quite messy
The technology still is still quite young but you can produce this pattern
And if you do that in this animal when you cut him he will produce a two-headed animal
This is not photoshop. These are real real live worms
Even though the genetics are untouched the hardware is exactly the same
There's nothing wrong with the with the genetics here. We didn't edit the genome
And and the other critical thing is that this map is not a map of this two-headed body
This is a map of this one-headed animal
So it's basically you can think about this as a primitive form of counterfactual memory the
A kind of very simple form in morpho space of what we like about brains
Which is this ability to time travel to to to have memories and predict and make predictions about things that are not true right now
So even though anatomically this animal has one head and one tail
If you were to look to see what is what is your idea of what the correct planarian looks like that's very clear
It's two heads. So if you get injured, that's what you'll do if you don't get injured nothing happens
It's a latent memory that doesn't get activated. So when I talk about
The collective of cells being a real a collective intelligence
This is what I mean the it we can literally read the memories that it has at least in in some cases
Such as this and we know now very much like in the brain that the same hardware
The same hardware is capable of having one of two different ideas of what a correct planarian looks like
It's it's a representation of a future
Morphological state the goal of its movement through morpho space if it's called upon to move through morpho space
Now I keep calling it a memory because
If you cut these animals, so so here's our two-headed worm you cut off the primary head
You cut off this crazy ectopic secondary head you take this middle fragment and you might think well
The genetics are untouched in plain water as you just go back to normal and make one head one tail
That's not what it does the circuit the electrical circuit that keeps this information
Has has memory. Um, in fact, it has all the properties of memory. It's long-term stable
It's rewriteable by experience not by not by hardware manipulation, but by experience
It has latency which I just showed you or conditional recall and it has two possible behaviors
So what happens is as far as we can tell in perpetuity once you make these two-headed animals
They stay two-headed even though their genome is wild type and and we now know how to make them go back
We can actually reset the circuit. So it's kind of like a
Almost a flip-flop where we can kind of go back and forth between
That circuit and coding one state one head or two head kinds of states and here you can see this is a video
You can see these these two-headed animals
Hang it out. So, um, not only can you can you take this this kind of machine and tell it how many heads it's supposed to have
You can actually tell it what kind of head to have
So here's uh, here's a planarian with normally a triangular head shape like this
What we can do is amputate the head
And then treat the rest of the tissue in a way that uh, basically using a general anesthetic that just all it does
So general anesthetics among other things uncouple gap junction
So they uncouple these electrical synapses and when you uncouple them what happens is the individual cells are still alive
But things like global kind of kind of global computations go away
And then when you pull them out of the the the um, when you put them out of the compound
They settle down, but they don't always settle into the same state
Actually, this is true in in for example humans as well
There are there are the reason that they don't like giving general anesthesia to people
Is that some people have psychotic breaks because the brain does not come back to the same state
It's actually to me kind of miraculous that it ever comes back to the same state if you sort of uncouple all the activity
But what you can do here with these guys is uh, when when when they come back
They sometimes come back flat headed like this pifalina
sometimes they come back round headed like this S. Mediterranean and uh,
The the the evolutionary distance here is between between these guys and the actual um species. It's about 150 million years
So without genetic change you can explore different attractors in morpheus space that other species
Live in naturally, you know and and maybe this this this may be how the speciation happened
We we we don't know and it's not just the shape of the head
It's also um
The shape of the brain and the distribution of stem cells are exactly the same as these other species
So you get you get the idea of this this incredible uh reprogrammability and plasticity that goes beyond the default
kinds of robust behaviors that um that that the standard
machine does after uh after development and um, not only that but you can explore regions of the latent space
Uh that are very far from normal plan areas. So here's your normal plan area
We can make these crazy spiky forms. We can make something that's cylindrical has a different
Kind of a symmetry body plant symmetry. You can make these these kind of uh hybrid forms
and the thing is that uh, a lot of biological uh kinds of um
Hardware is extremely reprogrammable. So this is these these kinds of things if you've ever seen them in the wild
these are called galls and
There's a there's a wasp embryo that's that's in there
But these are not made of the wasp cells. These are made of the leaf cells of the plant
So normally the these cells what they normally do is they make you this nice flat leaf and people who are focused on
On genetics and molecular biology will say well, that's what the genome encodes is is the ability to make these flat leaves
But in fact, it's very easily hacked by uh by this parasite that gives them signals
To form something completely different, right? So the morphology. So these leaf cells are in fact able to form something like this
It's just that they normally don't so um
I want to now start to start to pull back and try to really really talk about uh, what we mean by
A collective intelligence in whatever space it's acting in so this is what happens during evolution is that the
Components like this which are very competent at very local tiny little goals. So metabolic goals
Things that little the things that individual cells do
Using bioelectricity and other types of modalities including chemical signaling, of course by mechanical signaling
They scale up to systems that have much bigger goals. So this system has
Has the ability to try to reach this goal something like organogenesis
Despite all kinds of perturbations that i've shown you and so on so there's there's this scale up of there's a there's a flip
In space so so this now is in morpho space
And there's a scale up of the kinds of goals that it can achieve
But that process of course has failure modes and that failure modes is cancer
So this is this is human glioblastoma in a dish
What happens is that um individual cells when they electrically disconnect from their neighbors and that can be caused by a variety of factors
At that point they basically just revert back to their unicellular past. They are no longer
interested or capable of of understanding
What the the behavioral cues that?
Bind all of them towards these kind of larger scale construction projects
And they go back on their own at that point the rest of the animal is just amoeba
Is just an environment to these to these amoebas and that's metastasis and so um
there's a there's a
The utility of of these kinds of uh this kind of thinking where you think about um
These these cancer cells are not more selfish. It's just that their cells are smaller
The computational boundary has shrunk to the level of a single cell and that leads you naturally to some new therapeutics
So for example here you can see when you induce a human oncogene into these tadpoles
And they're going to make a tumor even before the tumor forms
You can already see these these bioelectrical
Disconnections of these cells from the network you know exactly where the tumor is going to be
And if you co-inject an ion channel that forces the cells
To remain in electrical communication doesn't kill the cells doesn't fix the the genetic mutation
And you can see that here the oncogene is blazingly expresses and it can be a nasty
K-RAS mutation or a p53 or whatever. In fact, it's all over the place
There's no tumor because what drives the whole collective outcome is uh is is the
The behavior of the of the network the the individual cells are are actually much less important here
And so you can try to re expand that sort of cognitive
boundary uh to
To to try to get the cells connected with each other and to pursue organogenesis and so on
So this this issue of these these cognitive boundaries between right the the the boundary between self and outside world
In a standard human you would think it's very simple, right? It's it's what there's our human
There's there's where the body ends. Although, uh, you know, this this idea of the extended the extended mind, right?
handy clerks and and and those kind of ideas are are already stretching that but but it's really it's really more fundamental
If if if you didn't already know what a human was and somebody
Somebody showed you a a brain, you know, this this, you know, this
Three and a half or whatever pound mass. Um, how many
Individual cells would you say are in there? You really don't know because we don't have a way of saying, you know per per pound
This is how many this is how much real estate it takes to make a self and the same thing is true of embryo genesis when you
This is this is a deep problem of of uh
an individual
an individual emergent system arising from a sea of uh components
This is this is an embryonic blasted arm, right? It's it's an early let's say 50 000 cells and you look at it and you say
Well, that's an embryo and when you look at it given that there's 50 000 cells you can ask yourself
Well, first of all, what are we counting?
What what is an embryo as as distinct from the the individual cells we're looking at?
And can we guess how many embryos are present in any particular blasted arm?
And usually the answer is one and so you might and just like usually there's there's seemingly one individual in a in a in a brain
But it doesn't have to be one and what can happen is this and
I used to do these experiments myself as a grad student
You can take an an avian or a mammalian blasted arm and you take a little needle and you make a little
You make some scratches in it and what happens is when you make these scratches
Each domain that can't temporarily because the scratches will heal well temporarily
Will self organize into a new embryo and when the scratches do heal you end up with conjoined twins
And so you will have these regions each of them as a separate embryo
Then there's some disputed zones, which is kind of interesting these cells that don't quite know who they belong to but
A particular blasted arm can give rise to zero one or several individuals
Now in the in the case of morphogenesis, what are individuals?
Well, they are collections of cells that are bound to a common purpose
They're going to make a specific thing meaning they're going to move to the right region of
Morphous space is going to have two eyes and then you know four limbs and then various other things
And that's what we're counting. We're counting independent goal following systems and in this sort of
Excitable medium there can be multiple depending on the dynamics multiple numbers of them. It's not genetically determined
I mean usually it's one but it doesn't have to be one and this is this is true in brains as well
Where we see split brain patients and various dissociative disorders. There's no guarantee that in that medium. There's one individual and so
What what we're interested in is is kind of merging
these ideas of understanding the the bioelectric circuitry and the
Attractors and the other the other kind of features of that of that state space and merging them with with ideas about
How memories are stored in electrical networks?
What it means when we can recover portion of that information after damage and and of course the dynamical systems approaches to this and so on
And so what we really need and this is this is very active kind of work in our lab now
Is to understand the scaling where we start with individual tiny little competent subunits
Which can do homeostatic things like keep pH and hunger level and so on so so individual cells
And then you bind them together into networks that have particular policies for spreading signals back and forth
and we can talk about what some of those important policies are and as a result of this what you get is a
um an increase in what we call the cognitive light cone the the size of the the maximal spatiotemporal size
Of the biggest goal that it can hang on to or they can that it can pursue
So individual cells pursue little tiny goals collections of cells pursue bigger goals and so on
Now now when we talk about these these kind of the size of these goals
Typically if we ask well, where do they come from and and this the standard answer is well evolutionary selection, of course
You get them you get them from evolution
But what about novelty and we have examples like this?
And I can show you much more on this but but I don't have too much time left
These are um what we call zenobots zenopus lavis is the name of the frog
And we can use frog skin cells to make something to make a biological robot or a biobot called a zenobot
These little these little things running around are just skin
They're just frog skin that was liberated from the rest of the animal rebooted into a new kind of
Critter with a new behavior. This is a very interesting. They have many new behaviors
But here's one if you provide them with a bunch of loose cells
What they will do is they will run around and
Collect these cells into little balls and sort of polish them like this and because the little balls are not passive
They're um, they're a gentle they're an agential material just like the original
They will mature into the next generation of zenobots and continue to do the same thing
So this is a kinematic self replicating system. This is kind of von Neumann's dream
You know a robot that goes around and finds um materials in the environment and builds copies of itself
But the the the the interesting thing here is that there's never been evolutionary selection to do this
No other animal does kinematic self replication
When you look at these skin cells in vivo, you might think well
The only thing they could possibly know how to do is to be this boring two-dimensional layer that keeps the bacteria out
You know on the on the on the outer side of uh, uh of these embryos
But in fact liberated from those instructive cues you get to find out that actually
They can do all kinds of things by themselves and they have uh within about 48 hours
They uh, they they exhibit reproductive behavior
That's completely different to how frogs normally reproduce because we've made it impossible for them to reproduce their normal way
This is just skin. I can't do any of that other stuff. So so this the the ability of all the parts to have coherent
Uh novel behaviors and to solve new problems that were not actually anywhere in the training set is is really interesting here and
um for that reason
This incredibly large option space, you know, all of all of the natural model systems of of biology are here
Including brains that that we like to get inspiration from but all this other stuff
So hybrids and cyborgs and hybrids of various kinds, you know, every combination of of cellular material
Designed engineered material and software is some kind of viable agent
So there's there's this huge kind of option space of of novel um intelligences that I think we really need to mine
Uh as in in addition to whatever uh insights we can get from from standard brains. And so um in the end
I'm just gonna close here with a couple of thoughts. Uh, this idea that um non neural bioelectricity
Is a kind of cognitive glue from for for collective intelligence in morphogenetic space
Exactly as it serves as the cognitive glue to neurons in the brain and in traditional behavioral space
Um, I I think it has some some interesting things uh to say to neuroscience in terms of the origins of the amazing things that neuroscientists study
And vice versa and we you know, we certainly benefit from from all of the uh from all the insights of the field
And the same thing with with AI, you know, I think that uh, there are some just this idea of diverse intelligence in
unconventional embodiments is a really powerful set of inspirations for um, creating creating novel robotics
No novel AI systems that are not specifically not neuromorphic that are looking at more basic
Fundamental principles and all of this kind of stuff. So so you know, we we kind of appropriate
A lot of ideas I could show you date on on perceptual by stability in morpho space
Plenaria that can't decide if they want one head or two and so they sort of shift back and forth and so on
Many many deep areas of intersection here among these three fields. And so from all this this this kind of these ideas about
These ideas about
How individual pieces come to to be a single coherent thing give us some suggestions for
What might you want from a from a real agent, you know, this idea that when we make these things
Everything has to be determined on the fly. We can't pre define
What you know a built-in model of what they are or where their boundaries are they have to emerge
Spontaneously through auto polices. They have to figure out where the world starts. Where do they end?
What do they have? What effectors as you saw from from all of these examples, you know, the
Tadpoles with the eyes on their tails and everything they make biological systems make very few assumptions really about what happened before
The whole the the product of the evolutionary process is a problem-solving machine that starts from scratch
Kind of I call it play the hand your dealt, you know, they sort of they do not make too many assumptions about how the world is
I can show you many examples of
Beings that have too many cells too few cells
The wrong kinds of cells and they will always try to figure out something useful to do with that
So that process I think that process of self-construction is really going to be critical for for proper intelligence
So anybody who's interested can kind of dive into some of the details here
So I just want to thank all of the the students and the postdocs who have done the work. Thank our funders
I'll do a disclosure here fauna systems because josh bongar and I have a
startup company around computer designed biorebotics and
Yeah, and and just just you know, my my final message is that I think
That this multi-scale competency architecture, which is made up of these agential materials that basically behavior shape each other
To accomplish
Specific outcomes in in morpho space can really teach us a lot about how collective intelligence works and how we can
Engineer it. So I'll stop here and thank you all for listening
Yeah, thank you
Exploded several times through there. Thank you
So one question regarding the
The the warm and the head and you said that the memory is distributed. So it
built the same head with this
Same functionality and same memory. So if the memory is in the body, why does it need that?
So what's the functionality of the head? Is it that the executive is the memory?
Yeah
It's always great. Well, thank you so much. Thank you
Yeah, so so the thing with planaria is that the brain is actually required for behavior
So when you cut off the head the the remaining body parts really don't do anything. They just sit there
They they don't so you wouldn't know whether it had memory or it didn't have memory because it doesn't do anything
and so in order to to to observe evidence of of the of the memory you have to let it
Regrow the head so that it can actually start to behave
So I think that um
The rest of the body and we don't know exactly where the memory is. We don't know if it's in the neurons
We don't know if it's in every you know, it's in all the tissues. We really don't know
Uh, but I think that the memory outside of the brain is kind of like
Passive it it doesn't it's stored. All right, but it doesn't have the ability to act or to be read out
I think I I personally think that and of course this is extremely controversial
But but I'm not the only person thinking about this way
This idea that to what extent our specific memories actually stored in the neurons versus the neurons being a
Kind of decoding machinery from from other cellular substrates and there's this there's some nice work on that
so so I think I think there's something to that and
But but you definitely need the brain to be able to read out the memories and act in the in the three-dimensional world
This was absolutely spectacular and thank you
Localization in a sense that comes out out of your view, but I want to push that along
so we will often be in this situation where
There's something that could happen that is good for me like if I think about myself as being small
and what I'm gonna do is I
I I want someone over there, which is my direct neighbor to do something for me and some level
What we want is something that's almost like radian descent then like where I tell my neighbor
Hey, can you move out of the way and they are telling me but hey, can you move out of the way?
And so this chaining that we have in radian descent in a high
Should be the case for biology at all levels. If I like
So this is this is really interesting and
I I have a slide I didn't bring it here just for lack of time, but I have a slide that shows almost exactly what you just said
So so think about think about the role of stress, right?
So imagine imagine I'm going to try to describe this this this slide in words here
Imagine that you have a bunch of cells and there's one cell at the bottom
That's not at the right location. It wants to get up here to the top
Now the problem is that all of these other cells are perfectly happy where they are
They're not getting out of the way for this and so this cell is very stressed because because it's not in the right location
What you can do is you can export your stress. You can start to leak your stress to the neighbors
The neighbors also start to feel stressed
They don't know that it's not their stress because all the stress molecules are exactly identical
And so the temperature of the whole system rises
They get so they start to get a little plastic and everybody's kind of willing to move around a little bit
And then you end up, you know, then then you can get to where you can go and then the global
You you reach some kind of global maximum and everybody's happy and it's a way to um
It's a way to to to have this kind of cooperativity without
Really any altruism because all the other cells want to do is minimize their own stress
And and you're stressing them out and the way for them to have lower stresses to have you have lower stress
And so it's it's like this collective again. It's I think it's one of these things that helps the collectivism
So if you want to call that gradient descent, I'd love to talk more because uh, you know, I'm not I'm not an expert in gradient descent
So I'm not sure but if that's what it is, I'd love to know about it
I think it's quite similar. I'd love to okay. That would be great. That would be great. Yeah
Hey, uh, thanks for that talk. That's great. Thank you. And I was also a perfect question
for me to follow up on
So I come from a multi-agent rl background multi-agent systems and
something that
um, I guess the goal of multi-agent systems is to is to model the collection of agents working together
To solve tasks something like that. So like a larger collective intelligence
in multi-agent rl the way we do this is
agents share rewards and so
This could be sharing stress. This could be
sharing food or or whatever like
So this models the group of agents as a as a larger self
Although like there's also
work like recent work in the last few years that like
If the group of the
Agents grows too big
then performance might degrade or
If these agents fully share their rewards performance might degrade. So is there anything like this where?
Between cells they might not fully share their stress or fully share their rewards, but
there's kind of like a
degree there where where
Maybe I don't want to offload all of my reward, but just part part of my reward. Yeah, you kind of help cooperation. Yeah. Yeah
Yeah, yeah, that's great. And uh, sarah marson who who's an rl expert. I'm not
We're we're writing a paper on on this on this topic. There are there are two
I can think of two examples that are similar to what to what you're saying
one is uh, chris chris fields and I had this this idea a while back for for one of the one of the um
Uh drivers of multicellularity might be that if if you you as a as a simple cell
Want to be able to do some kind of active inference and predict your environment
The most predictable thing out there in a very uncertain environment would be a copy of yourself
So the nice thing to do would be to surround yourself with copies of yourself so that you have some prayer of of
You know having a stable environment and knowing what's coming next at which point what you might want to do is
Addict your neighbors to hang out with you
So you might have these kind of autocrine and paracrine loops where you're secreting some sort of goodies
Maybe opioid, you know natural opioids. Maybe maybe nutrients. Who knows but but you know
You might you might try to share some of this to keep the other cells around and kind of um
I maintain this the other the other aspect of what you just said is seen in gap junctions
The magical thing about gap junctions, which are these connections that allow
molecules to pass directly from the inside of one cell to the other is this under traditional
Uh signaling modes one cell will secrete some kind of chemical
It sort of floats over the other cell has receptors and it feels it
The thing with that is that the other the receiving cell is very clear that this is a signal that came from outside
And then you might ignore it. You might learn from it. You know, whatever, but it came from outside
Gap junctions are different because if something happens so cell a and b are connected with gap junctions
Something happens to cell a it triggers some sort of um, um memory trace
Let's say a calcium spike or something like that that immediately propagates into cell b
What these gap junctions do is they kind of erase the ownership on that data
There's no metadata on the calcium about where it came from calcium is calcium
And so whatever else comes across as a signal of that information or a reward or whatever it is
Is shared equally by the two cells or or not equally because the gap junctions can be regulated, right?
So they get they're tunable. And so what happened what that tends to do is um,
I think what goes on here is that it erases the individual
Identities because if if you're if a and b cannot cleanly maintain their individual memories if they share memories
It's kind of like this this this mind meld because now it's not that I have my own memories
And you have your own memories now
There's just we because it's the same pool of molecules right and it also makes it impossible to defect in a game theory sense
Because because if you're connected and I do something nasty to you
Well, guess why it comes back to me immediately. So so it forces this cooperativity. It forces a kind of um sharing of of
You know of of of of our past that that binds us together. And I think in that sense
Uh, no, no, but you know, I to my knowledge, nobody's actually studied this in detail
But I bet exactly what you're saying that that if we were able to track the reward molecules going through these things
we would find some dynamics that are um kind of
of
Understandable under these various frameworks like rl and other things that you guys study
Well, thanks. Thanks
Hi, um, thank you
I would like to challenge you a bit on the notion of ubiquitous intelligence
So from what I see, I really like the idea that it goes through transcriptomic networks to cell-to-cell interaction network
But it sounds to me like you you ascribe
every complex system that's
Interconnected and that the interaction between these individual agents that if there's an adaptive behavior that is somehow
intelligent
But my question is like, where is the boundary? Let's assume the block of metal is not
Because it's not
Sure
In your framework, I mean the weather might be right because you have interacting things and your interactions as a contact system
And and I just wonder
So in your framework, do you think that
From cell-to-cell interaction gene to gene interaction to neuron to neuron interaction. Is it just a slow continuous scale up?
Uh, uh, basically it's just a time scale that's different
Because we have like these learning rules in the rain, which would like to understand
Do you think the same things hold true for the cells? It's just that it's a different time scale and we eventually get there and I think
Uh, let's say IBM
To develop a brain model that's I don't know is able to solve some problems with intelligence, right? So so
In a sense like chat gbt can solve problems or ai has
improved or become more intelligent because it is able actually to solve certain problems and my question is
In your framework, then you would say if you just wire up a bunch of neurons, uh, artificially
Uh, they are doing something and create some kind of dynamic. That's not intelligent. We're interested in, right?
So so do you think there's a qualitative difference
In our brain is doing your intelligence and how cells are doing intelligence?
Okay, great. Yeah, great great question. So so here's here's what I would say first of all
Um, I I do not believe in intelligence as a binary notion
So I don't think we can say yes. It is no it isn't I think the real question is how much and what kind
So I think there's a continuum and we can talk in a minute about whether there's really there are these kind of great transitions
Or it's really a smooth continuum
And the other thing is that I absolutely agree with you in that
Intelligence cannot be be attributed simply on the basis of complexity or
You know some kind of dynamical system the whole point of some degree of intelligence
And and this is so so I don't know if you can see the slide I put up
But but this is this is what we enter and at all we're trying for is they were giving
Functional criteria for assigning certain kinds of intelligence, which by the way you can only assess in experiment
So if you bring me some kind of extremely complex system
You have to and and and we want to make intelligence claims about it. We have to on my framework
We have to do a couple of things. We have to first of all
Pick a problem space. Okay, then we have to pick
some kind of
Some kind of a goal or problem-solving behavior that we think it's doing and then we have to do experiments to see how much
what what kinds of
Competencies some of them are on this chart here
It can muster to and and then and then we have an empirical answer to you know
If two people have a model one person says I think it's just
You know it's just a hard-wired thing that does the same thing somebody else is why I think it's a Brittenberg vehicle of type
Too somebody else is no I think it has metacognition and it knows what it knows
These are all empirical
Questions we have to do the experiment. I'll give you a very simple example
If you look at a gene regulatory network, right?
So these are just it's a it's a mathematical model that literally just says it has you know
Maybe let's say a dozen genes and each one turns another one on and off
So it's a set of coupled ordinary differential equations for example
So you look at this thing. He's okay. This this the traditional view was that look this is clearly
It's an it's a it's a complex dynamical system, but there's no magic here
It's we can see where all the party, you know, what what it's doing
It's this there's no way this thing's intelligent
And what we said what we said was let's do the experiment and what we found out was that it can actually
It can actually do six different kinds of learning including associative conditioning
So is it is it highly intelligent? No
Can it do associative learning and is associative learning a kind of intelligence somewhere on the spectrum of the kinds of things we mean?
I would say so, but we didn't know that until we did the experiment
We tried to train it and we observed what it can do. So when you brought up the weather
I think that's actually really interesting and I've made this this exact claim about the weather at the moment
We have no idea. Why because nobody's tried training the weather. It is I do not think we know right whether or not if you tried
Uh, certain kinds of behavioral kinds of paradigms things that come from
Behavioral science we we would then find out. No, actually the weather doesn't have any kind of learning capacity
So it's it's zero or extremely low or we would find that. Oh, whoa, it actually
Much like this genetic network that people these these biological
Transcriptional networks that people thought we hadn't had none of this in fact have some so I I you know
I kind of I just insist on two things one is that
Uh, we that this is a matter for experiment not for armchair kind of um
Yeah, I don't think we can have feelings about systems as to whether they should be intelligent or not
We have to do experiments which means you make a claim about what type of like like this is one
I have a different actually um a different scale that I came up with but this is this is wieners is fine, too
Uh, you you pick where you think it is on this and then you see whether your model gives you better prediction and control
Versus somebody else who picks a different spot on the spectrum
So, you know as long as we stick to to to empirical experiments then we can find out what kind of intelligence anything has
Thank you
