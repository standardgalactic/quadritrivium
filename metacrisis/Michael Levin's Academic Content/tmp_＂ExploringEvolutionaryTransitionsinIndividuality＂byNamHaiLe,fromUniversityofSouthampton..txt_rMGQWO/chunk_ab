should evolve and should evolve the transition into a bigger hole so that they can eat the predators
and then the the ring structure should evolve the ring structure of boys could evolve into a bigger
one which will be the next transition and also that I want I'm interested in whether the process
of self-organization and naturalism invites NOVA can be generalized into other ETIs in nature
and yes so in this simulation I'm using a simple neural network to simulate the transition from
solitary to e-sociality but in evolution in classic example of the transition evolution of
multi-cellularity the cell doesn't have neural network in it so how can we extend
right to NOVA to model multi-cellularity and the first thought is that I can use
gene regulatory network in the place of neural networks and yes some other technical stops
especially how I need to define more metrics to measure emergent collective behavior
and how can we define the collective genotype from vital NOVA yes and measure the difference
in change the change in genotype at the component level of boys and the change at the genotypic
level as a collective level to compare it yes thank you
