and then so today I'm going to talk about the evolutionary transition and my most recent
Confession Assimilation Demonstrating ETI. So this is part of the project, the Skilling
Out of Purpose in Evolution funded by John Tammerton and the PI is Richard Watson. So as we
already knew that ETI is referred to the key events in the evolutionary history where organisms
evolve new levels of organizing the complexity. This process often involves the integration
of previously independent biological units into a new and cohesive entity and a classic example
is a transition from the single cell life to monthly cellular organisms and also the evolution of
use of social super organisms and the program was set like 30 years ago by in the classic book
major transition in evolution. So the evolutionary puzzle here is that the classic evolution by
natural selection theory focusing on the combination between cell interest units. So it's
harder to imagine how natural selection can explain the emergence of an evolution of new
higher level units from interactions among lower level entities and here we are facing
circular problem or chicken and egg reasoning because most existing theories often presuppose
the existence of higher level units which only emerge after the transition and so the process
of ETI can be divided into two phases the pre-transition phase or the group formation phase
and some quick questions in this phase that how do individuals entities initially come
together to form cooperative or coordinated groups and what mechanisms drive this aggregation?
Is this period random or is there any underlying biological process?
And the second phase is what we call post transition phase or the group transformation. So
since the aggregation of the group is formed there is a transformation process of that group
into a more structured integrated organization as a new level of individuality and some quick
questions here is what processes guide the transformation of this transformation and yeah.
So our plan is that today we'll explore the mechanisms behind ETIs and talking about some
limitations of current theories and I will introduce my approach based on the combination
of self-organization and emergent selection processes and which will be demonstrated in
an artificial life simulation. So yeah several theories of current viewable viewpoints of ETI
the first and famous one is kin selection. This says as natural solution favorites of
reproductive success of an organism's relatives and some famous proponent like W. D. Harmington.
So it has a strength of providing a robust explanation for the evolution of altruistic
behaviors in a closely related group but it's not adequate enough to explain that the cooperative
behavior among unrelated individuals. And the second one is it's more controversial one is
what we call group selection and the basic idea is that natural selection will operate at the
level of the group rather than the individual. Some proponents will be like Dave Sloan Wilson
and it has a strength of explaining how traits beneficial to the group can evolve even if they
are costly to individuals but this theory is very debatable and a lot of debates in the history
of biology like between Richard Dawkins and Dave Sloan Wilson or even E.O. Wilson about this.
Yeah so this debate encapsulates the fundamental question in evo-bio so does natural selection
act primarily at the level of the genes there's more reductionist view individuals or groups.
Another view point is the fitness decoupling proposed by Richard Micho and this is processed
by the fitness of individual components is integrated into the success of the entire group
and it has a strength of allowing for a higher level of specialization and division of labor.
Yeah but it's of course it has some witnesses too and the most obvious one is that it does
not explain the initial step still worth performing these interdependent relationships
between entities and all these theories and viewpoints are post-transition
focus and it highlights the gaps in the research of ETI because it does not explain how
the initial group and it is formed what is mechanism behind how is the drive of it.
Another view point is called ecological scaffolding this means that
environmental structures and interactions that facilitate emergence of new biological
individuality by providing some scaffoldings in the environment right.
Yeah and this is crucial in the early stage of the transition
some mechanisms of this is like physical structures like it can provide the boundary
to protect new groups and the concept of niche construction is here also this means that
organisms modify their own and each other's environment or niche is leading to new selective
pressures for example like it can change the environment in a way that reduce the
selective pressure that foster more a coordinated or cooperative behavior in the first place.
Yeah some classic examples of ecological scaffolding in bacterial biophirms or eukaryotic cell
evolution yeah of course it has some limitations too because it's often presupposed extreme
conditions and the ecological scaffolding more effectively explains how
certain environmental structures can support the maintenance of higher level individuals
once they are established and less quality on how these structures emerge.
And it has some both it has both theoretical gap and experimental gap in this view point.
And a more recent view view point proposed supported by my PI in Southampton and also with
Mike in the paper they call it connection least approach to ETI so the basic idea here is that
and they saw some analogy between evolution and learning as an optimization process or
they call it the ball rolling down here and so this means that because evolution is
analogous to learning in neural networks so they saw the similarity between the ETI and
the process of hierarchical concept formation in deep learning
and the idea is that self-organization can drive adaptation autonomously
without resorting to natural selection as a primary drive in evolution.
Yeah so in the most recent paper like they call it natural induction
a spontaneous adaptive organization without natural selection is a really cool idea
and but of course it has limitation too based on my perspective because
in there's a biggest the biggest difference here is that the structure of most deep learning
of neural networks is predefined by the experimenter rather than as part of this emergence in ETI
and there is no inheritance mechanism at the component level and also that the
reproduction process as a component level to say that there is a transition in
individuality in that way in sense so it also means a transition in level of inheritance
and reproduction and it lacks some empirical support too
and so it goes back to the debate between self-organization and natural selection as the main
drive of biological adaptation like the debate between Stoke Kaufman and Minna Smith years and
years ago but here I think that self-organization and natural selection can be complementary
rather than mutually exclusive and for example the easiest way to think about is self-organization
can initiate the formation of complex structures which natural selection then can act on it by
refining and stabilizing it over time or another way the ability to self-organize is an evolvable
adaptation this means that we are talking about the evolution of self-organization yes it's
this evolutionary process can promote the emergence of collective self-organization
as an adaptive response to environmental challenges
so I propose that by combining natural selection and self-organization we can
study the spotless emergence of pre-transition group formation and also the spotless emergence
of group selection post-transition selection
yeah so I use an artificial light approach to ETI as we may know that a life is a study of
life as it could be rather than life as we know it so we study the basic underlying fundamental
processes and mechanisms of life regardless of the material it's based on
so it allows us to revive the tip of life in the computation or by artificial chemistry
yeah and I think I think a life is a unique platform in order to test and observe how complex
interactions and evolutionary pressures can generate higher levels of biological organizations
as in ETI right oh and actually there have been many models of self-organizations
in a life like cellular or automata-like models of conways, gamelight, or long-term slur or even the
most recent on linear so in that in all those models we have the formation of patterns and
the replicating process of patterns over time but if they are not adequate to say that it's an
evolutionary transition in individuality the same reason as in re-chart conditionist approach
because there is no inheritance at the component level and no selection at the component level
also so by this I mean that in order to model an ETI in an artificial system we need inheritance
selection and reproduction at the component level and by some way these combinations can give
price to an emergence of the reproduction or replication at the group level as if the new
level of individuality emerged and then so I recently I developed a life model I call it
vitamin nova it means new life in leitens and in this simulation there is no explicit fitness
function so we use the fitness as an emergent property and selection here is also an emergent
property from the interactions of lower level units so it's closer to biological natural
selection rather than using the fitness function in normal evolutionary computation
and here's a design methodology of vitamin nova so we have 2d square and some
origins I call boys yeah so the green boy is the worker boy and the blue boy is the soldier boy
and the red one is a predator one of which is included in the environment and each boy is
controlled by its own new network which will model it the course steering behaviors of boys
like we know that it's separation alignment and cohesion so it's different from the classic
boy simulation of very nice when he used the pre-fixed parameters too for these behaviors
the inputs to the new network will include the relative positions and velocities of nearby
boys and predators and also the current energy level the opposite as we know is a tendency for
type separation alignment and cohesion and also predator avoidance and the role tendency the
role tendency here is the likelihood of being a worker or soldier is the next step this means that
in my simulation that we have plastic division of labor governed by neural network it's exactly
evolving neural network and the predator still will the behavior of the predator is that to detect
and move towards nearby boys all reverse the direction if facing three or more soldier boys
this is a setup of the simulation here's the basic architecture of the neural network is the
simple fit forward neural network with one hidden layer
and equations for boys behavior and here's a pseudo code for reproduction and mutation so
there is no explicit selection so the production here is so in this current simulation there's no
autonomous as there's no neural network output to control the reproduction so when the boy
reaches a certain amount of energy it will reproduce and reduce some energy and the reproduction
is a repetition with some mutation in the waste of the neural network
yeah so the neural networks waste are the genotype of boys which are evolving and the concept of
fitness here is just an emergent concept and here's the video demonstration of boys
of my vital nova so initially we saw that they are trying to as I put some statistics on this
a number of flocks and average flock size some are trying to form flocks but not good enough
yeah so most flocks are destroyed until like one flock in the corner survives yeah so it moves
towards the corner and here I think it starts growing or we can call it kind of development
until an adult stage yeah so there is a ring structure here it means like there is something
inside and on the circle yeah it starts growing the average flock size is increasing
yeah some predators around to put pressure on it there are some blues here to block the predators
from attacking the flock yeah it's growing it's developing and the critical moment is
around steps two thousand two thousand and two hundred I think yes
yeah I suddenly it starts spreading into two entities and a new ring structure emerges here
and also it's people uses again a new ring structure moves downward the screen
yeah they move they move in different the direction and oh yeah sorry yeah and
we can we we can call that the first flock in the on the screen is flock zero and the first
ring structure is flock one and the flock one after moving it starts reproducing again into two ring
structures right and also you see the second child yeah it starts reproducing again
in the box in the bottom of the screen okay so yeah so the result overview is that we have
observed a margin of cohesive groups and a transition from solitary boys to organized flocks
and the formation of ring structures and I speak exhibiting both stability and capacity for division
and potential mechanism for group level reproduction
and also we have observed the adaptation and survival at the group level
and there is some spontaneous emergence of group selection because some groups are formed but
they are not good enough to survive and the only one who the only one survives
then reproduce it itself there's some snapshots of the screen some critical moment
and we observed it
yeah so yeah so it's just statistics we observe that there is a number of flock count over time
until the step of like a 2000 times step only one flock survive for more than 1000 times steps and
the flock size starts increasing until the critical point of the transient of the reduction
it reduces the size because there's there are now two flocks yes and again it supports a hypothesis
and observation and here we observed another we call it I put this figure for observing the
role distribution and collective adaptation so here we see that the soldier and worker
soldier and worker ratio is inversely proportional to the change in flock size
yeah why because the remember that the flock zero the first flock it starts it's reproducing
under the pressure of three predators around so it will in the until the critical point of
transition it will require more soldiers for protection
and here is the same figure for flock zero the first ring structure when it reproduces we see that
it is the soldier and worker ratio is proportional to the change in flock size because
we observe that the flock one reproducing in the less threatened environment or surrounding
so it will favor more workers yeah so it's kind of collective adaptation at a collective level
yeah we observe it
yeah so we have demonstrated an artificial ETI or a kind of ETI in an artificial system
and this process is akin to the transition from solitary to social superorganisms
the whole process is that we have the crew formation by a self-organization capacity
which is an evolved and which is evolved and selected by natural selection
and we have observed spontaneous group selection some groups are better to survive
and there is interdependency within groups agents depend on each other to survive and to
reproduce and this makes a collective cohesive collective
and surviving agents present adaptive plastic division of labor because we know that the ability
to switch between rows is an evolvable ability because we are evolving new networks and new
networks are controlling that ability and we have observed a spontaneous group production
by a process akin to binary fission observed in mitochondria we see that mitochondria
is a ring structure also and some comparisons with other frameworks
unlike in selection we don't require genetic homogeneity for groups formation and survival
unlike multilevel selection or group selection we don't be supposed to formation of the existence
of the group but the group is positively formed from the bottom up
there are some thoughts after my simulation is that we can ask some questions like what are
the critical tests for population density and resource availability that facilitated the transition
to e-sociality and also we can study how does communication within a group evolve and facilitate
the organism of that e-social super organism and I'm more interested in how and can
transition generation and non-genetic inheritance such as form social learning
can support and the establishment and maintenance of e-social structures
and my whole research before my post my current process is about the bow and effect of the
interaction between evolution and lifetime plasticity in the next step I will
investigate is this bow and effect can foster or hinder the processor ETI especially when the
environment changes so we will require some ability to learn to predict the environmental
changes and here in this current simulation the predator is just presented as an environmental
challenges but it's not evolvable so the next step is let's say if we allow the predators to
evolve also and we include the self-organized ability as an evolvable trait like in boys
and can we observe an evolutionary arms race in the transition this means that the predators
should evolve and should evolve the transition into a bigger hole so that they can eat the predators
and then the the ring structure should evolve the ring structure of boys could evolve into a bigger
one which will be the next transition and also that I want I'm interested in whether the process
of self-organization and naturalism invites NOVA can be generalized into other ETIs in nature
and yes so in this simulation I'm using a simple neural network to simulate the transition from
solitary to e-sociality but in evolution in classic example of the transition evolution of
multi-cellularity the cell doesn't have neural network in it so how can we extend
right to NOVA to model multi-cellularity and the first thought is that I can use
gene regulatory network in the place of neural networks and yes some other technical stops
especially how I need to define more metrics to measure emergent collective behavior
and how can we define the collective genotype from vital NOVA yes and measure the difference
in change the change in genotype at the component level of boys and the change at the genotypic
level as a collective level to compare it yes thank you
