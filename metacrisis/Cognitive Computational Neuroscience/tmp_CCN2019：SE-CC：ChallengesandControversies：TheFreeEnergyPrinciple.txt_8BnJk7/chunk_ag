as a neuroscientist, you could go to
the empirical data.
One thing that's hit me in the past few years
is a fundamental distinction between
generative models based upon discrete
state spaces, like Markov decision
processes and hidden Markov
models and the like, and those
built around the assumption
you're dealing with continuous states
like Bayesian filters, predictive coding
and the like.
And just knowing that there are different
sorts of generative models that carve
in this way or that way, I think can put
a lot of very useful constraints
on the different
hypotheses
or process theories that you could then say,
well, does it look as though the brain's doing this kind
of message passing or that kind of message
passing or both.
And then we can get into the argument
about the neural code, what messages
are actually being passed and how
is it biophysically represented.
So I guess I'm
agreeing with you that the
specification, although the free energy
principle has nothing to say about it, when you
start to commit to a process theory
and you start to commit to the
generative model that will be apt for
this experimental paradigm, you do
actually narrow the hypothesis space about
the biophysics that will be doing
the
inference
and the kinds of
behaviors and neurophysiology
that you would see from that.
And then you just base
a model selection in the normal way to a
geutica.
Andre, do you want to give us your
question? Yeah, thanks for your presentation.
So I think in both presentations
we focused a lot on the needs
and also on the
mystics.
And are physiologists mystics
actually also?
That's not
my full question.
I'll just say that we are.
So we have the physicists
and the physiologists, psychologists
and so on on the other side.
But in between the scruffies, we haven't
discussed that very much and of course
a substantial part of the conference
are people from engineering and that are
trying to use some of these
principles to
make better models.
So I was wondering if the either the free
energy principle or theory
has informed
that engineering very practical
approach and if so, how?
And the other question
because we're in an interdisciplinary
setting here, it seems like
we are in a perfect setting to explore
the confluence
of those three groups together.
And I was wondering what you think
we can actually learn from each other
and what the interactions
should be between
the scruffies, the needs and
the mystics.
I'll say something.
So I barely remember
what those three things are. So scruffies were
engineers, is that right? Needs were physicists.
What was the third one?
Mystics. Mystics were
philosophers and then
where were we putting the physiologists?
I was going to say with the mystics.
With the mystics.
Yeah.
I don't know
how the free energy framework
particularly can bring these groups together
or explicate their differences, but I do
see a general way forward that is related to
like the Bayesian brain hypothesis
which is that
the role of the engineers
is to enhance
it's terrible, is to enhance
our computational space of models
to give us more P's for which we can find Q's
and actually do inference. So this is like saying
we can use artificial intelligence to help us figure
out maybe how real intelligence works.
Physiologists
obviously provide the constraints on what
biology can do which also tells us
something about behavioral, you know, the Q's
that are accessible, I think to some extent.
And philosophers
...
Oh, I'm sure there's one here.
Are there any philosophers here?
Philosophers can tell us what the right words
to use are.
That was pretty dismissive.
Do you want to go for that one too?
Also, someone
has asked, could Karl minimize my free energy
by speaking a bit louder?
Ah.
Sorry.
Right.
This is very enjoyable, by the way. Keep it coming.
We're trying to get to them.
I'd be interested
in your answer to be quite honest.
I mean, you do electrophysiology.
You are well versed in active inference
and some of the maths.
So when you've got your electrophysiology
cap on, do you
regard yourself as high church
theorist or
are you a mystic?
I would have actually put you with the scruffiness.
I think electrophysiologists need
to have a formal understanding
of the system
that they are trying to characterize.
And they are in the game, I think,
of testing the process theories that we've been talking about
doing the real heavy lifting.
But they need
to be able to
appeal to some theoretical framework
in order to
provide a mathematical rigor to their analyses
into their conclusions.
My experience is that they choose
what works.
So that would bring them
into the scruffy's camp.
And you're hearing the dialogue
here as to why it's good
to be a neat
or perhaps you're not.
What do you think?
Yeah, I like being
with the scruffies
doing something very practical.
But of course it has to be informed
that we have an infinite
space of possible experiments.
So we need to basically
use a theory to inform
what experiments we will do.
And even if a theory is conceptual,
only conceptual,
you still need to have something
to ground yourself in as a physiologist.
I was also wondering though
just in terms of the pure computational space,
people from AI and so on,
has there been any progress
in using free energy principles
in that space?
And if so, could you talk about them a little bit?
It's not my field,
but my limited knowledge of it
is it's making more
headway as one might imagine
in things like neuro robotics.
So we're talking about the construction of real-world artifacts.
So on the purely
software side, deep learning
is the oil tanker that is moving
forward and that's what everybody uses.
To be controversial,
I think that's exactly in the wrong
direction.
And it's obvious why.
Well, sorry, it should be
obvious why I say that, not why it's in the wrong direction.
It's all
about simplicity. It's always
