my favorite experiment. We talk about this one
when we're trying to do auditory
visual localization. One possibility is
that you're doing it optimally, so you take into account
uncertainty on both of them. Another possibility
is that you don't.
That you do
means that on every trial
your Q is a mean and a variance
for both auditory localization and visual
localization. And if you're not going to do it
in a Bayesian way, if we see that it's not coming
from behavior, the explanation would be that you're
not tracking the variance on a trial-by-trial
base. You have some kind of fixed variance
and ultimately, I think that's how you address these questions.
You build tasks for which
you can do the inversion. You know what
the P is. You look at the kinds
of deviations people have, humans,
monkeys, whatever, mice, have
from optimal behavior and try to come up
with explanations for them by manipulating,
by coming up with restrictions on
Q.
That says nothing about the neural code,
so I hope that your question really wasn't about
that.
And then how did the models
arise in the first place? So do we just go back
in early development of genetic
priors or are there any
insights that we can take from this
principle for how they
arise? The generative models that you
showed were necessary for this
theory, but not necessarily
for our
RL-based policy selection.
So, I mean, the way
that you'd normally frame those
questions in terms of hierarchical
Bayes, so, yeah, certainly
you could look at different timescales in
terms of evolution, neurodevelopment,
experience-dependent learning,
attentional contours, synaptic efficacy
right down to fast fluctuations
in, you know, responses
to visual motion as
essentially being reflections
of a hierarchical
generative model where
each level of the hierarchy
affords empirical prize on
the level below. And I guess in some
sense could be looked at as doing
a form of Bayesian model selection.
So if you have a hierarchical model
questions like where did the prize
come from, again, just go away.
So they just come from the next
level up. And you normally end up
with evolution as you
intimated at the top level.
That's not a get-out. You're then compelled
to model evolution as a
process or natural selection
as a process of Bayesian model selection.
And it all comes then down to defining
the relationship of the Q with
the P. But the Q is now the phenotype
and the P is the environment.
And natural selection now becomes a process
of the environment selecting those
phenotypes that are fit for purpose
in terms of then being able to model
P, the environment, until you
get to humanity when we start
to design our own environments
and then you get into the world of eco-niche
construction and free energy minimization
at an ethological
level, which you can go there
if you want to.
So I'm not quite going to agree
with that because what you've done
is you've introduced yet a third P.
That's why I have a subscript for M.
You said that P now,
there's a third P, the P
is the way the world actually works.
Which is, in my view,
I mean, how many scientific
anti-realists are there out there?
That's inaccessible.
It's not a thing. The only thing that you've got
is what you can store, whether you're
in your brain, what you can compute. That's either what's
in your brain or what's in your genes.
There is no P.
There's only a piece of M.
You're coming out as a radical skeptist.
Absolutely.
In front of everybody.
Oh, yes. I've done it before.
Every once in a while someone says,
what's the most controversial position you've ever taken?
I'm not sure you guys exist.
I place no metaphysical
significance on the latent variables of my models.
So...
I promise not to use philosophical
terms, and I just violated that. I apologize.
So, I'll be
the structural realist then,
if that helps me.
So, the position that I
would be forced to take, which probably
is not what I'd want to, if I was
not in a controversy,
is that there is something real out there.
And it is the P.
And the Q,
and the P that the Q is predicated on,
the sort of implicit genetic model,
which I agree entirely is not the real P.
It's not the genetic process,
is
constrained by the real P
out there.
But philosophically, it's a really
interesting position, because the
whole sort of
inferring from within your
the skull, when you just have
access to data, and everything,
everything that you do
is
based upon an inference about what's out there
that you'll never, ever actually directly connect
with, really does force you into
a skeptical position
philosophically. The problem
is that the free energy really
does depend upon the
goodness of those P's and Q's
in the head, in relation
to something that's generating
those sensory observations. So, you sort of
force back into a realist
position, just to motivate
the machinery. So, philosophically, it's
very uncomfortable for me, but you are clearly
comfortable being a skeptical, taking
a skeptical position. So, that's
very nice.
That's a nice thing about being a skeptic.
It doesn't matter.
There's a really neat question
here, and then we'll go to Andre, which is
will theories develop
differently in the context of the
free energy framework, if this
isn't a theory?
No.
They'll go on with that.
No, I'm happy with that answer.
Just no.
Okay, sorry.
Mike and soapbox.
It's a
language. It's a way of talking about
theories of brain function, in
my view. It's a very useful one.
But again, we can shoehorn, because
of the freedom to choose P's or P's and Q's,
we can shoehorn just about
any computational framework into it.
And so, no, it would not develop
differently, other than the fact that
people might start talking about reward
a little differently. That's a possibility.
I think that that's
talking about reward and default policy
is being exchangeable might be a good
thing. It might be helpful in some sense.
Again, it's certainly the case that we measure
policies and we infer rewards, and maybe
there'd be some benefit to that. I don't
know.
So, no was maybe a little strong.
I'm just wondering, I mean, in a
sense you
intimated several ways that you could
use the framework
just to elaborate
a whole bunch of process theories
predicated on different kinds of generative
models that then you could go to
