tools or they want to do enhancement that is customized that we have doctors trained in
integrative medicine and integrative neuropsych in particular and we're bringing additional
protocols to them that can actually help test people and do really good work so when you really
good personalized work so when you're asking how do you know what good resources are we're working
on curating doctors that really can do a good job of psychiatry and psychopharmacology both
you know and and not just what we think of a psychiatry but um neurochemical optimization
and that'll be cool in the meantime I would say if people are interested uh the integrative doctors
it's it's hard because some of them are awesome and some of them are terrible
but at least the integrative doctors are working on understanding personalization and root cause
in a deeper way than just what med is going to be given for this symptom in general the
institute for functional medicine doctors seem to be getting pretty well trained
but finding finding someone that you actually like and resonate with who will spend time
and who seems knowledgeable is a is a valuable tool
yeah the next part I'm sorry do you do you want to respond to that or do you want me to go on to
the circadian rhythms part oh I'm definitely interested in the circadian rhythms yeah
um are people circadian rhythms fixed or are they changeable uh different opinions on this
um there is a hypothesis that circadian rhythms are um
um have a strong genetic component and that um there are the morning larks the kind of normal
people and the night owls and that you have give or take 70 percent of people who have a normal
circadian rhythm um that basically you know wakes in the in the morning with light and
about 15 percent of the people that wake much earlier and 15 percent of people that stay awake
much later in the evolutionary biology story is that there always had to be some people awake
in evolutionary environments for tribes to be safe some watchmen and that there is a
genetic predisposition to be in those groups I don't know how solid that is I know there are
some genes that are correlated but we all obviously also know people who were night owls when they
were teenagers or in college and now they work a job where they wake up at 5 a.m every day um
most people can adapt their schedule fairly well most people also if they control artificial
lighting and stimulants and exercise and like that most people do better on an earlier schedule
than a later schedule now I'm saying that at 1 a.m my time yeah podcast and when I hop off here I'm
hopping on to another meeting um the rules of thumb like that are really good starting places
and then personal exploration is important because um I've had very early schedules and later
schedules and I actually do better on later schedule and uh so it is valuable for people to explore
what works best for them well part of the underlying question there is like
so it can be changed potentially maybe maybe not but also why why do we want to change it
and I think that can be down to the the personal needs say if you're in a relationship with someone
I experienced this in the past where you seem to be on the opposite timetables that can be
remarkably destructive um and can also seem to be a case that somebody has to compromise
for somebody else so it can be much more personal as opposed to simply you know the practical case
of I need this kind of job yeah it can be that it can be uh someone starts a spiritual practice
where they are in the meditation group at 4 a.m I think almost everybody when they have kids
gets a different circadian rhythm than they had before um because they are going to wake up
whatever time their kids come in um so lots of lots of reasons there but I will say getting
enough sleep is critical and um in general also getting enough light during the day is critical
and most people like I said do better if they're waking up with
with sunlight so they're waking up in the dawn vicinity and then getting an earlier bed and
a regular bedtime those are the general starting recommendations that any sleep expert will give
you and and then like I said some percentage of the people will find that they do better or
have personal reasons like you said to do otherwise so again we're back to the the
importance of sleep in and of itself and we we also talked about how to get better nutrition
into our bodies when it comes to the the other element that can make the difference to absorbing
these things that was the the gi piece that you you mentioned and for those possibly including me
there's some basic steps to get a sense of if there is a problem in the microbiome and what
can be done short of going into a specialist lab which I think in most cases is not immediately
available or affordable are there some steps that we can take
yeah so um for most people there are dietary things they can do that will
help their gut if they notice that they are having gi symptoms they're having gas or bloating
or tenderness in their abdomen or constipation or diarrhea or upper gi issues acidity etc
it gets complex and the you know the allopathic answer is to say you have IBD and which catches
so many things that's not that that's not that descriptive or useful right the integrative
approaches to the functional medicine approaches to try and figure out what's going on and is it
a food allergy is it dysbiosis is it actually pathogens um bacteria parasite etc many of which
even when they're there the tests have a lot of false negatives so it's kind of tricky to figure it
out um so the foundational things one can do uh someone can do an elimination diet and you can
read online on how to do an elimination diet where you um eliminate the foods that people commonly
react to so you eliminate the gluten grains the dairy the soy and corn um and sugar and
you know but different people react to different things so when you're doing elimination diets
there's different things you can eliminate and then after you know some period of time off of
them see do their symptoms get better if so then reintroduce the foods one at a time see
which one kicks the symptoms on and you start to get some insight this is the way people can
experiment on their own with what foods are bothersome the ones i mentioned are ones that
are classically bothersome for a lot of people and uh there are people who have bad gi reactions to
plants who have lectin sensitivities um but uh you know the the gluten thing is obviously a very
um heated controversial difficult topic uh for the most part the gluten sensitivity gluten sensitivity
thing is not just a marketing ploy and or like some weird fad um it is largely the result of
ubiquitous glyphosate use on wheat um and so it's not actually gluten itself it's this associated
dynamic there's a lot we could get into there um and there's a lot of books that are critiquing
grains and why there are problems with grains the paleo world is pretty big into this um where
people can study further but there are also a lot of people who leave the us go to europe and find
that they can eat bread and pasta when they're in many european countries and they come back here
and they can't and it actually does have to do with different agricultural methods in different
countries so again you can explore that topic but cutting out hard to digest foods and foods you
might be reacting to and finding which ones you react to is a first major step um some other
steps that are worth noting is not overeating is kind of a major step people are going to have gi
issues if they're overeating or if they're eating too fast or if they're not chewing well uh eating
too fast and not chewing well go together and especially if people are on the run or they're
eating while they're distracted um and the the mechanical part of digestion the actual chewing
and mastication is really critical for the chemical part of digestion to come later because
the acid and the enzymes are not designed to break down large chunks of food right they're
designed to take already tiny particles with a lot of surface area and break them down further
so eating in a slower calm environment healthier foods the right amount of them chewing that's
all a pretty big deal to what's going in your gi track um drinking enough water is actually quite
important so your gi track can flush and peristalsis is stimulated by water so specifically drinking a
lot of water first thing in the morning like half a liter to a liter first thing in the morning and
then waiting until that leaves your stomach before having breakfast something like a half hour uh
very helpful for a lot of people and then um taking the right pro and prebiotics can be very
helpful and the prebiotics are foods that are going to feed the uh healthy bacteria in the gut
and there's a lot of prebiotics that people can get into but just even starting simply with
things like resistant starch um just kind you know these are kinds of fiber that uh help feed
good bacteria differentially more than um bacteria that cause problems so a prebiotic supplement
taking it at night in particular is usually quite helpful and you can take it with a probiotic
and probiotics are tricky this is also one that you can personalize you can do an a test at home
for your microbiome with companies like biome or ubiome and see how your microbiome's doing and
start to personalize it you can do deeper tests with integrative doctors which is going to be super
useful um uh so i won't get into specific brands of probiotics uh but there there are ones that
can be quite meaningful yeah there's uh kind of taking a lot of mental notes there and took
a swig of water whilst you were talking as well there's a lot of things to to think about and
it's i guess something to to emphasize um people listening that it's not just i think a lot of
new tropics are thought of in terms of being for the mind and yet it's really this connection this
intimate relationship between the mind and the body and more and more it seems that
mental health issues such as depression can be caused or exacerbated by the things that are
happening in the microbiome and in the physical body i guess we know at the superficial level
if you go and do some exercise you probably feel better mentally and emotionally but when we talk
about diets and so on i think not everyone is making the the connection that there is a connection
between these things okay right before we hopped on i was talking to a friend who's just starting
her first business and she was um asking me if i would tell her just exactly what to do a checklist
for how to start a business and i said this is not the mindset it's not the appropriate mindset
to start a business it's that's the appropriate mindset to be an employee which you've always been
which is will someone else tell me what to do and i'll and i'll just do it right which is a mindset
that our parents in school and religion trained us well to do but if you're going to run your own
business then you actually have to figure out what the fuck to do you have to figure out what is
relevant what's needed does it make sense um and ultimately you're responsible for what if if your
business fails because of something your employees did it's still your business that failed you're
still the one that hired those employees that trained them that manage them that you know whatever
it was and um so and if your business succeeds it's ultimately yours right so the that the responsibility
well even more so when it comes to your own health um and when you if you coming back to the beginning
when we were talking about empowered responsibility and health
every single experience that we are going to have in this life is going to be mediated through our body
every experience of learning and helping people and making love and staring at a sunset and you
know every everything we're going to do is going to be mediated through our physiology and how long
it lasts and how vital it is and how um cognitively clear we are how emotionally clear we are is uh
uh it is all related to the bio hardware that our consciousness is running on and so you're
born here you got this body you didn't happen to have an education manual given to you for how
to really use it well but you should fucking figure it out like of all the things that everyone
should become an expert in learning how to take care of the vessel that they exist in
that mediates everything else they do should be one of the things that everybody develops
some capacity in yeah i guess because we all have one we take it so for granted that we
forget that it's it's the thing that's so important and ever present that it's easy to overlook um
as you say we people get rid of houses and get new ones that get rid of cars and get new ones you
cannot do that with your body not yet but you have to take care of it yeah as you as you say that
brings us round full circle to responsibility and uh i want to be respectful of your time
i feel like i i would happily um sit uh through your sleep cycle wait for you to wake up and
keep talking and just go round and round and round but um we can wrap things up for for this
particular occasion the there's just one more question we didn't ask you last time but we like
to ask the the guests and i think in the context of this conversation i think there should be it
is very fitting and that is what does living a high existence mean to you
well there's obviously lots of really fun ways to answer that i'll share one answer that's related
to something we talked about today which was you were asking the question of can we
enhance certain capabilities without detracting from other ones can we increase our ability to
focus on a task and do task switching simultaneously
we're we're used to doing a lot of theory of trade-offs in our life where at all scales what's
good for one country is bad for another country in terms of war or particular trade agreement
or whatever what's good for one company is bad for another company that's competing in space
what's good what seems like it's good for us today is actually bad for us tomorrow in terms
of the chocolate cake scenarios that we were talking about or the the smart drug we're using
that seems good for one aspect of life is actually damaging other aspects of life
um the the proposal that we're voting on is that leads to so much political polarization is because
it benefits some things and damages others and so people who care about one side cluster here
care about the other side cluster there as much as we can get over decision making based on
unnecessary dichotomies and unnecessary theory of trade-offs and say how can we factor everything
that is connected to all the things that are interconnected to a particular decision
that are meaningful and enhance them all simultaneously right enhance across dialectics
simultaneously so is there a way to help the economy make jobs and make the environment better
rather than jobs or the environment well there are and if you require that you find something
that does both life is going to be radically better can we find something that helps um task
switching and focus yes and now that starts to extend to everything can i live my life in a way
that is actually enjoyable now and that leads to a progressively more enjoyable future yes can i
figure out how to increase my gratitude of what it is while simultaneously increasing my motivation
to make things better yes so all of the dichotomies where we will typically enhance one thing at the
cost of something else meaningful um you know we could say a high existence is being high
in any particular area but most of the things that people would try to make higher they would
try to optimize would be at the expense of something else in the in the that previous
way of thinking about it so high across all domains simultaneously because we're thinking
about the interconnectedness of all of it and supporting the entire picture consciously
is it one meaningful way to think about high existence yeah i think that's the most
healthy way in which to try and approach it that we live in so many times we seem to think we're
we're living in a world of zero sum games um but what i like the what you're emphasizing which is
that if we begin from the premise of how can we find the best thing that includes all of these
elements rather than thinking i just want to go down one particular rabbit hole but thank you
thank you for that and thank you for coming on the show again and uh sharing a lot of very
deep knowledge that certainly got me thinking that uh i need to go and pursue some elimination
diet and maybe not keep buying cheesecake for me it's cheesecake rather than chocolate cake
it's my particular fascination so people can find links and everything to the neurohacker
collective um in the show notes but that's where to find you and we've linked up with you to create
a promotional offer for qualia that i'll give the full details in the the intro to this episode
and as you said there's it's not a risk to to check it out um and that people can try it and
see if it does work for them but it seems very likely that it will it was a delight to be here
with you and i'm happy to come back again if listeners have questions in particular they'd
like to go in a particular direction so if so uh let me know absolutely that would be awesome so if
you're listening you've got questions you want to ask daniel um then get in touch with us and
you can leave comments at the bottom of the post or on facebook whatever we'll be paying
attention to that and uh yeah for all the more reason to have another mind-opening conversation
so thanks again daniel and um until next time um i hope that we can all try and pursue
living a higher existence thank you john
