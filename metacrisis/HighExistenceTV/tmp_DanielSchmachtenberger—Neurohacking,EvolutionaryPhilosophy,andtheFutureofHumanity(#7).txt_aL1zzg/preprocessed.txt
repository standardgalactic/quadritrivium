I'm your host John Waterlow, you can find me over on High Existence and on my own podcast
Voices in the Dark.
Hey, welcome to the High Existence podcast.
I'm John Waterlow, joined by Martijn Scherp and we welcome, we have a great guest this
week, Daniel Schmacktenberger, who is a founder at the Neurohacker Collective, a movement
dedicated to upgrading our individual and collective capacities and to safeguarding
the well-being of all.
He's an evolutionary philosopher, systems designer, a strategist and I could probably
keep throwing lots of labels around and they'd still kind of apply.
There's a lot of crossover between different fields, which I think is something that we're
going to explore in this episode.
So Daniel, thank you very much for joining us.
Thanks for having me, it's fun to be here.
How do you feel about the labels, in fact, when trying to sum up the things that you're
interested in?
I like talking about things that I'm interested in more than labels of things that I am or
am not.
So when, in general, when people are wanting to ask what my background is, whatever, I
like sharing things that I'm passionate about and I like asking people similarly what they're
interested in.
And yeah, as you said, there's a lot of overlapping interests when you have a deep fascination
with the nature of reality and everything within it.
Yeah, I think it's good to start with the things that you're interested in rather than
making identity statements.
So what do you think, how would you sum up the mission of Neurohacker Collective and
what drives and prompted you to do the things that you do and what the Collective is aiming
to do?
So the Collective is an awesome project and it's one project that I've associated with
and there are other projects I'm associated with that do very different things.
So what its mission is and what moves me are partially overlapping.
The goal of Neurohacker is really at an individual level increasing human well-being and human
capacity and right now it's mostly focused on the physiology side of that but is eventually
interested in the psychology and psychological cognitive development side as well.
But specifically looking at how physiology affects psyche, both states of experience
and motion, well-being and capacities and working to do a better job of how we support
physiologies to predispose happier and more capable and more positively oriented people
is really the interest of it and in terms of what we're doing so far that's exploring
the space of what you could think of as kind of psychoneuropharmacology or psychiatry but
rather than just looking at single molecule solutions, how do we address dopamine through
one synthetic molecule or address serotonin through one synthetic molecule, trying to
look at is there anything even imbalanced with this person's dopamine-ergic system,
do we know and if so where did the imbalance occur and what do we understand about the
regulatory systems that are involved and what would a more comprehensive approach to supporting
those regulatory systems to do better and is dopamine the only thing that was imbalanced
if it was, were there other neurotransmitters involved, were there other nutrient imbalances
involved, were there gut brain access or neuroinflammatory dynamics, so how do we do a better job of
understanding the physiology as a whole as a subset of then not just physiology but the
mind, brain, environment complex but starting even just with physiology, how do we understand
how the different systems interact with each other more complexly, how do they self-regulate,
what leads to increased homeostatic resilience or decreased homeostatic resilience or deviation
from homeostasis and how can we do a better job of both understanding these systems and
supporting these systems to have more resilience and more capacity, so that's the goal of Neurohacker
and if you know if anyone goes to the website and checks it out, what they'll see right
now is some information about that mission writ large but then they'll see one offering
which is, you know, we had a first offering that was kind of how do we do something better
than the smart drugs that people are taking to increase productive capacity but that increase
fairly narrow bandwidth of productive capacity oftentimes at the expense of other meaningful
aspects so maybe we get more focus but certain memory metrics decrease, certain creativity
metrics decrease and maybe things like empathy decrease, anxiety can increase and it's doing
it in a way that creates long-term dependence and down-regulation, can we increase a broader
set of the things that are meaningful for people and do it in a way where because it's
working through and with their endogenous regulatory systems rather than overriding
them if they're on something like this for a while and then get off of it, they don't
have dependence and crash and if anything they have lasting elevation of baseline, those
are our goals and you know we're working on that for a number of other categories not
just in the productivity category but that was the first thing that we were able to get
far enough with to have as an offer. So that's Neurohacker.
Yes and those are kind of the areas where we're going to get into in a later episode
with the personal development but I think if we look at the bigger picture of societies
and where we are across the world it's almost the same problem but talking at the collective
level about how we can optimize what we have and try and raise and change some baselines
away from if there are depleted or dangerous levels. Do you see them as sort of overlapping
goals in that respect, the collective optimization or is it a different sort of perspective?
The human brain, the human physiology, the human psyche and culture and ecology are all
complex systems, self-organizing complex systems and we are not that good at interacting with
and supporting complex systems yet. The whole field of complexity science is still a brand
new field and hasn't really entered that meaningfully into how we approach things like design.
We're quite good at simple systems and we're also pretty good at complicated systems so
when I look at something like the laptop I'm talking to you on, the blueprint for how to
make it from the transistor level all the way up to all the parts fitting the other
software I mean there's a tremendous amount of information, no one person could do it,
it takes a tremendous number of people but there is a blueprint and it doesn't evolve
itself in real time right so it's a static design, it was designed, the computer didn't
design itself, it was designed from outside of itself and it doesn't repair itself as
opposed to when we look at biology and we see systems that organize and emerge in relationship
with their environment but without exogenous design and where they don't have a formal
blueprint, the blueprint itself is changing, the structure of it is changing in every interaction
even if we look at the genome, the genetic expression is changing and you know etc.
So what happens is when we're dealing with a complex system like human physiology and
if there's an acute cause of an issue like an injury we're pretty good at that in medicine
dealing with things like injuries, it doesn't mean we won't get a lot better and exponential
tech will help us get a lot better but when we're dealing with something like cancer or
autoimmune disease or neurodegenerative disease or something that doesn't have an obvious
acute cause it has complex causation and that might mean that there isn't one cause, there's
a number of different causes and they might not be the same for different people so we
might be looking at autoimmune disease where infection was part, some kind of subclinical
infection was part of a destabilization of homeodynamic systems and some kind of toxicity
exposure and maybe some kind of nutrient deficiency combined with some kind of genetic predisposition
all came together to lead to a series of imbalances that eventually we call MS or rheumatoid arthritis
or whatever it is and so not only might it be multifactorial but it might have many steps
of causal transform the infection leading to changed immune cells leading to autoimmune
antibodies etc and that happened over the course of time and you have this delayed time causation
all of this makes it much harder to assess cause and effect and so you need really a
deeper system that isn't just working with one variable at a time and where there's clear
causation but that can do this kind of complex causal assessment in the same way that we are
just starting with functional medicine and systems biology to try and understand the human
physiology more complexly but we have dealt with it pretty much like oh you have a tumor let's cut
it out rather than understand carcinogenesis well cut it out or radiate it out or poison it out
and they we've really dealt with global issues right we've dealt with the environment in very
much the same way the temperatures too high so let's do geoengineering to address decreasing
temperature but that's not addressing the cause of why the temperature is too high at all because
we really don't know how to do that well enough there's too many complex economic and social and
worldview and technological factors so we largely deal with it symptomatically we'll deal with wars
symptomatically without understanding all of the things that lead to patterns of human
experience and behavior that lead to war and so I would say that one of the things I'm really
interested in is understanding that universe is a complex not a complicated system that just like
our computer our civilization most of what we have built as civilization has been complicated
systems complex systems are antifragile inherently like in a in a forest each tree is exactly the way
that it is in relationship with everything else around and it's changing and adapting in real
time it's contextual right and because of all the ratio of aerobic to anaerobic microbes of
certain kinds of plants with others ones that fix nitrogen and take nitrogen you can't get one bug
that's going to devastate everything there's going to be predators for that bug there's not going
to be that much it likes whereas you contrast that to row crops and you can get a bug that can
devastate everything right the row cropping is fragile it is susceptible to collapse in a way
that you know robust complex biospheres aren't and we can think of physiologies you know in a
similar way we can give culture in a similar way well what we have called civilization so far has
been a process of converting complex systems into simple and complicated ones and that doesn't mean
it hasn't done anything good but it has been kind of a entropy generator in that way when you
think of evolution as increasing elegantly ordered complexity that has more synergy leading to new
emergent properties we take a tree than a forest that has an indefinite number of value
metrics right like it's value to pollinators and it's value to stabilizing the topsoil and the
sequestering CO2 and producing oxygen and home for these kinds of animals and just all these things
and and the fish a thousand miles away that have different water because of the way it stabilizes
topsoil and the people that eat the fish generations down down who are going to have different
epigenetic patterns because of it like the tree is in this radically interconnected complex system
so you say how do you even assess its value it's totally non fungible non inter exchangeable with
any like it and you can't even quantify it but if I kill it and turn it into two by fours that two
by fours not really adapting or changing it slowly degrades but otherwise it's a fixed thing I extract
it from its environment it has all I care about is a tensional and compressional strength two
things and I really am going to take that even further and just measure it in dollars and make
it accumulatable or exchangeable when we look at that process I took something that was contextualized
and complex I decontextualized it brought it into a lower degree of complexity and in the process
we're making we're actually making human civilization our whole habitability here fragile and so I'm
very interested in how we can understand universe and nature and reality better how we can understand
complexity and self-organization better so that we can work with the systems that like economics
is just made-up monopoly right like what our governments are made-up systems but ecology isn't
and biology isn't and psychology there are intrinsics to it even though there's plenty of
made-up stuff in there so how do we understand those better so that we can work with them in
ways that support real thriving of the things that are fundamentally meaningful in trying to
understand that and thinking thinking how much expertise needs to go into it it's part I was
thinking back to what you first said about the nature of the body that when say we have a disease
or a disorder of some kind there can be so many interlaced interlocking causal factors yet doctors
are often experts in just one of those so is there potentially an expert problem here that lots of
people are in their particular fields say economics and they only see things through the
economics lens do we need to have more jacks of all trades involved or is this a case of I don't
know re re understanding what you need to be to be an expert yeah so an expert in a complicated
system see one of the things about a complicated system is you can break it apart into parts and
understand the parts and isolation put it back together and you don't have the same kinds of
synergies that you have in complex self-organizing systems so no one has to understand every part
of the computer because we can take it apart and put a new CPU and put a new hard drive in and you
notice that we've treated bodies very much like that like oh this part's worn out let's take it out
put a new one in or you don't really need this part as opposed to like well what happened with
the regulatory systems here and what role did it really play and and a gastroenterologist can't
you know an neurologist an oncologist they can't really understand any of those parts
independent of the other ones because what's happening in the gut via the microbiome via
the gut brain access via the enteric nervous system via so many different kinds of pathways is
affecting what's happening in the nervous system and then all of the top-down mechanisms so there
is I wouldn't I wouldn't say that an expert problem is how I would describe it I would say
there's a problem of hyper-specialization in complex systems where that is just not the
right epistemology and Alfred North Whitehead wrote this great paper some decades ago called
the problem of over-specialization and said notice how we the smarter a kid is the earlier we
start moving them into specialization and we move them further and further into specialization so
that by the time they do their PhD there's a few people in the world that really understand their
dissertation and they have relatively little abstraction across domains lateral thinking
into other spaces etc because they're supposed to be able to do a good job of that specialized
expertise and of course we know there were benefits of specialization but I think then
there were real problems with it instead so when all of our a students are thinking about
tiny tiny parts then who's thinking about the whole and so we are leaving to people who didn't
you know excel that well to think about it or just nobody at all and it is just a complex kind of
system but it's not necessarily the one that we want or that works effectively so I wouldn't say
what we want is jack of all trades that's kind of a false dichotomy I would say people who are
studying complex systems and who are studying systems at all and who are studying deeper level
generalized principles and things like design that are cross applicable so that they can so that
they really have the right epistemology to understand the systems that they're looking at and to work
with them yes I think that's critical and I think it's been critical for a while but
especially in the face of machine learning within narrow intelligence right now already and over
the next little bit narrow intelligence via machine learning will just be better at us better than
us at combinatorics within finite spaces and it really is generalized intelligence that is at the
meaningful place for humans to develop themselves and work yeah and in that case it's it looks
like the education system and the way that we value certain kinds of education is going to need to
change and I've heard you speak passionately and passionately in the past about an issue that we
damp down kids curiosity in the traditional education systems and say no stop looking at that stop
playing with that you need to go and learn these specific exercises so I wonder how you think we
can reawaken that kind of curiosity without fear and when I say fear I mean the fear of parents or
older generations because they might want to nurture it in their kids they might want they
understand the necessity for it but if they don't have any answers themselves because they've only
the parents have only got this old-fashioned education how can we overcome this this divide
and find a way to nurture it in children yeah the thing that we call modern western education is
not the only system of education that has ever been explored and it's I don't think it's very hard
to have the educational philosophy argument that it is just not even a very good one for many
definitions of what is a meaningful way to educate a human being but when you look at kind of the
history of how it came about and things like we need you know the movement into an industrial
revolution where we needed people we need a lot of people to get trained to fulfill roles within
the industrial revolution that were pretty fun to build right factory line workers were pretty
fun like any of them could do basically what any of the other ones could do and MBAs are supposed
to be able to do pretty much what the other ones can do and doctors and so how do we society needs
people to fulfill these roles so how do we create both an extrinsic incentive economics to get them
to do it and how do we create an education system to train them up into these roles where then we
identify them with this role and this role is really fun to build anyone else who had that
training give or take a little bit there's gonna be profound meaninglessness in that because the
uniqueness of self is gone their own kind of self-directed process is gone right and again
especially in the place of robotic automation where those jobs are going to be getting automated
and not just physical robotic automation but even the deep deep learning through a lot of the things
that we think of as thinking things but things that are proceduralizable I think that actually makes
possible and necessitates a foundational rethinking of what education should be for and really like
what society what civilization should be for and it is rather if we if we can decouple to where the
jobs don't need the people to do them we can also decouple it where the people don't need the jobs
meaning start to actually change the economic structure because we don't need it to be a source
of extrinsic incentive then we get to say okay now we can actually have a system of interest where
entrance a incentive is deeper to both the economics and the education so what is an education system
where the focus is facilitating each child's unique expression their unique passion interest
curiosities capacities and following it right now you say how can parents how can teachers
participate with that if they weren't facilitated that way and they don't necessarily know the answer
and the kid the kid's gonna ask them questions they don't know answers to if the parents earnest
if they really are earnest about this they can go on a process of co-discovery with their kid
and when the kid says so why is the sky blue and the parent realizes that they don't actually know
they remember something about diffraction but maybe it is reflecting the ocean they don't really
fucking know right then they can be like well let's explore it together yeah and then rather than
push for that exploration to go in the way that they're interested in pay attention to the kids
interest and ask them like find out why they're interested in it and what their what their intuition
about it is what their thought is and help help go through the process of helping them learn how
to learn and facilitating their interest in life and letting their interest in life and their learning
reignite the adults also I think that's that's a key ingredient there that you mentioned I
hadn't thought of which is not only to go and find the answer for the kid but say first of all
what what do you think and why do you wonder that and try and tune into into the nature of that
curiosity but it's the the dynamic that I often see and I even feel it myself as a sort of sense
a little bit of shame and fear if someone asked me a question I feel I ought to know the answer to
and so it's kind of a conversation too about putting aside our own ego and need to appear a
certain way in front of others well there's a there's a few fun things here so let's first
address the part about asking the kid why they're interested so the kid asked why the sky is blue
maybe that was the question they asked in the moment but they're just really curious about why
any color has color and they could just as easily ask why is the leaf green and they really just
want to know what color is right and or they're really asking kind of a question about God and
existential things about like why did the creator make it that way because that's the way they're
thinking about it and today there's a they're thinking about things like why is anything the
way that it is or they're asking a question about why is it that we subjectively experience it as
blue and does that relate to what is objectively true and do we all experience it the same way if
you don't know you're gonna go into answering it the way you think they're asking it and then
you're gonna find them get bored pretty quickly and then you're gonna get frustrated and try and
get them to pay attention and so it's pretty important to actually pay attention to what is the
real inquiry and then not you go find the answer as if the answer already fucking exists they might
be asking questions the answers don't fully exist to and you get to like be in that process of
discovery together where the answer matters less than the investigation the inquiry the thinking
about it and some of the best questions are when they get to things where we don't know the answers
and their intuition about it might be as good as anybody's yeah that's the the hot that I guess
the the stereotype the picture of the from the mouths of babes thing where you start seeing the
world from a new angle just because somebody is asking a question which is unencumbered by years
of cultural conditioning yeah and you know if we're asking about so what's fundamentally real
is consciousness real and this is all arising in my consciousness is is matter fundamentally real
and my consciousness is an epiphenomenal neural networks if we ask a question where we were the
real answer right now is we don't fucking know this is the best thinkers in the world vehemently
disagree on this then it's a place where you get to actually have a dialogue with them really on
equal footing because you actually can't even though you can tell a whole history of Western
philosophy and Eastern philosophy on it you that still just brings you to I just told you a whole
lot of things about why I don't know and so if you can come back to the like fascination and the
interest you and you're in the same place as them and they do have they are touching it for the
first time in different ways how do you think we can get to to tackle the other point that I
mentioned is how do you think we can get to the point where we're not worrying about admitting
our ignorance maybe it's not such a big deal to a child but I think that we in in the West loosely
speaking it's it's seen as largely not okay to admit oh I don't know even though I feel that I
should yeah so I mean you can see what a great tool to control other people that is yes and you
can see how little real freedom you have and how little real ability for peace or intimacy or
honesty with other people you have well that bullshit's running in you now let's step back
and think about it like this for a minute let's think about the field of the knowable and the
field of the unknowable as ontologic categories well let's think of them as epistemological
categories for a minute you explain to our audience what the difference is yeah so ontology is in
philosophy the the inquiry into the study of what is fundamentally real what exists and epistemology
is how do we know like do we think this exists because we're measuring it and all getting the
same thing because we're experiencing it because we're intuiting it because we're doing math like
what is the what is the right process of coming to believe anything that we might believe and so
there's this deep relationship between what we think is real and how we think about anything
and so those are some some of the deep categories in philosophy so let's think about the knowable
stuff and the unknowable stuff now Heisenberg said limit on know ability at the quantum mechanical
level right said the position and the momentum of a quantum particle are not simultaneously knowable
and here's the big deal it wasn't an epistemological limit it wasn't we just can't get enough
information about it was an ontologic limit they don't both exist at the same time at the level
of the quantum it does not actually have a fixed amount of momentum and a fixed amount of position
and has something weirder than that like a probability distribution about how much of those
things it has and so there is a limit to the knowable and then you say okay well how many
quantum particles are there in universe and we're all the interactions between them and how much
unknowable is there from that and it's like okay that's you know that's a profound set
and girdle's incompleteness theorem said set a limit on the knowable when it comes to mathematics
right the foundational axiomatic set of math is infinite well we you can't know infinite shit
the knowable's always finite but the unknowable is infinite so it's important to to get first that
the unknowable is a larger class than the knowable fundamentally and then within the knowable you
have the known and the unknown and the known is i have a reasonable confidence margin through
whatever process that my understanding of this is pretty good and the unknown is this is hypothetically
knowable stuff we just don't know it yet and there's plenty of that within that the unknown
is also a larger class than the known is within the knowable now why why am i specifying this
i'm specifying it because if i think that i should know most things then i actually just
don't know the deepest things about the nature of knowability itself
and so that idea like oh someone asked me something i don't know there's something
wrong with me like to just realize how ridiculous that fucking thought is
yeah and it's oh and to instead say okay well there there is an infinite class of things i don't
know and couldn't know and then there's a bunch of things that i could know that i don't and that's
forever and that is fascinating right that is in in enthralling it's like you get to touch
a sense of awe in that and so i think that reframe of just really getting how vast reality is and how
complex and how deep and and then being able to have a totally different humility in relationship to
it there's an emotional and even spiritual element to this i think that people find i found if you
study something in depth when you go into the subject at first you can make all sorts of strong
and sweeping claims because you don't know enough to know how complicated it is and that's quite
exciting and then the more that you learn you realize uh oh i feel like i have to equivocate
over everything all the time because everything's so complicated i wish i could go back to when i knew
less but then the transformation can happen where you can become comfortable knowing that you don't
know much yeah so this is a this is a fun process right so we will see you go to academic conference
and you'll see the top scientists in a domain almost tripping over themselves to not make
any real statements because um they don't want to say something wrong in front of all the other
people that probably know a shit ton of stuff that they that they don't know that is relevant
where what they're saying might be wrong and then you look at um people who are radically less educated
about a field and you know adamant and passionate about it so now i i basically i shared half of
the story so one half is um this is actually this is a fun story so related to the knowable and the
unknowable and the known and the unknown within the knowable our subjective relationship has to do
with certainty and uncertainty and think think about it like this in the um in the pre-modern world
and most of the kind of religious traditions and maybe not some of the mystical interpretations
of them but at least in in the uh dominant expressions of the religious traditions um certainty
had a pretty high value right have certainty that i know who the right god is and i didn't get the
wrong god and i'm dedicated to that when i'm doing the right things not the wrong things and like and
if i get it wrong like i go i could go to hell instead of going to heaven or i could reincarnate
badly instead of reincarnating well and i'm certain enough that we can burn women as witches and do
crusades and whatever we need to do because we have enough certainty about that rightness right
right now science started to emerge and have a lot more success in in really important things like
aiming cannons um and you know practical physical things which is actually part of what i proliferated
in one um and it acknowledged certain kinds of uncertainties but it also gave us the capacity
for more certainty plenty of questions like do heavy things and light things or dense things
and non-dense things fall at the same speed we were able to start solving some of that stuff right
and earth being rounder flatter and um and so even though within the philosophy of science
the purely uncertainty holding it is very deep a lot of people carried the kind of emotional
orientation towards certainty into the way they did science and wanted to like be pretty sure that
the world started with the universe started with a big bang and you know matter first and biology
and consciousness emerged from neural networks and and this this isn't actually the philosophy of
science it's actually an emotional structure of uh associating certainty with security
and value and associating uncertainty within security fear and lack of value which create
which is an emotional and existential bias leading to a cognitive bias so then postmodernism
saw these flaws and it said shit look at all the things that we fucked up in the name of
over certainty all the things we were certain about what we were wrong later even within the
sciences when we were pretty certain we had it almost all figured out around the time of Maxwell's
equations and modern physics fucked it all up and that's just happened so many times we really
shouldn't ever be certain about anything because historically we've been wrong about all of it
and whenever we were whenever we were over certain we could do really terrible stuff
and so then postmodernism said we should actually embrace uncertainty about everything
and kind of all certainty and of course i'm radically simplifying all of pre-modernism
and then modernity and then postmodernity um but a move towards embrace uncertainty
and any idea any narrative is just one narrative and isn't fundamentally true and we don't know
and so then it kind of pathologized certainty and made uncertainty laudable and i think both
of those are untenable and you know we we can actually see some major problems in the world
from certain interpretations of postmodern that have led to the post fact world that have led to
increased likelihood for strong man leaders to come in in a post fact world and um but
i would say part of maturity is having a mature relationship with certainty and uncertainty
inside of ourselves and it's it's what you could call it epistemic maturity which is
i have a reasonable confidence margin for certainty about these things based on the
appropriate processes that i went through to come to it and i have less confidence margin
about these things and i have no confidence margin about these things but my security and
universe and my self-worth aren't coupled to any of it yeah yeah and that's that's a big point
that people become so emotionally wrapped up in it and as you were talking about that
postmodernism there i thought of someone who we featured on the site quite a bit Jordan Peterson
who has a particular kind of gripe against who he calls postmodernists and yet the people he's
talking about seem to have gone kind of full circle where they've become very certain about
their position where things they're saying well there is no inherent truth in anything and in
particular we'll talk about say cultural relativism or cultural appropriation but they've suddenly
become dogmatic about it which seems to totally contradict the original point if you read Foucault
or Derrida or some of the good postmodern philosophers there was like real insights there
right there were there were key important insights and they were not equally like the critiques were
not about all of the sciences equally if you look at say the way we did social sciences
and all of the bias that affects how we do social science that is going to affect the
way we do chemistry less right not none but less and so you know there are there are important
insights there but when you look at so let you know let's take a fun case let's take the conversation
between Sam Harris and Dan Dennett about free will and consciousness these guys are on the same
team when it comes to you know atheism and the problems of superstitious ideas and
religious metaphysical ideas but then when it comes to foundational ontology
itself they actually disagreed on the deepest things one could disagree on right Sam says
consciousness is real but there's no free will and Dan said no there is free will but consciousness
is not real like those are the deepest and they and they are both philosophers of science
and both have read the same books and both understand critical thinking it's like well
how the fuck could they come to things that are that different and it's you know and Sam actually
said something really important in the end of that dialogue if and if you if you've read it but
it's it was a fun one he said it seems that we just have fundamentally different intuitions
and or something to that effect and that that is actually like in AI there's this thing called
the symbol grounding problem how do we get the symbols to ground into experience right when you
when you when you think of an apple you know things about the way an apple can be tart or sweet
or mealy or its skin can kind of peel off or it can snap or like you have so many interdependent
contextual things and you've taken it in through a tongue and a nose and your fingers and so many
sensory organs plus the abstraction layers of it that the symbol has grounded right the symbol
apple has grounded through all of those sensory channels and so if you haven't had some of the
same sensory channels you're not going to get the symbol grounding in the same way so I'm I'm
studying the chemistry of an apple but I haven't tasted it no matter how much fucking chemistry
about an apple I've got and I know what the EEG patterns of people tasting it are I still don't
know what the fucking apple tastes like and so there is a place at which as much as we're trying
to be totally objective and logical what what when we hear it can land as true or not has to connect
to some experience set that lands as true has to it is not a purely those axioms are reasonable
and can be later reified by the process and this this was a good process for deriving other things
from those axioms so I accept it the one of the main sources of our cognitive bias isn't just
the normal logical fallacies everybody you know those are easy to study it's a bunch of emotional
and existential level biases that affect the way we process and that's where the really subtle
work comes in can you give a few examples yeah remember the first time that this hit me so clearly
a very long time ago but I was I was young I was talking to someone about their religious
persuasion they had moved from being a kind of new age hindu to a fundamentalist muslim and
that seemed like a very and they did that well in
california upper class and like that seems like a very interesting step that doesn't make
that much sense to me and so I asked them questions about the theology of islam and if
they really believed these aspects of the theology and and it wasn't getting anywhere like it there
was no place where they were really willing to look at the aspects of the theology that was pretty
sure they probably didn't believe and but in the process of the way I was asking I was actually
damaging my rapport with this person and in damaging rapport I was damaging the ability to
actually have a meaningful conversation about this or any topic right and so I stopped and then I
came back to let me see if I can just create rapport about anything we get rapport fast forward
about a year because it takes that much time to repair the rapport from an issue like this and
I end up finding out that this person comes to islam and their particular beliefs I'm not
saying this would be true for everyone I'm saying that this one case this was a place of realizing
this person's past was that they actually couldn't say no and they couldn't set limits or boundaries
from themselves because of like family sexual trauma that had happened in their childhood
and they got to a place where they were there were some things that happened in their life and
because they couldn't say no to some fairly terrible things that led to their relationship
breaking whatever and they they're like oh wow I'm gonna die basically because I can't set limits
or say no and then right around that time they met a friend who had just joined islam and
they were talking about it and the rules and kind of the absoluteness of the rules and that they
didn't have to hold boundaries themselves they just being someone who believed that got to follow
those rules and at a survival level that told this person oh she could actually survive because she
could adopt a ruleset that now she could say no with that reason it bypassed her childhood
reasons of not being able to say no and so what I realized was it had nothing to do with theology
even though later the theology backfelled itself as a rationalization and so I was addressing it
at totally the wrong level because it wasn't the level at which the decision was made the choice
wasn't made by a deep rational introspection and and study of the theology compared to other
theologies and so then when I talked with them about basically just childhood and their ability
to say no and set boundaries and construct those capacities inside of them rather than try to
deconstruct a belief once they actually felt they had that capacity they ended up deconstructing
the religious belief on their own right their critical thinking couldn't kick in because it was
if their critical thinking kicked in or if they allowed anyone else's critical thinking to kick
in it would hit a survival level fear for them of a belief that was meeting a need
and maybe it's the need to get to still be part of your family because if you leave the religion
you won't be part of the family or you won't be part of the community or or you're too afraid of
death and so you know there's an extent whatever it is or it's it's a situation where if you say
this particular thing inside of academia and inside of the sciences you'll be shunned for
saying something that is so non-standard model that you lose all kinds of opportunity so there's
like all these little subtle and not so subtle sources of bias that affect the process of how
we go about understanding reality it's it's also the same sort of mechanism I think you have when
you make a big change in your life or maybe you leave a place of employment and people become
angry with you because you're changing you're not what they expected anymore because for them
there's they could receive it as an implicit criticism of themselves and their choices
and that's all happening kind of as a subtext and people are getting angry and they maybe
don't know why they're angry yeah yeah so now you come back to the cultural relativism and
you see okay someone might have taken postmodern philosophy and used it as cognitive backfill
to positions that largely came from other places they didn't just come from a
emotionally neutral existential neutral study of the topics and that this was the
very best thinking they could come within the topic it might have been their own trauma or
witnessing a trauma in the world that was so problematic that they took it on or resonated
with it and that's affecting then the way they are you know what they're resonating with intellectually
and how they're processing it do you how do you think we can become more aware of that in ourselves
if we if we start from the point that we're willing to become more aware of it a lot of
these things just sort of well up as emotions and sometimes that's useful and sometimes it's not but
maybe if we take the example of cultural appropriation which is such a hot topic at the moment
how do you see that playing out for people emotionally and how might we be able to
have a more productive self-reflective conversation about it
well one good thing is I want to see if I can take both sides or any side of the topic well
enough that I really get it and if I can't if while I'm trying to take the other side I feel
like I'm mocking at the whole time because it just seems so stupid then there is some bias that
won't actually allow me to see reality through that lens and see if I'm missing anything right
and so then part of earnestness would be can I actually do I know that I'm seeing what they're
seeing or am I I might not be but I actually like notice how many times there's a I want to stay
in with the people who share a belief similar to me or coming to this belief that I had answered
some really critical things that made me feel more okay or like I had my shit together or safer
in universe or smarter and leaving that feel scary you know you notice all those kinds of things
and so I would say the degree to which we can identify with our own earnestness
to learn and explore more than our current position about things that's a much better
identity to the degree we need to have one I think with with the example of cultural appropriation
when I try and think into the mind of someone who thinks that it's pretty much always a bad thing
it goes out sort of two rough pictures of what that can be driven by and one is the more negative
kind of wanting to virtue signal and want to be right on and sort of accrues the sort of certainty
we talked about before that I know that this is the this is wrong to do it's morally wrong and
therefore I'm a good person and the other I think comes from a place of pain that it's hard to want
to identify with that if you feel that you your culture or the the culture of your your parents
and relatives has been taken and abused that's quite a deep hurt and you're coming from a place
where you feel there is no understanding of you it's a deep alienation pain and that's also very
uncomfortable to enter into yeah so I think this is a good process right where you're you're not
making everyone who believes that cultural appropriation is an issue in the same category
you're acknowledging that there might be different epistemologies and different processes that bring
them there which is key and then you're kind of feeling into what those could be and some that
you can really empathize with this is not a topic that I would say I have very deep familiarity
or expertise with but but as I just think into it right now with you there's a bunch of things that
come up right as I think about someone who says cultural appropriation is wrong and why that would be
I can imagine reasons deeper than just even the pain of a culture that has been damaged by another
culture I can imagine very real reasons so let's say we take hey white people shouldn't wear
dreadlocks or they shouldn't wear hindu bindis or they shouldn't you know wear harry christian
harry christian of chicapony tales or whatever whatever it is right well then you say well
what were those things well there's a superficial answer which is they were some aesthetic whatever
right but then you go deeper well it was actually a signaling mechanism of people who had went through
so say say in getting that um that brahman string or getting that mall or getting that
whatever it was they had actually went through specific rituals specific processes practices
worldview where then they could see anyone else who had that and they could know here's a person
that I'm going to have a certain amount of shared experience with and it created a signaling that
was actually relevant not only maybe for survival which it very much might have been in a world
where in group outgroup dynamics have determined most of survival but also their ability for deeper
connection trust coherence and they're like okay that that that actually meant something sacred
and now if someone else is is taking that thing without all that it meant now I actually don't
know my signaling system is broken and I don't know if these are people with shared experience or
not or and so you think about like there might be layers of depth that you're just completely
missing in an argument when you come to a position on it and I'm not saying I think cultural appropriation
is always wrong I'm saying I as I start to imagine in I can think of a lot of things and I would want
to listen a lot and I'd want to see can I be earnest about it or does something come up in me
it starts to get blocked and if it does I want to look at that well I think that's that's a great
attitude is both self-reflective and asking questions but also not seeking to have a certainty
at the at the end of it and what what comes up for me when you're you're describing those
sorts of singles symbol systems and how how we can read those things is is it at the core that we
have as humans trying to understand each other and improve ourselves are we kind of tripping over
a kind of an innate nature which is tribal and wanting certain systems to make sense and apply
to everybody is that something that we can overcome big question to dump on you different
questions let me separate are we tribal and signaling mechanisms in human nature
sure signaling mechanisms were actually part of what helped us go beyond tribalism
because if I'm in a hunter-gathered society pre-agrarian society and we're below done bar
number right typically below 150 people maybe meaningfully below that I actually don't need
signaling mechanisms because I know all the people like I first hand actually know them all I've
lived with them my whole life and I know if it's the people that I know and can trust or other
people that I don't know and so actually don't need symbolism because I don't need an abstraction
layer I'm actually in my instantiated experience right okay and now if we want to get a number of
tribes to be able to come together into villages and then kingdoms and then nation states or you
know religious associations or whatever larger kind of entity that has some coherence then the
question is how do we have coherence with other people that we don't know but that we've chosen
to have coherence for coherence with in a situation where that was survival relevant
and now signaling mechanisms were a major part of how that happened right so now
you know you're a red team we're blue team the fact that you've got a red shirt on even
though I haven't met you like I know that we're that you're playing on my side that's called
the what flag are you flying right and so you notice with regard to cultural appropriation like
there are people who get pretty bent out of shape of someone who isn't a citizen of their country
using their flag in a certain way yeah it's a it's a similar thing right I mean it's a related
topic of wait this is a way that our group was able to maintain some coherence against forces
that were arrayed against it and you know you think about like how would us or or UK military deal
with if someone was fucking up their intelligence system right and the signals that were coming
into their intel like that would be a problem if you see someone like the crime of being
dressed as a police officer if you're not a police officer or being dressed as a military
official is actually a crime because that system of signaling is very meaningful and
and so one thing I would say is like now many of those systems have have interspersed so much
that we then have cultures like the US that doesn't really have a culture right that's the mix of a
whole bunch of different things because it's fairly new and um and and so then of course it makes
sense to allow those cultures to come together and to make new emergent things from one perspective
from another perspective if some of those subgroups feel like they are still needing to maintain some
of their identity for survival or thriving reasons then it's like wait fuck this is a real issue
and oh yeah by the way the US was built on slavery and on a genocide and if that hasn't
even been addressed like there there are there are issues with some of the appropriation that
are on the pain side so uh I I know I went off topic a little bit but I don't think that this
I don't think the signaling I think that's actually an abstraction layer to make larger
cultures cohere that's not tribalism now if by tribalism what you really meant was in group
outgroup behavior I guess I probably did but beyond the Dunbar number um now that's a different
question are humans so are humans capable of moving beyond the Dunbar number obviously right
like being able to have some sense of coherence with abstracted people well that's what what
nations and religions and whatever have been um and they've had they've mostly only been able to do
it through hierarchical systems that where the there was loss of freedom of individuals within
those systems to maintain coherence now um Machiavelli you know his enemy hypothesis said that the
only way to get a group of people to cohere sustainably beyond the Dunbar number is if they
have a shared outside threat that is a bigger threat than their reason to not cohere with each other
um that has been true for the most part right like we've we you can get uh you can have infighting
between Shiite and Shuni until they have the west as a big enough uh you know shared foe that they
can actually unify against that that's been true I think there's a dynamic that's about to happen
that is different than anything that has ever happened and I think so I think this is actually
an important piece of changing social science axioms for a minute um so how do you get the whole
how do you get everyone on this little spaceship biosphere to recognize that they are all inside
of the same spaceship biosphere and now we're affecting things at the level of the whole
fucking biosphere right it's like climate change and biodiversity loss and like all those issues
and if we have catastrophic threats from the way we develop exponential tech like AI or nanotech or
like these are not local issues so they so local governance doesn't make any sense if we're affecting
each other completely like China and India and the US can't can't think about climate change as
countries in a meaningful you know sense without what each other are doing so how do we get that
to happen well either you've got to have some aliens attack so we can all unify against the
common enemy you've got to abstract the enemy and say climate change is the enemy we all need to
unify to keep ourselves from going extinct as a species or ai is the enemy whatever the fuck we
decide or you can actually unify um so the first part is you can unify against an abstract threat
right it does not have to be an agentic threat so something like environmental destruction or
catastrophic risk of any kind could be a unifying imperative it's harder but it's possible but the
next thing is we also can't unify towards shared goals where it is more useful for us to do that
than not and this is a important thing and i think right now we have a situation where if we
continue in group out group dynamics there is no way to not move into catastrophic and even
existential risk zone and so we absolutely do have abstracted enemy hypothesis drivers of our
need to be totally coherent um but we also have you know the the kinds of opportunities that are
most interesting to all of us are only realizable that way why do i say this if we think about it
from a game theoretic perspective those early tribes would cohere with each other as a team to then
if when they needed to compete against other tribes in a win lose game model and they would
compete either for resource extraction of scarce resources or direct head-on competition through
war right through military conflict and if there was enough abundance of resources materials that
it was easier to take shit from nature from the commons and fight each other then they wouldn't
fight if the they're started to be scarcity and fighting each other uh directly or indirectly
became a a necessity or an easier thing to do than that happened and then of course if there's a
larger uh tribe and we can't actually uh fight them competently then we might unify with some
other smaller tribes but then now we're bigger that's going to have them do it now we're at villages
and then they're going to keep unifying and creating better now we need signaling systems
right now we need culture larger and so we'll eventually get nation states and economic
trading blocks but as as we think about this kind of what we've called civilization growing
from tribes into what we what we have now of you know kinds of large conglomerated superpower
dynamics where the ability we've where our ability to compete with each other for extracting scarce
resource from the earth is actually giving us towards the points of making the earth not habitable
across major regions and where then you start getting you know massive refugee human migration
issues that start to collapse grid infrastructure that can't handle it over the next little bit
Syria was already an example of that droughts leading to people moving from subsistence farming
areas into the city leading to resource shortage leading to the war and the escalation that happened
and it was basically a small one um but also even then you know these these groups in war with each
other we don't we can't use our weapons right like China and Russia in the US like we just
can't get into a war with each other so we will try and deal with them as proxy wars or whatever
but we have weapons that are powerful enough that winning would against the other one since the
other one also has powerful enough shit winning would require destroying the whole playing field
for everybody when you get to enough power in a game theoretic situation where winning requires
destroying the playing field so it equals losing even for the winner and when lose game theory becomes
omnilose lose because there's that much power then you either have to get off game theory entirely
and this means in group out group dynamics or you go or you go extinct or very near right you
have a massive step down in in capacity catastrophic or existential risk i think in the next very
little bit very short number of years we either continue competing for the extraction of scarce
resources moving the biosphere towards more uh you know critical fragility um and keep competing
with each other in heads-on fashions that end up and competing for more powerful tech that leads
to exponential tech that is autocatalytic and can run away from us in a number of different ways
and we we we will have then a radical step down in civilization either no civilization or a radical
step down if we continue doing that or we actually figure out what the fuck omni win win on a little
bitty biosphere where we're all in it together means and it means it it means something where
nations are an obsolete idea they might have served evolutionary relevance but they don't
anymore and it means something where private balance sheets that where you want to accumulate
more shit on your balance sheet because it leads to new capacities but scarce stuff that other people
don't have and where nature doesn't have a balance sheet so all of the economic incentive is to
externalize cost to nature take shit out of nature and compete with each other for that shit
served evolutionary relevance but can't go further either so there is some you know a post
win lose game theory a post uh in-group out-group mentality requires a complete shift to economics
complete shift to governance complete shift to culture religion all the way down to a shifted
identity where i'm not even a fucking separate being in my mind
of course i'm an individual and actually even a totally unique non-fungible individual but
i'm an individual that wouldn't exist without the whole rest of it they wouldn't exist without an
atmosphere with oxygen they wouldn't exist in the way that i am without other people doing a
gazillion functions that my life depends on and when i get that we're all these emergent properties
of an interconnected whole and unique emergent properties that are not replaceable at that identity
level we can start getting something that can transcend in-group out-group dynamics
this reminds me of i don't know if you've read a book called finite and infinite games yep by
james course yeah it's a great read for for those who haven't read it there's he outlines a perspective
on essentially everything in human life where we can see it as a game and a finite game there's
winners and losers and a clear outcome and it's it's finite it's not going to be something you
could repeat it you could do multiple times in a series but each outcome is kind of set whereas the
point of an infinite game is to keep playing so like a relationship or we would say the human
species if this is the game we're playing what we want to do is not to have winners and losers
but to be able to enable the game to continue rolling along and yeah it's it's a great foundational
book and i highly recommend it for everyone and it has so many layers of depth and meaning built
in that if you're if you're reading it it's a treatise on economics and governance and spirituality
and human psychology at the same time but that core idea that finite games are meant to be one
and when you win the game's over and infinite games are meant to continue the game of play
it's a it is a so we're looking at a shift from win-lose game theory to omni win-win or a different
concept even of what win means from mostly zero sum to increasingly positive sum from finite to
infinite there's a whole shift but that new thing isn't even anything like what we have called a game
previously yeah and if and if to win is to play then this brings us to a couple of points of ideas
that people have talked about i know you talk about the commons as a key reference point in your work
where things that are common like the common resources or the the things that are common to
everyone like the environment but then we face the problem of say hardly anybody who uses wikipedia
actually contributes to it and how can we change that perspective and then there's another obvious
example which is the idea of a universal basic income which would enable people to keep playing
their lives without feeling that if they they don't do certain things they're simply not going to be
able to play at all and i wonder if you could comment on the the usual objections that come
up against those which tend to be people are selfish and they don't care about others how
can we reconfigure our people's ideas of what the game is that they're playing
yeah so you're asking questions that um to really deconstruct a lot of our ideas around
evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology and what we think of as human nature genetically
and um economic theory and then adequately reconstruct new things would take enough time
that since i'm not gonna get to do it i'm gonna just push push buttons of all of those um i think
that we have got human conditioning that is actually relatively new but that has become
very ubiquitous because it was successful in a win-lose game theoretic structure and it's so
ubiquitous that we've done pretty much all of our social science within that context and so we
stop factoring the context and call it human nature right we've we've done almost all of our
social sciences within capitalism we've done almost all of it within nation states right within
those kinds of structures done it within win-lose game theory in a mostly post industrial definitely
post agrarian world most the history of our species is pre agrarian um definitely pre nation
say and and you know pre agrarian also meant pre capital pre private ownership of surplus
because there was no fucking surplus um and so there's a totally different relationship to those
things so um and then we say okay well the way that we're behaving since it's ubiquitous must
be nature rather than nurture so then let's try and look for the genes that correlate and make
it a genetic answer and this is where i think our our biases lead to bad science um
so i won't go further down there but i will say that most of what we call inalienable human
nature i think is uh our nature expressed through a certain set of conditions and different enough
conditions can can have what is nature expressed differently now i'm gonna come back and say the
whole nature nurture what is fundamentally possible to the human condition it we can ask a
thought experiment about it that's different than we've been able to ask previously because
crisper is is making the conversation of human genetic engineering a real not that far off
possible conversation right it's a big fucking deal because if we say okay well maybe maybe
there is something that is genetic and maybe we can change those genes then it brings up
instantly now we're in deep existentialism around
oh if we can actually change something that we thought of as nature what is fundamentally
desirable outside of what we thought was a fixed context right um should do we want to
then change the genes where everyone is a hyper competitor do we and and they're the most violent
and largest alpha men possible only do we want to make it to our now alphas are irrelevant and
everyone is a super cooperator do we want to make it to where people are happy all the time
and we have done the abolitionist imperative and got rid of the ability to
suffer and feel pain or do we like are there evolutionary and psychological purposes that
stay relevant to like now we're in a very deep existential philosophical place and it's important
that we go there now as soon as we can start to you know ask those questions then we can come back
to okay well here are some things that are meaningful about the human condition what of
them might actually be possible even without the genetic engineering but it does make us start
thinking that the what we have thought of as human nature that was a hard unfixed limit
we can at least think about it more flexibly which i think is a useful thought experiment
but
if you have a if you have a situation where there's a lot of shitty jobs right
like touring roads is just not that fun and you know etc etc so it doesn't mean that
nobody would would never want to go do some touring of a road or different kinds of labor
or different kinds of road tasks but most people wouldn't want to do 50 hours of it a week for 40
years right yeah and yet the society has needed people to do a bunch of that shit
and so when you then see people as the vector for getting societal things done
you have to have an extrinsic motive system to get people to do it so if we all pool our resources
and then make sure everybody has resources we call it communism then then why would anyone
do the shitty jobs well now the state has to force them so we call it imperialism and that's
why we don't like communism um it's i'm radically over simplifying of course but that's like at
the heart of the argument so then we say cool let's let the free market force people because
that's better so when the state's not going to force people but if but they don't get any basic
needs met so if they don't go do one of the shitty jobs they starve now we'll say that they
have the freedom to get better education and hopefully not have to do the shitty jobs but of
course it's not a real argument since a lot of people are going to have to do the shitty jobs
because somebody has to right and those who are born into families where someone else was doing it
have a lot less likelihood to have access to good education and good healthcare and good training
and so in a situation where the default is having nothing you need to get stuff to just survive
bottom of mazlo's hierarchy but now surviving doesn't give me the next levels of mazlo's hierarchy
right like my belonging the more shit that i get the more i'll be able to actually get relationships
and do things with friends that have the resources to do stuff and and my esteem all the way up to
my self actualization the more that i can get shit the more capacity i have to self express and do
and like that every level of mazlo's hierarchy if i want it and we value the scare shit where you
having something then you don't have access to it like a shopping cart you have possession of it
where when you're not using it i still can't use it and so because you possessing some
scarce thing there's not enough of for everybody means that i don't have access we're in fundamental
competition with each other right and if there's something that's abundant enough that uh you
having it doesn't decrease my access at all like air we put no economic value at all on it because
there's no ability to have differential advantage associated with getting some of the scarce thing
and because we put no economic value on the air we'll pollute the shit out of it and burn it up
because it doesn't enter our economics uh calculus that is the basis of our decision making but we'll
work really hard to get the gold or the diamond or whatever it is that we perceive as scarce enough
that if i have it gives me some differential advantage over you but then i'm going to take
that gold or diamond and put it in a safe that is doing nothing for anyone other than a fiat
purpose right and then because it's scarce this is important to get because the values
proportional to the scarcity because we're not looking for systemic advantage we're looking for
differential competitive advantage which is assumed if the thing became unscars it would
have no value like air so as soon as we start finding that diamonds aren't as scarce as we
thought they were we start burning and crushing and hiding them right now we need to artificially
manufacture scarcity um so when you have a system where if you don't get shit you die and if you
don't get more shit you don't get to express very well and anyone else getting shit means you don't
have it and win lose dynamics everywhere like if you if i wanted to condition greed and selfishness
and jealousy in the people the best i could that's how the fuck i would do it this is how you train
people to be that that exactly and if i wanted to train people to be psychopaths right not like
i put them through enough first person childhood trauma or they have the right kind of brain injuries
or genes for formal psychopathy but i want to decrease their empathy pretty radically and their
ability to rationalize harm well i would do things like capitalism and large you know and then the
evolutions of capitalism that happen corporate capitalism where if you aren't willing to participate
in something that's going to have externalities you just don't get a run a big company if you're
running a big company you've got to say yeah shit well those mines are run by slave labor but like
there's just no other mines and if we tried to pay for fair trade we'd be totally out of business so
you got to like crack some eggs to make some omelette so just even being able to participate
with a system that isn't closed loop that doesn't actually value all the metrics that it affects
requires rationalizing harm and having a kind of abstracted psychopathy so you know we have a system
that you can think of as conditioning low-grade ubiquitous psychopathy in everybody and then
we do social science on it we call it human nature yeah and then we can change it then we do that
to rationalize the system again continuing exactly but like you know if i walk by a homeless person
and they have they're in real pain right they might even be bleeding they might be
really dirty they and i just walk by because i'm busy i got shit to do and maybe i give them five
bucks but you know i walk by there is something wrong with me at a human level there is some
way that i was able to turn my empathy off where this this appointment i got to get to that is
trivial as fuck in comparison to this other person's whole life i just i can and i can be fine
just continuing to be worried about my busyness like what the fuck how could i do that well
because there's so many homeless people i can't fix all of them and then that then that rationalizes
none of them right but that's that's systemic that is a system where empathy isn't even viable
in the system and so everybody has to turn it down or go crazy yeah it's also like a personal if
i don't have the language makes sense but it's a personally systemic thing that if you think you
can't help all the people then you won't help one then you never help anybody yeah and so well
you know because it doesn't you say all right i can try and do this like i'll help this one thing
but then if i'm if i care about this one enough to really help them i turn my feeling back on
right and then you're on the danger zone i turn my feeling back on now what about the next one
and the next one and when do i stop but also and when do i decide that actually upgrading
from my last year's Mercedes to this next year's Mercedes is worth more than helping a couple more
of them what were you going to say martin well in this system when you do help that other person
you might depend on the extent you help them but you also start risking your own safety in future
so if you if you really want to help them and you want to give them all the resources
and you already have yourself live in scarcity which a lot of people do like you have to take
care of your own shit first before you can help anyone else but that's the story right that's
that's the story that we tell and then of course now this is a very painful thing to say but most
people then if you look at at the end of their life the amount of shit that they've consumed
and what that did to the environment what it did to however many animals that were involved
how many species went extinct related to those supply chains how many animals and factory farms
and then how many migrant workers how many people in sweatshops etc and you and you look at all of
that and then you compare it to what that person then did once they got ahead well enough to help
other people like there they are on the liability side of nature's balance sheet yes now the answer
is not obvious because the answer doesn't exist within this system the answer is actually needing
to build new systems that don't take complexity and make it simple or complicated right that don't
do win lose game theoretic structures so when when you look at this it is that it's actually
there aren't obvious answers that are good and meaningful about how to like okay how do we
prevent war and have a world full of peace like why the fuck do we still have war it would seem
like world peace is something everybody wants okay well how do you have a for-profit military
industrial complex as the largest block of global economics and understanding the laws
of supply and demand have a world that doesn't have war like how do those two things get lived
together they don't they don't right and so then when we say well we're working on peace are you
working to obsolete having a for-profit military industrial complex because if not you have no
chance of addressing it because any system of supply has to continue to maintain and protect
and grow its source of demand and that's even just the directors following their fiduciary
responsibility to the shareholders of the company I mean like that so the point is it's a the system
as a whole is a paperclip maximizer and there's there's an identity problem here at the core too
that if you're trying to say obsolete a military industrial complex the people within it don't
want to be obsoleted but in the same way that somebody who has spent their whole life tiring
the roads and that's the only skill they feel they have they also don't want to be obsoleted
because there's that sense of existential confusion and angst over well well what am I then I'm being
forced to become something else and that's frightening right right so the shift that has to
happen does include a macro structural shift but it also includes individual both trauma
and attachments level shifts and identity level shifts right because most people's identity like
that not most people everybody's identity was conditioned by a system and it's adaptive within
it and it's actually maladaptive to making something else and then I guess we come back to
the question of still wanting to have control over your life and how things make sense but if
we're talking about a radical shift in human development and something that we've come to
think of as human nature which you said likely is just something we call human nature because
it's been the case for long enough that we think it's fundamental that we have to overhaul some
very basic structures of thought here so looking looking forward at that process do you think this
is we're a chrysalis about to turn into a butterfly or are you kind of more worried than that?
I think that if we just okay first I will say that we have what I might call kind of naive
techno optimism which I won't name names but they're much of Silicon Valley is famous for right
and that that narrative is also connected to kind of this that dialectic of progress that we
used to have these short brutish nasty lives and shit has just been getting continuously better
with capitalism and tech and industry you know on a on a consistent path that's going to continue
forever and every problem we have that ahead we don't really have to worry about because human
ingenuity always figures it out I do think that this is radically naive I think that is a more
dangerous worldview than fundamentalist religious worldviews because the fundamentalist religious
worldviews can't create new tech that gives us more power and having more power exponentially
more power to affect shit without having comprehensively better decision making means
exponential externality equals catastrophic risk we have a scenario right now where exponential tech
is means we are we don't know how to make an intuition around exponents because we've never
had them right we we've got we can maybe make a sense out of like curves that are slightly
inflected up for a short period of time but not really right so with an exponential curve our
intuition can't really make sense of it but we have exponentially increasing capacity to affect
the world around us militarily and through supply chains and through extraction technology through
all kinds of things and well of course there are positive applications there's there's more
negative applications and there are positive applications because thermodynamics just works
that way right like there there's one way to put all the pieces of a cell together where it's a
cell and it respirates there's lots of fucking ways to take it apart um and so and it and it takes
a year to build a house or six months but it takes a few minutes with a record ball to break
it down entropy is just easier so when we develop new technological capacity the negative applications
have higher probabilities if i'm just looking at an even playing field of probability so we have to
factor that so if we're two things we're exponentially increasing our capacity to affect
the world around us while simultaneously decreasing the quality of our decision making in many areas
because exponential increase in information technology combined with an economic structure
where having information having data is competitive advantage in a system where i need
competitive advantage so i want to both hide things that are true and i want to even share
disinformation right like fake left and then go right to make get the competitor off of that we
have all sorts of incentive to dis disinform but with exponential information tech media tech
then we get such a glut of noise that you can't even identify signal clearly
and so this is why we're in this kind of post fact world where it's like okay how long do we
have with climate change before the coral die nobody fucking knows how much uranium is fukushima
really releasing or how close is it to a to a reactor meltdown or a or can north korea's nukes
really hit north america or not or or did rusher really meddle in the election or like
we actually don't have the ability to make sense of fucking anything
that matters to whether we survive as a species or not because the disinform so we've had this
escalating disinformation for reasons that make sense right for just competitive advantage on
information and recent and incentive to to disinform can but that means decrease capacity to
make sense of the world which means decrease capacity to make good choices with increased
capacity to make powerful choices so techno optimism why i say it's a dangerous worldview is
because it is actually capable of advancing the tech that within the current structure is
self-terminating and so we do need to say okay shit nature does this complex
self-organizing self adaptive resilient thing the era of evolution is defined by it
how do we make a complex human built world that is that has closed loops that doesn't have
externality that is continuously adaptive rather than a complicated one and how do we do it
in harmony with the complex system of nature rather than you know with nature as a finite
consumable substrate we have to figure that out and that that is of course even more advanced
tech and more advanced science but fundamentally different oh so you were asking i'm sorry the
question the are we going to make it are we not going to make it how does it look well if i just
plot the current curves the current curves don't look good if if we look at any of the groups working
on global catastrophic risk assessment nexus sensor risk assessment the probabilities of really
problematic stuff are way too high way too near term now that said you know you asked this question
about caterpillar into a butterfly this is a really interesting question because if i didn't know
the caterpillar was going to go into a chrysalis and do the butterfly thing and i was just watching
the caterpillar grow and i was forecasting a curve i would assume that it just kept becoming a bigger
and bigger caterpillar and eating more and more shit until it decimated all the plants and ate
itself to extinction yeah and so i can't keep plotting that curve because it's not going to
do that curve it's going to do that curve till a certain point where it's actually eating enough
stuff meaning the caterpillar is a net consumption machine right like it doesn't pollinate stuff all
it does is devastate everything around it consuming but it's getting the raw materials the minerals
amino acids to make a butterfly so but as this consumption machine it is devastating the environment
around it but once it eats enough stuff that it has the fuel and resource necessary to make a
butterfly the imaginal cells the first butterfly cells start kicking on triggers the movement
into the chrysalis at which point the caterpillar ends up dissolving like all the organs dissolve
right dissolves all the way down to uh subcellular structures and then gets to reform right at an
amino acid at a peptide level reformed to a butterfly it is not a retrofit of a caterpillar
it's a fundamentally different thing with a fundamentally different code
but you wouldn't have predicted that discrete phase shift by just continuing to forecast along
the caterpillar curve any more than you would if you just took the 40 weeks of in utero development
and said it looks bad right like if we didn't know birth was going to happen it's getting really
cramped around 42 weeks around 44 weeks it looks like it's just going to like get too big and die
and this the same can be true said true for a little bird developing inside of an egg shell
right like there all the developmental phases are defined by net consumption and net growth
in a finite self-terminating way to get to the point that of course if it tried to continue it
would go it would die but it's to get to the point that it has the capacity to go through some
discrete phase shift the chrysalis the birth out of the uterus and the cutting of the umbilical
cord the emergence out of the egg shell and then on the other side of that discrete phase
shift is a totally new curve and so then the question is could there be a discrete phase shift
that where all of what we've called humanity or civilization so far has been a developmental
phase where we were focused on with capitalism military industrial complex all the civilization
structures we're focused on gathering the parts necessary to build a truly global sustainable
regenerative anti-fragile complex civilization but now it's not going to be an extension of the
current system it is a dissolve and then restructure those technologies those capacities for a
fundamentally new reason for being and that is i would say the the hope and the possibility is a
world where win-lose game theory got us a lot of capacity to actually not just be a tribal people
but a global people but now we actually have to transcend at at the place where we've gotten so
much power to win that that power actually can't be used without destroying itself we have to now
transcend win-lose game theory right i guess so let's say last question for this this part of our
discussion then um are you optimistic about that do you think this is going to be the
chrysalis moment and that we're going to just be creating or turn into a new paradigm of some kind
is there enough cause for hope that we could feel that way
it's a tricky question um uh there there's a utilitarian answer which is depending upon
what is going to move people more it's important for them to hold both sides right if if getting
that it's not a given that we make it can shake someone enough from just wanting to win at a dying
game then they might need to go through that and i think probably most people do and it's important
but then not stay stuck there and then say okay well now i don't want to win at a dying game or a
game that is causing the death of of what is meaningful itself i want to help birth a new game
now what is what is that if you think of it as inevitable then it doesn't necessarily
compel your participation if you think of it as impossible it doesn't compel your participation
either if you think of it as possible and not yet determined and influencible by how you show up i
think that's the right way to think about it so i have one last question in this regard um
what can we do then on an individual level to
make this shift happen
yeah so i'm going to answer that in a meta way first
good
ask that question earnestly a lot
and really work for answers without assuming that any authority already has them
and not assuming that there aren't places that have a lot of answer that you want to study right
but like for whatever faults we can assess there uh gondi did some very
meaningful things that have have not been done at that scale maybe maybe ever and one of the
interesting parts of the story when he said you know in south africa the first time then india
later he said okay i'm gonna i'm gonna stop this i'm gonna get a home rule for india and people
said how he said i have no idea but he said like i know that it's right i know that these people
being enslaved by another people is not right i know that's right so i'm committed to aligning
my life to make it happen fully before knowing how there's a decision before the problem solving
and so then it was like then because of that he said so my how i'm gonna just sit here in journal
and think about it and meditate and pray and do whatever process i have to come up with a how and
then when i give that how i'm gonna try it and then when it failed he was like no i didn't fail i
just learned something kind of like Edison's life but let me try again we have to take something
an approach where there is a where there's a knowing that we don't actually know how to do
this fundamentally new phase yet we want to learn from all the people that have been thinking well
about it and we want to be thinking well about it and we want to be adding our energy to it as
best as we can and we want to get really fucking earnest about that and notice wait where am i
actually just kind of mostly trying to win at the current system and and what does that mean
and think more deeply about it so the first thing i would say is is really that like rather than
rather than you know me give an answer do this thing it's activate yourself as an agent of
sense making as a as a capable being that can actually make sense of shit and think about it and
work on stuff and so the the answer what can you do i one thing that it is not is donate some money
to charity and go do some volunteer work sometimes and recycle and like ride your bike to work
all of that is lovely and we we still hit catastrophe if that's if that's the best we're
doing because it's not like decrease our personal consumption a little bit try and do some good stuff
changes anything at scale like people have to take a deeper level of responsibility for
how do we actually change these meta systems what could a future of economics post capitalism
that's viable really look like so then you say well i don't know let's start studying it study
post capitalism and and study different systems that have been proposed and then look out what are
groups that are working on things and is there something i can meaningfully contribute all
right well that system makes sense but i have no idea how the fuck we get there all right what
might a transitional system that's intelligible to the current system but vectors towards that so
maybe aspects of the venus project and resource based economies are not fully dialed in but there
are parts of it that are right but how do you vector there maybe some parts of crypto currency
blockchain is also inadequate but maybe convector that you start kind of really dialing in
what are the closest things we know for how to think about both what a viable civilization
could look like and how we can vector there and um yeah i mean that that's what i would really say
is think about it earnestly educate yourself and work on it and and actually realize that it matters
that's really helpful thank you yeah i agree that's definitely it's keeping an it's an active
mind and not just looking for quick fixes um which i guess is part of the core of what
what your work is and what neuro hacker is trying to do but people want to find out more about um
your own thinking and writing as well as neuro hacker where can they go to find you
you know uh all of this work on kind of macroeconomics and sense making and
governance and infrastructure um there is no place that that's hosted on the web yet but
there is about to be um we you know we have some kind of think tank like organizations
that focus on these things but it uh they're not publishing at some point they might i'll let you
know um i'm about to put up a website in like a week or so and i i'll give you the url it'll be
civilization emerging dot com or something like that um but uh you know for right now there's
people can come make friends on facebook and maybe see some things and neuro hacker is not
really focused on um you know future of macroeconomics whatever directly but it is focused on
can we develop can we you know take complex system science and develop better technologies
to help humans have the capacity to participate in these things more meaningfully so if you're
interested in that topic then uh neuro hacker has interesting resources yeah that's neurohacker.com
for people to check that out and um looking forward to in a future conversation talking deeply about
optimizing and at least improving our human capacity so then from which point hopefully
we can tackle some of these bigger issues we've been talking about and i guess learn how to play
a different game in the process so yeah thanks so much for your time and for sharing all of this
daniel i've i've learned a lot and i've really enjoyed the conversation.
Likewise these were um these were fun questions and topics and i i appreciate it and you know on
the topic of what can we do to help meaningfully transform civilization looking at the model that
that y'all are working on which is you know what i said is people should work to educate themselves
meaningfully and study and explore both outside education and mining their own thinking where are
the sources of good information that are relevant and i see that that's what you all have been working
to do here that's what we do bring together resources so that's i'm very happy about that thank you
