chance of addressing it because any system of supply has to continue to maintain and protect
and grow its source of demand and that's even just the directors following their fiduciary
responsibility to the shareholders of the company I mean like that so the point is it's a the system
as a whole is a paperclip maximizer and there's there's an identity problem here at the core too
that if you're trying to say obsolete a military industrial complex the people within it don't
want to be obsoleted but in the same way that somebody who has spent their whole life tiring
the roads and that's the only skill they feel they have they also don't want to be obsoleted
because there's that sense of existential confusion and angst over well well what am I then I'm being
forced to become something else and that's frightening right right so the shift that has to
happen does include a macro structural shift but it also includes individual both trauma
and attachments level shifts and identity level shifts right because most people's identity like
that not most people everybody's identity was conditioned by a system and it's adaptive within
it and it's actually maladaptive to making something else and then I guess we come back to
the question of still wanting to have control over your life and how things make sense but if
we're talking about a radical shift in human development and something that we've come to
think of as human nature which you said likely is just something we call human nature because
it's been the case for long enough that we think it's fundamental that we have to overhaul some
very basic structures of thought here so looking looking forward at that process do you think this
is we're a chrysalis about to turn into a butterfly or are you kind of more worried than that?
I think that if we just okay first I will say that we have what I might call kind of naive
techno optimism which I won't name names but they're much of Silicon Valley is famous for right
and that that narrative is also connected to kind of this that dialectic of progress that we
used to have these short brutish nasty lives and shit has just been getting continuously better
with capitalism and tech and industry you know on a on a consistent path that's going to continue
forever and every problem we have that ahead we don't really have to worry about because human
ingenuity always figures it out I do think that this is radically naive I think that is a more
dangerous worldview than fundamentalist religious worldviews because the fundamentalist religious
worldviews can't create new tech that gives us more power and having more power exponentially
more power to affect shit without having comprehensively better decision making means
exponential externality equals catastrophic risk we have a scenario right now where exponential tech
is means we are we don't know how to make an intuition around exponents because we've never
had them right we we've got we can maybe make a sense out of like curves that are slightly
inflected up for a short period of time but not really right so with an exponential curve our
intuition can't really make sense of it but we have exponentially increasing capacity to affect
the world around us militarily and through supply chains and through extraction technology through
all kinds of things and well of course there are positive applications there's there's more
negative applications and there are positive applications because thermodynamics just works
that way right like there there's one way to put all the pieces of a cell together where it's a
cell and it respirates there's lots of fucking ways to take it apart um and so and it and it takes
a year to build a house or six months but it takes a few minutes with a record ball to break
it down entropy is just easier so when we develop new technological capacity the negative applications
have higher probabilities if i'm just looking at an even playing field of probability so we have to
factor that so if we're two things we're exponentially increasing our capacity to affect
the world around us while simultaneously decreasing the quality of our decision making in many areas
because exponential increase in information technology combined with an economic structure
where having information having data is competitive advantage in a system where i need
competitive advantage so i want to both hide things that are true and i want to even share
disinformation right like fake left and then go right to make get the competitor off of that we
have all sorts of incentive to dis disinform but with exponential information tech media tech
then we get such a glut of noise that you can't even identify signal clearly
and so this is why we're in this kind of post fact world where it's like okay how long do we
have with climate change before the coral die nobody fucking knows how much uranium is fukushima
really releasing or how close is it to a to a reactor meltdown or a or can north korea's nukes
really hit north america or not or or did rusher really meddle in the election or like
we actually don't have the ability to make sense of fucking anything
that matters to whether we survive as a species or not because the disinform so we've had this
escalating disinformation for reasons that make sense right for just competitive advantage on
information and recent and incentive to to disinform can but that means decrease capacity to
make sense of the world which means decrease capacity to make good choices with increased
capacity to make powerful choices so techno optimism why i say it's a dangerous worldview is
because it is actually capable of advancing the tech that within the current structure is
self-terminating and so we do need to say okay shit nature does this complex
self-organizing self adaptive resilient thing the era of evolution is defined by it
how do we make a complex human built world that is that has closed loops that doesn't have
externality that is continuously adaptive rather than a complicated one and how do we do it
in harmony with the complex system of nature rather than you know with nature as a finite
consumable substrate we have to figure that out and that that is of course even more advanced
tech and more advanced science but fundamentally different oh so you were asking i'm sorry the
question the are we going to make it are we not going to make it how does it look well if i just
plot the current curves the current curves don't look good if if we look at any of the groups working
on global catastrophic risk assessment nexus sensor risk assessment the probabilities of really
problematic stuff are way too high way too near term now that said you know you asked this question
about caterpillar into a butterfly this is a really interesting question because if i didn't know
the caterpillar was going to go into a chrysalis and do the butterfly thing and i was just watching
the caterpillar grow and i was forecasting a curve i would assume that it just kept becoming a bigger
and bigger caterpillar and eating more and more shit until it decimated all the plants and ate
itself to extinction yeah and so i can't keep plotting that curve because it's not going to
do that curve it's going to do that curve till a certain point where it's actually eating enough
stuff meaning the caterpillar is a net consumption machine right like it doesn't pollinate stuff all
it does is devastate everything around it consuming but it's getting the raw materials the minerals
amino acids to make a butterfly so but as this consumption machine it is devastating the environment
around it but once it eats enough stuff that it has the fuel and resource necessary to make a
butterfly the imaginal cells the first butterfly cells start kicking on triggers the movement
into the chrysalis at which point the caterpillar ends up dissolving like all the organs dissolve
right dissolves all the way down to uh subcellular structures and then gets to reform right at an
amino acid at a peptide level reformed to a butterfly it is not a retrofit of a caterpillar
it's a fundamentally different thing with a fundamentally different code
but you wouldn't have predicted that discrete phase shift by just continuing to forecast along
the caterpillar curve any more than you would if you just took the 40 weeks of in utero development
and said it looks bad right like if we didn't know birth was going to happen it's getting really
cramped around 42 weeks around 44 weeks it looks like it's just going to like get too big and die
and this the same can be true said true for a little bird developing inside of an egg shell
right like there all the developmental phases are defined by net consumption and net growth
in a finite self-terminating way to get to the point that of course if it tried to continue it
would go it would die but it's to get to the point that it has the capacity to go through some
discrete phase shift the chrysalis the birth out of the uterus and the cutting of the umbilical
cord the emergence out of the egg shell and then on the other side of that discrete phase
shift is a totally new curve and so then the question is could there be a discrete phase shift
that where all of what we've called humanity or civilization so far has been a developmental
phase where we were focused on with capitalism military industrial complex all the civilization
structures we're focused on gathering the parts necessary to build a truly global sustainable
regenerative anti-fragile complex civilization but now it's not going to be an extension of the
current system it is a dissolve and then restructure those technologies those capacities for a
fundamentally new reason for being and that is i would say the the hope and the possibility is a
world where win-lose game theory got us a lot of capacity to actually not just be a tribal people
but a global people but now we actually have to transcend at at the place where we've gotten so
much power to win that that power actually can't be used without destroying itself we have to now
transcend win-lose game theory right i guess so let's say last question for this this part of our
discussion then um are you optimistic about that do you think this is going to be the
chrysalis moment and that we're going to just be creating or turn into a new paradigm of some kind
is there enough cause for hope that we could feel that way
it's a tricky question um uh there there's a utilitarian answer which is depending upon
what is going to move people more it's important for them to hold both sides right if if getting
that it's not a given that we make it can shake someone enough from just wanting to win at a dying
game then they might need to go through that and i think probably most people do and it's important
but then not stay stuck there and then say okay well now i don't want to win at a dying game or a
game that is causing the death of of what is meaningful itself i want to help birth a new game
now what is what is that if you think of it as inevitable then it doesn't necessarily
compel your participation if you think of it as impossible it doesn't compel your participation
either if you think of it as possible and not yet determined and influencible by how you show up i
think that's the right way to think about it so i have one last question in this regard um
what can we do then on an individual level to
make this shift happen
yeah so i'm going to answer that in a meta way first
good
ask that question earnestly a lot
and really work for answers without assuming that any authority already has them
and not assuming that there aren't places that have a lot of answer that you want to study right
but like for whatever faults we can assess there uh gondi did some very
meaningful things that have have not been done at that scale maybe maybe ever and one of the
interesting parts of the story when he said you know in south africa the first time then india
later he said okay i'm gonna i'm gonna stop this i'm gonna get a home rule for india and people
said how he said i have no idea but he said like i know that it's right i know that these people
being enslaved by another people is not right i know that's right so i'm committed to aligning
my life to make it happen fully before knowing how there's a decision before the problem solving
and so then it was like then because of that he said so my how i'm gonna just sit here in journal
and think about it and meditate and pray and do whatever process i have to come up with a how and
then when i give that how i'm gonna try it and then when it failed he was like no i didn't fail i
just learned something kind of like Edison's life but let me try again we have to take something
an approach where there is a where there's a knowing that we don't actually know how to do
this fundamentally new phase yet we want to learn from all the people that have been thinking well
about it and we want to be thinking well about it and we want to be adding our energy to it as
best as we can and we want to get really fucking earnest about that and notice wait where am i
actually just kind of mostly trying to win at the current system and and what does that mean
and think more deeply about it so the first thing i would say is is really that like rather than
rather than you know me give an answer do this thing it's activate yourself as an agent of
sense making as a as a capable being that can actually make sense of shit and think about it and
work on stuff and so the the answer what can you do i one thing that it is not is donate some money
to charity and go do some volunteer work sometimes and recycle and like ride your bike to work
all of that is lovely and we we still hit catastrophe if that's if that's the best we're
doing because it's not like decrease our personal consumption a little bit try and do some good stuff
changes anything at scale like people have to take a deeper level of responsibility for
how do we actually change these meta systems what could a future of economics post capitalism
that's viable really look like so then you say well i don't know let's start studying it study
post capitalism and and study different systems that have been proposed and then look out what are
groups that are working on things and is there something i can meaningfully contribute all
right well that system makes sense but i have no idea how the fuck we get there all right what
might a transitional system that's intelligible to the current system but vectors towards that so
maybe aspects of the venus project and resource based economies are not fully dialed in but there
are parts of it that are right but how do you vector there maybe some parts of crypto currency
blockchain is also inadequate but maybe convector that you start kind of really dialing in
what are the closest things we know for how to think about both what a viable civilization
could look like and how we can vector there and um yeah i mean that that's what i would really say
is think about it earnestly educate yourself and work on it and and actually realize that it matters
that's really helpful thank you yeah i agree that's definitely it's keeping an it's an active
mind and not just looking for quick fixes um which i guess is part of the core of what
what your work is and what neuro hacker is trying to do but people want to find out more about um
your own thinking and writing as well as neuro hacker where can they go to find you
you know uh all of this work on kind of macroeconomics and sense making and
governance and infrastructure um there is no place that that's hosted on the web yet but
there is about to be um we you know we have some kind of think tank like organizations
that focus on these things but it uh they're not publishing at some point they might i'll let you
know um i'm about to put up a website in like a week or so and i i'll give you the url it'll be
civilization emerging dot com or something like that um but uh you know for right now there's
people can come make friends on facebook and maybe see some things and neuro hacker is not
really focused on um you know future of macroeconomics whatever directly but it is focused on
can we develop can we you know take complex system science and develop better technologies
to help humans have the capacity to participate in these things more meaningfully so if you're
interested in that topic then uh neuro hacker has interesting resources yeah that's neurohacker.com
for people to check that out and um looking forward to in a future conversation talking deeply about
optimizing and at least improving our human capacity so then from which point hopefully
we can tackle some of these bigger issues we've been talking about and i guess learn how to play
a different game in the process so yeah thanks so much for your time and for sharing all of this
daniel i've i've learned a lot and i've really enjoyed the conversation.
Likewise these were um these were fun questions and topics and i i appreciate it and you know on
the topic of what can we do to help meaningfully transform civilization looking at the model that
that y'all are working on which is you know what i said is people should work to educate themselves
meaningfully and study and explore both outside education and mining their own thinking where are
the sources of good information that are relevant and i see that that's what you all have been working
to do here that's what we do bring together resources so that's i'm very happy about that thank you
