I'm your host John Waterlow, you can find me over on High Existence and on my own podcast
Voices in the Dark.
Hey, welcome to the High Existence podcast.
I'm John Waterlow, joined by Martijn Scherp and we welcome, we have a great guest this
week, Daniel Schmacktenberger, who is a founder at the Neurohacker Collective, a movement
dedicated to upgrading our individual and collective capacities and to safeguarding
the well-being of all.
He's an evolutionary philosopher, systems designer, a strategist and I could probably
keep throwing lots of labels around and they'd still kind of apply.
There's a lot of crossover between different fields, which I think is something that we're
going to explore in this episode.
So Daniel, thank you very much for joining us.
Thanks for having me, it's fun to be here.
How do you feel about the labels, in fact, when trying to sum up the things that you're
interested in?
I like talking about things that I'm interested in more than labels of things that I am or
am not.
So when, in general, when people are wanting to ask what my background is, whatever, I
like sharing things that I'm passionate about and I like asking people similarly what they're
interested in.
And yeah, as you said, there's a lot of overlapping interests when you have a deep fascination
with the nature of reality and everything within it.
Yeah, I think it's good to start with the things that you're interested in rather than
making identity statements.
So what do you think, how would you sum up the mission of Neurohacker Collective and
what drives and prompted you to do the things that you do and what the Collective is aiming
to do?
So the Collective is an awesome project and it's one project that I've associated with
and there are other projects I'm associated with that do very different things.
So what its mission is and what moves me are partially overlapping.
The goal of Neurohacker is really at an individual level increasing human well-being and human
capacity and right now it's mostly focused on the physiology side of that but is eventually
interested in the psychology and psychological cognitive development side as well.
But specifically looking at how physiology affects psyche, both states of experience
and motion, well-being and capacities and working to do a better job of how we support
physiologies to predispose happier and more capable and more positively oriented people
is really the interest of it and in terms of what we're doing so far that's exploring
the space of what you could think of as kind of psychoneuropharmacology or psychiatry but
rather than just looking at single molecule solutions, how do we address dopamine through
one synthetic molecule or address serotonin through one synthetic molecule, trying to
look at is there anything even imbalanced with this person's dopamine-ergic system,
do we know and if so where did the imbalance occur and what do we understand about the
regulatory systems that are involved and what would a more comprehensive approach to supporting
those regulatory systems to do better and is dopamine the only thing that was imbalanced
if it was, were there other neurotransmitters involved, were there other nutrient imbalances
involved, were there gut brain access or neuroinflammatory dynamics, so how do we do a better job of
understanding the physiology as a whole as a subset of then not just physiology but the
mind, brain, environment complex but starting even just with physiology, how do we understand
how the different systems interact with each other more complexly, how do they self-regulate,
what leads to increased homeostatic resilience or decreased homeostatic resilience or deviation
from homeostasis and how can we do a better job of both understanding these systems and
supporting these systems to have more resilience and more capacity, so that's the goal of Neurohacker
and if you know if anyone goes to the website and checks it out, what they'll see right
now is some information about that mission writ large but then they'll see one offering
which is, you know, we had a first offering that was kind of how do we do something better
than the smart drugs that people are taking to increase productive capacity but that increase
fairly narrow bandwidth of productive capacity oftentimes at the expense of other meaningful
aspects so maybe we get more focus but certain memory metrics decrease, certain creativity
metrics decrease and maybe things like empathy decrease, anxiety can increase and it's doing
it in a way that creates long-term dependence and down-regulation, can we increase a broader
set of the things that are meaningful for people and do it in a way where because it's
working through and with their endogenous regulatory systems rather than overriding
them if they're on something like this for a while and then get off of it, they don't
have dependence and crash and if anything they have lasting elevation of baseline, those
are our goals and you know we're working on that for a number of other categories not
just in the productivity category but that was the first thing that we were able to get
far enough with to have as an offer. So that's Neurohacker.
Yes and those are kind of the areas where we're going to get into in a later episode
with the personal development but I think if we look at the bigger picture of societies
and where we are across the world it's almost the same problem but talking at the collective
level about how we can optimize what we have and try and raise and change some baselines
away from if there are depleted or dangerous levels. Do you see them as sort of overlapping
goals in that respect, the collective optimization or is it a different sort of perspective?
The human brain, the human physiology, the human psyche and culture and ecology are all
complex systems, self-organizing complex systems and we are not that good at interacting with
and supporting complex systems yet. The whole field of complexity science is still a brand
new field and hasn't really entered that meaningfully into how we approach things like design.
We're quite good at simple systems and we're also pretty good at complicated systems so
when I look at something like the laptop I'm talking to you on, the blueprint for how to
make it from the transistor level all the way up to all the parts fitting the other
software I mean there's a tremendous amount of information, no one person could do it,
it takes a tremendous number of people but there is a blueprint and it doesn't evolve
itself in real time right so it's a static design, it was designed, the computer didn't
design itself, it was designed from outside of itself and it doesn't repair itself as
opposed to when we look at biology and we see systems that organize and emerge in relationship
with their environment but without exogenous design and where they don't have a formal
blueprint, the blueprint itself is changing, the structure of it is changing in every interaction
even if we look at the genome, the genetic expression is changing and you know etc.
So what happens is when we're dealing with a complex system like human physiology and
if there's an acute cause of an issue like an injury we're pretty good at that in medicine
dealing with things like injuries, it doesn't mean we won't get a lot better and exponential
tech will help us get a lot better but when we're dealing with something like cancer or
autoimmune disease or neurodegenerative disease or something that doesn't have an obvious
acute cause it has complex causation and that might mean that there isn't one cause, there's
a number of different causes and they might not be the same for different people so we
might be looking at autoimmune disease where infection was part, some kind of subclinical
infection was part of a destabilization of homeodynamic systems and some kind of toxicity
exposure and maybe some kind of nutrient deficiency combined with some kind of genetic predisposition
all came together to lead to a series of imbalances that eventually we call MS or rheumatoid arthritis
or whatever it is and so not only might it be multifactorial but it might have many steps
of causal transform the infection leading to changed immune cells leading to autoimmune
antibodies etc and that happened over the course of time and you have this delayed time causation
all of this makes it much harder to assess cause and effect and so you need really a
deeper system that isn't just working with one variable at a time and where there's clear
causation but that can do this kind of complex causal assessment in the same way that we are
just starting with functional medicine and systems biology to try and understand the human
physiology more complexly but we have dealt with it pretty much like oh you have a tumor let's cut
it out rather than understand carcinogenesis well cut it out or radiate it out or poison it out
and they we've really dealt with global issues right we've dealt with the environment in very
much the same way the temperatures too high so let's do geoengineering to address decreasing
temperature but that's not addressing the cause of why the temperature is too high at all because
we really don't know how to do that well enough there's too many complex economic and social and
worldview and technological factors so we largely deal with it symptomatically we'll deal with wars
symptomatically without understanding all of the things that lead to patterns of human
experience and behavior that lead to war and so I would say that one of the things I'm really
interested in is understanding that universe is a complex not a complicated system that just like
our computer our civilization most of what we have built as civilization has been complicated
systems complex systems are antifragile inherently like in a in a forest each tree is exactly the way
that it is in relationship with everything else around and it's changing and adapting in real
time it's contextual right and because of all the ratio of aerobic to anaerobic microbes of
certain kinds of plants with others ones that fix nitrogen and take nitrogen you can't get one bug
that's going to devastate everything there's going to be predators for that bug there's not going
to be that much it likes whereas you contrast that to row crops and you can get a bug that can
devastate everything right the row cropping is fragile it is susceptible to collapse in a way
that you know robust complex biospheres aren't and we can think of physiologies you know in a
similar way we can give culture in a similar way well what we have called civilization so far has
been a process of converting complex systems into simple and complicated ones and that doesn't mean
it hasn't done anything good but it has been kind of a entropy generator in that way when you
think of evolution as increasing elegantly ordered complexity that has more synergy leading to new
emergent properties we take a tree than a forest that has an indefinite number of value
metrics right like it's value to pollinators and it's value to stabilizing the topsoil and the
sequestering CO2 and producing oxygen and home for these kinds of animals and just all these things
and and the fish a thousand miles away that have different water because of the way it stabilizes
topsoil and the people that eat the fish generations down down who are going to have different
epigenetic patterns because of it like the tree is in this radically interconnected complex system
so you say how do you even assess its value it's totally non fungible non inter exchangeable with
any like it and you can't even quantify it but if I kill it and turn it into two by fours that two
by fours not really adapting or changing it slowly degrades but otherwise it's a fixed thing I extract
it from its environment it has all I care about is a tensional and compressional strength two
things and I really am going to take that even further and just measure it in dollars and make
it accumulatable or exchangeable when we look at that process I took something that was contextualized
and complex I decontextualized it brought it into a lower degree of complexity and in the process
we're making we're actually making human civilization our whole habitability here fragile and so I'm
very interested in how we can understand universe and nature and reality better how we can understand
complexity and self-organization better so that we can work with the systems that like economics
is just made-up monopoly right like what our governments are made-up systems but ecology isn't
and biology isn't and psychology there are intrinsics to it even though there's plenty of
made-up stuff in there so how do we understand those better so that we can work with them in
ways that support real thriving of the things that are fundamentally meaningful in trying to
understand that and thinking thinking how much expertise needs to go into it it's part I was
thinking back to what you first said about the nature of the body that when say we have a disease
or a disorder of some kind there can be so many interlaced interlocking causal factors yet doctors
are often experts in just one of those so is there potentially an expert problem here that lots of
people are in their particular fields say economics and they only see things through the
economics lens do we need to have more jacks of all trades involved or is this a case of I don't
know re re understanding what you need to be to be an expert yeah so an expert in a complicated
system see one of the things about a complicated system is you can break it apart into parts and
understand the parts and isolation put it back together and you don't have the same kinds of
synergies that you have in complex self-organizing systems so no one has to understand every part
of the computer because we can take it apart and put a new CPU and put a new hard drive in and you
notice that we've treated bodies very much like that like oh this part's worn out let's take it out
put a new one in or you don't really need this part as opposed to like well what happened with
the regulatory systems here and what role did it really play and and a gastroenterologist can't
you know an neurologist an oncologist they can't really understand any of those parts
independent of the other ones because what's happening in the gut via the microbiome via
the gut brain access via the enteric nervous system via so many different kinds of pathways is
affecting what's happening in the nervous system and then all of the top-down mechanisms so there
is I wouldn't I wouldn't say that an expert problem is how I would describe it I would say
there's a problem of hyper-specialization in complex systems where that is just not the
right epistemology and Alfred North Whitehead wrote this great paper some decades ago called
the problem of over-specialization and said notice how we the smarter a kid is the earlier we
start moving them into specialization and we move them further and further into specialization so
that by the time they do their PhD there's a few people in the world that really understand their
dissertation and they have relatively little abstraction across domains lateral thinking
into other spaces etc because they're supposed to be able to do a good job of that specialized
expertise and of course we know there were benefits of specialization but I think then
there were real problems with it instead so when all of our a students are thinking about
tiny tiny parts then who's thinking about the whole and so we are leaving to people who didn't
you know excel that well to think about it or just nobody at all and it is just a complex kind of
system but it's not necessarily the one that we want or that works effectively so I wouldn't say
what we want is jack of all trades that's kind of a false dichotomy I would say people who are
studying complex systems and who are studying systems at all and who are studying deeper level
generalized principles and things like design that are cross applicable so that they can so that
they really have the right epistemology to understand the systems that they're looking at and to work
with them yes I think that's critical and I think it's been critical for a while but
especially in the face of machine learning within narrow intelligence right now already and over
the next little bit narrow intelligence via machine learning will just be better at us better than
us at combinatorics within finite spaces and it really is generalized intelligence that is at the
meaningful place for humans to develop themselves and work yeah and in that case it's it looks
like the education system and the way that we value certain kinds of education is going to need to
change and I've heard you speak passionately and passionately in the past about an issue that we
damp down kids curiosity in the traditional education systems and say no stop looking at that stop
