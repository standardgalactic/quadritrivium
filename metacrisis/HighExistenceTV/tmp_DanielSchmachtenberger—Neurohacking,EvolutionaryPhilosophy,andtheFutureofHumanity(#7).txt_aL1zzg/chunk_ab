playing with that you need to go and learn these specific exercises so I wonder how you think we
can reawaken that kind of curiosity without fear and when I say fear I mean the fear of parents or
older generations because they might want to nurture it in their kids they might want they
understand the necessity for it but if they don't have any answers themselves because they've only
the parents have only got this old-fashioned education how can we overcome this this divide
and find a way to nurture it in children yeah the thing that we call modern western education is
not the only system of education that has ever been explored and it's I don't think it's very hard
to have the educational philosophy argument that it is just not even a very good one for many
definitions of what is a meaningful way to educate a human being but when you look at kind of the
history of how it came about and things like we need you know the movement into an industrial
revolution where we needed people we need a lot of people to get trained to fulfill roles within
the industrial revolution that were pretty fun to build right factory line workers were pretty
fun like any of them could do basically what any of the other ones could do and MBAs are supposed
to be able to do pretty much what the other ones can do and doctors and so how do we society needs
people to fulfill these roles so how do we create both an extrinsic incentive economics to get them
to do it and how do we create an education system to train them up into these roles where then we
identify them with this role and this role is really fun to build anyone else who had that
training give or take a little bit there's gonna be profound meaninglessness in that because the
uniqueness of self is gone their own kind of self-directed process is gone right and again
especially in the place of robotic automation where those jobs are going to be getting automated
and not just physical robotic automation but even the deep deep learning through a lot of the things
that we think of as thinking things but things that are proceduralizable I think that actually makes
possible and necessitates a foundational rethinking of what education should be for and really like
what society what civilization should be for and it is rather if we if we can decouple to where the
jobs don't need the people to do them we can also decouple it where the people don't need the jobs
meaning start to actually change the economic structure because we don't need it to be a source
of extrinsic incentive then we get to say okay now we can actually have a system of interest where
entrance a incentive is deeper to both the economics and the education so what is an education system
where the focus is facilitating each child's unique expression their unique passion interest
curiosities capacities and following it right now you say how can parents how can teachers
participate with that if they weren't facilitated that way and they don't necessarily know the answer
and the kid the kid's gonna ask them questions they don't know answers to if the parents earnest
if they really are earnest about this they can go on a process of co-discovery with their kid
and when the kid says so why is the sky blue and the parent realizes that they don't actually know
they remember something about diffraction but maybe it is reflecting the ocean they don't really
fucking know right then they can be like well let's explore it together yeah and then rather than
push for that exploration to go in the way that they're interested in pay attention to the kids
interest and ask them like find out why they're interested in it and what their what their intuition
about it is what their thought is and help help go through the process of helping them learn how
to learn and facilitating their interest in life and letting their interest in life and their learning
reignite the adults also I think that's that's a key ingredient there that you mentioned I
hadn't thought of which is not only to go and find the answer for the kid but say first of all
what what do you think and why do you wonder that and try and tune into into the nature of that
curiosity but it's the the dynamic that I often see and I even feel it myself as a sort of sense
a little bit of shame and fear if someone asked me a question I feel I ought to know the answer to
and so it's kind of a conversation too about putting aside our own ego and need to appear a
certain way in front of others well there's a there's a few fun things here so let's first
address the part about asking the kid why they're interested so the kid asked why the sky is blue
maybe that was the question they asked in the moment but they're just really curious about why
any color has color and they could just as easily ask why is the leaf green and they really just
want to know what color is right and or they're really asking kind of a question about God and
existential things about like why did the creator make it that way because that's the way they're
thinking about it and today there's a they're thinking about things like why is anything the
way that it is or they're asking a question about why is it that we subjectively experience it as
blue and does that relate to what is objectively true and do we all experience it the same way if
you don't know you're gonna go into answering it the way you think they're asking it and then
you're gonna find them get bored pretty quickly and then you're gonna get frustrated and try and
get them to pay attention and so it's pretty important to actually pay attention to what is the
real inquiry and then not you go find the answer as if the answer already fucking exists they might
be asking questions the answers don't fully exist to and you get to like be in that process of
discovery together where the answer matters less than the investigation the inquiry the thinking
about it and some of the best questions are when they get to things where we don't know the answers
and their intuition about it might be as good as anybody's yeah that's the the hot that I guess
the the stereotype the picture of the from the mouths of babes thing where you start seeing the
world from a new angle just because somebody is asking a question which is unencumbered by years
of cultural conditioning yeah and you know if we're asking about so what's fundamentally real
is consciousness real and this is all arising in my consciousness is is matter fundamentally real
and my consciousness is an epiphenomenal neural networks if we ask a question where we were the
real answer right now is we don't fucking know this is the best thinkers in the world vehemently
disagree on this then it's a place where you get to actually have a dialogue with them really on
equal footing because you actually can't even though you can tell a whole history of Western
philosophy and Eastern philosophy on it you that still just brings you to I just told you a whole
lot of things about why I don't know and so if you can come back to the like fascination and the
interest you and you're in the same place as them and they do have they are touching it for the
first time in different ways how do you think we can get to to tackle the other point that I
mentioned is how do you think we can get to the point where we're not worrying about admitting
our ignorance maybe it's not such a big deal to a child but I think that we in in the West loosely
speaking it's it's seen as largely not okay to admit oh I don't know even though I feel that I
should yeah so I mean you can see what a great tool to control other people that is yes and you
can see how little real freedom you have and how little real ability for peace or intimacy or
honesty with other people you have well that bullshit's running in you now let's step back
and think about it like this for a minute let's think about the field of the knowable and the
field of the unknowable as ontologic categories well let's think of them as epistemological
categories for a minute you explain to our audience what the difference is yeah so ontology is in
philosophy the the inquiry into the study of what is fundamentally real what exists and epistemology
is how do we know like do we think this exists because we're measuring it and all getting the
same thing because we're experiencing it because we're intuiting it because we're doing math like
what is the what is the right process of coming to believe anything that we might believe and so
there's this deep relationship between what we think is real and how we think about anything
and so those are some some of the deep categories in philosophy so let's think about the knowable
stuff and the unknowable stuff now Heisenberg said limit on know ability at the quantum mechanical
level right said the position and the momentum of a quantum particle are not simultaneously knowable
and here's the big deal it wasn't an epistemological limit it wasn't we just can't get enough
information about it was an ontologic limit they don't both exist at the same time at the level
of the quantum it does not actually have a fixed amount of momentum and a fixed amount of position
and has something weirder than that like a probability distribution about how much of those
things it has and so there is a limit to the knowable and then you say okay well how many
quantum particles are there in universe and we're all the interactions between them and how much
unknowable is there from that and it's like okay that's you know that's a profound set
and girdle's incompleteness theorem said set a limit on the knowable when it comes to mathematics
right the foundational axiomatic set of math is infinite well we you can't know infinite shit
the knowable's always finite but the unknowable is infinite so it's important to to get first that
the unknowable is a larger class than the knowable fundamentally and then within the knowable you
have the known and the unknown and the known is i have a reasonable confidence margin through
whatever process that my understanding of this is pretty good and the unknown is this is hypothetically
knowable stuff we just don't know it yet and there's plenty of that within that the unknown
is also a larger class than the known is within the knowable now why why am i specifying this
i'm specifying it because if i think that i should know most things then i actually just
don't know the deepest things about the nature of knowability itself
and so that idea like oh someone asked me something i don't know there's something
wrong with me like to just realize how ridiculous that fucking thought is
yeah and it's oh and to instead say okay well there there is an infinite class of things i don't
know and couldn't know and then there's a bunch of things that i could know that i don't and that's
forever and that is fascinating right that is in in enthralling it's like you get to touch
a sense of awe in that and so i think that reframe of just really getting how vast reality is and how
complex and how deep and and then being able to have a totally different humility in relationship to
it there's an emotional and even spiritual element to this i think that people find i found if you
study something in depth when you go into the subject at first you can make all sorts of strong
and sweeping claims because you don't know enough to know how complicated it is and that's quite
exciting and then the more that you learn you realize uh oh i feel like i have to equivocate
over everything all the time because everything's so complicated i wish i could go back to when i knew
less but then the transformation can happen where you can become comfortable knowing that you don't
know much yeah so this is a this is a fun process right so we will see you go to academic conference
and you'll see the top scientists in a domain almost tripping over themselves to not make
any real statements because um they don't want to say something wrong in front of all the other
people that probably know a shit ton of stuff that they that they don't know that is relevant
where what they're saying might be wrong and then you look at um people who are radically less educated
about a field and you know adamant and passionate about it so now i i basically i shared half of
the story so one half is um this is actually this is a fun story so related to the knowable and the
unknowable and the known and the unknown within the knowable our subjective relationship has to do
with certainty and uncertainty and think think about it like this in the um in the pre-modern world
and most of the kind of religious traditions and maybe not some of the mystical interpretations
of them but at least in in the uh dominant expressions of the religious traditions um certainty
had a pretty high value right have certainty that i know who the right god is and i didn't get the
wrong god and i'm dedicated to that when i'm doing the right things not the wrong things and like and
if i get it wrong like i go i could go to hell instead of going to heaven or i could reincarnate
badly instead of reincarnating well and i'm certain enough that we can burn women as witches and do
crusades and whatever we need to do because we have enough certainty about that rightness right
right now science started to emerge and have a lot more success in in really important things like
aiming cannons um and you know practical physical things which is actually part of what i proliferated
in one um and it acknowledged certain kinds of uncertainties but it also gave us the capacity
for more certainty plenty of questions like do heavy things and light things or dense things
and non-dense things fall at the same speed we were able to start solving some of that stuff right
and earth being rounder flatter and um and so even though within the philosophy of science
the purely uncertainty holding it is very deep a lot of people carried the kind of emotional
orientation towards certainty into the way they did science and wanted to like be pretty sure that
the world started with the universe started with a big bang and you know matter first and biology
and consciousness emerged from neural networks and and this this isn't actually the philosophy of
science it's actually an emotional structure of uh associating certainty with security
and value and associating uncertainty within security fear and lack of value which create
which is an emotional and existential bias leading to a cognitive bias so then postmodernism
saw these flaws and it said shit look at all the things that we fucked up in the name of
over certainty all the things we were certain about what we were wrong later even within the
sciences when we were pretty certain we had it almost all figured out around the time of Maxwell's
equations and modern physics fucked it all up and that's just happened so many times we really
shouldn't ever be certain about anything because historically we've been wrong about all of it
and whenever we were whenever we were over certain we could do really terrible stuff
and so then postmodernism said we should actually embrace uncertainty about everything
and kind of all certainty and of course i'm radically simplifying all of pre-modernism
and then modernity and then postmodernity um but a move towards embrace uncertainty
and any idea any narrative is just one narrative and isn't fundamentally true and we don't know
and so then it kind of pathologized certainty and made uncertainty laudable and i think both
of those are untenable and you know we we can actually see some major problems in the world
from certain interpretations of postmodern that have led to the post fact world that have led to
increased likelihood for strong man leaders to come in in a post fact world and um but
i would say part of maturity is having a mature relationship with certainty and uncertainty
inside of ourselves and it's it's what you could call it epistemic maturity which is
i have a reasonable confidence margin for certainty about these things based on the
appropriate processes that i went through to come to it and i have less confidence margin
about these things and i have no confidence margin about these things but my security and
universe and my self-worth aren't coupled to any of it yeah yeah and that's that's a big point
that people become so emotionally wrapped up in it and as you were talking about that
postmodernism there i thought of someone who we featured on the site quite a bit Jordan Peterson
who has a particular kind of gripe against who he calls postmodernists and yet the people he's
talking about seem to have gone kind of full circle where they've become very certain about
their position where things they're saying well there is no inherent truth in anything and in
particular we'll talk about say cultural relativism or cultural appropriation but they've suddenly
become dogmatic about it which seems to totally contradict the original point if you read Foucault
or Derrida or some of the good postmodern philosophers there was like real insights there
right there were there were key important insights and they were not equally like the critiques were
not about all of the sciences equally if you look at say the way we did social sciences
and all of the bias that affects how we do social science that is going to affect the
way we do chemistry less right not none but less and so you know there are there are important
insights there but when you look at so let you know let's take a fun case let's take the conversation
between Sam Harris and Dan Dennett about free will and consciousness these guys are on the same
team when it comes to you know atheism and the problems of superstitious ideas and
religious metaphysical ideas but then when it comes to foundational ontology
itself they actually disagreed on the deepest things one could disagree on right Sam says
consciousness is real but there's no free will and Dan said no there is free will but consciousness
is not real like those are the deepest and they and they are both philosophers of science
and both have read the same books and both understand critical thinking it's like well
how the fuck could they come to things that are that different and it's you know and Sam actually
said something really important in the end of that dialogue if and if you if you've read it but
it's it was a fun one he said it seems that we just have fundamentally different intuitions
and or something to that effect and that that is actually like in AI there's this thing called
the symbol grounding problem how do we get the symbols to ground into experience right when you
when you when you think of an apple you know things about the way an apple can be tart or sweet
or mealy or its skin can kind of peel off or it can snap or like you have so many interdependent
contextual things and you've taken it in through a tongue and a nose and your fingers and so many
sensory organs plus the abstraction layers of it that the symbol has grounded right the symbol
