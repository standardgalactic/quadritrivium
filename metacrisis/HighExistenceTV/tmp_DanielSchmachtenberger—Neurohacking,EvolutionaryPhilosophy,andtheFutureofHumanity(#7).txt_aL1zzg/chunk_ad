right now we need culture larger and so we'll eventually get nation states and economic
trading blocks but as as we think about this kind of what we've called civilization growing
from tribes into what we what we have now of you know kinds of large conglomerated superpower
dynamics where the ability we've where our ability to compete with each other for extracting scarce
resource from the earth is actually giving us towards the points of making the earth not habitable
across major regions and where then you start getting you know massive refugee human migration
issues that start to collapse grid infrastructure that can't handle it over the next little bit
Syria was already an example of that droughts leading to people moving from subsistence farming
areas into the city leading to resource shortage leading to the war and the escalation that happened
and it was basically a small one um but also even then you know these these groups in war with each
other we don't we can't use our weapons right like China and Russia in the US like we just
can't get into a war with each other so we will try and deal with them as proxy wars or whatever
but we have weapons that are powerful enough that winning would against the other one since the
other one also has powerful enough shit winning would require destroying the whole playing field
for everybody when you get to enough power in a game theoretic situation where winning requires
destroying the playing field so it equals losing even for the winner and when lose game theory becomes
omnilose lose because there's that much power then you either have to get off game theory entirely
and this means in group out group dynamics or you go or you go extinct or very near right you
have a massive step down in in capacity catastrophic or existential risk i think in the next very
little bit very short number of years we either continue competing for the extraction of scarce
resources moving the biosphere towards more uh you know critical fragility um and keep competing
with each other in heads-on fashions that end up and competing for more powerful tech that leads
to exponential tech that is autocatalytic and can run away from us in a number of different ways
and we we we will have then a radical step down in civilization either no civilization or a radical
step down if we continue doing that or we actually figure out what the fuck omni win win on a little
bitty biosphere where we're all in it together means and it means it it means something where
nations are an obsolete idea they might have served evolutionary relevance but they don't
anymore and it means something where private balance sheets that where you want to accumulate
more shit on your balance sheet because it leads to new capacities but scarce stuff that other people
don't have and where nature doesn't have a balance sheet so all of the economic incentive is to
externalize cost to nature take shit out of nature and compete with each other for that shit
served evolutionary relevance but can't go further either so there is some you know a post
win lose game theory a post uh in-group out-group mentality requires a complete shift to economics
complete shift to governance complete shift to culture religion all the way down to a shifted
identity where i'm not even a fucking separate being in my mind
of course i'm an individual and actually even a totally unique non-fungible individual but
i'm an individual that wouldn't exist without the whole rest of it they wouldn't exist without an
atmosphere with oxygen they wouldn't exist in the way that i am without other people doing a
gazillion functions that my life depends on and when i get that we're all these emergent properties
of an interconnected whole and unique emergent properties that are not replaceable at that identity
level we can start getting something that can transcend in-group out-group dynamics
this reminds me of i don't know if you've read a book called finite and infinite games yep by
james course yeah it's a great read for for those who haven't read it there's he outlines a perspective
on essentially everything in human life where we can see it as a game and a finite game there's
winners and losers and a clear outcome and it's it's finite it's not going to be something you
could repeat it you could do multiple times in a series but each outcome is kind of set whereas the
point of an infinite game is to keep playing so like a relationship or we would say the human
species if this is the game we're playing what we want to do is not to have winners and losers
but to be able to enable the game to continue rolling along and yeah it's it's a great foundational
book and i highly recommend it for everyone and it has so many layers of depth and meaning built
in that if you're if you're reading it it's a treatise on economics and governance and spirituality
and human psychology at the same time but that core idea that finite games are meant to be one
and when you win the game's over and infinite games are meant to continue the game of play
it's a it is a so we're looking at a shift from win-lose game theory to omni win-win or a different
concept even of what win means from mostly zero sum to increasingly positive sum from finite to
infinite there's a whole shift but that new thing isn't even anything like what we have called a game
previously yeah and if and if to win is to play then this brings us to a couple of points of ideas
that people have talked about i know you talk about the commons as a key reference point in your work
where things that are common like the common resources or the the things that are common to
everyone like the environment but then we face the problem of say hardly anybody who uses wikipedia
actually contributes to it and how can we change that perspective and then there's another obvious
example which is the idea of a universal basic income which would enable people to keep playing
their lives without feeling that if they they don't do certain things they're simply not going to be
able to play at all and i wonder if you could comment on the the usual objections that come
up against those which tend to be people are selfish and they don't care about others how
can we reconfigure our people's ideas of what the game is that they're playing
yeah so you're asking questions that um to really deconstruct a lot of our ideas around
evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology and what we think of as human nature genetically
and um economic theory and then adequately reconstruct new things would take enough time
that since i'm not gonna get to do it i'm gonna just push push buttons of all of those um i think
that we have got human conditioning that is actually relatively new but that has become
very ubiquitous because it was successful in a win-lose game theoretic structure and it's so
ubiquitous that we've done pretty much all of our social science within that context and so we
stop factoring the context and call it human nature right we've we've done almost all of our
social sciences within capitalism we've done almost all of it within nation states right within
those kinds of structures done it within win-lose game theory in a mostly post industrial definitely
post agrarian world most the history of our species is pre agrarian um definitely pre nation
say and and you know pre agrarian also meant pre capital pre private ownership of surplus
because there was no fucking surplus um and so there's a totally different relationship to those
things so um and then we say okay well the way that we're behaving since it's ubiquitous must
be nature rather than nurture so then let's try and look for the genes that correlate and make
it a genetic answer and this is where i think our our biases lead to bad science um
so i won't go further down there but i will say that most of what we call inalienable human
nature i think is uh our nature expressed through a certain set of conditions and different enough
conditions can can have what is nature expressed differently now i'm gonna come back and say the
whole nature nurture what is fundamentally possible to the human condition it we can ask a
thought experiment about it that's different than we've been able to ask previously because
crisper is is making the conversation of human genetic engineering a real not that far off
possible conversation right it's a big fucking deal because if we say okay well maybe maybe
there is something that is genetic and maybe we can change those genes then it brings up
instantly now we're in deep existentialism around
oh if we can actually change something that we thought of as nature what is fundamentally
desirable outside of what we thought was a fixed context right um should do we want to
then change the genes where everyone is a hyper competitor do we and and they're the most violent
and largest alpha men possible only do we want to make it to our now alphas are irrelevant and
everyone is a super cooperator do we want to make it to where people are happy all the time
and we have done the abolitionist imperative and got rid of the ability to
suffer and feel pain or do we like are there evolutionary and psychological purposes that
stay relevant to like now we're in a very deep existential philosophical place and it's important
that we go there now as soon as we can start to you know ask those questions then we can come back
to okay well here are some things that are meaningful about the human condition what of
them might actually be possible even without the genetic engineering but it does make us start
thinking that the what we have thought of as human nature that was a hard unfixed limit
we can at least think about it more flexibly which i think is a useful thought experiment
but
if you have a if you have a situation where there's a lot of shitty jobs right
like touring roads is just not that fun and you know etc etc so it doesn't mean that
nobody would would never want to go do some touring of a road or different kinds of labor
or different kinds of road tasks but most people wouldn't want to do 50 hours of it a week for 40
years right yeah and yet the society has needed people to do a bunch of that shit
and so when you then see people as the vector for getting societal things done
you have to have an extrinsic motive system to get people to do it so if we all pool our resources
and then make sure everybody has resources we call it communism then then why would anyone
do the shitty jobs well now the state has to force them so we call it imperialism and that's
why we don't like communism um it's i'm radically over simplifying of course but that's like at
the heart of the argument so then we say cool let's let the free market force people because
that's better so when the state's not going to force people but if but they don't get any basic
needs met so if they don't go do one of the shitty jobs they starve now we'll say that they
have the freedom to get better education and hopefully not have to do the shitty jobs but of
course it's not a real argument since a lot of people are going to have to do the shitty jobs
because somebody has to right and those who are born into families where someone else was doing it
have a lot less likelihood to have access to good education and good healthcare and good training
and so in a situation where the default is having nothing you need to get stuff to just survive
bottom of mazlo's hierarchy but now surviving doesn't give me the next levels of mazlo's hierarchy
right like my belonging the more shit that i get the more i'll be able to actually get relationships
and do things with friends that have the resources to do stuff and and my esteem all the way up to
my self actualization the more that i can get shit the more capacity i have to self express and do
and like that every level of mazlo's hierarchy if i want it and we value the scare shit where you
having something then you don't have access to it like a shopping cart you have possession of it
where when you're not using it i still can't use it and so because you possessing some
scarce thing there's not enough of for everybody means that i don't have access we're in fundamental
competition with each other right and if there's something that's abundant enough that uh you
having it doesn't decrease my access at all like air we put no economic value at all on it because
there's no ability to have differential advantage associated with getting some of the scarce thing
and because we put no economic value on the air we'll pollute the shit out of it and burn it up
because it doesn't enter our economics uh calculus that is the basis of our decision making but we'll
work really hard to get the gold or the diamond or whatever it is that we perceive as scarce enough
that if i have it gives me some differential advantage over you but then i'm going to take
that gold or diamond and put it in a safe that is doing nothing for anyone other than a fiat
purpose right and then because it's scarce this is important to get because the values
proportional to the scarcity because we're not looking for systemic advantage we're looking for
differential competitive advantage which is assumed if the thing became unscars it would
have no value like air so as soon as we start finding that diamonds aren't as scarce as we
thought they were we start burning and crushing and hiding them right now we need to artificially
manufacture scarcity um so when you have a system where if you don't get shit you die and if you
don't get more shit you don't get to express very well and anyone else getting shit means you don't
have it and win lose dynamics everywhere like if you if i wanted to condition greed and selfishness
and jealousy in the people the best i could that's how the fuck i would do it this is how you train
people to be that that exactly and if i wanted to train people to be psychopaths right not like
i put them through enough first person childhood trauma or they have the right kind of brain injuries
or genes for formal psychopathy but i want to decrease their empathy pretty radically and their
ability to rationalize harm well i would do things like capitalism and large you know and then the
evolutions of capitalism that happen corporate capitalism where if you aren't willing to participate
in something that's going to have externalities you just don't get a run a big company if you're
running a big company you've got to say yeah shit well those mines are run by slave labor but like
there's just no other mines and if we tried to pay for fair trade we'd be totally out of business so
you got to like crack some eggs to make some omelette so just even being able to participate
with a system that isn't closed loop that doesn't actually value all the metrics that it affects
requires rationalizing harm and having a kind of abstracted psychopathy so you know we have a system
that you can think of as conditioning low-grade ubiquitous psychopathy in everybody and then
we do social science on it we call it human nature yeah and then we can change it then we do that
to rationalize the system again continuing exactly but like you know if i walk by a homeless person
and they have they're in real pain right they might even be bleeding they might be
really dirty they and i just walk by because i'm busy i got shit to do and maybe i give them five
bucks but you know i walk by there is something wrong with me at a human level there is some
way that i was able to turn my empathy off where this this appointment i got to get to that is
trivial as fuck in comparison to this other person's whole life i just i can and i can be fine
just continuing to be worried about my busyness like what the fuck how could i do that well
because there's so many homeless people i can't fix all of them and then that then that rationalizes
none of them right but that's that's systemic that is a system where empathy isn't even viable
in the system and so everybody has to turn it down or go crazy yeah it's also like a personal if
i don't have the language makes sense but it's a personally systemic thing that if you think you
can't help all the people then you won't help one then you never help anybody yeah and so well
you know because it doesn't you say all right i can try and do this like i'll help this one thing
but then if i'm if i care about this one enough to really help them i turn my feeling back on
right and then you're on the danger zone i turn my feeling back on now what about the next one
and the next one and when do i stop but also and when do i decide that actually upgrading
from my last year's Mercedes to this next year's Mercedes is worth more than helping a couple more
of them what were you going to say martin well in this system when you do help that other person
you might depend on the extent you help them but you also start risking your own safety in future
so if you if you really want to help them and you want to give them all the resources
and you already have yourself live in scarcity which a lot of people do like you have to take
care of your own shit first before you can help anyone else but that's the story right that's
that's the story that we tell and then of course now this is a very painful thing to say but most
people then if you look at at the end of their life the amount of shit that they've consumed
and what that did to the environment what it did to however many animals that were involved
how many species went extinct related to those supply chains how many animals and factory farms
and then how many migrant workers how many people in sweatshops etc and you and you look at all of
that and then you compare it to what that person then did once they got ahead well enough to help
other people like there they are on the liability side of nature's balance sheet yes now the answer
is not obvious because the answer doesn't exist within this system the answer is actually needing
to build new systems that don't take complexity and make it simple or complicated right that don't
do win lose game theoretic structures so when when you look at this it is that it's actually
there aren't obvious answers that are good and meaningful about how to like okay how do we
prevent war and have a world full of peace like why the fuck do we still have war it would seem
like world peace is something everybody wants okay well how do you have a for-profit military
industrial complex as the largest block of global economics and understanding the laws
of supply and demand have a world that doesn't have war like how do those two things get lived
together they don't they don't right and so then when we say well we're working on peace are you
working to obsolete having a for-profit military industrial complex because if not you have no
