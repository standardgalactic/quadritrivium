apple has grounded through all of those sensory channels and so if you haven't had some of the
same sensory channels you're not going to get the symbol grounding in the same way so I'm I'm
studying the chemistry of an apple but I haven't tasted it no matter how much fucking chemistry
about an apple I've got and I know what the EEG patterns of people tasting it are I still don't
know what the fucking apple tastes like and so there is a place at which as much as we're trying
to be totally objective and logical what what when we hear it can land as true or not has to connect
to some experience set that lands as true has to it is not a purely those axioms are reasonable
and can be later reified by the process and this this was a good process for deriving other things
from those axioms so I accept it the one of the main sources of our cognitive bias isn't just
the normal logical fallacies everybody you know those are easy to study it's a bunch of emotional
and existential level biases that affect the way we process and that's where the really subtle
work comes in can you give a few examples yeah remember the first time that this hit me so clearly
a very long time ago but I was I was young I was talking to someone about their religious
persuasion they had moved from being a kind of new age hindu to a fundamentalist muslim and
that seemed like a very and they did that well in
california upper class and like that seems like a very interesting step that doesn't make
that much sense to me and so I asked them questions about the theology of islam and if
they really believed these aspects of the theology and and it wasn't getting anywhere like it there
was no place where they were really willing to look at the aspects of the theology that was pretty
sure they probably didn't believe and but in the process of the way I was asking I was actually
damaging my rapport with this person and in damaging rapport I was damaging the ability to
actually have a meaningful conversation about this or any topic right and so I stopped and then I
came back to let me see if I can just create rapport about anything we get rapport fast forward
about a year because it takes that much time to repair the rapport from an issue like this and
I end up finding out that this person comes to islam and their particular beliefs I'm not
saying this would be true for everyone I'm saying that this one case this was a place of realizing
this person's past was that they actually couldn't say no and they couldn't set limits or boundaries
from themselves because of like family sexual trauma that had happened in their childhood
and they got to a place where they were there were some things that happened in their life and
because they couldn't say no to some fairly terrible things that led to their relationship
breaking whatever and they they're like oh wow I'm gonna die basically because I can't set limits
or say no and then right around that time they met a friend who had just joined islam and
they were talking about it and the rules and kind of the absoluteness of the rules and that they
didn't have to hold boundaries themselves they just being someone who believed that got to follow
those rules and at a survival level that told this person oh she could actually survive because she
could adopt a ruleset that now she could say no with that reason it bypassed her childhood
reasons of not being able to say no and so what I realized was it had nothing to do with theology
even though later the theology backfelled itself as a rationalization and so I was addressing it
at totally the wrong level because it wasn't the level at which the decision was made the choice
wasn't made by a deep rational introspection and and study of the theology compared to other
theologies and so then when I talked with them about basically just childhood and their ability
to say no and set boundaries and construct those capacities inside of them rather than try to
deconstruct a belief once they actually felt they had that capacity they ended up deconstructing
the religious belief on their own right their critical thinking couldn't kick in because it was
if their critical thinking kicked in or if they allowed anyone else's critical thinking to kick
in it would hit a survival level fear for them of a belief that was meeting a need
and maybe it's the need to get to still be part of your family because if you leave the religion
you won't be part of the family or you won't be part of the community or or you're too afraid of
death and so you know there's an extent whatever it is or it's it's a situation where if you say
this particular thing inside of academia and inside of the sciences you'll be shunned for
saying something that is so non-standard model that you lose all kinds of opportunity so there's
like all these little subtle and not so subtle sources of bias that affect the process of how
we go about understanding reality it's it's also the same sort of mechanism I think you have when
you make a big change in your life or maybe you leave a place of employment and people become
angry with you because you're changing you're not what they expected anymore because for them
there's they could receive it as an implicit criticism of themselves and their choices
and that's all happening kind of as a subtext and people are getting angry and they maybe
don't know why they're angry yeah yeah so now you come back to the cultural relativism and
you see okay someone might have taken postmodern philosophy and used it as cognitive backfill
to positions that largely came from other places they didn't just come from a
emotionally neutral existential neutral study of the topics and that this was the
very best thinking they could come within the topic it might have been their own trauma or
witnessing a trauma in the world that was so problematic that they took it on or resonated
with it and that's affecting then the way they are you know what they're resonating with intellectually
and how they're processing it do you how do you think we can become more aware of that in ourselves
if we if we start from the point that we're willing to become more aware of it a lot of
these things just sort of well up as emotions and sometimes that's useful and sometimes it's not but
maybe if we take the example of cultural appropriation which is such a hot topic at the moment
how do you see that playing out for people emotionally and how might we be able to
have a more productive self-reflective conversation about it
well one good thing is I want to see if I can take both sides or any side of the topic well
enough that I really get it and if I can't if while I'm trying to take the other side I feel
like I'm mocking at the whole time because it just seems so stupid then there is some bias that
won't actually allow me to see reality through that lens and see if I'm missing anything right
and so then part of earnestness would be can I actually do I know that I'm seeing what they're
seeing or am I I might not be but I actually like notice how many times there's a I want to stay
in with the people who share a belief similar to me or coming to this belief that I had answered
some really critical things that made me feel more okay or like I had my shit together or safer
in universe or smarter and leaving that feel scary you know you notice all those kinds of things
and so I would say the degree to which we can identify with our own earnestness
to learn and explore more than our current position about things that's a much better
identity to the degree we need to have one I think with with the example of cultural appropriation
when I try and think into the mind of someone who thinks that it's pretty much always a bad thing
it goes out sort of two rough pictures of what that can be driven by and one is the more negative
kind of wanting to virtue signal and want to be right on and sort of accrues the sort of certainty
we talked about before that I know that this is the this is wrong to do it's morally wrong and
therefore I'm a good person and the other I think comes from a place of pain that it's hard to want
to identify with that if you feel that you your culture or the the culture of your your parents
and relatives has been taken and abused that's quite a deep hurt and you're coming from a place
where you feel there is no understanding of you it's a deep alienation pain and that's also very
uncomfortable to enter into yeah so I think this is a good process right where you're you're not
making everyone who believes that cultural appropriation is an issue in the same category
you're acknowledging that there might be different epistemologies and different processes that bring
them there which is key and then you're kind of feeling into what those could be and some that
you can really empathize with this is not a topic that I would say I have very deep familiarity
or expertise with but but as I just think into it right now with you there's a bunch of things that
come up right as I think about someone who says cultural appropriation is wrong and why that would be
I can imagine reasons deeper than just even the pain of a culture that has been damaged by another
culture I can imagine very real reasons so let's say we take hey white people shouldn't wear
dreadlocks or they shouldn't wear hindu bindis or they shouldn't you know wear harry christian
harry christian of chicapony tales or whatever whatever it is right well then you say well
what were those things well there's a superficial answer which is they were some aesthetic whatever
right but then you go deeper well it was actually a signaling mechanism of people who had went through
so say say in getting that um that brahman string or getting that mall or getting that
whatever it was they had actually went through specific rituals specific processes practices
worldview where then they could see anyone else who had that and they could know here's a person
that I'm going to have a certain amount of shared experience with and it created a signaling that
was actually relevant not only maybe for survival which it very much might have been in a world
where in group outgroup dynamics have determined most of survival but also their ability for deeper
connection trust coherence and they're like okay that that that actually meant something sacred
and now if someone else is is taking that thing without all that it meant now I actually don't
know my signaling system is broken and I don't know if these are people with shared experience or
not or and so you think about like there might be layers of depth that you're just completely
missing in an argument when you come to a position on it and I'm not saying I think cultural appropriation
is always wrong I'm saying I as I start to imagine in I can think of a lot of things and I would want
to listen a lot and I'd want to see can I be earnest about it or does something come up in me
it starts to get blocked and if it does I want to look at that well I think that's that's a great
attitude is both self-reflective and asking questions but also not seeking to have a certainty
at the at the end of it and what what comes up for me when you're you're describing those
sorts of singles symbol systems and how how we can read those things is is it at the core that we
have as humans trying to understand each other and improve ourselves are we kind of tripping over
a kind of an innate nature which is tribal and wanting certain systems to make sense and apply
to everybody is that something that we can overcome big question to dump on you different
questions let me separate are we tribal and signaling mechanisms in human nature
sure signaling mechanisms were actually part of what helped us go beyond tribalism
because if I'm in a hunter-gathered society pre-agrarian society and we're below done bar
number right typically below 150 people maybe meaningfully below that I actually don't need
signaling mechanisms because I know all the people like I first hand actually know them all I've
lived with them my whole life and I know if it's the people that I know and can trust or other
people that I don't know and so actually don't need symbolism because I don't need an abstraction
layer I'm actually in my instantiated experience right okay and now if we want to get a number of
tribes to be able to come together into villages and then kingdoms and then nation states or you
know religious associations or whatever larger kind of entity that has some coherence then the
question is how do we have coherence with other people that we don't know but that we've chosen
to have coherence for coherence with in a situation where that was survival relevant
and now signaling mechanisms were a major part of how that happened right so now
you know you're a red team we're blue team the fact that you've got a red shirt on even
though I haven't met you like I know that we're that you're playing on my side that's called
the what flag are you flying right and so you notice with regard to cultural appropriation like
there are people who get pretty bent out of shape of someone who isn't a citizen of their country
using their flag in a certain way yeah it's a it's a similar thing right I mean it's a related
topic of wait this is a way that our group was able to maintain some coherence against forces
that were arrayed against it and you know you think about like how would us or or UK military deal
with if someone was fucking up their intelligence system right and the signals that were coming
into their intel like that would be a problem if you see someone like the crime of being
dressed as a police officer if you're not a police officer or being dressed as a military
official is actually a crime because that system of signaling is very meaningful and
and so one thing I would say is like now many of those systems have have interspersed so much
that we then have cultures like the US that doesn't really have a culture right that's the mix of a
whole bunch of different things because it's fairly new and um and and so then of course it makes
sense to allow those cultures to come together and to make new emergent things from one perspective
from another perspective if some of those subgroups feel like they are still needing to maintain some
of their identity for survival or thriving reasons then it's like wait fuck this is a real issue
and oh yeah by the way the US was built on slavery and on a genocide and if that hasn't
even been addressed like there there are there are issues with some of the appropriation that
are on the pain side so uh I I know I went off topic a little bit but I don't think that this
I don't think the signaling I think that's actually an abstraction layer to make larger
cultures cohere that's not tribalism now if by tribalism what you really meant was in group
outgroup behavior I guess I probably did but beyond the Dunbar number um now that's a different
question are humans so are humans capable of moving beyond the Dunbar number obviously right
like being able to have some sense of coherence with abstracted people well that's what what
nations and religions and whatever have been um and they've had they've mostly only been able to do
it through hierarchical systems that where the there was loss of freedom of individuals within
those systems to maintain coherence now um Machiavelli you know his enemy hypothesis said that the
only way to get a group of people to cohere sustainably beyond the Dunbar number is if they
have a shared outside threat that is a bigger threat than their reason to not cohere with each other
um that has been true for the most part right like we've we you can get uh you can have infighting
between Shiite and Shuni until they have the west as a big enough uh you know shared foe that they
can actually unify against that that's been true I think there's a dynamic that's about to happen
that is different than anything that has ever happened and I think so I think this is actually
an important piece of changing social science axioms for a minute um so how do you get the whole
how do you get everyone on this little spaceship biosphere to recognize that they are all inside
of the same spaceship biosphere and now we're affecting things at the level of the whole
fucking biosphere right it's like climate change and biodiversity loss and like all those issues
and if we have catastrophic threats from the way we develop exponential tech like AI or nanotech or
like these are not local issues so they so local governance doesn't make any sense if we're affecting
each other completely like China and India and the US can't can't think about climate change as
countries in a meaningful you know sense without what each other are doing so how do we get that
to happen well either you've got to have some aliens attack so we can all unify against the
common enemy you've got to abstract the enemy and say climate change is the enemy we all need to
unify to keep ourselves from going extinct as a species or ai is the enemy whatever the fuck we
decide or you can actually unify um so the first part is you can unify against an abstract threat
right it does not have to be an agentic threat so something like environmental destruction or
catastrophic risk of any kind could be a unifying imperative it's harder but it's possible but the
next thing is we also can't unify towards shared goals where it is more useful for us to do that
than not and this is a important thing and i think right now we have a situation where if we
continue in group out group dynamics there is no way to not move into catastrophic and even
existential risk zone and so we absolutely do have abstracted enemy hypothesis drivers of our
need to be totally coherent um but we also have you know the the kinds of opportunities that are
most interesting to all of us are only realizable that way why do i say this if we think about it
from a game theoretic perspective those early tribes would cohere with each other as a team to then
if when they needed to compete against other tribes in a win lose game model and they would
compete either for resource extraction of scarce resources or direct head-on competition through
war right through military conflict and if there was enough abundance of resources materials that
it was easier to take shit from nature from the commons and fight each other then they wouldn't
fight if the they're started to be scarcity and fighting each other uh directly or indirectly
became a a necessity or an easier thing to do than that happened and then of course if there's a
larger uh tribe and we can't actually uh fight them competently then we might unify with some
other smaller tribes but then now we're bigger that's going to have them do it now we're at villages
and then they're going to keep unifying and creating better now we need signaling systems
