is not causation the evidence is just as consistent with cancer causing smoking as smoking causing
cancer now on the one hand he's right on the math he's wrong on everything else when you think
about it they never are going to do that randomized controlled study for for smoking and they never
did it so what they did instead to establish causality was look at the weight of the evidence
all of the different observational studies the fact that people tend to start smoking before
they get cancer which is subjective studies in animals which might have been randomized
chemical analysis of cigarette smoke and you put all of that evidence together and you use human
judgment to say yes smoking causes cancer not the other way around it's not justified by objective
probability but it's still the right answer so what have we learned today well you have learned
that statisticians use probability to describe uncertainty and that we don't always agree as
to how that should be done you have learned that it's not just about the basins versus the
frequentist we also have the frequentist versus the frequentist and the basins versus the basins
and a giant statistical scrum uh john tuki once said the collective noun for a group of statisticians
is a quarrel so what i hope that you take away from this is a better foundation for your understanding
of not just basian statistics but all statistics there's really only two pieces up up here that
feed into inferential statistics one is mathematical probability and the second is the application of
mathematical probability to real world problems neither of those is trivial i can't teach you
how to be an expert in that in an hour but it's a lot easier to build an understanding when you
understand what you're building towards so again this gives you i hope a better way to approach
statistical methodology and to approach ways to increase your understanding of statistical methodology
so assuming you're not now just going to take a timeout of two to five years while you just study
probability intensively before you encounter statistics again please don't hesitate to reach out
if you're at the laboratory you can call me you can call the statistical consulting service if
you're outside the laboratory then don't hesitate to contact a statistician at your own institution
or at a university i play up the uh the stroppiness of statisticians in this talk because it's funny
but in my experience statisticians are very friendly very collaborative people who just
like to argue for fun so on that note i hope that you have learned something today that will help
you in your future encounters with statistics and thank you all so much for your time
