Hi, I'm Michelle May. I'm here with Daniel Schmockenberger, who's a researcher and think
tank director with the background in ecology and nutrition. He's joined me here today to
talk about veganism and animal rights. Thank you for joining us, Daniel.
Thank you for having me, Michelle.
I'd like to begin by asking you why you think that we should care about animals and why
our dietary choices are so important.
Why we should care about animals is because we affect them, and it's important to know
how we affect them and to be able to really take responsibility for that.
The key for me is the relationship between sentience and sovereignty. Sentience is the
capacity for something to feel, to suffer, to love, to want, and sovereignty is its freedom
to direct its own life. And I think the essential insight on the topic of rights, whether we're
talking about rights of other races, rights of women, rights of any group that has been
marginalized, rights of other species, is that if something is sentient, it should be acknowledged
as sovereign. If something has the ability to suffer or to experience joy, if it can
feel, it should get to direct its own life according to what would optimize those feelings
for it.
And earlier in human history, we've subjugated other people in ways that we no longer find
okay, through slavery, through patriarchal domination. And when we progressively came
to recognize, hey, women or people with another skin color or kids, they feel as much as we
do and their life matters and they should have the same sovereign rights, it's really
the next extension of that now to all the other animal species. And empathy is really
this progressive process of recognizing that things that are different than us have similarities
with us. At first, if someone had a different skin color than us, we could make them different
enough that we could torture them and think it was okay. And with more awareness and empathy,
we started to recognize there was actually more similarity, there was enough similarity
between us that we could relate to their experience and then it wasn't okay to inflict
an experience on them we wouldn't want. And the truth is, even though animals are very
different than us in many ways, they share hurt and suffering and love and playfulness
and depending upon where in the evolutionary spectrum they are, they share those things
more or less.
But the ability to feel pain is all the way down to the most fundamental animals. And
recognizing that, we need to take responsibility for how we affect them.
If animals eat other animals, do you believe that nature is violent and immoral?
When we look at how we should live as humans that have the ability to choose to live in
very different ways than we lived ancestrally, sometimes we look to nature for models and
it's important to understand which models are relevant and which ones aren't relevant.
And so in the animal kingdom we see predatory cycles, we see predation in some animals eating
plants and some animals eating other animals and we see that's actually part of the balance
of the whole system, right? That the animals that are eating plants actually don't regulate
their own consumption and they don't regulate their own reproduction so they would breed
themselves beyond the caring capacity of their environment and the process of prey checking
them is actually what creates a dynamic balance, right?
And so when many look at that, they say, hey, survival of the fittest is what drives evolution
and it's part of what drives balance and it's a part of nature and that we're part of the
food chain, we're animals, we're part of the biosphere and that we should embrace being
part of that. And there's a couple distinctions that are really key, I think, to note here.
One is, it's kind of a really subtle scientific and philosophic point is that the reason there's
predation in nature, the reason there's a predatory process and it is violent, right?
And any animal that is on the prey side of the equation will acknowledge that really
clearly is because the prey animals can't self-regulate sustainably because they don't
have the cognitive capacities, the neurophysiologic capacities to be able to assess what the caring
capacity of their environment is and then say, hey, we're going to stop reproducing
now, we're going to slow reproduction rates, we're going to slow our consumption rates
to actually live sustainably and so when they start to outbreed their own environmental
capacities and there starts to be a scarcity of resource for the creatures, some of the
creatures start to actually prey on each other because there isn't enough of the base materials
anymore and there's too many of them, they go into competition as a function of that
scarcity, as a function of their inability to modulate their own sustainability and then
those ones have an evolutionary niche where they evolve in the direction of predatory
kind of animals so the predatory process arises out of the unsustainability or the incapacity
of a species to be self-sustaining so that violence is actually necessary for the species
to continue and for the biosphere to continue and so it's not like it's just a good thing,
it's a necessary thing and in nature it is a necessary thing. With humans there's this
fascinating thing that evolution drives more complexity, more complexity to respond and
so we see from reptilian nervous system that's kind of on-off modulated responses that experience
physiologic pain and pleasure in those response capacities to mammalian nervous systems and
their ability for emotion to neocortex primates and dolphins, porpoises, etc. and their capacity
for cognition to then with humans and the prefrontal cortex and the capacity for abstraction
or the first creature that has this abstraction capacity, we can actually assess our environment's
carrying capacity, we don't do a good job of this yet, but we could assess hey how many
of us could really fit here based on the resource per capita needs and then we could modulate
the efficiency of how we consume and actually modulate our own reproduction to stay within
those carrying capacity limits so that we didn't need ongoing violence to check our
numbers. Now this is a capacity we have neurophysiologically because of our prefrontal cortex and uniquely
human capacities, but it's not one we've exercised well yet, we're still breeding irrespective
of the resource limits of the planet and we're still consuming irrespective of the unsustainable
resource limits of the planet and as a result some humans start preying on other humans
in different ways right through all kinds of pathological competition. It's an important
note though that we don't have to do this right and that we're actually at the point
right now where because of our data harvesting capacities and really our ability to assess
planetarily things that we couldn't even a few generations ago because of our technological
capacities that we really are for the first time capable of saying how many people can
the earth support sustainably in harmony with the rest of the biosphere and how do
we consciously self-regulate as a whole species how we relate to the planet sustainably where
there's no long where there's no need for a predation process continuing and what's
so exciting about that to me is that we're the first species that really has the capacity
to end the need for violence and to really step up to that capacity such an exciting
thing. What about eating plants since they're also live organisms? If we're going to kill
a plant to eat or we're going to kill an animal to eat or is it still the fundamental truth
that we have to kill to eat and it's all the same are we still being specious to you know
pick killing plants over animals and I think there's actually some core distinctions here
that are really worth making. There's an evolutionary purpose for pain and that really the ethic
that we're looking at here is cause no harm or cause as little harm as possible to the
point of view of a sentient experience right? Shattering a rock apart if the rock doesn't
feel anything isn't an act of violence even though there was harm from one point of view
but the rock wasn't experiencing as far as we know about rocks wasn't experiencing harm
so when we say cause no harm or cause the least amount of harm possible it's two things
capable of experiencing that harm right and so there's an evolutionary purpose for pain
which is to be able to move away from something harmful to the organism. So in all animals
are sensory nerves nerves that take in information and our motor nerves our nerves that can then
respond to that information are intimately tied and they actually co-evolve going up
the evolutionary ladder and so notice that whenever there's a pain response it will always
trigger a motor response of one of two kinds so either you touch something hot or sharp
and you move away from it or you have a sprained ankle and you make sure not to step on it
or not move into it but the purpose of that pain is to protect the organism because of
some response capacity and that response capacity involves our movement capacity right? So this
is a place where plants and animals fundamentally differ plants don't have real-time movement
capacity right? A sunflower can track the sun over the course of a day very slowly but they
don't have the ability to move away from something harmful or to stop moving in some
way that's harmful to them and so there's no evolutionary purpose for pain for them and
it's important to understand that the process of experiencing pain it's physiologically
mediated and it requires a lot of energy so in us the pain process is mediated through
acetylcholine processing synaptic gaps producing an opiate response you know an adrenal and
sympathetic responses there's a lot of energy required to experience pain and that was only
selected for because it was advantageous that the creatures who experienced it moved away
from harm better or didn't move into harm better so they actually got through reproduce
better and natural selection selected for their ability to feel pain right? If a tree
or a plant the key to how they can gather energy from sunlight and none of the other
animals can has to do with their ability to be rooted and be able to gather a huge amount
of nutrition from the soil and to be able to support this huge base of foliage that can
do all of this photoreception right? And so because of that they give up the ability for
movement and with it there really is no evolutionary purpose for pain wouldn't have been selected
for that's the first thing. The second thing is that when we look in other animals we see
in their nervous system opiate receptors on their neurons which have to do with the chemistry
of modulating the pain process and we see that on every animal all the way down to hinge
valve creatures like clams and they all have the same kinds of opiate structures that you
know indicate the same kinds of pain processes because they have an ability to respond and
the clam is kind of the most simple one which is they can close up if there's something
potentially harmful that means they have to experience harm right? Experience something
subjectively and they can open in response to positive stimuli or at least a lack of
negative stimuli. In the plant kingdom we don't see anything like an opiate kind of chemistry
and we don't see anything response wise like that. Now the book The Secret Life of Plants
and you know a number of books and studies that have been done that show that plants
do show some kind of electrical response to being cut or to other plants being cut or
burned in their presence doesn't mean plants have no response capacity but their response
capacity is very very limited relative to animals response capacity and so the main
kind of thing is if a plant is being cut it can't stop that from happening, cannot move
away from it, can't pull into its turtle shell, can't close its clamshell, can't what it can
do is it can add resins to the sap in that area to be able to stop the loss of sap right?
And so when we see the electrical responses galvanic responses in plants we see that they're
responding and we can anthropomorphize that and call it plant screaming but we don't really see
any basis to suspect that the plant is having a subjective experience of pain. Does this mean
that plants have no subjective experience at all? No qualia? This is actually at the edge of our
scientific knowledge we don't know. Most neuroscientists say no plants don't have any
experience. Some people have reason to think that they do have experience but we don't have any
reason to think that there's an evolutionary relevance for them or any indication of an actual
pain or kind of suffering process because they couldn't respond to it and they don't show those
signs. So that's a major distinction right in the process of saying hey if I'm taking a plant
life here it's still alive but am I inducing suffering and all the indications we have indicate
no and even if so in a radically different way right? The other thing that's worth noting is that
even if there was some pain or suffering that the plant experienced when we are eating animals
the animals had to eat plants and they there's some entropy there's some energy loss in that
process so it's going to take many pounds of plant vegetation to produce a pound of animal
vegetation that then the person could eat and so by supporting the supply and demand chain of
eating that animal you're causing the harm to the animal plus that towards however many other
plants so that there's really kind of no water held in that argument. We all know that factory
farms are terrible but what about eating animals that come from free-range farms or from hunting?
You know if all we succeeded at was stopping the factory farms I would be so happy because an animal
that is living in a natural environment and really getting to experience its sovereignty and its
direction of its life and then gets killed hopefully quickly it's a radically different
experience than an animal that is really enslaved and enslaved in poor to terrible to
atrocious conditions for its whole life and then killed in very often a very brutal way and so
if we only made that shift that would be so humongous right? So much of the atrocity would be
addressed then the question comes is that the only shift worth making you know is that all the
shift and for me as much respect as I have for say the Native American kind of ethic I also
noticed that in areas where there was more pre-agriculture in areas where there was more
natural edible plant life there was less animal consumption and in areas where there was less
natural edible plant life there was more animal consumption because that's what the people had
to do to adapt and live there right? We totally understand. Post-agriculture where we have the
ability to grow everything we need plant-wise then if that produces less suffering then you know
less harm than killing more sentient creatures then is there really a justification for continuing
the animal thing and for me there isn't and we talk about the idea of humane slaughter and it
really is an oxymoron and all you have to do to recognize that is ask would you be okay being on
the other side of it and in morality there's a famous test called the pie slice theorem and
we're asking it something is something really ethical something fair and it's like okay well you
slice the pie you know you pick what the two sides are and I get a pick which one I want or I slice
and you pick but that way we avoid bias so we got to just ask are we setting up a dynamic for how
we tend to animals where we'd be okay being in their position and if the answer is no I I wouldn't
want a life where I was taken care of pretty well and then murdered quickly then the answer is they
wouldn't want that either and if it was necessary then we'd have to look at justifying it but if
it's not necessary there's really no justification for it and that really is a key to get is that no
animal has ever voluntarily put their head on a chopping block and if they knew that that was
coming would do everything in their power to get away from it and just because we have the
power to take their life away do we have the right and if we need to you know if there's a
situation where we are in a survival situation we have no other resources and we're going to die
or they're going to die it's a totally different story right and if someone really didn't know how
to be healthy otherwise it's a different story but if it's simply a preference for us but it's
the whole possibility for life for them then I don't think we can ethically justify that
and I think that's something that you find consistent through all forms of life
from the most complex to the most basic is that every animal wants to live
at the end of the day there isn't any animal that doesn't want to have life and to experience life
well it's it's the fundamental impulse of life of biology is to continue right and to propagate
and um and when we think about our desires everything we want and everything we don't want
it's all contingent upon life right and without that everything else is gone so their desire
to mother their children and to be social and to uh experience anything that they might want to
experience is on the foundation of their ability to live and so to take that away for just I like
the way it tastes right or something that is so surface in our hierarchy of needs and it's at the
core of their hierarchy of needs means that we have to make their life so unimportant in our eyes
that their whole right to life is worth less than something relatively trivial to us
and if we're willing to take another feeling life form and make their whole experience that
