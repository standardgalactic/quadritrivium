Hi, I'm Michelle May. I'm here with Daniel Schmockenberger, who's a researcher and think
tank director with the background in ecology and nutrition. He's joined me here today to
talk about veganism and animal rights. Thank you for joining us, Daniel.
Thank you for having me, Michelle.
I'd like to begin by asking you why you think that we should care about animals and why
our dietary choices are so important.
Why we should care about animals is because we affect them, and it's important to know
how we affect them and to be able to really take responsibility for that.
The key for me is the relationship between sentience and sovereignty. Sentience is the
capacity for something to feel, to suffer, to love, to want, and sovereignty is its freedom
to direct its own life. And I think the essential insight on the topic of rights, whether we're
talking about rights of other races, rights of women, rights of any group that has been
marginalized, rights of other species, is that if something is sentient, it should be acknowledged
as sovereign. If something has the ability to suffer or to experience joy, if it can
feel, it should get to direct its own life according to what would optimize those feelings
for it.
And earlier in human history, we've subjugated other people in ways that we no longer find
okay, through slavery, through patriarchal domination. And when we progressively came
to recognize, hey, women or people with another skin color or kids, they feel as much as we
do and their life matters and they should have the same sovereign rights, it's really
the next extension of that now to all the other animal species. And empathy is really
this progressive process of recognizing that things that are different than us have similarities
with us. At first, if someone had a different skin color than us, we could make them different
enough that we could torture them and think it was okay. And with more awareness and empathy,
we started to recognize there was actually more similarity, there was enough similarity
between us that we could relate to their experience and then it wasn't okay to inflict
an experience on them we wouldn't want. And the truth is, even though animals are very
different than us in many ways, they share hurt and suffering and love and playfulness
and depending upon where in the evolutionary spectrum they are, they share those things
more or less.
But the ability to feel pain is all the way down to the most fundamental animals. And
recognizing that, we need to take responsibility for how we affect them.
If animals eat other animals, do you believe that nature is violent and immoral?
When we look at how we should live as humans that have the ability to choose to live in
very different ways than we lived ancestrally, sometimes we look to nature for models and
it's important to understand which models are relevant and which ones aren't relevant.
And so in the animal kingdom we see predatory cycles, we see predation in some animals eating
plants and some animals eating other animals and we see that's actually part of the balance
of the whole system, right? That the animals that are eating plants actually don't regulate
their own consumption and they don't regulate their own reproduction so they would breed
themselves beyond the caring capacity of their environment and the process of prey checking
them is actually what creates a dynamic balance, right?
And so when many look at that, they say, hey, survival of the fittest is what drives evolution
and it's part of what drives balance and it's a part of nature and that we're part of the
food chain, we're animals, we're part of the biosphere and that we should embrace being
part of that. And there's a couple distinctions that are really key, I think, to note here.
One is, it's kind of a really subtle scientific and philosophic point is that the reason there's
predation in nature, the reason there's a predatory process and it is violent, right?
And any animal that is on the prey side of the equation will acknowledge that really
clearly is because the prey animals can't self-regulate sustainably because they don't
have the cognitive capacities, the neurophysiologic capacities to be able to assess what the caring
capacity of their environment is and then say, hey, we're going to stop reproducing
now, we're going to slow reproduction rates, we're going to slow our consumption rates
to actually live sustainably and so when they start to outbreed their own environmental
capacities and there starts to be a scarcity of resource for the creatures, some of the
creatures start to actually prey on each other because there isn't enough of the base materials
anymore and there's too many of them, they go into competition as a function of that
scarcity, as a function of their inability to modulate their own sustainability and then
those ones have an evolutionary niche where they evolve in the direction of predatory
kind of animals so the predatory process arises out of the unsustainability or the incapacity
of a species to be self-sustaining so that violence is actually necessary for the species
to continue and for the biosphere to continue and so it's not like it's just a good thing,
it's a necessary thing and in nature it is a necessary thing. With humans there's this
fascinating thing that evolution drives more complexity, more complexity to respond and
so we see from reptilian nervous system that's kind of on-off modulated responses that experience
physiologic pain and pleasure in those response capacities to mammalian nervous systems and
their ability for emotion to neocortex primates and dolphins, porpoises, etc. and their capacity
for cognition to then with humans and the prefrontal cortex and the capacity for abstraction
or the first creature that has this abstraction capacity, we can actually assess our environment's
carrying capacity, we don't do a good job of this yet, but we could assess hey how many
of us could really fit here based on the resource per capita needs and then we could modulate
the efficiency of how we consume and actually modulate our own reproduction to stay within
those carrying capacity limits so that we didn't need ongoing violence to check our
numbers. Now this is a capacity we have neurophysiologically because of our prefrontal cortex and uniquely
human capacities, but it's not one we've exercised well yet, we're still breeding irrespective
of the resource limits of the planet and we're still consuming irrespective of the unsustainable
resource limits of the planet and as a result some humans start preying on other humans
in different ways right through all kinds of pathological competition. It's an important
note though that we don't have to do this right and that we're actually at the point
right now where because of our data harvesting capacities and really our ability to assess
planetarily things that we couldn't even a few generations ago because of our technological
capacities that we really are for the first time capable of saying how many people can
the earth support sustainably in harmony with the rest of the biosphere and how do
we consciously self-regulate as a whole species how we relate to the planet sustainably where
there's no long where there's no need for a predation process continuing and what's
so exciting about that to me is that we're the first species that really has the capacity
to end the need for violence and to really step up to that capacity such an exciting
thing. What about eating plants since they're also live organisms? If we're going to kill
a plant to eat or we're going to kill an animal to eat or is it still the fundamental truth
that we have to kill to eat and it's all the same are we still being specious to you know
pick killing plants over animals and I think there's actually some core distinctions here
that are really worth making. There's an evolutionary purpose for pain and that really the ethic
that we're looking at here is cause no harm or cause as little harm as possible to the
point of view of a sentient experience right? Shattering a rock apart if the rock doesn't
feel anything isn't an act of violence even though there was harm from one point of view
but the rock wasn't experiencing as far as we know about rocks wasn't experiencing harm
so when we say cause no harm or cause the least amount of harm possible it's two things
capable of experiencing that harm right and so there's an evolutionary purpose for pain
which is to be able to move away from something harmful to the organism. So in all animals
are sensory nerves nerves that take in information and our motor nerves our nerves that can then
respond to that information are intimately tied and they actually co-evolve going up
the evolutionary ladder and so notice that whenever there's a pain response it will always
trigger a motor response of one of two kinds so either you touch something hot or sharp
and you move away from it or you have a sprained ankle and you make sure not to step on it
or not move into it but the purpose of that pain is to protect the organism because of
some response capacity and that response capacity involves our movement capacity right? So this
is a place where plants and animals fundamentally differ plants don't have real-time movement
capacity right? A sunflower can track the sun over the course of a day very slowly but they
don't have the ability to move away from something harmful or to stop moving in some
way that's harmful to them and so there's no evolutionary purpose for pain for them and
it's important to understand that the process of experiencing pain it's physiologically
mediated and it requires a lot of energy so in us the pain process is mediated through
acetylcholine processing synaptic gaps producing an opiate response you know an adrenal and
sympathetic responses there's a lot of energy required to experience pain and that was only
selected for because it was advantageous that the creatures who experienced it moved away
from harm better or didn't move into harm better so they actually got through reproduce
better and natural selection selected for their ability to feel pain right? If a tree
or a plant the key to how they can gather energy from sunlight and none of the other
animals can has to do with their ability to be rooted and be able to gather a huge amount
of nutrition from the soil and to be able to support this huge base of foliage that can
do all of this photoreception right? And so because of that they give up the ability for
movement and with it there really is no evolutionary purpose for pain wouldn't have been selected
for that's the first thing. The second thing is that when we look in other animals we see
in their nervous system opiate receptors on their neurons which have to do with the chemistry
of modulating the pain process and we see that on every animal all the way down to hinge
valve creatures like clams and they all have the same kinds of opiate structures that you
know indicate the same kinds of pain processes because they have an ability to respond and
the clam is kind of the most simple one which is they can close up if there's something
potentially harmful that means they have to experience harm right? Experience something
subjectively and they can open in response to positive stimuli or at least a lack of
negative stimuli. In the plant kingdom we don't see anything like an opiate kind of chemistry
and we don't see anything response wise like that. Now the book The Secret Life of Plants
and you know a number of books and studies that have been done that show that plants
do show some kind of electrical response to being cut or to other plants being cut or
burned in their presence doesn't mean plants have no response capacity but their response
capacity is very very limited relative to animals response capacity and so the main
kind of thing is if a plant is being cut it can't stop that from happening, cannot move
away from it, can't pull into its turtle shell, can't close its clamshell, can't what it can
do is it can add resins to the sap in that area to be able to stop the loss of sap right?
And so when we see the electrical responses galvanic responses in plants we see that they're
responding and we can anthropomorphize that and call it plant screaming but we don't really see
any basis to suspect that the plant is having a subjective experience of pain. Does this mean
that plants have no subjective experience at all? No qualia? This is actually at the edge of our
scientific knowledge we don't know. Most neuroscientists say no plants don't have any
experience. Some people have reason to think that they do have experience but we don't have any
reason to think that there's an evolutionary relevance for them or any indication of an actual
pain or kind of suffering process because they couldn't respond to it and they don't show those
signs. So that's a major distinction right in the process of saying hey if I'm taking a plant
life here it's still alive but am I inducing suffering and all the indications we have indicate
no and even if so in a radically different way right? The other thing that's worth noting is that
even if there was some pain or suffering that the plant experienced when we are eating animals
the animals had to eat plants and they there's some entropy there's some energy loss in that
process so it's going to take many pounds of plant vegetation to produce a pound of animal
vegetation that then the person could eat and so by supporting the supply and demand chain of
eating that animal you're causing the harm to the animal plus that towards however many other
plants so that there's really kind of no water held in that argument. We all know that factory
farms are terrible but what about eating animals that come from free-range farms or from hunting?
You know if all we succeeded at was stopping the factory farms I would be so happy because an animal
that is living in a natural environment and really getting to experience its sovereignty and its
direction of its life and then gets killed hopefully quickly it's a radically different
experience than an animal that is really enslaved and enslaved in poor to terrible to
atrocious conditions for its whole life and then killed in very often a very brutal way and so
if we only made that shift that would be so humongous right? So much of the atrocity would be
addressed then the question comes is that the only shift worth making you know is that all the
shift and for me as much respect as I have for say the Native American kind of ethic I also
noticed that in areas where there was more pre-agriculture in areas where there was more
natural edible plant life there was less animal consumption and in areas where there was less
natural edible plant life there was more animal consumption because that's what the people had
to do to adapt and live there right? We totally understand. Post-agriculture where we have the
ability to grow everything we need plant-wise then if that produces less suffering then you know
less harm than killing more sentient creatures then is there really a justification for continuing
the animal thing and for me there isn't and we talk about the idea of humane slaughter and it
really is an oxymoron and all you have to do to recognize that is ask would you be okay being on
the other side of it and in morality there's a famous test called the pie slice theorem and
we're asking it something is something really ethical something fair and it's like okay well you
slice the pie you know you pick what the two sides are and I get a pick which one I want or I slice
and you pick but that way we avoid bias so we got to just ask are we setting up a dynamic for how
we tend to animals where we'd be okay being in their position and if the answer is no I I wouldn't
want a life where I was taken care of pretty well and then murdered quickly then the answer is they
wouldn't want that either and if it was necessary then we'd have to look at justifying it but if
it's not necessary there's really no justification for it and that really is a key to get is that no
animal has ever voluntarily put their head on a chopping block and if they knew that that was
coming would do everything in their power to get away from it and just because we have the
power to take their life away do we have the right and if we need to you know if there's a
situation where we are in a survival situation we have no other resources and we're going to die
or they're going to die it's a totally different story right and if someone really didn't know how
to be healthy otherwise it's a different story but if it's simply a preference for us but it's
the whole possibility for life for them then I don't think we can ethically justify that
and I think that's something that you find consistent through all forms of life
from the most complex to the most basic is that every animal wants to live
at the end of the day there isn't any animal that doesn't want to have life and to experience life
well it's it's the fundamental impulse of life of biology is to continue right and to propagate
and um and when we think about our desires everything we want and everything we don't want
it's all contingent upon life right and without that everything else is gone so their desire
to mother their children and to be social and to uh experience anything that they might want to
experience is on the foundation of their ability to live and so to take that away for just I like
the way it tastes right or something that is so surface in our hierarchy of needs and it's at the
core of their hierarchy of needs means that we have to make their life so unimportant in our eyes
that their whole right to life is worth less than something relatively trivial to us
and if we're willing to take another feeling life form and make their whole experience that
trivial then there's a bleed over effect where we start doing that with other people right we
start doing that with anything else we start thinking of the rest of life as a commodity for us
rather than other sovereign life forms with their own right to life we're not thinking about
what is it what does it want what does it feel what does its right to life how can I support
it having a full life experience in this universe it's what is in it for me and even if it requires
harming it or hurting it how can I get what I want out of it when we start thinking that way
in any area it leads to a way of thinking that bleeds over to commoditizing all life
and we can see that being like an underlying way of being for all of the problems in the world right
now what about dairy and eggs and other animal products you know I grew up on a heavy meat diet
and loved animals and didn't recognize those were incongruent and then I saw a slaughter truck
and I saw animals in the most terrible conditions and it was really horrifying for me um I was nine
I asked my parents about it and they said that's where hamburgers came from and that was the beginning
of my animal rights journey and the last time I ate meat um and I found uh John Robbins book
diet for new america and got into it and got into pita's work and uh but I still ate dairy and eggs
for some years wasn't us 15 that I became vegan because in my mind it was like well I'm not hurting
the animal right and but not right um there's a couple things that are important to note here
on the dairy topic first if we look at factory farms all animals in factory farms whether we're
consuming their body or byproducts from their body are seen as a commodity where we're trying to
maximize the output of the sellable commodity for the least amount of money in which means the
least amount of care space etc and there's just really grotesque cruelty throughout the whole
process if you want to have a look at what dairy cows lives are like uh the hormones that they're
pumped full of to produce extra milk the way their babies are taken from them early I mean on and on
have a youtube videos on what the life of industrial dairy looks like uh it's nothing like the small
farms that people imagine but then let's even go to that small farm model right here's the
fundamental challenge with dairy even if it's done as well as it can be done is in order for a
cow to be producing milk it has to have a baby and the milk is intended for the baby if the baby
gets to drink the milk then we aren't getting the commodity from it that we can sell and yet we still
have to um pay for the feed to support that cow and so we take the cows or the goat or whatever
it is away from the mom either at the very beginning or prematurely and they get raised on formula so
that we can get the milk and that's all of all of the developmental problems for the baby cow all
the emotional issues you know that would develop between the two of them um that's a fundamental
unavoidable kind of ethics issue right there and then the second thing is that half of those
babies are going to be male cows and that means that even if this is a dairy where the female
cows could grow up and become part of this dairy the male cows can't be part of this dairy and
again there's a cost to support their life and that cost can't be justified if there's no return on
investment there so they all get sold to slaughter whether they're slaughtered there slaughtered
somewhere else so there really is no dairy without slaughter right the fact that the milk requires
babies and that the babies you know half are going to be male guarantees slaughter in the process
in the modern industrial version most of that looks like veal and some of the most terrible
kinds of uh animal cruelty but even in the kindest versions of it slaughter is intimately tied with
it um and so i don't see any way to do dairy that doesn't support things that uh again have that same
fundamental ethic of you have to make their life matter so much less or something relatively trivial
for us when we look at eggs again commercial egg farming uh is as atrocious as every other
form of commercial animal husbandry um but let's imagine that we're talking about a local little
farm and first i i do want to state that if something says farm fresh eggs or cage free eggs that
doesn't mean that it's not industrial farming you can have cage free meaning they're not in battery
cages but they're still packed into the tiniest environment you know etc so um if you're thinking
that you're doing eggs that come from a healthy little farm you've really got to double check
what the sourcing on that is if someone is in the graduation process of eating less animal
products they're kind of having a wake up on that and yet they don't feel totally ready for
whatever reason just nutritional or otherwise to be a hundred percent vegan yet eggs are the thing
that i would uh i would be happiest with them to eat you know as a transitional food eggs from a
local small sustainable kind of farm and here's kind of the whole breakdown with regard to that
if chickens or whatever animal you're uh getting eggs from but most commonly chickens if they're
allowed to have a natural life where we're not constraining it too much then they're going to
be mating and those are all going to be fertilized and they're going to want to protect those eggs
just not get away from them you're going to be taking animals that that you know would otherwise
taking eggs that would become animals otherwise and so there's the the ethic kill thing in that
um and that's you know that's a an ethical problem on the same kind of order as the previous ones
if you keep the rooster away from the chickens then it's unfertilized eggs and there's not a huge
kind of ethical harm to it intrinsically but i'll tell you where kind of the boundary issues are here
we have to constrain that animal's life where we don't ever give it the opportunity to mate
or to interact in what would really be a natural way for it and even if we're doing that in what
looks like a pretty kind environment we still ask that that what i trade places with them kind of
thing if if you were kept in an environment that where you were fed and you're well taken care of
but you were never allowed around the opposite gender or allowed to mate like you wouldn't consider
that a good deal it would be a better deal than a torturous one and so anytime we relate with animals
where we are modifying what their nature is to make them fulfill a purpose for us there's ethical
questions that come up and honestly these even extend into how we relate to what we call pets
horses dogs cats when you start to get into issues like hey if they keep breeding and we're
killing in shelters this is a real problem but neutering would you want to be in a position
where that had to happen and these are really the boundaries on questions right these are
well hey is that animal getting some enhancement in its life experience because of us or because
it's been so domesticated and hybridized that it couldn't live in nature anymore is this now
just something we have to deal with and i'm going to say these are things to just feel into but the
bottom line here is that if you commodify an animal where the animal or its byproducts becomes a
commodity for us then you are going to constrain the way that it lives alter it in ways that it
doesn't like that you wouldn't like to trade places with and there are going to be some ethical
considerations around that so you know this is why i choose veganism i don't eat eggs if i was
going to eat some animal product it would be eggs and i'd be really cautious about where they came
from and i think one point on this that's worth noting is that when someone says you know what
for me the ethics of eating an egg from a small farm like i can live with that it's important to
then hold from a small farm and not just say oh i eat eggs because there's one way of doing it
that's okay so that means when i'm out in a restaurant i will even though in a restaurant
it's coming from uh you know a battery cage um or even if you say you know what i could hunt
i'm okay with that but i'm really not okay with factory farms and really own what that means when
you go to a restaurant or a friend's house right and what your supply and demand means and that
to where if you're going to draw lines that aren't all the way at veganism make sure you really hold
to your own ethical lines what about eating honey i think that honey is an animal byproduct that's
the easiest for people that don't eat animal products for ethical reasons to still continue to
eat because of all the issues with these um in terms of calm colony collapse and their inability
to survive currently with gmo's and pesticides why is it still important for people to consider
how and when they eat honey um you know i think with honey there's a few reasons why some people
might think of it differently one is the more different another creature is than us the harder
it is for us to extend our empathy because the harder it is for us to recognize that it might
experience anything like we experience and so empathy is a process of progressive widening
to be able to recognize our interconnectedness and our sameness with more things right so extending
all the way down to insects um insects don't necessarily elicit the same emotional responses
in most people that mammals do um but it also doesn't mean that their life doesn't matter
and obviously we know that for the pollinators our life depends on their life continuing in
terms of maintaining the ecosystem and plant life um with regard to honey
the way that we relate to the bees and the way that we relate to their hive and the way that we
gather the honey is what really determines the ethics of it in my eyes um because i don't have
an ethic around not interacting with animal products i mean if if an animal died of natural causes
and if someone wanted to eat it i have no ethical issue whether it's a good idea or good for them
or not no suffering was caused for doing that i have an ethic around causing unnecessary harm
right and so in the process of uh creating honey very oftentimes there's the animal the the bees
are commodified in a way where the colony is damaged bees are killed there's no real respect
for their life process and that's through how the antibiotics are pumped into them it's through
um the process of smoking them out to get them to move from one hive together the honey
but there are beekeeping practices that recognize that bees are surplus creators they're one of the
few things in nature that create surplus and that even if they have more honey than they're
going to use for a long time they just keep doing it that's what they do and that we can
take from that surplus without really bothering their life without harming them if that's the
beekeeping practice i have no problem with it and if that's really supports people to support bees
it happens to be that those practices also go along with what will help bees resist colony
collapse disorder much of the colony collapse disorder has to do with very hybridized species
of bees that have less robust immune systems because we've hybridized them for being able
to pollinate very productively specific kinds of plants and like that obviously it has most to do
with the neonicotinoid pesticides and other factors that have affected them so the organic
farming of bees that both keeps them off of pesticide crops that has a diverse variety of
bee species or less hybridized bee species and that harvests the honey in a more considerate way
to them i don't have an ethics issue with and i actually think is a good example of human animal
symbiosis where we get to mutually benefit each other but again if a human is going to choose to
consume honey they they need to stand the line and be certain that they're only eating honey that
comes from bees that that were treated fairly and that's usually going to say raw it's going to say
organic and typically if you can find locally produced honey uh you you've got a lot of nutritional
benefits that come in terms of pollen inoculation and like that for many people with locally produced
honeys but if you can even go check out how they do it um that's a great thing yeah definitely what
should someone do if they're struggling to stay healthy on a vegan diet there are people that
have an easier time being healthy with animal products than without them there are a lot of
people for whom that's the opposite where uh as soon as they become vegan they start feeling a lot
healthier and issues clear up and uh they lose weight and their athletics become better great
but for some people that have a harder time with it it's my belief that almost all of them
can learn how to be vegan just as healthfully um but for but for some people getting a variety of
amino acids is a little bit more of a challenge because they actually have to source them intelligently
because when you when you're eating an animal the animal eats whatever a varied diet is and
creates a complete protein in its muscle and when you eat that complete protein it breaks back down
into all the amino essential amino acids but if we're just eating you know beans legumes the plant
sources they're that are mostly not complete proteins themselves we have to make sure we
have some variety of those and if someone isn't paying attention to do that they can start to
get an amino acid imbalance so for the most part i would say learn more and uh having a complete
amino acid profile is one of the major things um that matters for people also long chain uh fatty
acid specifically long chain omega 3 and your uh flax oil and other seed oils you're going to be
getting a form of omega 3 called ala which is a shorter chain the longer chain epa and dha come
in meats because the animal but animal synthesizes it and an egg yolk um you can get those longer
chains in algaes and in alga oils you can supplement with that but your body can also convert it but
it converts it if your blood sugar is balanced if your blood sugar isn't balanced you have high resting
insulin it's harder to convert it and for so many people that are eating a higher starch
carbohydrate sugar diet then it's harder to convert those things um and then for other people hem iron
is one of uh those other challenges and again there are uh vegan and vegetarian sources of iron
that do convert well and the b vitamins that are essential cofactors for the conversion of it um
and so basically i would say study and learn about it and almost everyone that i have ever
interfaced with that was having a challenge with it actually to be honest everyone that i have ever
worked with who had it who wanted to be vegetarian or wanted to be vegan for spiritual
ethical moral reasons and was having a challenge with their health and they felt better when they
ate some meat than not when we figured out what was going on what nutrients they were missing
and we figured out how to plant source those they were all able to plant source them effectively
but to acknowledge the possibility that someone doesn't yet know how to do that or maybe their
body just can't and i just want to be open to that possibility then i'm not going to begrudge that
person for eating an animal product because if our goal is to minimize suffering that means to the
person also and if they don't know how to not suffer and i don't mean emotionally because
they're craving it because that's something that we can work with but i mean physiologically
then what i would say is make sure that you are sourcing the things as ethically as possible
and that you're really doing the minimum amounts of those possible to really support you and so if
you can get by just with eggs from a local farm and you don't need to actually have a kill product
then the fact that you need some animal product doesn't automatically justify going to kill
products and if you do need a kill product and you find some you know sustainably harvested
thing that doesn't mean go to factory farm things and so i would just say if you're in that place
where you have an ethical care for this ancient experience of other life forms and yet you don't
know how to do it with your body yet have compassion with yourself so uh that you don't
have to shame yourself for just not knowing how to do it yet and and make sure that you also hold
the lines of okay if i need to do this that doesn't mean that i automatically do a bunch of other
things right because very often there's a black and white kind of thinking where as soon as we
have a real justification for part we end up leaking beyond that and then the other thing is
do continue to work to progress in that area and educate yourself and see if you can get to
where hey i needed that but now i don't anymore and it's been my experience it with right education
and support from other people that know more about it i have yet to find anyone that hasn't been able
to do it helpfully yeah i feel like it's a journey for everyone i know for myself um when i initially
became a vegan i ate a lot more processed food and learning to eat more whole foods more whole
grains and vegetables and fruits and and things that don't have a lot of other ingredients and
then has really helped me thrive on a vegan diet yeah what someone replaces the meat with is a big
deal because if they were eating meat that was a lot of say pre-processed fast food whatever
because they're not really in the food prep way of mind and so now they're still doing kind of
pre-processed etc that means that it's probably going to be mostly all grain products that they're
replacing it with and now they're doing a bunch of breads and cereals and pastas and that does mean
that they are likely to get in staple blood sugar that they are likely to get uh amino acid imbalances
and it's just not a healthy diet so the protein has to be replaced with other things that contain
protein right which is com complexes of beans and legumes and nuts and seeds as well as potential
algae sea vegetables fresh green vegetables um and so moving to vegan healthfully usually also means
a movement towards more whole foods this is a question that really touches me personally because
as i've become more involved in veganism and become more interested in animal rights it's
really been difficult for me to retain the same amount of compassion for other humans especially
other humans that are hurting animals as i do for other animals so what is the best way to retain
compassion for non-vegans while still promoting veganism my diet is what you would call vegan
but i don't really say often anymore i am a vegan i'll say that i don't eat animal products
but identifying with any kind of label that excludes others ends up being the basis for
limiting where our compassion extends and then the basis for conflict and so we want to not just be
americans or you know christians or whatever limited group we want to be citizens of the
planet and then we want to be not just human citizens but earthlings right we want to continue
to expand our sense of connectedness to the rest of life and so i think there's even an
identity level of i am a vegan or i'm an animal activist as opposed to just compassion as a deep
value for me everybody actually values compassion even if their circle hasn't extended as far yet
they value it towards their kids towards their pets usually right towards some things and then we
identify again what's the same between us not what's different and then we get to have a basis for
building from there because with the exception of a few people that were raised by very conscious
parents in this way most of us ate meat while experiencing ourselves as ethical caring loving
people i did right and so the meat today could easily be judging the previous me as uncaring
and i wasn't uncaring right i was unaware and awareness requires more than just hearing oh
animals suffer somewhere it requires actually getting it to change a lifelong pattern that
our whole family is done our whole culture is done almost everybody around us has done since
we were a baby right and so we're looking at changing something profound we're looking at changing
how someone supports their own life staying alive at like a multiple times a day basis
which is why the act of becoming vegetarian is such a huge one it's because when you say hey the
way that i support my staying alive and something that i do every day multiple times a day and
something that i've done since since i was an infant i'm going to change that it's a huge change
and if you're changing it not just for you if you change it for health reasons it's different
because then you learn another health fad and it just keeps changing but if you change
a core way of how you support your life that started early on and that everyone around you
is still doing the other thing for the purpose of compassion then you're saying that compassion is
actually one of my core values and i'm actually going to guide the core aspects of my life by
that value and that ends up bleeding over into so many other areas you start recognizing oh my
purchases affect things in ways i don't see if i had to go to the factory farm to buy meat i would
never get the meat but because the atrocity somewhere else i don't notice it but what about
landfills isn't it like that too and now i'm going to start being conscientious of my waste
right what about did my did my shoes come from a place that was uh using child slave labor did
with animal testing involved in my cosmetics and you start really taking responsibility for the
effects that are invisible to us if we don't dig but that are very real and that matter to somebody
else and that act of saying compassion and responsibility for that compassion come together
as the core of my life that i'm actually not just going to have compassion where i care but i don't
do anything about it but i'm going to have compassion and i'm going to act on it and that
becomes a central defining thing about who i am that's such an essential shift and it's my belief
that everybody wants to have their life be a positive impact on others lives
as they get more informed and they get more sensitized and that those who are capable of
causing more harm whether it's to animals or anything is both because of a lack of awareness
a lack of resources for other opportunities and because of their own hurts and wounds that have
shut their empathy down and so it's really a process of helping people to resensitize
and to have new resources and strategies and to have deeper awareness
which means that going to attack them is the exact opposite of what would help
right recognizing like recognizing our sameness with them recognizing the goodness that's
that's there and then helping to both heal and offer new strategies is which relevant
i think that's a great point to close on and i really appreciate you being with me today
i really look forward to delving deeper into these topics with you and um and learning more
about veganism thank you michelle i'm really excited about your blog and that you're sharing this with
thanks
