trivial then there's a bleed over effect where we start doing that with other people right we
start doing that with anything else we start thinking of the rest of life as a commodity for us
rather than other sovereign life forms with their own right to life we're not thinking about
what is it what does it want what does it feel what does its right to life how can I support
it having a full life experience in this universe it's what is in it for me and even if it requires
harming it or hurting it how can I get what I want out of it when we start thinking that way
in any area it leads to a way of thinking that bleeds over to commoditizing all life
and we can see that being like an underlying way of being for all of the problems in the world right
now what about dairy and eggs and other animal products you know I grew up on a heavy meat diet
and loved animals and didn't recognize those were incongruent and then I saw a slaughter truck
and I saw animals in the most terrible conditions and it was really horrifying for me um I was nine
I asked my parents about it and they said that's where hamburgers came from and that was the beginning
of my animal rights journey and the last time I ate meat um and I found uh John Robbins book
diet for new america and got into it and got into pita's work and uh but I still ate dairy and eggs
for some years wasn't us 15 that I became vegan because in my mind it was like well I'm not hurting
the animal right and but not right um there's a couple things that are important to note here
on the dairy topic first if we look at factory farms all animals in factory farms whether we're
consuming their body or byproducts from their body are seen as a commodity where we're trying to
maximize the output of the sellable commodity for the least amount of money in which means the
least amount of care space etc and there's just really grotesque cruelty throughout the whole
process if you want to have a look at what dairy cows lives are like uh the hormones that they're
pumped full of to produce extra milk the way their babies are taken from them early I mean on and on
have a youtube videos on what the life of industrial dairy looks like uh it's nothing like the small
farms that people imagine but then let's even go to that small farm model right here's the
fundamental challenge with dairy even if it's done as well as it can be done is in order for a
cow to be producing milk it has to have a baby and the milk is intended for the baby if the baby
gets to drink the milk then we aren't getting the commodity from it that we can sell and yet we still
have to um pay for the feed to support that cow and so we take the cows or the goat or whatever
it is away from the mom either at the very beginning or prematurely and they get raised on formula so
that we can get the milk and that's all of all of the developmental problems for the baby cow all
the emotional issues you know that would develop between the two of them um that's a fundamental
unavoidable kind of ethics issue right there and then the second thing is that half of those
babies are going to be male cows and that means that even if this is a dairy where the female
cows could grow up and become part of this dairy the male cows can't be part of this dairy and
again there's a cost to support their life and that cost can't be justified if there's no return on
investment there so they all get sold to slaughter whether they're slaughtered there slaughtered
somewhere else so there really is no dairy without slaughter right the fact that the milk requires
babies and that the babies you know half are going to be male guarantees slaughter in the process
in the modern industrial version most of that looks like veal and some of the most terrible
kinds of uh animal cruelty but even in the kindest versions of it slaughter is intimately tied with
it um and so i don't see any way to do dairy that doesn't support things that uh again have that same
fundamental ethic of you have to make their life matter so much less or something relatively trivial
for us when we look at eggs again commercial egg farming uh is as atrocious as every other
form of commercial animal husbandry um but let's imagine that we're talking about a local little
farm and first i i do want to state that if something says farm fresh eggs or cage free eggs that
doesn't mean that it's not industrial farming you can have cage free meaning they're not in battery
cages but they're still packed into the tiniest environment you know etc so um if you're thinking
that you're doing eggs that come from a healthy little farm you've really got to double check
what the sourcing on that is if someone is in the graduation process of eating less animal
products they're kind of having a wake up on that and yet they don't feel totally ready for
whatever reason just nutritional or otherwise to be a hundred percent vegan yet eggs are the thing
that i would uh i would be happiest with them to eat you know as a transitional food eggs from a
local small sustainable kind of farm and here's kind of the whole breakdown with regard to that
if chickens or whatever animal you're uh getting eggs from but most commonly chickens if they're
allowed to have a natural life where we're not constraining it too much then they're going to
be mating and those are all going to be fertilized and they're going to want to protect those eggs
just not get away from them you're going to be taking animals that that you know would otherwise
taking eggs that would become animals otherwise and so there's the the ethic kill thing in that
um and that's you know that's a an ethical problem on the same kind of order as the previous ones
if you keep the rooster away from the chickens then it's unfertilized eggs and there's not a huge
kind of ethical harm to it intrinsically but i'll tell you where kind of the boundary issues are here
we have to constrain that animal's life where we don't ever give it the opportunity to mate
or to interact in what would really be a natural way for it and even if we're doing that in what
looks like a pretty kind environment we still ask that that what i trade places with them kind of
thing if if you were kept in an environment that where you were fed and you're well taken care of
but you were never allowed around the opposite gender or allowed to mate like you wouldn't consider
that a good deal it would be a better deal than a torturous one and so anytime we relate with animals
where we are modifying what their nature is to make them fulfill a purpose for us there's ethical
questions that come up and honestly these even extend into how we relate to what we call pets
horses dogs cats when you start to get into issues like hey if they keep breeding and we're
killing in shelters this is a real problem but neutering would you want to be in a position
where that had to happen and these are really the boundaries on questions right these are
well hey is that animal getting some enhancement in its life experience because of us or because
it's been so domesticated and hybridized that it couldn't live in nature anymore is this now
just something we have to deal with and i'm going to say these are things to just feel into but the
bottom line here is that if you commodify an animal where the animal or its byproducts becomes a
commodity for us then you are going to constrain the way that it lives alter it in ways that it
doesn't like that you wouldn't like to trade places with and there are going to be some ethical
considerations around that so you know this is why i choose veganism i don't eat eggs if i was
going to eat some animal product it would be eggs and i'd be really cautious about where they came
from and i think one point on this that's worth noting is that when someone says you know what
for me the ethics of eating an egg from a small farm like i can live with that it's important to
then hold from a small farm and not just say oh i eat eggs because there's one way of doing it
that's okay so that means when i'm out in a restaurant i will even though in a restaurant
it's coming from uh you know a battery cage um or even if you say you know what i could hunt
i'm okay with that but i'm really not okay with factory farms and really own what that means when
you go to a restaurant or a friend's house right and what your supply and demand means and that
to where if you're going to draw lines that aren't all the way at veganism make sure you really hold
to your own ethical lines what about eating honey i think that honey is an animal byproduct that's
the easiest for people that don't eat animal products for ethical reasons to still continue to
eat because of all the issues with these um in terms of calm colony collapse and their inability
to survive currently with gmo's and pesticides why is it still important for people to consider
how and when they eat honey um you know i think with honey there's a few reasons why some people
might think of it differently one is the more different another creature is than us the harder
it is for us to extend our empathy because the harder it is for us to recognize that it might
experience anything like we experience and so empathy is a process of progressive widening
to be able to recognize our interconnectedness and our sameness with more things right so extending
all the way down to insects um insects don't necessarily elicit the same emotional responses
in most people that mammals do um but it also doesn't mean that their life doesn't matter
and obviously we know that for the pollinators our life depends on their life continuing in
terms of maintaining the ecosystem and plant life um with regard to honey
the way that we relate to the bees and the way that we relate to their hive and the way that we
gather the honey is what really determines the ethics of it in my eyes um because i don't have
an ethic around not interacting with animal products i mean if if an animal died of natural causes
and if someone wanted to eat it i have no ethical issue whether it's a good idea or good for them
or not no suffering was caused for doing that i have an ethic around causing unnecessary harm
right and so in the process of uh creating honey very oftentimes there's the animal the the bees
are commodified in a way where the colony is damaged bees are killed there's no real respect
for their life process and that's through how the antibiotics are pumped into them it's through
um the process of smoking them out to get them to move from one hive together the honey
but there are beekeeping practices that recognize that bees are surplus creators they're one of the
few things in nature that create surplus and that even if they have more honey than they're
going to use for a long time they just keep doing it that's what they do and that we can
take from that surplus without really bothering their life without harming them if that's the
beekeeping practice i have no problem with it and if that's really supports people to support bees
it happens to be that those practices also go along with what will help bees resist colony
collapse disorder much of the colony collapse disorder has to do with very hybridized species
of bees that have less robust immune systems because we've hybridized them for being able
to pollinate very productively specific kinds of plants and like that obviously it has most to do
with the neonicotinoid pesticides and other factors that have affected them so the organic
farming of bees that both keeps them off of pesticide crops that has a diverse variety of
bee species or less hybridized bee species and that harvests the honey in a more considerate way
to them i don't have an ethics issue with and i actually think is a good example of human animal
symbiosis where we get to mutually benefit each other but again if a human is going to choose to
consume honey they they need to stand the line and be certain that they're only eating honey that
comes from bees that that were treated fairly and that's usually going to say raw it's going to say
organic and typically if you can find locally produced honey uh you you've got a lot of nutritional
benefits that come in terms of pollen inoculation and like that for many people with locally produced
honeys but if you can even go check out how they do it um that's a great thing yeah definitely what
should someone do if they're struggling to stay healthy on a vegan diet there are people that
have an easier time being healthy with animal products than without them there are a lot of
people for whom that's the opposite where uh as soon as they become vegan they start feeling a lot
healthier and issues clear up and uh they lose weight and their athletics become better great
but for some people that have a harder time with it it's my belief that almost all of them
can learn how to be vegan just as healthfully um but for but for some people getting a variety of
amino acids is a little bit more of a challenge because they actually have to source them intelligently
because when you when you're eating an animal the animal eats whatever a varied diet is and
creates a complete protein in its muscle and when you eat that complete protein it breaks back down
into all the amino essential amino acids but if we're just eating you know beans legumes the plant
sources they're that are mostly not complete proteins themselves we have to make sure we
have some variety of those and if someone isn't paying attention to do that they can start to
get an amino acid imbalance so for the most part i would say learn more and uh having a complete
amino acid profile is one of the major things um that matters for people also long chain uh fatty
acid specifically long chain omega 3 and your uh flax oil and other seed oils you're going to be
getting a form of omega 3 called ala which is a shorter chain the longer chain epa and dha come
in meats because the animal but animal synthesizes it and an egg yolk um you can get those longer
chains in algaes and in alga oils you can supplement with that but your body can also convert it but
it converts it if your blood sugar is balanced if your blood sugar isn't balanced you have high resting
insulin it's harder to convert it and for so many people that are eating a higher starch
carbohydrate sugar diet then it's harder to convert those things um and then for other people hem iron
is one of uh those other challenges and again there are uh vegan and vegetarian sources of iron
that do convert well and the b vitamins that are essential cofactors for the conversion of it um
and so basically i would say study and learn about it and almost everyone that i have ever
interfaced with that was having a challenge with it actually to be honest everyone that i have ever
worked with who had it who wanted to be vegetarian or wanted to be vegan for spiritual
ethical moral reasons and was having a challenge with their health and they felt better when they
ate some meat than not when we figured out what was going on what nutrients they were missing
and we figured out how to plant source those they were all able to plant source them effectively
but to acknowledge the possibility that someone doesn't yet know how to do that or maybe their
body just can't and i just want to be open to that possibility then i'm not going to begrudge that
person for eating an animal product because if our goal is to minimize suffering that means to the
person also and if they don't know how to not suffer and i don't mean emotionally because
they're craving it because that's something that we can work with but i mean physiologically
then what i would say is make sure that you are sourcing the things as ethically as possible
and that you're really doing the minimum amounts of those possible to really support you and so if
you can get by just with eggs from a local farm and you don't need to actually have a kill product
then the fact that you need some animal product doesn't automatically justify going to kill
products and if you do need a kill product and you find some you know sustainably harvested
thing that doesn't mean go to factory farm things and so i would just say if you're in that place
where you have an ethical care for this ancient experience of other life forms and yet you don't
know how to do it with your body yet have compassion with yourself so uh that you don't
have to shame yourself for just not knowing how to do it yet and and make sure that you also hold
the lines of okay if i need to do this that doesn't mean that i automatically do a bunch of other
things right because very often there's a black and white kind of thinking where as soon as we
have a real justification for part we end up leaking beyond that and then the other thing is
do continue to work to progress in that area and educate yourself and see if you can get to
where hey i needed that but now i don't anymore and it's been my experience it with right education
and support from other people that know more about it i have yet to find anyone that hasn't been able
to do it helpfully yeah i feel like it's a journey for everyone i know for myself um when i initially
became a vegan i ate a lot more processed food and learning to eat more whole foods more whole
grains and vegetables and fruits and and things that don't have a lot of other ingredients and
then has really helped me thrive on a vegan diet yeah what someone replaces the meat with is a big
deal because if they were eating meat that was a lot of say pre-processed fast food whatever
because they're not really in the food prep way of mind and so now they're still doing kind of
pre-processed etc that means that it's probably going to be mostly all grain products that they're
replacing it with and now they're doing a bunch of breads and cereals and pastas and that does mean
that they are likely to get in staple blood sugar that they are likely to get uh amino acid imbalances
and it's just not a healthy diet so the protein has to be replaced with other things that contain
protein right which is com complexes of beans and legumes and nuts and seeds as well as potential
algae sea vegetables fresh green vegetables um and so moving to vegan healthfully usually also means
a movement towards more whole foods this is a question that really touches me personally because
as i've become more involved in veganism and become more interested in animal rights it's
really been difficult for me to retain the same amount of compassion for other humans especially
other humans that are hurting animals as i do for other animals so what is the best way to retain
compassion for non-vegans while still promoting veganism my diet is what you would call vegan
but i don't really say often anymore i am a vegan i'll say that i don't eat animal products
but identifying with any kind of label that excludes others ends up being the basis for
limiting where our compassion extends and then the basis for conflict and so we want to not just be
americans or you know christians or whatever limited group we want to be citizens of the
planet and then we want to be not just human citizens but earthlings right we want to continue
