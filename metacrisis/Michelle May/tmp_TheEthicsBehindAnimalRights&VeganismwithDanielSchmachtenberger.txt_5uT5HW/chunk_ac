to expand our sense of connectedness to the rest of life and so i think there's even an
identity level of i am a vegan or i'm an animal activist as opposed to just compassion as a deep
value for me everybody actually values compassion even if their circle hasn't extended as far yet
they value it towards their kids towards their pets usually right towards some things and then we
identify again what's the same between us not what's different and then we get to have a basis for
building from there because with the exception of a few people that were raised by very conscious
parents in this way most of us ate meat while experiencing ourselves as ethical caring loving
people i did right and so the meat today could easily be judging the previous me as uncaring
and i wasn't uncaring right i was unaware and awareness requires more than just hearing oh
animals suffer somewhere it requires actually getting it to change a lifelong pattern that
our whole family is done our whole culture is done almost everybody around us has done since
we were a baby right and so we're looking at changing something profound we're looking at changing
how someone supports their own life staying alive at like a multiple times a day basis
which is why the act of becoming vegetarian is such a huge one it's because when you say hey the
way that i support my staying alive and something that i do every day multiple times a day and
something that i've done since since i was an infant i'm going to change that it's a huge change
and if you're changing it not just for you if you change it for health reasons it's different
because then you learn another health fad and it just keeps changing but if you change
a core way of how you support your life that started early on and that everyone around you
is still doing the other thing for the purpose of compassion then you're saying that compassion is
actually one of my core values and i'm actually going to guide the core aspects of my life by
that value and that ends up bleeding over into so many other areas you start recognizing oh my
purchases affect things in ways i don't see if i had to go to the factory farm to buy meat i would
never get the meat but because the atrocity somewhere else i don't notice it but what about
landfills isn't it like that too and now i'm going to start being conscientious of my waste
right what about did my did my shoes come from a place that was uh using child slave labor did
with animal testing involved in my cosmetics and you start really taking responsibility for the
effects that are invisible to us if we don't dig but that are very real and that matter to somebody
else and that act of saying compassion and responsibility for that compassion come together
as the core of my life that i'm actually not just going to have compassion where i care but i don't
do anything about it but i'm going to have compassion and i'm going to act on it and that
becomes a central defining thing about who i am that's such an essential shift and it's my belief
that everybody wants to have their life be a positive impact on others lives
as they get more informed and they get more sensitized and that those who are capable of
causing more harm whether it's to animals or anything is both because of a lack of awareness
a lack of resources for other opportunities and because of their own hurts and wounds that have
shut their empathy down and so it's really a process of helping people to resensitize
and to have new resources and strategies and to have deeper awareness
which means that going to attack them is the exact opposite of what would help
right recognizing like recognizing our sameness with them recognizing the goodness that's
that's there and then helping to both heal and offer new strategies is which relevant
i think that's a great point to close on and i really appreciate you being with me today
i really look forward to delving deeper into these topics with you and um and learning more
about veganism thank you michelle i'm really excited about your blog and that you're sharing this with
thanks
