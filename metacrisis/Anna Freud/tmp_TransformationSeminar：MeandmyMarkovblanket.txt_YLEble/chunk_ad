that you're trying to make sense of you know and all your sensing is possibly a rattle or suckling
or nurturing behaviour or filletive touch from your mother and you're trying to make sense of the
world but you can't discontent from anything to actually drill down and start to build a deep model
that provides a parsimonious explanation of the kind our mother is a creature she is an object
out there that's doing stuff to me I cause this bit and she calls that bit so you know then the
game gets ex exquisitely difficult in terms of understanding the profound implications of a failure
to suspend your attention in a in a in an apt way to realise your agency or disambiguate
I cause that or you cause that I mean there is a finding that originally John Watson
brought forward to the developmental world that babies up to the age of about three months
attend with preference things that are perfectly contingent with their actions after three months
they prefer to attend to things that are clearly but clearly not perfectly contingent nearly
contingent but not perfectly contingent and that autistic children do not have this switch
at the three month switch would this be consistent with what you're suggesting yes it would I didn't
know that that's fascinating I mean you know if I if I had to build a baby in silico that's exactly
what one would hope would happen in the normal development you've got to learn what bits of
this world you know can I act upon and what bits can't you know that's that that's the first thing
that you need to do to just the self-discovery without any sense of selfhood per se but then
you get to the more interesting bits well you know I thought I could control this but perhaps
there's another agent's out there and then you start to you know get it find that much more
epistemically attractive it has much more epistemic affordance these things I thought I could
control but in fact someone else might be out there yeah well let me try and squeeze another
question so enlightening lecture thank you I'm a psychologist working with parents
who struggle to relate to their kids who engage in very high-risk behaviors part of the issue is
that often parents overreact emotionally feeding into the behavior staying calm and acting
counteratively is a challenge so thinking about the mark of blanket model where would
you start with these parents not an easy question it's not because I was immediately trying to
answer it as a psychiatrist and as a mathematician all that this very simple minded treatment of
dadic interactions brings to the table is the the notion of generalized synchronization between
you and your loved ones or you and your clients or you and your and your patients which would
basically says that to have a harmonious aligned interaction you have to be in a like-minded
singing from the same hymn sheet so if you are at all that hymn sheet covers all modalities from
interception from verbal non-verbal cues but the synchronization the alignment is still in play
even to the level you can measure it in terms of your body movements blushing for example
pupillary dilatation all of these subliminal cues that tell you about the state of your embodied brain
are mutually available and the trick would be I would imagine to try and synchronize them so
just on that mathematical basis you have to put yourself in the same state of mind as the child
in the fond hope that the child will reciprocate by putting themselves in the same state of mind
as you one little trick here is that the weight the weight at which the rate at which two couple
systems converge to their common ground depends upon the precision or the confidence in the
predictions of the two so there's an asymmetry there you can often get a teacher or a parent or
a therapist who has more if you like precise beliefs higher in their model that will move
towards the less precise Markov blanket or client or child but will move less quickly than the child
moves to the parent and clearly you see that in a natural setting just in terms of schooling
it's generally the case that the teacher is older than the child and the teacher is more
confident about what the child knows but at some point there is a meeting in the middle but it's
not always in the middle so that was a really stupid answer but at least it was faithful to
the mathematics one final question to test that breath that I was boosting on your behalf
and here is I'm sorry could a problem in the stability or structuring in the Markov blanket
be thought of as a failure or weakness of psychic defense and would the introduction of entropy
or dissolution point to links with Freud's ideas of the death instinct?
Yes I mean there are all sorts of what really interesting ways you could take that question
in terms of structural learning you know but let me focus on you know on the Freudian
interpretation or homologues here and I think you know if there is part of the audience that
likes this to understand the parallels and the homologies and isomorphisms between your Freudian
take on free energy and the more mathematical Richard Feynman take on it then Mark Soames is
your man you know he's written beautifully about this and would normally start the story by noting
that Freudian formulations inherited quite a lot from Helmholtz so you know had Freud known Feynman
and had you know tried to develop Helmholtzian ideas it's more than likely his free energy would
be the same as that used by people like Geoffrey Hinton and Richard Feynman and the interestingly
when when Mark Soames goes into this in great detail he actually converges on the same thing
that we were talking about before which is this precision that the you know I'm not sure that we
in this we don't have time to get to to eager dissolution and the like but one important
autopoetic aspect that maintains the integrity of the Markov blanket is exactly this attending
and disattending it's selective and appropriate switching on and off of how the sensory states
get in and influence the internal states and then vicariously your actions upon the world
if that breaks everything falls to pieces and that certainly is Mark Soames's story
based upon sort of you know a sort of a theoretical neuropsychology based upon the importance of
ascending modulating neurotransmission systems for example dopamine and the like but not just
dopamine all these classical neuromodulators because if it's the physiological
mediation of this precision control is via selecting selection and per-snapting game which
is neuromodulation so it's not surprising that a lot of the neurochemistry of and the pharmacology
of psychopathology fixes upon these neuromodulators and furthermore this is exactly
Mark Soames's conclusion in terms of the the failure to resolve free energy
lives you know the seat of the soul is essentially the source of origin of the ascending
modulating neurotransmitter systems that are exactly there to provide this gating attenuation
selection behaviour that that preserves the Markov blanket in the sense that we've been discussing.
Can't this is an absolutely brilliant lecture you are everything that I have advertised you to be
it is obviously a revelation but a revelation in the direction of helping us understand
sociality helping us understand how ultimately the brain and our capacity to
create a create a world that's consistent with our hypothesis actually falls into
a continuum that we are living every day in but as you said in a very strange as a very strange
function of time as a very strange function of time and it's to have a mind like yours that
actually can bridge the obtuse writings of psychoanalysts with the cutting edge writings of
physicists and the neuroscientists in between and whilst maintaining an identity as a somebody who's
concerned with mental health you are a remarkable human being you really are and we are enormously
privileged to have had you here this evening and to be able to benefit from your wisdom so
thank you so much for joining us thank you thank you thank you so much
