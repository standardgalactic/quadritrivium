mechanics ensues that there's a difference between the activity here and the top-down prediction
that elaborates a prediction error that's sent forward to give better top-down predictions
on the first-order predictions that generate and try to suppress the first-order prediction errors
and you can see how you can build this hierarchically into a deep generative model of the sort necessary
for inferring what's going to happen next at different temple scales a narrative or in this
instance birdsong and this is a useful explanation for listening and but notice that we've also
included in the things the sensations that have to be predicted the sensations that are reporting
the status of my motor plant in this instance the the voice box of the bird here so the if I
were able to if I was listening then I would I would not be predicting any sensations from
from my articulatory muscles any stretch receptor signals however I can use exactly
the same generative model the same machinery predicted machinery and to actually reproduce
and sing and all I need to do is basically switch on by increasing the precision
or of the descending predictions of what I would feel if I was actually producing this sensory
input and then I would have a difference between my top-down predictions and what I'm actually
sensing from my muscles and I would have a prediction error and I could use that prediction
error to drive my expectations and in fact I wasn't singing or I can send them back outside to the
world and actually cause the muscles to move until they supply the predicted signals so all I've
done here is sketch a computational anatomy that is isomorphic exactly the same as a classical
reflex arc where the way that we move and indeed the way that we secrete in terms of autonomic
action is rests upon top-down predictions providing a set point for classical reflex arcs that these
peripheral prediction errors actually drive and fulfill and all this requires is a sort of yin yang
or a selective gating of whether I am attending to switching on the precision of the prediction
errors pertaining to proprioception to action or extra reception this instance auditory
sensations so this illustrates a very important role of
of precision in contextualizing whether I'm passively listening and not moving or whether I'm
actually generating the sensations actively and implicitly also attenuating the consequences of
my own action sometimes referred to as sensory attenuation technically what we are the story
that we've just told this little predictive coding with reflexes formulation of active inference
is a story about the top-down predictions descending predictions playing the role of
corollary discharge predicting stuff that I'm sensing in the extra receptive domain
and at the same time bilaterally generating predictions of proprioception that are
interpreted as motor commands by the peripheral nervous system and my neuromuscular junctions
from the point of view of the control of precision this is often this mechanism sort of switching
between sensory attenuation and organ and sensory attenuation sensory attention or selection
sometimes interpreted in terms of attention being if you like the psychological homologue
of this sort of precision engineered message passing here I just want to drill down on that
because I'm going to use that in the final couple of slides to simulate dynamic interactions
so just to show you how potent this precision modulation of the prediction errors that we're
trying to use to select the kinds of prediction errors that we want to minimize on that we believe
convey precise information for our belief updating I'm going to play a little game
if you allow me to play this game it's illustrative of one of the clearest
examples of sensory attenuation which is called mechanic suppression but I'll explain
how and why just after illustrating its potency so this is not going to work very well given that
you're all very remote but could you if you are a man do one task and if you're a woman do another
task and the task is as follows in a moment Sherlock Holmes is going to jump from this side of the
screen to the other side of the screen and your job is to tell me whether any aspect of this picture
of Sherlock Holmes changed when it goes from here to here I'd like the women to focus on this
fixation point here in the center so they have to keep their eyes still and tell me whether
Sherlock Holmes changed on Passon whilst fixating on the cross conversely the men I'd like you to
focus on Sherlock Holmes and try and track Sherlock Holmes and what I want to know is who's
the best at being able to detect whether or not anything changed in the picture of Sherlock Holmes
so if you if you can all do that I'm going to pick on Lydia as representative of women to give
me her answer and Tim as representative of men to give me give me the given the men's answer so
Lydia and Tim can you can you focus if you're still there on on this particular little task
right so three two one and then is going to jump three two one
Lydia can you hear me hi yes I can what did you did you think Sherlock Holmes changed in
any aspect well I saw something flash up in the middle oh what did you see I think it said did
you miss me okay that's Tim okay I Tim are you there I'm there I'm here yes I'm afraid I didn't
see anything I didn't know you didn't see anything at all no change in Sherlock Holmes
so beautiful that that is a lovely illustration of the power of saccadic suppression or sense
detenuation in the ocular motor context so what Lydia well done that was you know you only had
about 50 milliseconds to see that but you did indeed see did you miss me and and the idea here
is the reason that you Lydia saw this and was that you were not suppressing the precision of your
visual prediction errors because you weren't moving Tim on the other hand had to suppress
the prediction the visual prediction errors because they were a consequence of its active
sensing or visual palpation of the world so this is a lovely example of enforced sensory attenuation
where we're basically transiently blind or transiently suspender our attention when we
cause the sensations and of course when we move our eyes there is an enormous visual flow or optic
induced simply by our eye movements which we cannot see and in virtue of the fact that Tim
could not see it whilst he was moving his eyes he couldn't see anything else either which is why
you Lydia were the only person that could actually see the did you did you miss me so I think this
is a wonderful example of you know hardwired sensory attenuation that really has a profound
influence of on on how the sensorium updates our belief and how that depends exquisitely
on agency and action and what I want to do now is just to close by leveraging sensory attenuation
and augmentation that underwrites whether I'm whether I'm listening or talking or whether I'm
listening or singing to simulate now dyadic interaction so previously we've been talking
and simulating little creatures inter exchanging with the external world what I'm doing now
was making a further move and putting two Markov blankets face to face as it were so the internal
states of one blanket are the external states of another blanket in the hope of simulating dyadic
interactions but to do that to preserve the conditional independences I have to do turn
taking and I'm going to use this precision mechanism to turn take so one in this instance
is going to be a bird is listening and then it's singing and then it's listening and then it's singing
and vice versa for the other bird so when we integrate those equations let the birds sing
and when we integrate those equations of motion that predictive coding equation with the prediction
and the gradient the prediction and minimization part of a neuro of a neurobiologically
plausible sort for the generative model that I've just described for singing and listening
we can simulate what would happen if two birds were singing in the same locale
what I've done here is separate the two birds so that they can't hear each other
so what you're listening to now is what one bird is actually hearing it can't hear itself
so it can hear itself and it can't hear the other bird and then now simply going to repeat
the simulation but bringing the two birds within hearing range of each other so now they can hear
each other and then I'm going to track the internal states at different levels in this
synthetic cortical hierarchy that are providing the predictions and the prediction errors for
the song that you've just heard and now if we listen to what is perceived by the first bird
you can now hear a continuous melody and this melody is composed of itself singing and then
hearing the other bird then itself and the other bird and in contrast to the previous slide
what we're seeing here is a synchronization and this synchronization ensues because both birds
have the same generative model they both have the same beliefs about what's out there and in
this instance what's out there is exactly the same as itself which means that this is a really
powerful way to minimize surprise or prediction error in the sense that
if you are like me and we are in exchange then you become very predictable from my point of view
because anything that I do you are doing and vice versa and this holds for you as well so
dyadically or together we can now minimize our free energy or minimize our prediction error
simply because where we are committing to the same narrative to the same sensory states and
active states that generate the sensorium and our sensorium is shared and it's mutually predictable
simply because I can assume that you are like me and under that assumption and when two things
are sufficiently similar and they can learn mutually to be sufficiently similar then we
see the emergence again of the synchronization manifold so here in a different context but it's
mathematically exactly the same construct that we that we looked at with the simulations the
primordial soup what I've done is tracked out the brain activity if you like the neural activity
generating predictions when the two birds couldn't hear each other at the different levels in this
synthetic cortical hierarchy and then exactly the same neural activity patterns when they can
hear each other just to show you how they align how they become synchronized and because we now
know that it couldn't be in it it couldn't be in any other way in the sense that these this is the
kind of coupling that is the non-equilibrium steady state or it is this attracting set of states that
must emerge very much like Huygens clocks so that's an illustration of synchronization in terms of
communication and this is a very elemental communication literally singing from the same
hint sheet in order to be able to infer a very elemental if you like theory of mind the the
last slide is really an invitation to think about what that means for the way that we learn our
generative models of the world to exploit this free energy minima this this prediction error
solution in a world that is populated constitutes creatures like me I can assume that every
creature like me is like me and we're all seeing from the same him sheet but to get there I have to
learn that the world out there comprises creatures like me so here is the challenge for a newborn
first of all the newborn has to distinguish between the things that it can act upon and the things
that he has no control over in order to develop a sense a generative model that enables it to
recognize those reflexes and parts of the world can be controlled and can't be controlled but the
even greater challenge then is to recognize and to learn by this surprise minimizing free energy
minimizing prediction error mechanism applied to the connections and the structure and the parameters
of the generative model to learn that the best explanation for its sensorium is a fact that many
of the sensations are supplied by something else another and in particularly a mother that is
something like me which will be the final the final stage and the very elemental
sort of simplistic sense of learning that there are things like me out there
so having developed a sense of mother then one might suppose that a neonate might test then the
hypothesis or perhaps I am like mother and thereby leading to a sense of self so in a rather cursory
way I've managed to get to the what was promised in the introduction from Peter about agency and a
sense of self but in a way really which is more an invitation to interpret discuss whether the
underlying physics of sentience really makes sense in terms of speaking to these fundamental
questions about selfhood and relationships with others I'll end with a quote from Feynman it's
usually a technical quote but I thought this would be more appropriate in given in the current
context the highest forms of understanding we can achieve our laughter and human compassion
and with that it just remains for me to thank all the people whose ideas I've been talking about
and most importantly thank you for your attention thank you very much indeed and I'm
going to pass now back to Peter. Thank you thank you so much Carl I've been monitoring some of the
comments in between and if I could just cite to you a few enlightening lecture thank you
this is so interesting and brilliantly explained so I've got some questions but just to say
in kind of try and do a little bit of translation what is remarkable about your
view is really that it's like the picture that you should you've turned perception upside down in
the kind of active inference framework that there is that the traditional notion of perception
and action and everything between is not a kind of the endpoint of a whole
long line of processing but really something that we generate from inside and then
compare without that and those of us here working clinically and a number of questions
from that perspective have learned this all along we have you're not telling us anything new you've
known this that the people just interpret that world and you know they try and minimize prediction
error and they change the world until the prediction error is minimized and
and some of that has very painful consequences in some way it has distressing
consequences in psychopathology and one of the questions and there'll be more technical
questions one of the questions that people really want you to address just a little bit because I
know that you have done is how would you brilliant your model is how would you
see mental disorder how would you see psychopathologies in terms of prediction error
and is there a risk which I don't think there is but I think it could be the reassurance
that is there a risk that some sorts of innate disruption in minimizing prediction errors could
be at the root of mental disorder or is that a consequence of
historical experience in terms of consequence of personal experience
but do you go excellent question and so just speaking to this sort of you know turning things
on their head it is I think a nice example of what dandenek calls a strange inversion but clearly
not strange to you and people actually work with with people but for some people in machine learning
and artificial intelligence it's certainly a strange inversion but much more natural for
people work with actually also real artifacts of artificial sorting robotics but the deeper I
think more challenging question which I'm sure we'll drill down to is you know where does this
mechanics yield some interesting hypotheses about false inference and the concomitant behaviors
that attend or belief states that attend false inference that we see in psychopathology of its
various flavors and I think you've you've carved up the answer into two domains already which is
part of it is this false inference in the moment what leads what's what's the
the first principle account of a false belief or indeed a false percept
in the moment and then there's the other questions which are more about the learning
of the gerentive models so there's the deployment of a gerentive model inverting it in the moment
given the sensory evidence given all the evidence from your interception from your
pro-social interactions at hand to use your gerentive model to infer what's going on at the moment
and you know how I can sample or create new information to make my predictions come true
as opposed to in a developmental or indeed actually in any experience dependent setting
the updating of the parameters the contingencies the lawful aspects the structure of that
gerentive model that would underwrite you know the emergence of a sense of agency attachment
possibly a description of you know the development of a dadic relationship over
over you know days months weeks and years so in the first domain there's a really
practical answer and it just comes from the empiricism that you know one can find in
academic psychiatry and academic neurology when one looks at the the process there is a neuronal
process there is that mediate this gradient flow then it seems that the both the the nature of
false inference the psychopathology if you like and the neurophysiology almost universally
identifies a failure of that precision so it's a failure of that sensory attenuation that we
were illustrating with the circadian suppression but at a much higher level so whether you're
talking about Parkinson's disease failure to attenuate proprioceptive information that I'm
not moving I'm therefore never being able to develop the fantasy that I'm moving leading to
psychomotor poverty or whether it's the hallucinosis volcanic psychosyndromes
or indeed schizophrenia where you or perhaps the poster child here would be autism
where you are unable to modulate or attenuate the precision afforded sensory evidence so you
become glued to the sensorium you fail to develop deep centrally coherent generated models of your
world you cannot discontent nothing is surprising because nothing everything is is worthwhile
predicting so you can't have illusions you can't have mismatched negativities all ball responses
all cardinal signs of you know of things like schizophrenia so you put that failure of sensory
attenuation in a developmental context and just ask what it must be like to be born into a world
