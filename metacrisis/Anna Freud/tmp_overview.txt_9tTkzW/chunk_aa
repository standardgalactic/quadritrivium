Checking Anna Freud/Transformation Seminarï¼š Me and my Markov blanket.txt
1. The question about the convergence rate between two systems in a Markov blanket is influenced by the precision or confidence of each system's predictions. Typically, a more confident system (like a teacher or therapist) will move towards a less precise system (like a student or client), but not as quickly as the reverse.

2. The stability or structure of a Markov blanket can be seen as a form of psychic defense. A failure or weakness in this structure could be interpreted through a Freudian lens, potentially relating to the concept of the death instinct.

3. Freud's ideas on the mind might be thought of in terms of free energy or entropy, drawing parallels between his work and that of physicists like Richard Feynman. Geoffrey Hinton and Richard Feynman indeed use a similar concept of free energy in their models.

4. The integrity of the Markov blanket is maintained by selective attention and disattention, which is regulated by ascending modulating neurotransmission systems (like dopamine) within the brain. These systems control the precision of sensory states and actions upon the world.

5. Neurochemistry and pharmacology often target these neuromodulators to address psychopathology, as they are crucial for maintaining the balance necessary for a stable Markov blanket.

6. The lecture bridges the gap between psychoanalytic theories (like those of Freud), the work of physicists, and neuroscientific understanding, providing insights into sociality and the human capacity to create a consistent world based on our hypotheses.

7. The speaker is commended for their ability to connect seemingly disparate fields of knowledge and for their contribution to understanding mental health, as well as their wisdom in addressing these complex topics.
