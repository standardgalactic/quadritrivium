Checking Harvard Medical School/The Evolution of Bacteria on a “Mega-Plate” Petri Dish (Kishony Lab).txt
 The setup described is an experimental system, larger than a traditional Petri dish (two feet by four feet), designed to observe the evolution of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in real-time. This system consists of nine bands of agar, each containing varying concentrations of antibiotic, with no antibiotic in the outermost layer. The bacteria, specifically E. coli in this case, start from a point and spread across the medium. The process is observed through the addition of black ink to the top agar layer, which allows the bacterial colonies to appear as white spots against a dark background.

Initially, the bacteria grow freely in areas with no antibiotic. As they encounter higher concentrations of antibiotics, their growth slows or stops. However, mutant bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotic levels begin to appear and spread. These mutants continue to move through successive higher-concentration bands, each time having to undergo further mutations to survive the increasing antibiotic levels.

Over the course of about eleven days, the bacteria repeatedly acquire new mutations that confer resistance to the antibiotics. By the end of this process, bacteria that were originally sensitive have evolved to survive in a band with a thousand times the original antibiotic concentration. This experiment demonstrates how bacteria can rapidly develop resistance to high levels of antibiotics through natural selection and successive genetic mutations.
