So what we ended up building was basically a Petri dish, except that it's two feet by
four feet.
And the way we set it up is that there are nine bands, and at the base of each of these
bands we put a normal Petri dish thick agar with different amounts of antibiotic.
On the outside there's no antibiotic, just in from that.
There's barely more than the E. coli can survive.
Outside of that there's ten times as much, a hundred times, and then finally the middle
band has a thousand times as much antibiotic.
And then across the top of it pour some thin agar that bacteria can move around in.
The background is black because there's ink in it, and the bacteria appear as white.
First you see they spread in the area where there's no antibiotic, up until the point
they can no longer survive.
When a mutant appears on the right, it's resistant to the antibiotic, it spreads until
it starts to compete with other mutants around it.
When these mutants hit the next boundary, they too have to pause and develop new mutations
to make it into ten times as much antibiotic.
Then you see the different mutants repeat this at one hundred.
And after about eleven days they finally make it into one thousand times as much antibiotic
as the wild type can survive.
And so we can see by this process of accumulating successive mutations that bacteria which are
normally sensitive to an antibiotic can evolve resistance to extremely high concentrations
in a short period of time.
