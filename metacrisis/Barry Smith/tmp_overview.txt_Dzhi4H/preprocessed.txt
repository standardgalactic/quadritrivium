1. **Ontology Creation for Navy Systems Engineering Transformation (SET):** The U.S. Navy is undertaking a massive transformation called Systems Engineering Transformation (SET). A key challenge is the harmonization of terminology across the organization, which is essential for cross-disciplinary work and effective communication. To address this, a plan to create an ontology has been proposed to ensure consistent use of terms.

2. **Plan Architecture:** The ontology plan is structured around four main categories: Things, Attributes, Processes, and Information Entities. The Navy's operations, including the movement of ships, manufacturing, data exchange, role classification, and various processes like testing and logistics, require specific ontologies.

3. **Ontology Categories:**
   - **Things/Information Ontology:** Deals with physical assets (ships, equipment), information artifacts (reports, sensor data), and platforms (business systems).
   - **Attributes Ontology:** Addresses roles of personnel, capabilities of units and equipment, training for teams, and the different functions within the Navy.
   - **Processes Ontology:** Encompasses operational processes, maintenance, logistics, classification guidance, and manufacturing.
   - **Capabilities Ontology:** Details the various skills and training that Navy personnel undergo.
   - **Safety/Reliability Ontology:** Focuses on aspects related to safety and reliability of systems and equipment.

4. **Granularity Levels:** The ontologies range from broad categories (systems, platforms) to specific components (molecules, energy). Finding the right level of detail is crucial for effective use in SET.

5. **Negotiation and Determination:** The precise organization and implementation of these ontologies will be negotiated among stakeholders. Participants are encouraged to think about the necessary ontologies during the break, with a discussion to follow after a coffee break.

6. **Next Steps:** After the break, the group will continue discussing the ontology needs for ground systems, and further details on how to proceed will be established. The goal is to ensure that the Navy's SET initiative is supported by a robust and interoperable set of ontologies.
