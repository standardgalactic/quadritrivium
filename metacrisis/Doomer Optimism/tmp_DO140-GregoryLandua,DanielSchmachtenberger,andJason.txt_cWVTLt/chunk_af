contributing to the extractive world as much and maybe prototyping something maybe creating some
local resilience and prototyping something that would help prevent some of the cascading failures
i don't want to decrease people's um motivation to do that i think that if people are feeling
motivated in that way that is important and awesome and all you know i would say is that
like going from no agency to some agency even if it's just the agency to make your own life
better is a movement in the right direction and going from the agency to make your own life better
to your family's life better and then maybe a local community is better is a movement in the
right direction and to just keep that direction going as much as you can realizing that even if
you stop getting most of your needs your food and whatever met by global supply chains you are
still part of a world that independent of even caring for the other people and animals and other
parts of the world which you probably do you're also directly affected by them or indirectly but
really affected by them and to not get dysfunctionally bummed by what you can't do about it but to
care about it in ways that can motivate new insights and even if let's say you moved to get
to produce a lot less waste and have much deeper better relationships with your neighbors and you
you know produce much more of your own food and you start to realize that you can extend this to
your larger community than just a few neighbors you actually create some local resilience the
step from that to then mapping what were the things you thought would work that didn't and what were
the things that surprised you that really worked well and putting that online so that other people
that are inspired to do similarly can everyone can be benefiting from what everybody learns
and staying apprised of the macro issues enough that where you would have the ability to do something
meaningful you can that's really all i would add to that focus yeah and that's and that's really for
me at least that's kind of the part of the explicit project is this idea of cosmo local
diffusion of innovation and mutual aid and knowledge sharing you know across scales
in physically you know at a bioregional scale but um magnetically uh at much larger scales and so
yeah i think that's great advice um and i think that's that's definitely the direction that
you know i'm trying to help help help guide it good of it yeah um i apologize i'm gonna have to
move us towards wrapping i've just gotta um get the kiddos in in bed here so um kind of coming back
into the the very grounded reality of my uh my life as a as a householder yeah and i'm um i'm
amped that this first thread i mean i think we went a lot of different places but that for my
instinct that that conversation sort of like around embedding our instincts around the aesthetics
and ethics of local action and you know the the importance of relearning you know all of that
stuff but also getting that living edge with the global coordination coordination issues and the
sometimes mind-blowing both ethical and um technological quandaries that we're facing
and just like it's a very rich tension and i really feel like holding that tension
in allowing that to guide our creative agency and the questions that we're asking is just really
really fruitful so i'm super grateful for both of you and the work the thinking that both of you
exhibit so thanks so much for taking the time for the conversation and i'd love to do it again
sometime soon yeah thanks guys thank you both take care
