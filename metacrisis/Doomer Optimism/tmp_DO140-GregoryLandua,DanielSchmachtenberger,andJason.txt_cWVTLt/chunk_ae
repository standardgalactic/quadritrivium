and forth between the the ends and the means yeah okay so first let's when we say warfare we usually
mean actual physical violence so called kinetic warfare but sometimes we can talk about
peacetime where we engage in trade and politics and diplomacy and then wartime where we engage in
bombs but the other way to look at it is a continuum of navigating conflict where you know
bonklausowitz says war is politics by other means which that same statement can be reversed the other
way so in that way you can talk about kinetic warfare in the context of economic warfare
diplomatic warfare cultural warfare information warfare population central warfare and particularly
since the proliferation of things like fifth generation population centric warfare are actually
primary strategies of nation states against each other the clear line of using bombs to attack
each other versus not is really gone so then we're really looking at kind of conflict theory and
and so you can even see that the left and right inside of the us are engaged in a culture war
right and info war and cultural war against each other where each of the last few elections feels
existential to the entire republican system if our guide doesn't win to the other guy
to the other side and so obviously a democracy breaks down if your fellow countrymen are the
enemy are the in existentially terrible enemy that you're at war with there is no kind of common
unity basis but what I and so what you see is that the left will say things that appeal to the left
even if they totally villainize the right because there is no anti incentive in the current
governance system immediately for villainizing the other side and pissing them off because you
you know if you had something like rank choice voting you would actually be disincentivized for
doing that highly polarizing thing because whoever gets voted very last does much worse and so you'd
have an incentive to appeal across the entire space but where the current incentive is mostly
just to appeal to your own side you can do it by villainizing the other but then of course
the other gets existentially scared enough from that that they mount a more powerful and counter
response next time they get elected whatever you did in four years gets undone in the next four years
and whatever strategies of warfare that you learn that were effective they've reverse engineered
made better the next time and so the net result is just an escalation of an arms race and the
escalation of the arms race means the consequences just keep getting worse and worse so if you're
not totally fucking short-sighted you will stop that if you're totally short-sighted you'll say
we'll deal with that later we have to win the selection whatever it takes villainize the other
side tell some lies so long as you can get away with them you know whatever it is but if you
realize that whatever you do that's so important that it's worth doing that in these four years
we'll all get undone in the next ones and you're equipping the other side to be more powerful by
whatever new strategies you figure out that they'll reverse engineer then you calm yourself down a
little bit and say okay not just if I'm going to share a message how do I share a message that
appeals with my intended user base but who's not going to like and agree with this message and how
are they going to respond you've got to think about that so thinking through the long-term failure of
culture war can get someone to stop it and in the same way with kinetic war thinking through
um okay so in an escalating arms race of this on all new exponential technologies where we're
going to weaponize genes specific bio weapons and um autonomous AI weapon systems and this means
that smaller and smaller actors are going to have catastrophic weapons like who the fuck wants to
live in that world and how does anyone deploy that tech and ensure that it doesn't then get
deployed against them so there is a way that anyone who's engaged in war out of necessity can
think through the long-term non viability of that path and start to say is there a better path
if you think that path is viable though you might go for it and I'm not saying in the current world
there is no place for war if you have a group that has been highly conditioned with ethnocentric
genocidal cleansing ideologies and their weaponized and they're willing to move with that you can't
necessarily not engage with that but the question is how to engage with it only in kind of absolute
necessity and orienting towards a case of getting out of that thing and that's actually very tricky
because I don't think you can say let's never physically engage in war I think you just your
ideology will lose but if you're successful at it you usually think about how to keep using that
same success principle so to say how do we use a success principle only when we're necessary well
absolutely leading the thing that made us successful is a type of frame of mind that is necessary but
not common yeah I feel like you're sort of sharing you know it's like Machiavelli's prince this is like
schmockenberger's you know prince 2.0 like if you're going to be a leader these are the things
that you need to think through in order to have a longevity and stability in power is a responsible
not that Machiavelli was necessarily concerned with responsibility but you know game be Machiavelli
yeah game be Machiavelli yeah I think game I think Machiavelli was saying if you want to
be effective at all in protecting your people or engaging in anything like these are principles
that are at play you must understand them but then what we're saying is the ongoing arms race of
everyone employing those principles more effectively in the short term actually ruins everything in the
long term and yet if you don't employ them at all in the short term you'll probably just fail so how
do you not fail in the short term while seeking to change the entire game rather than just continue
to escalate it because winning it doesn't equal winning it forever it equals escalating it yeah
no for sure and I think that that's a that's a that's a really important that sort of like
not losing while changing the game is is a really powerful provocation I think and and I think I
can't help but feel like the simple way of saying what you're saying is we need to appeal to each
other's better angels or we need you know there's it ultimately boils down to sort of like a moral
decision for people in power to choose the long game over the short game that's how I'm
distilling what you're saying in in in very brief so I think that nobody can choose the long game
over the short game as long as any other competitors choosing the short game and the short game choice
gives them enough game theoretic advantage in the near term multipolar trap everybody here knows it
well and so if China was to say okay we're going to price carbon properly because that's important
for the environment but they couldn't ensure that the US and India are going to then they just can't
right and vice versa so you have to be able to create the possibility that for anybody to do that
thing enough people have to buy into it that they're not so disadvantaged by doing the right
long-term thing they're not so disadvantaged in the near term that they're fucked in order to do
that you've got to create very high transparency to see is the other side of actually keeping it
and you have to create some kind of capacity for enforcement associated with that transparency so
I think global multilateralism with high degrees of technologically mediated transparency
satellites etc that allow us to be able to make new agreements that nobody could make on their own
because it would be so competitively disadvantageous and yet everybody has to make I think that's
critical right I think we have to do that and it's going to be really hard because anyone within
that country's population that doesn't understand the criticality of that which will be many will
think it's a terrible idea because the trade-offs affect things that they care about when we start
talking about degrowth which is necessary for the environment anyone who doesn't get that that's
necessary for the environment and thinks that it is some kind of global conspiracy of lizard people
or something will say that degrowth actually means less resources for my family and maybe it
even disproportionately first hits poorer people worse so those like those things really have to
be thought through um and factored but yeah it's not just a moral argument because you like you
can't make the moral choice and lose to the other side that is doing the immoral thing and then have
the immoral thing run the whole world and have that be moral it's not right you so it's a combination
now wait this is important what I was trying to say about infrastructure social structure
superstructure was that the social structure i.e rule of law that can back a monopoly of violence
that can bind any other actor from doing things that we collectively agree or fucked to do
that basis the jurisprudence of the basis of that rule of law plus the adjudication of it
has to be grounded in the will of the people i.e superstructure or culture has to be upstream
from social structure and then your social structure your governance layer has to have the
adequate udaloups i.e the adequate speed and capacity of process to be able to govern that
which it's supposed to govern to be able to regulate that which it's supposed to regulate
because if the private sector and tech can outmaneuver through the combination of lobbying
and campaign finance and better lawyers for loopholes in the law and um first mover advantage
if it can outmaneuver the regulatory process then you basically have broken the regulatory
process and it doesn't meaningfully exist so you've got to ensure that your social structure
employs the same types of information technologies or the cutting edge of information technology
so that it has the udaloups necessary to regulate the field of tech and then its job is to guide,
bind and direct the tech for its life supporting and and yet not not life supporting purposes
its capacity to guide, bind and direct it has to be grounded in the collective values of the people
which is the cultural development which must be at the level of global shared interconnectivity
of identity and values and then the tech doesn't just affect the environment and doesn't just affect
the physicality of the people it affects the value systems of the people because any tech that we
engage with creates patterns of human behavior that end up affecting our experience of the world
so you've got to also think through not just the physical externalities but the psychosocial
externalities that are in turn affecting culture or the superstructure so now we're just describing
what is the long-term world look like and it looks like where everybody understands the
interconnectivity of the world and cares about it and even has their identity reified at that level
I'm not a separate being I'm not just an American or a Christian or whatever I exist because this
whole biosphere exists I wouldn't exist without the plants and the algae and so many other people
that make all the shit that I depend on I'm an emergent property of this whole thing and because
I don't even exist without all the rest of it I can't have an identity that is separate from it
and seek to advantage myself at the cost of it and that's just true right that's just scientifically
ontologically more true so you can't have a value system that is just based on non-reality your
worldview has to be more true which can then also be more ethical so how do you and how do you ensure
that your economic system is not creating perverse incentive that conditions the wrong things
in the value system and how do you ensure that your tech isn't producing psychosocial
externalities i.e smartphones and facebook ruining family attention and things like that
and attention span in general and um hypernormal stimuli so you've got to ensure that if the core
is how do we develop culture or then culture can be turned into governance rule of law etc which
can buy and guide and direct the tech then you have to have a society that's investing in that
where you're ensuring also that social systems and the infrastructure systems the effect that
they have on the culture is in the right direction now i that's at such a fucking high topological
level that it's still hard to get a vision of what does that look like do we have nation states do we
have city states um do we have skyscrapers do we have farmsteads do we have eight billion people
or half a billion people so we could still get into all that but that was the first level of me
wanting to address the question of long-term future of civilization at a criteria level what
must the criteria be yeah i love it you know it's super helpful and as you were describing that
you know sort of like the the worldview that people need to be able to inhabit and you know
sort of like what it what it means to be a citizen a responsible citizen i just got this really deep
i felt a deep sense of gratitude for my relationship with carol sanford specifically
who's been such a leader in creating experiences for people to evolve their epistemology ontology
cosmology through deep kind of spiritual reflection but in the business world or in the world of the
public sector and like that like you can see and i have experience and evolution of that and what it
means to to sort of even grow a capability and capacity to be taking kind of responsibility
at a scale you know it's sort of like what does it take for us to grow our capabilities individuals
to be a part of a society that works and then what do we need to do in order to change that and
just to like ground that for listeners you know and i've heard you and and and jordan talking about
this a little bit um recently in a dialogue that you guys were having maybe with jamie wheel as well
and it just rung to me it's her work sort of like and i don't know if you've been exposed to her
or anybody else has but just you know that lineage of um very rigorous self reflection
and and commitment to engaging with regenerating the systems that were embedded in whether that's
the biosphere or the industry that we're working in or the the local town that we're a part of
and just kind of like growing that capability and how essential that is you know and and how
that's not a tech thing that's a that's a commitment to growing agency and human capability
and capacity so yeah i just just love that and kind of like weaving that into to you know that's
a that's a solid foundation that people could go and engage with i'm i'm looking at the time here
and i'm like i'm so hungry to get to the um you know to the next stage but it's as if
as if it may never happen you know the i feel like there's this elusive um you know world
that daniel holds in his heart that may never you know appear in uh except for maybe around a
campfire or something you know we may never get this recorded so um i i obviously have no idea how
the world is actually going to unfold nor do i know what the right long-term systems look like
in detail but there's a lot more that i have a thoughts on yeah that you have an image of you
have a living that you're sourcing you're like sourcing a living image that's sort of yeah yeah
totally so the future of economic system and the future of governance systems and you know a lot of
things uh we could get into it more depth and i think it would be really fun and also specifically
food systems and water systems and things like that um and i would also really love to
understand a lot more than we got to in this conversation about jason's thoughts on those
things uh but i know we have to wrap and so i also realized that the the conversation was a bit
esoteric a bit meandering and left more threads open than it closed but um i still enjoyed having
the conversation with you guys and uh so thank you for engaging in it yeah no likewise i'm super
grateful for your time daniel and yours uh jason and you know i'm totally down to keep keep digging
in um you know if we can manage our mutually challenging schedules it would be fun to do a
little bit of a series dialogue on some of these especially the future of food i think that'd be
really fun to dig into and talk about in more depth but you know really all of it um well yeah i'm
super grateful maybe i'll just let each of you do a quick closing remark before we close down for the
evening here jason do you want to do you have any uh thoughts reflections uh any anything you want to
leave the audience with as we close out well i just want to thank you guys i thought this was
stimulating for me yeah i guess a couple closing thoughts one you know i think what we're trying
to do with doomer optimism is one it's a recognition so like what you're talking about daniel and all
of these considerations i'm glad that there's people out there that are that are doing this and i
and you know i hope more orders of magnitude more people think in these terms uh and their kind of
responsibility for larger scale systems uh but i also think that a lot of people aren't going to
to do that and i think what we're trying to do with doomer optimism is give people a very kind of
tangible way to rediscover value in their life and tangibility in their life you know by say
starting a homestead maybe that's helping you kick your internet addiction and it's helping you
think more crucially about technology and energy and uh loops and the biosphere and
and because you're not atomized agents uh perhaps you're you know engaged in culture building again
developing relationships and because you're also on the internet some you're you're still
you're not becoming hopefully that's this is my hope not you're not becoming so inward focused
that you know that you become you know either uncaring or ignorant of the larger responsibility
that that that you're a part of and in political economy uh social structure uh i i think that's
well you're you're you're you're placing certain limits on yourself where you're trying to
by localizing right instead of just buying the thing always on amazon which we all do but
and you know trying you know maybe perhaps you could get it locally from a neighbor or in your
county or you could make it yourself right and so and and there's an implicit kind of degrowth
implication of that as well because it's necessarily not as efficient uh if you're not
coming for externalities and so i i'd like to think that the projects are complementary
but maybe they're working on different scales and so i guess i'll leave it there yeah and i think if
again i don't know the audience in your world well but if there were people who felt apathetic
and hopeless about the macro scale of the world and their optimism came from decreasing the scale
of like maybe i do have agency over my own life and maybe over my own local region more and maybe
there is something net positive i can do for the world by at least not being part of or not
