Checking Jim Rutt Show/Currents 030： Daniel Schmachtenberger on The Consilience Project.txt
1. Daniel Schmücker from The Conciliant's Project discusses their mission to enhance the epistemic commons by sharing methods behind their projects, aiming to inspire other media organizations and individuals to innovate in similar ways.

2. They emphasize the importance of moving beyond clickbait and salacious headlines towards long-form, nuanced content that challenges readers' biases and encourages critical thinking.

3. The audience for such content is smaller but meaningful, with the hope that it can influence the nature of demand in media to encourage a "race to the top" rather than a "race to the bottom."

4. The Conciliant's Project also aims to contribute to community building and movement building by identifying and supporting groups working towards improving epistemic capabilities, sense-making, and meaningful discourse.

5. They plan to create forums that encourage deep discussions and good faith discourse with innovative digital architectures that discourage trolling and promote quality interactions.

6. Daniel thanks Jim Rucho for the conversation and encourages listeners to visit The Conciliant's Project website at conciliantsproject.org for more information. Production services and audio editing for the podcast are provided by Jared Janes Consulting, with music by Tom Muller from ModernSpaceMusic.com.

1. **Network Effects and Positive Generative Rules**: The discussion touched upon the concept of network effects where a product or service becomes more valuable as more people use it (positive network effects). The idea is to create a system where following positive generative rules within this network leads to mutual benefit, potentially even for those outside the network.

2. **Early Adopters and Value Orientation**: The conversation highlighted that early adopters, typically A-types, would be attracted to such a system due to its perceived success and well-being potential. Over time, as more people recognize the benefits of the system, others may join, initially just to be around the successful A-types, but eventually as the system proves itself.

3. **Subversive Doctrine**: The proposed system would have a doctrine that is subversive to existing paradigms, but not directly confrontational. This doctrine would be integrated into the ground rules of the network, influencing how members interact and value each other as peers.

4. **Peer Morality in Game B**: A reference to Game B was made, emphasizing the importance of treating every participant within the system as a peer, regardless of other power dynamics. This moral obligation is seen as a powerful way to interact within the system.

5. **Competition vs. Collaboration**: The discussion contrasted traditional competition on narrow metrics with a collaborative approach that values rich creativity and self-actualization. It suggested that such an approach would allow for the coexistence of diverse talents and contributions, where each person's uniqueness is respected and valued.

6. **Protection of the Less Capacitied**: The conversation also touched upon the ethical consideration of how those with higher intelligence or capacity should interact with those who have less. The proposition was made that those with more should act as stewards rather than exploiters of those with less.

7. **Social Values and Codification**: The importance of shaping social values and the economic/social system to encourage protective and steward-like behavior from those with greater capacity was emphasized.

8. **Conclusion**: The discussion concluded with gratitude for the enlightening conversation and a note that much more could be said on the topic. It also mentioned the logistics of production and editing, as well as the music provided by Tom Muller at ModernSpaceMusic.com.

In essence, the conversation explored the potential for creating a social system that leverages network effects, fosters positive interactions, and encourages stewardship among those with greater capacity, all with the aim of enhancing mutual well-being and creativity.

1. **Epistemic Models in Communication**: The conversation highlighted the importance of understanding different epistemic models to assess confidence in claims and to enable learning. The goal is to make these models transparent so that anyone can see how conclusions are reached, thus enhancing one's ability to understand complex topics like Tainter, McLean & Gerard, or Bayesian analysis.

2. **Educational Broadcasting**: The idea was proposed to create educational content that not only informs but also demonstrates the process of understanding and reasoning. This approach aims to increase epistemic capacity in the public, fostering better sense-making abilities and thus more informed civic engagement.

3. **Cultural Shift**: By creating compelling content with high production values, it's hoped that these educational artifacts can compete in the "idea marketplace," pushing back against less well-formed ideas and contributing to a cultural shift towards critical thinking and better dialogue.

4. **Viral Sharing vs. Deep Thinking**: The conversation differentiated between mindless sharing (viral replication) and meaningful engagement with content. It was suggested that the ultimate goal of this initiative would be to move beyond viral replication to foster genuine thought and high-quality dialogue among individuals.

5. **Engagement and Credibility**: A smaller group of people deeply engaged in complex issues can serve as a reference group to help validate the credibility of content for those who consume it rather than actively engage with it.

6. **Progress and Optimism**: The discussion ended on an optimistic note, looking forward to the potential impact of such initiatives in regulating the credibility of information and facilitating better understanding of complex issues in a polarized media landscape.

7. **Wrap-Up**: The hosts expressed gratitude for the conversation and the shared platform for sense-making and learning. They emphasized that such discussions are always valuable, especially with thinkers like Daniel.

8. **Production Credits**: The episode was wrapped up with a reminder of the production services and audio editing by Jared Janes Consulting and the music provided by Tom Muller at Modern Space Music.
