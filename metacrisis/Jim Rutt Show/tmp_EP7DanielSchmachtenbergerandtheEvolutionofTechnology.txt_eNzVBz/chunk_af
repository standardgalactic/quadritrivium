in the same way. So that's one big part of it. And the other part of it is, you know,
you and I had a conversation the other day, Jim, where you said something and you and I are just
getting to know each other. And I like I instantly loved you because of it, because you said anyone
who would abuse people with a below 90 IQ, I want to beat their head in with a baseball bat or
something like that. And that you wanted to see that those who have more intelligence are actually
protective of rather than exploiting of those who couldn't compete. So then the question is what made
you that way? And how do we create social systems where to the extent that anyone has obviously
increased capacity over anyone else, they're actually oriented to steward everyone else rather
than use that in an exploitive way. And I think this is conditionable both at the level of social
values and at the level of the way values are codified in a value equation, i.e. the economics
and the social system. Wow, I think we should wrap it here. We could go on for three more hours,
but I'd like to thank you for our amazingly interesting conversation. This was a delight.
