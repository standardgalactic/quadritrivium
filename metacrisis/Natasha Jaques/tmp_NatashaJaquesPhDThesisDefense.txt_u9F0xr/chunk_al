like not that Maya models are at all doing this,
but put yourself in the place of someone else
and do that perspective taking,
trying to model their intentions
and trying to coordinate with them on that level.
And basically also sensing that using affective signals
as a way to update and understand
what they're really trying to communicate
or what they're really trying to do.
Okay, I know there's still a lot more questions,
but maybe you'll get time to catch Natasha
in what will hopefully, I think,
pretty clearly be a celebration afterwards.
Thank you so much, Natasha, for a fabulous presentation.
There's going to be ice cream.
There's going to be ice cream.
It will be in the affective computing area back there.
