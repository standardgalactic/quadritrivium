Processing Overview for Karl Fant
============================
Checking Karl Fant/Null convention logic, flow computing first principles.txt
1. The initial distinction between combinational logic, registration stages (handshake mechanisms), and control structures such as clocks and handshakes in digital circuits becomes blurred when considering a network of linked oscillations.

2. In this perspective, every gate in the circuit performs multiple functions—flow control, memory storage, and combinational logic—and these functions are intertwined without clear-cut boundaries.

3. The emphasis shifts from separate components to the integrated behavior of the entire network, where the fundamental element is a linked oscillation that permeates all aspects of the circuit's operation.

4. Two circuits shown in the conversation perform the same combinational function and have identical input/output boundaries but differ in their granularity or throughput due to the period of their linked oscillations (20 gate delays for one, 6 gate delays for the other).

5. The first circuit has a longer oscillation period, allowing for data inputs less frequently compared to the second circuit with a shorter oscillation period, which can accept new data inputs every 6 gate delays, running almost three times as fast.

6. Both circuits operate on purely logical relationships without relying on external timekeeping, delay lines, or additional control mechanisms. They behave autonomously based solely on their own logical structures.

7. The discussion sets the stage for future conversations that will explore the construction of a risk processor using networks of linked oscillations.

8. The materials from this conversation can be found for review and further study at curlfant.net slash ytvideo.
