can happen simultaneously independent of each other, which things have to happen subsequently
because they depend upon the results of previous set of action and how do we allocate the total
amount of resources we have to each area in light of how that maximizes the systemic movement
and what are the best practices and best strategies for the utilization of that resource in each
area and all this comes together to do critical path.
Now when we're looking at the critical path for humanity's success, it's a dynamic critical
path because the here point is continuously changing as our global problems and global
needs change and this can happen in uncredicted ways all the time and a new earthquake occurs
and now we need to be able to look at oh resource needs allocated to dealing with that and that
means resources being taken from somewhere else and yet we still have all of our comprehensive
goals, how do we really optimize that process? So we have a continuously changing here point
and a continuously changing there point as new technologies emerge and new social understandings
emerge to where what the best of what's possible for societal design is keeps changing and so how
do we elastically upgrade and update our critical path with the input of all new relevant information
to where we know what we need to be doing now that is most effective towards the most long range
goals and all of our timely goals and that what we're doing now is continuously optimized in
light of the input of all new real information and so this requires a lot of complexity factoring
and so this is another thing we've looked at which is how do we see how a particular problem
relates to problems in other areas and potentially unanticipated ways when we only take a specialist
approach and how does a particular solution there end up affecting other areas because we can see
sometimes in solving a particular problem in a particular way we can actually externalize harm
to another area unanticipatedly like for instance when we were working to get off of foreign oil
by creating biofuels but in the process creating biofuels from agricultural sources that created
environmental damage we want we want to be able to make sure that as we're solving a particular
problem we're not externalizing that harm somewhere else so this requires a cross-sectoral analysis
and to have a functional cross-sectoral analysis we make sure that we're looking at all the other
sectors appropriately we need to know what all the sectors are this requires a taxonomy of
all of the issues that we're looking at and how they all interrelate to each other
and then how our goal is to be able to have solutions that are both optimized for their
particular area of focus and optimized for the systemic benefit when we factor all of the externalized
positives and negatives and this overall factoring all of our current problems and areas of need
and the timelines and the interconnections and the scope and the magnitude on all of that factoring
all the resources we have to work with factoring all the potential strategies and the way of
synthesizing those strategies and how those strategies interact each other and looking at
where we're wanting to go and what about that we know and it's clear what about that is not yet
clear that needs um refinement and experimentation uh to really be able to know where we want to go
in light of the most comprehensive kinds of metrics of what quality of life really means
and being able to optimize how we get from here to there continuously and recognizing there's no
fixed their point it's a continuously evolving uh progressive there this whole process of how
we collectively make decisions and how we and how we collectively allocate resource in a scientifically
optimized way creates the basis for a planetary operating system and a new system of global
governance and economics which is how do we as a conscious species recognizing that we're profoundly
interconnected that all of our needs and that all of our problems that all of our welfare is
profoundly interconnected not just with other humans in our area but with all other humans and
with all other species and not just now but ongoingly recognizing that how do we organize
all of our efforts and intentions and endeavors in specific areas in light of a whole meta endeavor
in an optimized way and this really is what appeals to us as not a another project amongst the
many projects but an organizational system that can potentiate and maximize the efficiency of
and the interconnected strategy between all projects all positive endeavors that need to be
happening and that's ultimately what our goal is here is a meta system for global governance and
organization of all evolutionary human activity in the broadest sense the direction of evolution
is ordering complexity higher orders of complexity which is two things it's more parts that are
involved more complexity and ordering that if we get a more complex system without adequate order
we end up just getting more entropy and it degrades to the last level and so if we look at
a cell a cell has all of the complexity of the component molecules that make it up but they're
arranged in a particular way that if we just had all of the molecules that make up a cell thrown in
a petri dish it wouldn't be a cell it would just be a heap of molecules it wouldn't be that interesting
when you arrange it when you order it that togetherness is what allows the cell to respirate
and to replicate even though none of the parts on their own do that and those emergent properties
come from ordering the parts into a whole and you know we can look at the same way in terms of a
nervous system and no neuron by itself thinks or feels it has a particular firing pattern but when
you order the firing pattern of all those neurons together in the way that a human brain and nervous
system works you get sentience and you get inus and consciousness well in the same way we have
as all of the many neurons are connected in our brain to create human consciousness and all of the
cells are connected in a particular pattern to create a human organism we have all of these cells
of human beings on this planet that when they're not ordered is basically just like a whole bunch
of cells separately which is not that interesting but when their activities are ordered together in
light of a higher order then humanity as an as an organism of sorts actually gets to emerge and
there are emergent properties that get to arise from that and what we're looking at creating here
with this global operating system is kind of a network for being able to take the database
inside of each human and be able to to take what everybody knows to be able to vet it and synthesize
it into a collected database that is ever evolving of the best of what humanity knows
about everything so far that is both able to be fed into by all people and fed out the relevant
parts to all people for maximizing our collective engagement organization and activity and so
rather than just being a bunch of separate neurons there's actually a nervous system
and a consciousness rather than just being a bunch of separate human individuals there's actually
humanity as not just a concept but really a functional entity
