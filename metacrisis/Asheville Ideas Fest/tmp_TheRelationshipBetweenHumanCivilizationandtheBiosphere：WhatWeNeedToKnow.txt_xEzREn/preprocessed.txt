Our final, not our final program for the week, but our final panel for the week is up next.
And we're going to be talking about the environmental impacts.
We're going to be talking about how to mitigate those environmental impacts.
And one familiar face is folks joining me on the stage here, Daniel Schmockenberger,
whom we all heard from yesterday, Joey Owl from the Cherokee Nation, and they're going
to introduce themselves and Nate Higgins.
Welcome to the stage for Asheville Ideas Fest, gentlemen.
All right, welcome, everybody, good to see you.
This panel is on the relationship between human civilization and the biosphere and what
we need to know about it.
We're going to try to address the totality of that topic in 45 minutes.
I am going to serve as moderator.
I spoke on other things yesterday, and both of these gentlemen have so much valuable things
to share.
My name is Daniel.
I'm with Civilization Research Initiative.
We actually just recently moved to the area and are meeting people, and it's been a delight
to start meeting people here.
And I'm really honored to just get to meet Joey for the first time, and I'm looking forward
to meeting more since we are here on lands that were attended by the people that were
here for 13,000 years previously.
And Joey Owl serves as the Secretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources for the Eastern Band
of Cherokee Indians here, which is a super important perspective.
He's going to be speaking.
And then we also have Nate Hagins, who flew in for this from Wisconsin.
And Nate is someone I know very well, a friend, colleague, and he's going to speak first.
Nate's background is both in global finance and in environmental science, specifically
planetary boundaries, kind of the biophysical, geophysical limits of the planet, and very
heavily in the relationship between the energy systems and the financial system, and probably
of all the environmental issues that everybody in here is aware of from deforestation and
overfishing and pollution issues.
Climate change is the one that gets the most attention.
Climate change is obviously related heavily to our energy systems.
And it might be that climate change is actually not the most important feature of the environmental
consequence of our energy systems.
And I think that will be where Nate gets us started today.
You want to try in 10 minutes to summarize the relationship between finance, energy,
and the ecosystem.
Thank you.
Thank you all for being here.
Yeah, I've actually spent 20 years assembling this story because we live as part of a system.
And a lot of the experts on TV are experts in one thing, like chemistry or nuclear engineering
or apartment development.
But we live as part of a system, and the parts and the processes do fit together.
The human ecosystem is that we combine energy and materials with technology for everything
in our world.
We develop products.
We measure their value by dollars or euros.
And we do this all in a growing system to give us the same neurotransmitters of our ancestors
and the whole thing produces waste.
One of the core things that I've discovered, and I have a master's from the University
of Chicago in finance, they never mentioned the word energy once.
And our culture is energy blind in what energy does for our current lifestyles and for our
future expectations in three core ways.
First of all, energy is the currency of life, and it also enables human aspirations and
human lifestyles.
Every single good in the world that contributes to GDP needs energy to invent, to extract,
to manufacture, to deliver, to maintain, to run, to repair, and to dispose of.
The correlation between energy and GDP, which is the size of our economy, or GWP, which
is the size of the global economy, is 0.99.
If we're going to grow our economy, we need to have energy.
But what we're living off of the majority is ancient carbon in the form of coal, oil,
and natural gas.
One barrel of oil, which it costs $70, does the same amount of work as me or any other
anyone in this room working for five years.
So the average, the human economy now, every year we use 100 billion barrel of oil equivalents
of coal, oil, and natural gas.
If you do the math of that, we have the labor equivalent of 500 billion human workers helping
the 5 billion or so real human workers.
And so we are blind to this reality of how energy underpins our society.
We just look at technology and money.
The second reason we're blind is we're treating this as if it were interest, as if it were
repeatable every year.
And during our lifetimes, it has been.
For the last 130 years, with the exception of COVID, with the exception of the great
financial crisis 2009, a couple years in the 1970s and the Great Depression, we have had
more and more access to energy every single year as the United States and as a global
culture.
But we have used all the good stuff.
The only region in the world that's growing oil production right now is the Permian Basin,
the only shale basin left that's growing.
So right now, if the United States stopped drilling, our oil production would drop 40%
in the first year, another 25% the year after.
We have to run faster and faster just to stay in place.
We've used all the good stuff.
Yes, technology has helped, but what technology has done is built a bigger straw.
And the straw still is sucking out hydrocarbons, but we're that much closer to the slurping
sound.
So the second part of energy blindness is we are treating this depleting resource as
if it were forever.
And we are all alive during the carbon pulse, which is the 200-year, 300-year timeframe
where humans are drawing down this ancient carbon bank account to support our economies.
The third area that we're energy blind on is that we don't understand energy fungibility
or energy properties.
Let's just build this solar panel to replace all this oil.
And solar, wind, geothermal, these are all very mature, great technologies, but they're
not going to replace the energy-dense liquid at room temperatures, transportable oil that
powers the world economy.
There are differences between kinetic and potential energy.
Kinetic is there's electrons that are moving and you have to use them when they're available.
Potential energy is it's stored.
You can store it until you want to burn it or turn it on.
So there's a quality difference.
Now how does this all fit into the economic system and the environment?
Humans today, living in our culture, we self-organize as families, as small businesses, as corporations,
as nation-states to maximize profits.
That is our cultural goal.
And those profits are 99% tethered to energy, which is 84% tethered to carbon energy.
So the pollution ends up being two types.
One is we have created a metabolic structure as a global human society.
There are no billionaires or secret cabal of sinister humans or politicians that are
in control of this.
We create money effectively out of thin air.
When money is created in a bank, it is not lent from existing capital, it's lent into
existence with reference to underlying trees, dolphins, oil, copper.
The same amount of those things existed before the money was created.
So what ends up happening is we have this imperative to grow because when money is created,
the interest is not created.
So the entire global system has to grow.
And so the two environmental impacts are, number one, there's a metabolism that is squeezing
out the rest of nature.
You all are aware of the impacts of climate change, 90% of the heat has gone into the
ocean, but there are other impacts as well.
Since I was born in the late 1960s, we've lost 70% of the populations on earth of insects,
animals, amphibians, and fish, and birds.
What a horrible thing to say in such a sacred, natural setting as Asheville.
The United States doing much better than the rest of the world.
So the two impacts on the environment are the metabolism, which can't easily change
if we just swap out solar panels.
We're going to have to change our aspirations.
What does it mean to be successful as a culture, as a species?
We're going to have to change our price signals because we're basically paying just the cost
of extraction, not the value of this stuff that is indistinguishable from magic on human
time scales for what it does for us.
The average American consumes in our body around 2,500 calories a day, but we consume
a hundred times that in our metabolic footprint of the lights and the air travel and the hospitals
and the NASCAR and all that stuff.
So we don't need all that energy to be happy or healthy, but we're on this like treadmill
where we're comparing ourselves to others by the pecuniary metrics of our time.
So this system ultimately to be more sustainable, we have to look at how can we get our evolutionary
neurotransmitters of dopamine and serotonin and oxytocin and all the rest by using less
energy and materials.
And that's the challenge.
And I think we are the first generation of 300,000 years of our species to be able to
understand how we got here, what we're doing, who we are, what we really need, and what
the natural resource balance sheet is.
So maybe that was a 10-minute summary of a much larger story.
Thank you.
You actually did that in like eight, which was amazing.
I have more.
We'll get there.
So I will just say the topic of peak oil, which was partially true and partially immature
topic has matured a lot in the kind of geobiophysics domain and Nate played a massive role in the
maturation of that.
You can see a project that he used to run called the oil drum that really advanced the
whole understanding of hydrocarbon energy and new energy systems.
He has a podcast now called The Great Simplification, where he brings on people that have expertise
in all of the kind of environmental and related domains.
And I will say, because we live in a time where it's so hard to tell what is true because
people think the exact opposite about almost everything, the claims that he's making
about the energy system, its relationship with the environment, finance the unsustainability
and what has to change are extremely well vetted across the people who disagree the most.
So go on there and check it out, The Great Simplification.
And since a lot of it is very deep, he did make some amazing animations to start where
you can get a good overview.
So thank you, Nate.
And we have 12 hours of recording with Daniel and I, if you're interested.
So now Nate's talking about fundamentally a human civilization system, mostly post-industrial
revolution that is consuming the biosphere upon which it depends in a process of self-terminating.
And one of the things I'm so interested in this conversation about is that Joey works
with and is from a group of people that had a sustainable civilization for a long time
that didn't depend on oil and didn't depend on a lot of aspects of 100 times the extra
somatic calories per day with exponential growth tied to an interest system.
There's a lot of conversation around are there things about indigenous wisdom that created
sustainability over the course of thousands or tens of thousands of years that are relevant
to our modern globalized high-tech world that could teach us how to live more sustainably.
He has a background in sustainable agriculture and earth sciences and I'm really curious
to hear if you're thinking about the, I mean it might even be hard for you to call this
global western thing civilization, but if you're thinking about the thing we call global
civilization and its relationship to the biosphere, what are the things that come to your mind
as some of the most important things for people to think about that they don't think about
clearly?
I appreciate you setting that up because I wanted to hit on something that Nate started
with.
Thank you for the invitation.
It's an honor to be here.
Shio, Nogada, Nole, Deji Adani, Lunga, hello everyone and welcome.
What Nate said was looking at the systems and how everything is interconnected.
When you look at indigenous wisdom and practices, that is what our ancestors practiced and understood
was that whether you're looking at animals, human interaction, plants, ocean, air, all
the environment and biosphere, it was all interconnected and influenced one another.
With colonization and Europeans discovering America in the 1400s, we immediately started
to adopt some of those practices of western implications to our culture and our systems
that started to degrade over the years, but we took metal tools and began to make new
materials into different baskets that we didn't have the ability to.
For example, we could break river cane down with natural materials, but we needed metal
to make white oak baskets.
When you look at, and I'm just a young person from Cherokee and I'm 34 years old and I'm
still learning a lot about what our indigenous culture and our ancestors and that knowledge
that they had because the government set out to assimilate indigenous cultures and they've
done a real good job at it.
It's just taking generation after generation to really get to the destruction of language
and practices.
With our tribe, Eastern Metham Cherokee in Western North Carolina, we're just one of
577 federally recognized tribes that are, particularly from a youthful generation, wanting to learn
from our elders and our seniors that still have the knowledge, the language, the wisdom
and the practices and reincorporate that into what's also being called today traditional
ecological knowledge and there's a bit of a debate in our communities, do we even call
it traditional ecological knowledge?
We're taking our practices and so for example we've been working with the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park on one plant permitting to say we're going to go demonstrate that our harvesting
techniques are sustainable and that is through different research projects and different methodologies
I'm cutting and saying well this is, we're proving what we've always known.
We have to prove this to the Western world, we have to prove this to the federal agencies
and everybody else is that the way we lived, and I can't always say in harmony because
there's some really good authors out there that have demonstrated cultures destroying
themselves through soil and over consumption of products and animals, but we're having
to prove our way as being self-sustaining and efficient, whether we're harvesting wild
greens and edibles or the way we interacted with our environment and just keep in mind
when you look at these mountains of Western North Carolina and any region across the nation
here, these mountains are not what they look like 130 years ago and so for example Chestnut
and Chestnut Bly and over forestry, I'm sorry, deforestation in the late 19th century or
the 20th century, you would have had a different stand in that across the mountains, the Chestnuts
had a vast range across the Appalachians from North Georgia all the way to Maine and so
we're getting around to a project with the American Chestnut Foundation trying to re-establish
the Chestnut, but that's going to be 2,200 years in the making based on that range so
we're going to have to plan and forecast out that what we're doing now and what we aim
to achieve is going to be something that we aim to do beyond our own lifetime, the things
that we're doing now, how are they going to impact that seven generations out?
And so I was discussing with Daniel, what does that seven generations mean for a culture
and just for society and civilization in general? Well if you have a community that starts making
babies around 20 years old and you're looking at 140 years old, if it's 30 years old you're
looking at 210 years old. So we've kind of developed this spot and working through our
tribe and in the division of agricultural natural resources that well now we have a target,
what practices and things are we going to prioritize now that are going to have impacts
to our future generations at about 140 and 210 years. But I also like to pair up this
conversation with what we're having now and as part of our work that we're doing is, you
know, one, what is our purpose of and for as a species on the planet? And then the second
question is where do we see ourselves in a thousand years? Because with what Nate queued up there
in terms of our consumption of resources centered on fossil fuels and currently everything that
centers around how we operate, I think we could get a little hopeless saying I don't know if we're
going to be able to enjoy or future generations are going to be able to enjoy what we have now
you know, much less probably in 140 to 210 years, but in a thousand years
who knows where we're going to go with technological advancements and all the
discussion with AI that's going on right now. And so, you know, from my community and I just
came back from Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe up near your neck of the woods, you know, I got
tribes and indigenous folks are at a point to where we know that the knowledge that we
are looking to capture within our own communities can be shared within the other indigenous
communities. We're working with the federal government to demand that there is accountability
for treaty rights that were guaranteed over the last several hundred years and treaties that were
developed and that when we're looking at the area that we're in now and we're one of the few tribes
that we can say we're truly fortunate to be on our ancestral homelands. There's not a lot of
tribes that can say that and so where we are at now and between language and culture and our
resources is that there's a road what feels like a renaissance for indigenous communities and cultures
to then really driven by young folks reaching out to our elder peers and our elder family
members just calling for that knowledge, wanting to capture that knowledge and then to practice it
out. And when you look at what I've learned in my short time on this earth, when you look at some
of the principles that folks espouse from our old generation, you know, one is of course many folks
are very spiritual whether that's in a traditional Christian sense or in a indigenous spiritual sense
and a lot of people pray to the creator called Aguidodha, Aguidodhu, Grandpa or Father, you know,
being spiritual and realizing again those everything is connected and that where we at is a blessing
that was provided by the creator in the various levels of his existence. And then the other component
is looking at our resources in the way we interact with both plants and animals and waterways. You
know, it's all relatives. You know, look at some of the indigenous communities in New Zealand who've
got a river named and given rights so that that river, I forgot the name of the river in New Zealand,
but it has the same rights as a human being. And that's where that when we take a step back, pause,
slow down, you know, how can indigenous knowledge be applied to our daily ways of life now that
what I really look at is we've got to slow down and really take a minute to think about what our
daily activities are doing to the planet and for future generations. And two is to really say, you
know, there is something of benefit to go back and look at the way we were living and saying that
is could be better than the way we're living now. Thank you. One of the many reasons we actually
decided to move to Asheville, even though this was we hadn't got to meet anybody in the eastern
band, I was just hearing that the native tribe here was one of the only ones in the whole country
that was still where they had been before colonizers came, meaning that they have some relationship to
the local flora and fauna and geography and like how impossible it is, even if you're a native person,
to have your intact wisdom after forced migration, right, after cultural assimilation and genocide,
but also where you're just not even in the world that you evolved with. And I'm really excited
to get to learn because it's such an incredible thing to get to have so close access to people that
know that. I have a question for you before, a question for both of you is I have some friends
that are have learned like yourself, cultural anthropology or whatever western thing they
needed to learn for credibility but also have indigenous training and the translation and
possibility they describe as being infuriating. You were talking about how we proved to western
science that we can do this one plant sustainably where an ancient process you would have never
focused on one plant separate from everything else. Tyson Young Caporta who wrote Sand Talk,
how indigenous wisdom can save the world is a very good friend and he was telling me is like,
we didn't say one herb was good for one thing because depending upon how the season went it
might not even have those properties like if the fish eat enough of the other thing. So
we didn't even have a cannon of it. We had a sensing into what was happening. Can you talk
a little bit about some things you know that are really where the nature of the assumption
space we have the nature of the mind or language makes it hard to even translate what you would
want to translate? Yeah, that's something we're involved in a couple of projects. One with
we're developing a climate change action plan and in partnership with North Carolina State
University. We're also again as I mentioned involved with the American Chestnut Foundation
and then we're also involved with another group called the Rights and Resources Institute and
we're trying to the crux of what we're doing right now is is knowledge capturing and you know I had
a great grandma who was a fluent speaker and I learned that I had to talk about in her mind
was starting to slip by the time we you know I wasn't in her home learning you know learning
the language I wasn't forced to be there and you know for whatever reason when I became in
college and started to discover my individuality I was trying to speak with her and learn the
language even more and we learned some but more folks had families who were conversational than
what my family was and so what I learned with her was you know as her mind was slip and one topic
she always lived to talk about was boarding school and so I had to bring up boarding school
to get her to feel comfortable speaking Cherokee with me and then that's when some that conversation
went and so to tie that into where we're at now with this knowledge capturing of fluent elder
speakers to hear them talk about Cherokee language and getting an answer to a specific question
related to resources or to a concept as opposed to learning about it in English they'll say you
know I'll have six different ways to say one word or I could phrase this differently and then
if you come to me next week I may my mind my mind is my mindset is going to influence the way I
would tell you how I've interpreted that which does make it difficult difficult to learn the language
but then I again I'm just trying to get out of that whole my own mindset of hey I need answers we've
got to do this now it's important you have the knowledge give it to us you know we got it there's
there's a there's a level of respect that you have to approach you know we got 150 fluent speakers
left 148 Cherokee nation has about 1200 you know united gadooban has several hundred
and so we're at a crisis state a point of crisis with our language because the way
language is used to describe things in Cherokee is going is a tale of of how we viewed the world
and and the way those words would have been arranged or the way a specific word would have been used
to describe something and you know you're not having to speak a lot of Cherokee because I'm
still learning and I'm still not comfortable speaking in public but you know to learn from
these folks and to really set take to stand back in our groups to gain that respect and to learn
that that wisdom is very interesting in particular on the projects that we're working on now and so
we're again we're putting a lot on our elders who we're they're being pulled in natural resources
environment that's just one area there's a lot that are just focused on language so you know we
think we think we're busy but you only have 140 speakers maybe 80 or involved or engaged in our
community and we're pulling at them every which way because it we were as a young generation
we're dying to know what they know and then how to translate that into modern terms and how can
it be preserved and used and more importantly passed down to their next generation like like my
daughter who's three years old so it's tough when you mentioned the number of native speakers it's
so heartbreaking because it's an endangered species it's so and it's an endangered species that
encodes so much wisdom about how to live here I had a I had a teacher that cultural anthropology
teacher who would be like maybe 120 now had if he was still alive and he was one of the last
people to go encounter a bunch of tribes that hadn't had western civilization at all and he
was studying the language with translators and looking at language as a function or language
in relationship to violence he was meeting some of the Polynesian Fijian South American people and
he said one of the most obvious things that he noted was that the least violent cultures had
the least prevalence in their language of first person possessive the word mine many of them
didn't even have a word mine they only had ours and it didn't even mean possessive them in stewardship
like they wouldn't even have a word resources because they don't talk about natural resources as
it's like no those are the buffalo people they're not resources for us there and so like we have
so much violent insanity coded into our language which then creates the world that Nate's talking
about so when I the question I want to ask you both is think about what was it like to be Cherokee
were any of the native people here who had been here for at least tens of thousands of years
before a warring culture came into kill 110 million of them did they feel like it was in times you
know like and similarly if it's a different story but if we go back what did it feel like in Rome
right before Rome collapsed or the Egyptian Empire the Mayan or and we look at that all previous
civilizations collapsed this is the first time we have a fully globalized civilization with global
supply chains making everything that we use take six continents to produce and it's also in the
process of collapsing is this a lot like what it would have felt like in Rome right before it
collapsed or and when you think about that it's seriously I don't hear that no I mean I really
do think about when Nate's saying we have an exponential financial system and it's perfectly
coupled nearly perfectly coupled 0.99 to energy which means you have to extract exponentially
more every year it's crazy to think that's possible and yet we can't stop it what would it take to
stop it so I guess what I want to ask you both is what if we are seeing that we're actually maybe
near the end of civilization as we know it what would it take like what about it is most unsustainable
what ideas have we acclimated to that are the craziest what would it take to change it like
share some thoughts well we've financialized the human experience which is why the indigenous
wisdom in the language we we just parse things into dollars that's been our success metric
I actually don't think the average person thinks we're headed for collapse I think the
yes we're exponentially creating money and our resources are doing this so the gap between them
is shifting but I think emotionally psychologically the way the media is the way the central banks
are the way the government is is they're papering over all these problems with artificial guarantees
and interest rates and quantitative easing and these things and we don't really have authentic
media anymore telling these deep stories so I think the average person is disconnected from what
you've just said but people paying attention no this is this is real if we grow at 3% a year which
is what every government and corporation in the world ostensibly expects we will double the
amount of energy and materials that the whole world uses in the next 30 years and we will double it
again in the 30 years after that so if you have a teenage child or grandchild by the time they're
in their 70s we will have quadrupled the scale of energy materials on the planet is that possible
is that desirable I no longer think the next doubling will happen so what happens in in lieu of
that personally I think we will kick every can possible we will change the rules we will print
money to forestall this moment which I call the great simplification and there's a there's
a dual reason for that for many of us a simpler life would be something that's healthier and
probably better for us but there's an academic reason too which is historically humans have
solved problems by adding complexity and complexity requires more energy more nodes in a supply chain
more vectors of of roads and things like that so we've all lived during this time of greater and
greater complexity but if we don't have the energy to sustain that we're going to need to simplify
we're going to need to reduce complexity so those scout team humans that are hearing this
if you really understand that our society is unlikely to conserve or leave the carbon in the
ground until there's a crisis it it emotionally empowers you to simplify first and beat the rush
from a cultural standpoint we're going to need new aspirations does more and more GDP and income
really make us happier and healthier and you have to look at the distribution of 60 or so of the
people aren't benefiting from this exponential growth what are our aspirations ask yourself
what are the 10 things in your life that bring you joy well for me it's playing with my chickens
my dogs planting and tending my garden seeing a forest like coming into ashville I saw a bobcat
this morning uh like these are the things that bring me joy or working closely with another
human being on something important if you think about all these things very few of them require
a lot of energy and resources but we're in this social trap that our culture is telling us this
is what we need to do so I think we need top down and bottom up bottom up we need humans
reconnecting with their indigeneity I mean I will never be a Native American but I have a
feeling deep in me what's right and wrong and what's sacred and what the right things are to do and
how to live with the land that I reside on and to reconnect with that feeling that's been lost in
this Monty Hall Las Vegas smorgasbord culture that we live in and then you know pass the baton to
others start having community conversations start finding the scout team in in ashville or whatever
black mountain or wherever you live and from the top down this is all going to rely on governance
and our governance model is kind of broken right now and we're going to need a different leadership
and we're going to probably need to change the prices because we're paying fractions of a penny
for the things that are supporting our our life if we were to maybe tax not only carbon but but
copper and fossil water aquifers and aluminum and things that are depleting millions of times
faster than mother and natures you know built them up that would make us conserve it would
make us innovate because it would send the right the right signals to corporations and companies
that this oil is going to be $500 a barrel instead of 70 because that's a more appropriate long-term
price it's going to mean that things are more expensive it's going to mean that we can't consume
as much but if most of the best things in life are free that's kind of the the the pathway we have
to navigate i'll stop there yeah i'll jump on there because one of the things that i have we
i'd like to have in our discussions within our team and our tribe and our community members and
when we're out and about engagement with other tribes again going back to that question and what
is our purpose and we look at westeros the size and where we're at you know it's pretty i've came
up with a sad answer you know it's to get up and make money to get up and make money every day
because anything and everything we do currently requires money whether you're paying for fossil
fuels whether you're paying for your power bill food your household needs family gifts whatever
you want to do our existence is centered around currency and making it and be able to pay someone
else or some corporation or something for that service or that need or that want and where conversations
are happening in our community is getting back to more of a local level of looking at the natural
resources that we have and how can we better manage those for today's needs while also making
you know trying to provide that guarantee for ourselves now for the future generations and
it's it's difficult i was at a native american climate change conference a couple years ago
i was sitting around with 12 other folks i was one of three males breast and female
and i suppose a question does anybody have kids here and i went no and i said well why not so
what are we talking about it's pretty bleak and hopeful you know hopeless that we're you know
we're here discussing climate change and it all centered around our individual choices and a decision
making moving forward and that you know can we really can we really make those tough decisions now
to reduce our consumption to be more conserved in how we're extracting resources and moving forward
you know i got a three-year-old three-year-old girl named color kawaii in cherokee coffee because
we love coffee with joella and you know i'll look at her now and i'm just like what did we do but
she's here other kids are here we have to now take these opportunities even even more seriously
about making sure every home has a community garden a raised bed or you are operating on a
community garden or that if you have some forested landscape look at the species distribution of what's
there maybe cut some out and then plant a nut bearing tree um do you have water resources and
how are you going to utilize that on your own uh your own land and then to the concept of what's
what's my land um and what is shared land um and so you know those discussions are going on and
and there's uh in our community it's funny i always when i talk with some some uh when i talk
with elected politicians uh and i start pointing out how we utilize gaming revenue for example
to fund the tribe or senior services or education department or my division public health operations
and all that they're like that's really great good for you all but then as i apply that to the
broader politics of the nation it sounds like socialism but i always call it tribalism it's
just it's just tribalism we take our resources we're taking care of our young and our old and
everybody and in between because we are reliant on our elder population for that knowledge and that
wisdom we have to take care and foster our youth as they're growing up and nourish them and and
provide them the best environment for for learning um and then as our family units you know we're
engaged in cultural activities and community activities that provide that and that enriching
environment that makes life perspective like okay these are the simple things that i think a lot of
folks can again step back take a breath slow down and say okay what is important to me in my daily
daily life i have a question for you before a final question um so since the eastern band of
Cherokee is right here just proximal to Asheville and since a lot of the people who are here in
Asheville uh i'm curious both sides of if people want to learn more about Cherokee knowledge wisdom
ideas how they might portend things for how to tend to this ecosystem watershed by a region um
and on the other side if there are things that uh that Cherokee people here need help with that local
people could help is there some way bi-directionally that people can follow up interface it's funny we
look at how history is taught and what is express course you know the old adage history is written
by the winners but we're now at a point to where we're claiming ourselves to be winner we're gonna
write our own future and research our own history and rewrite the history as we see it based on
what is available um it's something that relationship building first takes that takes an
introduction but most importantly it takes trust and you know we get approached by institutions
academic institutions organizations that hey we want to work with you we're gonna write this grant
can we get that letter of support and we're really sitting back and saying well let's vet this out
what what is good for us if you're if you're coming to work with us what research do you get out of it
do we get to own that data because we're not going to sign an agreement without saying that data belongs
to us uh because it's far too often and you know Cherokee's one of the most research tribes in in
American history that that we have researchers who come in and it's happened to us within the last
decade that they'll do a research project on wildlife or culture uh get out uh complete their
research and then we'll never hear from them again you know and so you know we have a CRRB
process in place to try to help protect what knowledge is shared how it's captured and again
who has ownership of of that knowledge so for folks here in Asheville that when you look at the
the history of what how Asheville came about or the lands that they're on or you know just that
50 miles west of here you got the you know say Eastern it'll say welcome to the Cherokee Union
Reservation it's actually called the Kuala Boundary you know there's some nuances that you're going
to have to really dive into various resources whether that's the Cherokee Indian Museum or
going to community events which you know I'm getting those aren't necessarily open you're going to
find somebody you're going to be deliberate and searching out and reaching out to you know human
resources individualism and foster relationship and build it on trust yeah
so given that um I guess one thought I want to share with everyone is uh world views have
core ideas and then have protector ideas that keep you from not questioning that idea you'll
burn in hell if you don't believe this idea and if you question any if any other ideas come in
whatever capitalism is very similar someone says there's a problem with money or they question
capitalism instantly it means they're a terrible communist Marxist don't you realize how bad that
is don't don't you know that capitalism has made everything better don't you realize that
Stalin killed 50 million people okay so we're not talking about Marxism we are saying that
capitalism is a relatively new thing to human society and that western European human society
coming here killed 100 million people that were here that were not savages being civilized
that were arguably more civilized in some ways so when we're saying there might be some unsustainable
things about the monetization of everything and the capital system that doesn't mean it
instantly is defaulting to some previous thing it might be we have to innovate new social technologies
we never had eight billion people with highly advanced technology that could over fish the
entire oceans with nuclear bombs with artificial intelligence we maybe have to just think through
some new stuff post Adam Smith right and maybe take more seriously some of the problems that the
successes of this system also cost that we don't tell in the history so I guess in closing thought
you were talking about thinking seven generations ahead we're institutionally legally fiduciarily
obligated only think a quarter ahead most of the time and that most four-year segments because if
I try to do something that's going to take many years in an elected position and it doesn't come
through I won't get reelected and whatever I do the other side will undo in four years so
we're it seems like we are institutionally bound to short-term thinking while having long-term
effects it seems like we have we're debasing the biosphere upon which we depend which means
while focusing on everything other than that so it does seem like we have acclimated ourselves to a
insane society and you were talking about human purpose you were talking about we're trying to
get the neurotransmitters but it's not just the neurotransmitters it's like what is actually
meaningful knowing that when people leave they forget about almost everything because the world
comes back and attacks them with to-do lists and stuff what would you want people to most
leave with and not forget that energy is invisible in our society and it underpins
our lives our expectations and it's unsustainable and that after basic needs are met which arguably
for a lot of humans they are not but if they are most of the best things in life are free
and I think we have to first understand the importance of energy and materials to our lives
secondly be grateful for it and not take it for granted and start to teach and inspire young
people towards a lesser energy and resource-intensive future that does not have to be a disaster
and start modeling that as individuals and as communities and that there are no
giraffes or dolphins or bumblebee representatives in this room and we have to speak for nature
we have to have someone speak for nature in the bottlenecks of the 21st century is
something I'd like you to take away
you know when I think about indigenous culture and where we're at now and knowledge and
capturing it you know I don't want to romanticize that indigenous folks you know
live in complete harmony with nature and the environment of course we're also having to
rely on accounts from you know mostly white folks that wrote about Cherkees and maybe maybe
bastardize a word and you read it now and that's not what it meant it wasn't captured correctly
I think with what I would hope folks leave with is that the efforts that are going on in Indian
country right now are again a bit of a both crisis mode and a renaissance era because
there is some intrinsically invaluable knowledge about you know how language described and
used was used to describe our relationship with the earth plants and animals and that
we are as a younger generation you know having grown up completely well not completely but just
you know with the education system and what we were being taught and we're finally
coming of age and looking at well we don't like this we don't like the way we're being told to
live and so let's go back to the knowledge of how our ancestors lived based on those that still
have the knowledge and how can we incorporate that into how we're living today because there's
you know unless there is a you know EMP over the earth and we all lose the ability to generate power
and make fossil fuels then we're all going to go back to having to live on the land and figure it
out one way or the other and give us 10,000 years and we'll probably go back to being indigenous
cultures just living off the land again so you know how are we living today and and particularly
in our in our in our perspective you know it's coming from looking at the older generations thank
you both
I think we have time for some Q&A and there's a couple mics here
if anybody has questions and I just wanted to say I wanted to check in if people want to follow up
you mentioned that if people want to have relationship with Cherokee people here they
kind of got a care enough to work at it which I think is great so I don't want to override that
I do just want to ask is there a website you have if people are interested to learn more
is there a place they can follow up yeah you go to ebci.com we do maintain a government website
that puts up our yearly events annual events that go on within the community ebci ebci ebci.com
and of course UNCA is a great partner to the eastern band Cherokee Indians we do have a student
population here and a Trey Adcock he's Cherokee Nation a great professor great liaison that's right
here at UNCA and so again you have to be delivered on finding some of these venues and of course we
talk about our community clubs and what goes on there that's that's more of an end on an individual
level but you know come to Cherokee with see what goes on with the events go to the museum
spark some conversations that's what you'll find it great and Nate the best resource for people
to follow up with you the great simplification.com is the podcast site and then I have a YouTube
channel where everything is there Nate Higgins on YouTube and I do just want to say as we're talking
about some of the problems of the financialization of everything which does actually require
radical macroeconomic restructuring that's not going to happen instantly so we
have to also steward those economic resources better. Nate's org is a nonprofit that I think
is doing some of the most important environmental work in the world punches way above its weight
needs donations if anyone in this room is interested in how to utilize those resources
better come talk to him. Questions? Hi and thank you very much for this. I'm an environmental
science professor here at UNC Asheville and I see in I've been here since 1999 and one thing I've
noticed is that all truly sustainable solutions solve multiple problems at once and don't create
new problems and then I'm going to ask a question that might seem a little strange
when I think about the previous panel and yesterday's artificial intelligence panel
and today and the the true existential threat to humanity and the need to redo systems completely
including our financial system it does remind me of about 15 years ago I was I was using some
scrap marble from a marble yard and edging some garden beds with it which don't do that slugs
but I was thinking oh my gosh I'm edging my beds in marble society is about to collapse so so this
question is there a way potentially to help to use AI to help us leverage these difficult
transitions and and how to navigate through these difficult transitions with as little damage as
possible should I address that yes and slippery it's asking is there ever a time where Frodo needs
to use the ring and yes and problematic right because what ends up happening is you say okay we
need to use AI to create the fusion technology that so we need to connect AI to quantum computers to
be able to do that modeling etc we have to drive new capacity for this purpose but now that capacity
is going to get utilized for every purpose that every agent has so we'll we will create the under
the ethical review board the immuno oncology research that advances the immuno-oncological
capabilities for that thing but now we can use it for bio weapons and so you always have to say
not is this application with this user in this time frame good but is this new capacity that is
now a new human capacity that will become decentralized across the entire landscape of motive
factoring second and third order effects good if you're thinking that way about it then yes AI has
some very important applications if you're not thinking that way about it the upsides will not
be worth the downsides in my short experience going around working with different tribes and
learning from different folks they'll say no you know there's nothing that AI can tell the seed
how to grow and some you know just simple plant breeding that makes it more resilient or that
you know how we look at and manage the environment a computer and you know something of a greater
higher order not going to be able to tell us how to save ourselves
I like most young people feel a crushing amount of existential dread for my future
especially after the AI talk yesterday but I was wondering I guess how you all personally
foster hope and keep going on considering all the terrible things that loom ahead and
how you spread that hope in your community yeah thank you for eight of the last 10 years I taught
college so I taught young people and I I don't really subscribe to hope hope is not a strategy
I prefer optimism and realism I think there was a famous I think it's the Stockdale Paradox
where he was a prisoner of war and the people that were super optimistic burned out and those
that were super pessimistic didn't make it but the realistic people eventually thrived because
they were facing reality I have already grieved for the future that society is selling us a long
time ago so I'm actually super charged to get up in the morning and play a role in our collective
future and what gives me the most coping skills I think there's coping engaging and thriving
as kind of a pyramid I think spending time with other like-minded people even if you
kind can't find answers is really reduces your cortisol which is a stress hormone and it boosts
your helper T cells which is an immune response so when I meet with Daniel I mean yes the things
we talk about are scary and existential we didn't evolve to handle this amount of stuff like every
two years we would have a lion attack our band or whatever and then we went back to singing and
storytelling we're living this toxic stuff every single day and so we need to find breaks I have
breaks with my dogs I have breaks in nature but when I meet with my friends and colleagues like
Daniel there's this like purpose of being on the team on the right side of history on working on
something that matters despite the odds that's what gives me optimism and drive and I would say
that's different than hope but it's just as meaningful you see me smiling up here a lot just
cracking up and you know Indian humor like when you look at the history of what has happened to us
I'm not going to cry about it and I'm going to laugh about it a little bit because you know
the ladies question first you know what the existential threat to humanity well it's human
behavior our greatest threat to humans is ourselves and so I'm like yeah you know what is what keeps
you hopeful and now I got you know before a kid I definitely was like oh god what are we gonna do
and let me go sit around talk with folks on how to fix all these problems and and now you know when
I moved back to Cherokee got depressed because I wasn't in an academic setting and you know you work
in a community that and in just rural areas it's like you know they're daily lives it's some of
its paycheck to paycheck day to day kind of living and so I usually you know look at humor a lot on
well it's a really f-ed up situation well what are we gonna do about it let's here talk about it
cry about it we can do something I'll add something to that one it just it's so different having an
indigenous person on the panel and that questions asked because what is it what does it mean to
actually have already had your civilization collapsed from the outside not actually as a result of
internal and sustainability and then be like okay so we're living through the post part of that
and what the cause was is everybody we're around all the time right or is the civilization that
they're all part of it's like what a head fuck so if you I mean realistically if you really want
to learn about that talk to people who have lived through more serious versions talk to people who
have come out of Syria out of Ukraine out of tribal lands and because they know more about
being post tragic right they have gone through it something you know Kiev was an amazing city a
couple years ago people were moving there to do blockchain from all around the world and so
we always have this weird sense and and Syria was an amazing place to be not long ago we we have
this weird sense that if something hasn't collapsed in a while it's not going to and it's it's not
founded right go ahead well I just did a podcast with a young woman from Lebanon in the last three
years Lebanon's economy has collapsed 50 percent their currency is down 98 percent she's an environmental
activist and cares about climate and she like you said she they use dark humor all the time like every
day that's one of their coping mechanisms she's now starting a maker space where they take algae
and potatoes and other things grown locally to create packaging materials to package things for
people within Lebanon and it was like super inspiring and I'm like oh my god the economy
collapsed 50 percent and you're cracking jokes and like getting up and and fighting the fight
so I agree with you like see people that are the the great simplification is already here it's just
not evenly distributed the thing I want to add to this is just deepening something because I think
the humor is important I think to get there in an honest version Nate was talking about having
grieved something already there's something that most wisdom cultures talk about die before you die
as long as you're in fear over what might happen you are not actually that empowered
to be able to work on it there is a place where you have to hold the everything that I hold is
sacred my life my family the ecosystem life is all threatened and I can't actually protect it all
and it might all be destroyed and I actually have to accept that and then say but I also am not for
sure useless and I might be able to do something and so I'm going to allocate all of my life energy
towards that with no guarantee at all if it'll work and there's also a sense that in the presence
of all of that tragedy it's only tragic because life is beautiful and meaningful otherwise you
wouldn't care if life was not inherently beautiful let it all burn and so the the the
anger at who's causing the harm the fear of the harm that might happen the depression of
the harm that has happened are all secondary to the actual love of the beauty of life that is
where you give a shit at all and you have to come back to there you have to source yourself there
every day now you look out the window you see the trees and just that you get to exist today at all
so fucking awesome that there is something rather than nothing and that you get to be part of it
and you have to act from there
