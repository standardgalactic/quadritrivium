done a real good job at it.
It's just taking generation after generation to really get to the destruction of language
and practices.
With our tribe, Eastern Metham Cherokee in Western North Carolina, we're just one of
577 federally recognized tribes that are, particularly from a youthful generation, wanting to learn
from our elders and our seniors that still have the knowledge, the language, the wisdom
and the practices and reincorporate that into what's also being called today traditional
ecological knowledge and there's a bit of a debate in our communities, do we even call
it traditional ecological knowledge?
We're taking our practices and so for example we've been working with the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park on one plant permitting to say we're going to go demonstrate that our harvesting
techniques are sustainable and that is through different research projects and different methodologies
I'm cutting and saying well this is, we're proving what we've always known.
We have to prove this to the Western world, we have to prove this to the federal agencies
and everybody else is that the way we lived, and I can't always say in harmony because
there's some really good authors out there that have demonstrated cultures destroying
themselves through soil and over consumption of products and animals, but we're having
to prove our way as being self-sustaining and efficient, whether we're harvesting wild
greens and edibles or the way we interacted with our environment and just keep in mind
when you look at these mountains of Western North Carolina and any region across the nation
here, these mountains are not what they look like 130 years ago and so for example Chestnut
and Chestnut Bly and over forestry, I'm sorry, deforestation in the late 19th century or
the 20th century, you would have had a different stand in that across the mountains, the Chestnuts
had a vast range across the Appalachians from North Georgia all the way to Maine and so
we're getting around to a project with the American Chestnut Foundation trying to re-establish
the Chestnut, but that's going to be 2,200 years in the making based on that range so
we're going to have to plan and forecast out that what we're doing now and what we aim
to achieve is going to be something that we aim to do beyond our own lifetime, the things
that we're doing now, how are they going to impact that seven generations out?
And so I was discussing with Daniel, what does that seven generations mean for a culture
and just for society and civilization in general? Well if you have a community that starts making
babies around 20 years old and you're looking at 140 years old, if it's 30 years old you're
looking at 210 years old. So we've kind of developed this spot and working through our
tribe and in the division of agricultural natural resources that well now we have a target,
what practices and things are we going to prioritize now that are going to have impacts
to our future generations at about 140 and 210 years. But I also like to pair up this
conversation with what we're having now and as part of our work that we're doing is, you
know, one, what is our purpose of and for as a species on the planet? And then the second
question is where do we see ourselves in a thousand years? Because with what Nate queued up there
in terms of our consumption of resources centered on fossil fuels and currently everything that
centers around how we operate, I think we could get a little hopeless saying I don't know if we're
going to be able to enjoy or future generations are going to be able to enjoy what we have now
you know, much less probably in 140 to 210 years, but in a thousand years
who knows where we're going to go with technological advancements and all the
discussion with AI that's going on right now. And so, you know, from my community and I just
came back from Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe up near your neck of the woods, you know, I got
tribes and indigenous folks are at a point to where we know that the knowledge that we
are looking to capture within our own communities can be shared within the other indigenous
communities. We're working with the federal government to demand that there is accountability
for treaty rights that were guaranteed over the last several hundred years and treaties that were
developed and that when we're looking at the area that we're in now and we're one of the few tribes
that we can say we're truly fortunate to be on our ancestral homelands. There's not a lot of
tribes that can say that and so where we are at now and between language and culture and our
resources is that there's a road what feels like a renaissance for indigenous communities and cultures
to then really driven by young folks reaching out to our elder peers and our elder family
members just calling for that knowledge, wanting to capture that knowledge and then to practice it
out. And when you look at what I've learned in my short time on this earth, when you look at some
of the principles that folks espouse from our old generation, you know, one is of course many folks
are very spiritual whether that's in a traditional Christian sense or in a indigenous spiritual sense
and a lot of people pray to the creator called Aguidodha, Aguidodhu, Grandpa or Father, you know,
being spiritual and realizing again those everything is connected and that where we at is a blessing
that was provided by the creator in the various levels of his existence. And then the other component
is looking at our resources in the way we interact with both plants and animals and waterways. You
know, it's all relatives. You know, look at some of the indigenous communities in New Zealand who've
got a river named and given rights so that that river, I forgot the name of the river in New Zealand,
but it has the same rights as a human being. And that's where that when we take a step back, pause,
slow down, you know, how can indigenous knowledge be applied to our daily ways of life now that
what I really look at is we've got to slow down and really take a minute to think about what our
daily activities are doing to the planet and for future generations. And two is to really say, you
know, there is something of benefit to go back and look at the way we were living and saying that
is could be better than the way we're living now. Thank you. One of the many reasons we actually
decided to move to Asheville, even though this was we hadn't got to meet anybody in the eastern
band, I was just hearing that the native tribe here was one of the only ones in the whole country
that was still where they had been before colonizers came, meaning that they have some relationship to
the local flora and fauna and geography and like how impossible it is, even if you're a native person,
to have your intact wisdom after forced migration, right, after cultural assimilation and genocide,
but also where you're just not even in the world that you evolved with. And I'm really excited
to get to learn because it's such an incredible thing to get to have so close access to people that
know that. I have a question for you before, a question for both of you is I have some friends
that are have learned like yourself, cultural anthropology or whatever western thing they
needed to learn for credibility but also have indigenous training and the translation and
possibility they describe as being infuriating. You were talking about how we proved to western
science that we can do this one plant sustainably where an ancient process you would have never
focused on one plant separate from everything else. Tyson Young Caporta who wrote Sand Talk,
how indigenous wisdom can save the world is a very good friend and he was telling me is like,
we didn't say one herb was good for one thing because depending upon how the season went it
might not even have those properties like if the fish eat enough of the other thing. So
we didn't even have a cannon of it. We had a sensing into what was happening. Can you talk
a little bit about some things you know that are really where the nature of the assumption
space we have the nature of the mind or language makes it hard to even translate what you would
want to translate? Yeah, that's something we're involved in a couple of projects. One with
we're developing a climate change action plan and in partnership with North Carolina State
University. We're also again as I mentioned involved with the American Chestnut Foundation
and then we're also involved with another group called the Rights and Resources Institute and
we're trying to the crux of what we're doing right now is is knowledge capturing and you know I had
a great grandma who was a fluent speaker and I learned that I had to talk about in her mind
was starting to slip by the time we you know I wasn't in her home learning you know learning
the language I wasn't forced to be there and you know for whatever reason when I became in
college and started to discover my individuality I was trying to speak with her and learn the
language even more and we learned some but more folks had families who were conversational than
what my family was and so what I learned with her was you know as her mind was slip and one topic
she always lived to talk about was boarding school and so I had to bring up boarding school
to get her to feel comfortable speaking Cherokee with me and then that's when some that conversation
went and so to tie that into where we're at now with this knowledge capturing of fluent elder
speakers to hear them talk about Cherokee language and getting an answer to a specific question
related to resources or to a concept as opposed to learning about it in English they'll say you
know I'll have six different ways to say one word or I could phrase this differently and then
if you come to me next week I may my mind my mind is my mindset is going to influence the way I
would tell you how I've interpreted that which does make it difficult difficult to learn the language
but then I again I'm just trying to get out of that whole my own mindset of hey I need answers we've
got to do this now it's important you have the knowledge give it to us you know we got it there's
there's a there's a level of respect that you have to approach you know we got 150 fluent speakers
left 148 Cherokee nation has about 1200 you know united gadooban has several hundred
and so we're at a crisis state a point of crisis with our language because the way
language is used to describe things in Cherokee is going is a tale of of how we viewed the world
and and the way those words would have been arranged or the way a specific word would have been used
to describe something and you know you're not having to speak a lot of Cherokee because I'm
still learning and I'm still not comfortable speaking in public but you know to learn from
these folks and to really set take to stand back in our groups to gain that respect and to learn
that that wisdom is very interesting in particular on the projects that we're working on now and so
we're again we're putting a lot on our elders who we're they're being pulled in natural resources
environment that's just one area there's a lot that are just focused on language so you know we
think we think we're busy but you only have 140 speakers maybe 80 or involved or engaged in our
community and we're pulling at them every which way because it we were as a young generation
we're dying to know what they know and then how to translate that into modern terms and how can
it be preserved and used and more importantly passed down to their next generation like like my
daughter who's three years old so it's tough when you mentioned the number of native speakers it's
so heartbreaking because it's an endangered species it's so and it's an endangered species that
encodes so much wisdom about how to live here I had a I had a teacher that cultural anthropology
teacher who would be like maybe 120 now had if he was still alive and he was one of the last
people to go encounter a bunch of tribes that hadn't had western civilization at all and he
was studying the language with translators and looking at language as a function or language
in relationship to violence he was meeting some of the Polynesian Fijian South American people and
he said one of the most obvious things that he noted was that the least violent cultures had
the least prevalence in their language of first person possessive the word mine many of them
didn't even have a word mine they only had ours and it didn't even mean possessive them in stewardship
like they wouldn't even have a word resources because they don't talk about natural resources as
it's like no those are the buffalo people they're not resources for us there and so like we have
so much violent insanity coded into our language which then creates the world that Nate's talking
about so when I the question I want to ask you both is think about what was it like to be Cherokee
were any of the native people here who had been here for at least tens of thousands of years
before a warring culture came into kill 110 million of them did they feel like it was in times you
know like and similarly if it's a different story but if we go back what did it feel like in Rome
right before Rome collapsed or the Egyptian Empire the Mayan or and we look at that all previous
civilizations collapsed this is the first time we have a fully globalized civilization with global
supply chains making everything that we use take six continents to produce and it's also in the
process of collapsing is this a lot like what it would have felt like in Rome right before it
collapsed or and when you think about that it's seriously I don't hear that no I mean I really
do think about when Nate's saying we have an exponential financial system and it's perfectly
coupled nearly perfectly coupled 0.99 to energy which means you have to extract exponentially
more every year it's crazy to think that's possible and yet we can't stop it what would it take to
stop it so I guess what I want to ask you both is what if we are seeing that we're actually maybe
near the end of civilization as we know it what would it take like what about it is most unsustainable
what ideas have we acclimated to that are the craziest what would it take to change it like
share some thoughts well we've financialized the human experience which is why the indigenous
wisdom in the language we we just parse things into dollars that's been our success metric
I actually don't think the average person thinks we're headed for collapse I think the
yes we're exponentially creating money and our resources are doing this so the gap between them
is shifting but I think emotionally psychologically the way the media is the way the central banks
are the way the government is is they're papering over all these problems with artificial guarantees
and interest rates and quantitative easing and these things and we don't really have authentic
media anymore telling these deep stories so I think the average person is disconnected from what
you've just said but people paying attention no this is this is real if we grow at 3% a year which
is what every government and corporation in the world ostensibly expects we will double the
amount of energy and materials that the whole world uses in the next 30 years and we will double it
again in the 30 years after that so if you have a teenage child or grandchild by the time they're
in their 70s we will have quadrupled the scale of energy materials on the planet is that possible
is that desirable I no longer think the next doubling will happen so what happens in in lieu of
that personally I think we will kick every can possible we will change the rules we will print
money to forestall this moment which I call the great simplification and there's a there's
a dual reason for that for many of us a simpler life would be something that's healthier and
probably better for us but there's an academic reason too which is historically humans have
solved problems by adding complexity and complexity requires more energy more nodes in a supply chain
more vectors of of roads and things like that so we've all lived during this time of greater and
greater complexity but if we don't have the energy to sustain that we're going to need to simplify
we're going to need to reduce complexity so those scout team humans that are hearing this
if you really understand that our society is unlikely to conserve or leave the carbon in the
ground until there's a crisis it it emotionally empowers you to simplify first and beat the rush
from a cultural standpoint we're going to need new aspirations does more and more GDP and income
really make us happier and healthier and you have to look at the distribution of 60 or so of the
people aren't benefiting from this exponential growth what are our aspirations ask yourself
what are the 10 things in your life that bring you joy well for me it's playing with my chickens
my dogs planting and tending my garden seeing a forest like coming into ashville I saw a bobcat
this morning uh like these are the things that bring me joy or working closely with another
human being on something important if you think about all these things very few of them require
a lot of energy and resources but we're in this social trap that our culture is telling us this
is what we need to do so I think we need top down and bottom up bottom up we need humans
reconnecting with their indigeneity I mean I will never be a Native American but I have a
feeling deep in me what's right and wrong and what's sacred and what the right things are to do and
how to live with the land that I reside on and to reconnect with that feeling that's been lost in
this Monty Hall Las Vegas smorgasbord culture that we live in and then you know pass the baton to
others start having community conversations start finding the scout team in in ashville or whatever
black mountain or wherever you live and from the top down this is all going to rely on governance
and our governance model is kind of broken right now and we're going to need a different leadership
and we're going to probably need to change the prices because we're paying fractions of a penny
for the things that are supporting our our life if we were to maybe tax not only carbon but but
copper and fossil water aquifers and aluminum and things that are depleting millions of times
faster than mother and natures you know built them up that would make us conserve it would
make us innovate because it would send the right the right signals to corporations and companies
that this oil is going to be $500 a barrel instead of 70 because that's a more appropriate long-term
