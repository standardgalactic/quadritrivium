price it's going to mean that things are more expensive it's going to mean that we can't consume
as much but if most of the best things in life are free that's kind of the the the pathway we have
to navigate i'll stop there yeah i'll jump on there because one of the things that i have we
i'd like to have in our discussions within our team and our tribe and our community members and
when we're out and about engagement with other tribes again going back to that question and what
is our purpose and we look at westeros the size and where we're at you know it's pretty i've came
up with a sad answer you know it's to get up and make money to get up and make money every day
because anything and everything we do currently requires money whether you're paying for fossil
fuels whether you're paying for your power bill food your household needs family gifts whatever
you want to do our existence is centered around currency and making it and be able to pay someone
else or some corporation or something for that service or that need or that want and where conversations
are happening in our community is getting back to more of a local level of looking at the natural
resources that we have and how can we better manage those for today's needs while also making
you know trying to provide that guarantee for ourselves now for the future generations and
it's it's difficult i was at a native american climate change conference a couple years ago
i was sitting around with 12 other folks i was one of three males breast and female
and i suppose a question does anybody have kids here and i went no and i said well why not so
what are we talking about it's pretty bleak and hopeful you know hopeless that we're you know
we're here discussing climate change and it all centered around our individual choices and a decision
making moving forward and that you know can we really can we really make those tough decisions now
to reduce our consumption to be more conserved in how we're extracting resources and moving forward
you know i got a three-year-old three-year-old girl named color kawaii in cherokee coffee because
we love coffee with joella and you know i'll look at her now and i'm just like what did we do but
she's here other kids are here we have to now take these opportunities even even more seriously
about making sure every home has a community garden a raised bed or you are operating on a
community garden or that if you have some forested landscape look at the species distribution of what's
there maybe cut some out and then plant a nut bearing tree um do you have water resources and
how are you going to utilize that on your own uh your own land and then to the concept of what's
what's my land um and what is shared land um and so you know those discussions are going on and
and there's uh in our community it's funny i always when i talk with some some uh when i talk
with elected politicians uh and i start pointing out how we utilize gaming revenue for example
to fund the tribe or senior services or education department or my division public health operations
and all that they're like that's really great good for you all but then as i apply that to the
broader politics of the nation it sounds like socialism but i always call it tribalism it's
just it's just tribalism we take our resources we're taking care of our young and our old and
everybody and in between because we are reliant on our elder population for that knowledge and that
wisdom we have to take care and foster our youth as they're growing up and nourish them and and
provide them the best environment for for learning um and then as our family units you know we're
engaged in cultural activities and community activities that provide that and that enriching
environment that makes life perspective like okay these are the simple things that i think a lot of
folks can again step back take a breath slow down and say okay what is important to me in my daily
daily life i have a question for you before a final question um so since the eastern band of
Cherokee is right here just proximal to Asheville and since a lot of the people who are here in
Asheville uh i'm curious both sides of if people want to learn more about Cherokee knowledge wisdom
ideas how they might portend things for how to tend to this ecosystem watershed by a region um
and on the other side if there are things that uh that Cherokee people here need help with that local
people could help is there some way bi-directionally that people can follow up interface it's funny we
look at how history is taught and what is express course you know the old adage history is written
by the winners but we're now at a point to where we're claiming ourselves to be winner we're gonna
write our own future and research our own history and rewrite the history as we see it based on
what is available um it's something that relationship building first takes that takes an
introduction but most importantly it takes trust and you know we get approached by institutions
academic institutions organizations that hey we want to work with you we're gonna write this grant
can we get that letter of support and we're really sitting back and saying well let's vet this out
what what is good for us if you're if you're coming to work with us what research do you get out of it
do we get to own that data because we're not going to sign an agreement without saying that data belongs
to us uh because it's far too often and you know Cherokee's one of the most research tribes in in
American history that that we have researchers who come in and it's happened to us within the last
decade that they'll do a research project on wildlife or culture uh get out uh complete their
research and then we'll never hear from them again you know and so you know we have a CRRB
process in place to try to help protect what knowledge is shared how it's captured and again
who has ownership of of that knowledge so for folks here in Asheville that when you look at the
the history of what how Asheville came about or the lands that they're on or you know just that
50 miles west of here you got the you know say Eastern it'll say welcome to the Cherokee Union
Reservation it's actually called the Kuala Boundary you know there's some nuances that you're going
to have to really dive into various resources whether that's the Cherokee Indian Museum or
going to community events which you know I'm getting those aren't necessarily open you're going to
find somebody you're going to be deliberate and searching out and reaching out to you know human
resources individualism and foster relationship and build it on trust yeah
so given that um I guess one thought I want to share with everyone is uh world views have
core ideas and then have protector ideas that keep you from not questioning that idea you'll
burn in hell if you don't believe this idea and if you question any if any other ideas come in
whatever capitalism is very similar someone says there's a problem with money or they question
capitalism instantly it means they're a terrible communist Marxist don't you realize how bad that
is don't don't you know that capitalism has made everything better don't you realize that
Stalin killed 50 million people okay so we're not talking about Marxism we are saying that
capitalism is a relatively new thing to human society and that western European human society
coming here killed 100 million people that were here that were not savages being civilized
that were arguably more civilized in some ways so when we're saying there might be some unsustainable
things about the monetization of everything and the capital system that doesn't mean it
instantly is defaulting to some previous thing it might be we have to innovate new social technologies
we never had eight billion people with highly advanced technology that could over fish the
entire oceans with nuclear bombs with artificial intelligence we maybe have to just think through
some new stuff post Adam Smith right and maybe take more seriously some of the problems that the
successes of this system also cost that we don't tell in the history so I guess in closing thought
you were talking about thinking seven generations ahead we're institutionally legally fiduciarily
obligated only think a quarter ahead most of the time and that most four-year segments because if
I try to do something that's going to take many years in an elected position and it doesn't come
through I won't get reelected and whatever I do the other side will undo in four years so
we're it seems like we are institutionally bound to short-term thinking while having long-term
effects it seems like we have we're debasing the biosphere upon which we depend which means
while focusing on everything other than that so it does seem like we have acclimated ourselves to a
insane society and you were talking about human purpose you were talking about we're trying to
get the neurotransmitters but it's not just the neurotransmitters it's like what is actually
meaningful knowing that when people leave they forget about almost everything because the world
comes back and attacks them with to-do lists and stuff what would you want people to most
leave with and not forget that energy is invisible in our society and it underpins
our lives our expectations and it's unsustainable and that after basic needs are met which arguably
for a lot of humans they are not but if they are most of the best things in life are free
and I think we have to first understand the importance of energy and materials to our lives
secondly be grateful for it and not take it for granted and start to teach and inspire young
people towards a lesser energy and resource-intensive future that does not have to be a disaster
and start modeling that as individuals and as communities and that there are no
giraffes or dolphins or bumblebee representatives in this room and we have to speak for nature
we have to have someone speak for nature in the bottlenecks of the 21st century is
something I'd like you to take away
you know when I think about indigenous culture and where we're at now and knowledge and
capturing it you know I don't want to romanticize that indigenous folks you know
live in complete harmony with nature and the environment of course we're also having to
rely on accounts from you know mostly white folks that wrote about Cherkees and maybe maybe
bastardize a word and you read it now and that's not what it meant it wasn't captured correctly
I think with what I would hope folks leave with is that the efforts that are going on in Indian
country right now are again a bit of a both crisis mode and a renaissance era because
there is some intrinsically invaluable knowledge about you know how language described and
used was used to describe our relationship with the earth plants and animals and that
we are as a younger generation you know having grown up completely well not completely but just
you know with the education system and what we were being taught and we're finally
coming of age and looking at well we don't like this we don't like the way we're being told to
live and so let's go back to the knowledge of how our ancestors lived based on those that still
have the knowledge and how can we incorporate that into how we're living today because there's
you know unless there is a you know EMP over the earth and we all lose the ability to generate power
and make fossil fuels then we're all going to go back to having to live on the land and figure it
out one way or the other and give us 10,000 years and we'll probably go back to being indigenous
cultures just living off the land again so you know how are we living today and and particularly
in our in our in our perspective you know it's coming from looking at the older generations thank
you both
I think we have time for some Q&A and there's a couple mics here
if anybody has questions and I just wanted to say I wanted to check in if people want to follow up
you mentioned that if people want to have relationship with Cherokee people here they
kind of got a care enough to work at it which I think is great so I don't want to override that
I do just want to ask is there a website you have if people are interested to learn more
is there a place they can follow up yeah you go to ebci.com we do maintain a government website
that puts up our yearly events annual events that go on within the community ebci ebci ebci.com
and of course UNCA is a great partner to the eastern band Cherokee Indians we do have a student
population here and a Trey Adcock he's Cherokee Nation a great professor great liaison that's right
here at UNCA and so again you have to be delivered on finding some of these venues and of course we
talk about our community clubs and what goes on there that's that's more of an end on an individual
level but you know come to Cherokee with see what goes on with the events go to the museum
spark some conversations that's what you'll find it great and Nate the best resource for people
to follow up with you the great simplification.com is the podcast site and then I have a YouTube
channel where everything is there Nate Higgins on YouTube and I do just want to say as we're talking
about some of the problems of the financialization of everything which does actually require
radical macroeconomic restructuring that's not going to happen instantly so we
have to also steward those economic resources better. Nate's org is a nonprofit that I think
is doing some of the most important environmental work in the world punches way above its weight
needs donations if anyone in this room is interested in how to utilize those resources
better come talk to him. Questions? Hi and thank you very much for this. I'm an environmental
science professor here at UNC Asheville and I see in I've been here since 1999 and one thing I've
noticed is that all truly sustainable solutions solve multiple problems at once and don't create
new problems and then I'm going to ask a question that might seem a little strange
when I think about the previous panel and yesterday's artificial intelligence panel
and today and the the true existential threat to humanity and the need to redo systems completely
including our financial system it does remind me of about 15 years ago I was I was using some
scrap marble from a marble yard and edging some garden beds with it which don't do that slugs
but I was thinking oh my gosh I'm edging my beds in marble society is about to collapse so so this
question is there a way potentially to help to use AI to help us leverage these difficult
transitions and and how to navigate through these difficult transitions with as little damage as
possible should I address that yes and slippery it's asking is there ever a time where Frodo needs
to use the ring and yes and problematic right because what ends up happening is you say okay we
need to use AI to create the fusion technology that so we need to connect AI to quantum computers to
be able to do that modeling etc we have to drive new capacity for this purpose but now that capacity
is going to get utilized for every purpose that every agent has so we'll we will create the under
the ethical review board the immuno oncology research that advances the immuno-oncological
capabilities for that thing but now we can use it for bio weapons and so you always have to say
not is this application with this user in this time frame good but is this new capacity that is
now a new human capacity that will become decentralized across the entire landscape of motive
factoring second and third order effects good if you're thinking that way about it then yes AI has
some very important applications if you're not thinking that way about it the upsides will not
be worth the downsides in my short experience going around working with different tribes and
learning from different folks they'll say no you know there's nothing that AI can tell the seed
how to grow and some you know just simple plant breeding that makes it more resilient or that
you know how we look at and manage the environment a computer and you know something of a greater
higher order not going to be able to tell us how to save ourselves
I like most young people feel a crushing amount of existential dread for my future
especially after the AI talk yesterday but I was wondering I guess how you all personally
foster hope and keep going on considering all the terrible things that loom ahead and
how you spread that hope in your community yeah thank you for eight of the last 10 years I taught
college so I taught young people and I I don't really subscribe to hope hope is not a strategy
I prefer optimism and realism I think there was a famous I think it's the Stockdale Paradox
where he was a prisoner of war and the people that were super optimistic burned out and those
that were super pessimistic didn't make it but the realistic people eventually thrived because
they were facing reality I have already grieved for the future that society is selling us a long
time ago so I'm actually super charged to get up in the morning and play a role in our collective
future and what gives me the most coping skills I think there's coping engaging and thriving
as kind of a pyramid I think spending time with other like-minded people even if you
kind can't find answers is really reduces your cortisol which is a stress hormone and it boosts
your helper T cells which is an immune response so when I meet with Daniel I mean yes the things
we talk about are scary and existential we didn't evolve to handle this amount of stuff like every
two years we would have a lion attack our band or whatever and then we went back to singing and
storytelling we're living this toxic stuff every single day and so we need to find breaks I have
breaks with my dogs I have breaks in nature but when I meet with my friends and colleagues like
Daniel there's this like purpose of being on the team on the right side of history on working on
something that matters despite the odds that's what gives me optimism and drive and I would say
that's different than hope but it's just as meaningful you see me smiling up here a lot just
cracking up and you know Indian humor like when you look at the history of what has happened to us
I'm not going to cry about it and I'm going to laugh about it a little bit because you know
the ladies question first you know what the existential threat to humanity well it's human
behavior our greatest threat to humans is ourselves and so I'm like yeah you know what is what keeps
you hopeful and now I got you know before a kid I definitely was like oh god what are we gonna do
and let me go sit around talk with folks on how to fix all these problems and and now you know when
