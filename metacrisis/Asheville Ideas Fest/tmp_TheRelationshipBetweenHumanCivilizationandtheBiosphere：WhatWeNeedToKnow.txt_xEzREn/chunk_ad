I moved back to Cherokee got depressed because I wasn't in an academic setting and you know you work
in a community that and in just rural areas it's like you know they're daily lives it's some of
its paycheck to paycheck day to day kind of living and so I usually you know look at humor a lot on
well it's a really f-ed up situation well what are we gonna do about it let's here talk about it
cry about it we can do something I'll add something to that one it just it's so different having an
indigenous person on the panel and that questions asked because what is it what does it mean to
actually have already had your civilization collapsed from the outside not actually as a result of
internal and sustainability and then be like okay so we're living through the post part of that
and what the cause was is everybody we're around all the time right or is the civilization that
they're all part of it's like what a head fuck so if you I mean realistically if you really want
to learn about that talk to people who have lived through more serious versions talk to people who
have come out of Syria out of Ukraine out of tribal lands and because they know more about
being post tragic right they have gone through it something you know Kiev was an amazing city a
couple years ago people were moving there to do blockchain from all around the world and so
we always have this weird sense and and Syria was an amazing place to be not long ago we we have
this weird sense that if something hasn't collapsed in a while it's not going to and it's it's not
founded right go ahead well I just did a podcast with a young woman from Lebanon in the last three
years Lebanon's economy has collapsed 50 percent their currency is down 98 percent she's an environmental
activist and cares about climate and she like you said she they use dark humor all the time like every
day that's one of their coping mechanisms she's now starting a maker space where they take algae
and potatoes and other things grown locally to create packaging materials to package things for
people within Lebanon and it was like super inspiring and I'm like oh my god the economy
collapsed 50 percent and you're cracking jokes and like getting up and and fighting the fight
so I agree with you like see people that are the the great simplification is already here it's just
not evenly distributed the thing I want to add to this is just deepening something because I think
the humor is important I think to get there in an honest version Nate was talking about having
grieved something already there's something that most wisdom cultures talk about die before you die
as long as you're in fear over what might happen you are not actually that empowered
to be able to work on it there is a place where you have to hold the everything that I hold is
sacred my life my family the ecosystem life is all threatened and I can't actually protect it all
and it might all be destroyed and I actually have to accept that and then say but I also am not for
sure useless and I might be able to do something and so I'm going to allocate all of my life energy
towards that with no guarantee at all if it'll work and there's also a sense that in the presence
of all of that tragedy it's only tragic because life is beautiful and meaningful otherwise you
wouldn't care if life was not inherently beautiful let it all burn and so the the the
anger at who's causing the harm the fear of the harm that might happen the depression of
the harm that has happened are all secondary to the actual love of the beauty of life that is
where you give a shit at all and you have to come back to there you have to source yourself there
every day now you look out the window you see the trees and just that you get to exist today at all
so fucking awesome that there is something rather than nothing and that you get to be part of it
and you have to act from there
