about these location parameters and shape parameters that that parameterize or describe
any belief so that's quite remarkable because it gives you a very different kind of take on
information because normally when people talk about sort of information theoretic treatments
or probabilistic treatments in self-organization on equilibrium steady state sort of treatments
that allow for this openness or exchange between the inside and the outside through the Markov
blanket and they're talking about the information inherent in any particular state you know how
surprising would it be to see this gas in this ensemble in this configuration what we're talking
about here is something much more subtle and it's a kind of information that is much closer to a
folk psychological or a lay notion of information it's information about things that can't be seen
so the internal states now hold Bayesian beliefs about hidden external states that are hidden from
them because of the Markov blanket that defines their existence so there's an existential imperative
here or one can read this existential imperative as this inference process which brings us back to
self-evidence that just to exist as a thing means that you have a Markov blanket which means that
there are hidden states which means that if you exist and persist you must be in some kind of
technically a generalized synchrony with the external states that means that I can read off
your internal states and infer only you can as the thing the configuration of external states
and this process in a dynamical setting now becomes a process of belief updating becomes
a an inference process that can be described technically as minimizing a path integral
of a physics called an action which is a time times energy
construct and Hamilton's principle of least action in our instance the action is the
the the marginal likelihood of the sensory states part of the Markov blanket which is
approximated by or may in some instances be identical to the free energy so hence the
free energy principle is just a principle of least action it's saying that the internal
states of anything that exists will have a description in terms of minimizing technically
a functional of beliefs about external states so that was a very brief
so let me let me try and let me try and summarize here if I can get this so what you're saying is
is that so all biological self-organizing systems they are ergodic they have the Markov blankets
they exhibit active inference and they are self for self-preservation or to put it another way
all of the quantities in a self-organizing system that can change will change to minimize free
energy do I have this right yep okay so how so I want to I want to go to this idea of hidden states
right so obviously you talked about equilibrium and I think maybe I would term it in my world
with something on home of stasis right you know people in psychology or people that do physiology
they like to talk about homeostasis so maybe you can chat a little bit more about the role of
homeostasis or equilibrium in preferred versus expected various physical states I do want to
introduce a little bit because I know we've mentioned him a few times you know mark solmes I
know you guys have worked together and I've talked to him he's he's fabulous so he has a
a psychoanalytic angle here which I'm very fond of as well about the impact of the Freudian model
of drive energy so maybe this is a I'm adding something here so maybe you want to talk about
homeostasis but my question about Freud is how does his conception of drives or drive energy
how is that consistent with your free energy principle right two really easy questions
right so you want to go from Bernard to frog
so but that was you know that that was I think a clever move to to introduce the notion of
homeostasis so what we're talking about here is just a generalized homeostasis so you know
you can regard this non-equilibrium steady state you use the word egodic which was interesting
um we try not to use that word because that brings all sorts of baggage right what we're implying
in terms of a non-equilibrium steady state is over a limited period of time
realizing that of course at a slower time scale things will evolve so we don't imply that the
system ever attains a steady state it's just that it has a steady state solution to its dynamics
but that solution may disappear after a short period of time but within a particular time scale
um what we are talking about is the fact that it has maintained its mark of blanket
which means that it must have established some kind of synchrony or balance between the inside
and the outside that we can now articulate as a principle of least action or a principle of least
free energy or maximum model evidence and then the question is well is this consistent with other
theories and other accounts of self-organization or global function of a system and the answer is yes
absolutely and so you know homeostasis is one of my favorite accounts but there are other
accounts you can also say well this fundamental objective function that appears to be minimized
remember this is a principle of least action it looks as a the system it looks as if the system
is trying to minimize something so that could be a cost function which could be a negative reward
function or utility function so you can now spin off all of reinforcement learning and economics
in terms of utility theory as one expression with a particular commitment to you know understanding
the mechanics and the the other metric of that field either in the economics or psychology sciences
but it's just really an expression of that there is something to be optimized or it looks as if
the system is optimizing something because it conforms to this principle of least action
where action is the negative log evidence or the free energy so all of reinforcement learning
and utility theory is just a statement I think I can describe the behavior of this
system as an optimization process all I need to do is to identify the function that's been optimized
and of course from our perspective that's going to be or minimize in our in our context that will be
a free energy or it's converse the marginal lighter and the evidence of my model the world
so you can rewrite all of reinforcement learning and utility theory as basically
an expression of or an optimization process of self-evidencing where you now start to interpret
the prior beliefs as or the logarithm of the prior beliefs as a reward functional preferences
so just because I am sitting in this configuration with my Markov blanket
means that if I now interpret my behavior in terms of basic mechanics I necessarily now have to
understand it or write it down in terms of a prior belief and a posterior belief and the updating
and it turns out that that prior belief just is the distribution of the study state solution
that we were talking about previously which means that just existing is a statement of your preferred
states of being and you can articulate that mathematically in many different ways you know
for example in the theory of random dynamical systems the set to which you will always return
will be called a pullback attractor or a global random dynamical attractor these are just the
states to which I'm attracted these are my preferred states and of course that's what's
being optimized from the point of view of reinforcement learning or utility theory you
can move them to the observation that the the negative of these utility functions or value
functions is surprise that's also known as self-information information theory it's just
the prediction error that we were talking about before which I'll minimize that and then from
that you can read up all sorts of information theoretic treatments of optimal behavior such as
maximum mutual information theory infamax theory you could even go as far to a certain extent as
integrated information theory if you wanted to but information theoretic accounts that that posits some
some metrics of functional information theory measure that is extremized of course the
free energy principle is just one of these it says the information theoretic measure is just
the free energy which is abound on the negative log model evidence or marginal likelihood but
then you come to your set of examples which would be more from the point of view of theories of
self-organization either of a sort of physical sort like cybernetics and then you get into things
like the good regulator theorem and or synergetics which are entirely consistent with this sort of
optimization sort of you know the Hamiltonian principle of least action but if you're a
physiologist or you're saying it's just homeostasis so this is just a generalized homeostasis it's
trying to place bounds upon or it looks as if you are in minimizing your prediction errors
if you now think of a particular kind of prediction error as the prediction error between
any autonomic physiological variable and your a priori set point or belief about what it should be
in minimizing the prediction error you are doing homeostasis so minimizing that surprise
in the particular setting of the surprise being about physiological states just is homeostasis
and if you just generalize that you're all you're doing when you're describing a particle
that keeps its states within particular bounds within its mark of blanket it you're necessarily
has to resist random fluctuations and gather itself up to evince a generalized homeostasis
and then the final interpretation cause is just in terms of self-evidencing and the Bayesian
bone hypothesis but these are just different perspectives on the same underlying dynamic
so having established the the privacy of homeostasis in its full and generalized sense
we just have to put Freud into the story which is not that difficult actually
and I say that because I should acknowledge that Mark Soames is the world expert on Freud
and I don't know if he spoke about his books on Freud and all the translations so my understanding
is childish and unscholarly to say the least but for what I understand that he's spoken to people
like Mark many of Freud's foundational ideas were coincident or shortly post dating much
of the work of Helmholtz so when when when what one might easily imagine that Freud thinking about
sort of his energy constructs in terms of a Freudian construct he probably had in mind the
same kind of thing that Helmholtz had in mind and one I haven't seen anything written or I haven't
read about this but certainly from secondary tertiary sources and Helmholtz did have a notion of a
neuronal free energy or a neuronal energy that was the thing that could be optimized or minimized in
order to explain unconscious inference he never really articulated or found it but he certainly
had the quest in mind that I fondly would now submit would be the variational free energy
it fills everything that he wanted and is entirely consistent with his more formal
formulations of perception and also much of physics and so my guess is that that basically
Freud was was taking that notion of an optimization in terms of an energy function
as it was articulated and conceived of at the time that these are the inception of these ideas that
you're bringing candid philosophy into physics but without the machinery afforded by Richard
Feynman to deal with it in a simple and graceful way in terms of mathematical equations and without
of course the high performance computing that machine learning subsequently enjoyed and was
able to sort of demonstrate proof of principle that this is the way to formulate the problem
so the Freud probably got as far as he could in the absence of Feynman-esque maths and
mathematical formulations and big computers but pursuing these kind of the same kinds of ideas so
it needs of no surprise to me when Mark tells me that there is a fundamental
conciliance between Freudian formulations and those that you would find that inherit from Feynman
and all the other contributors to these to this formulation of sense-making
and so I would imagine that Freud gets into the game quite gracefully.
The particular point I think that Mark Somes would emphasize here though brings us back to
this meta-cognition and beliefs about beliefs and in particular the ability of certain
hierarchically abstracted sophisticated particles like you and me to actually physically encode
and manipulate and do their Bayesian belief updating on beliefs about beliefs and specifically
the precision the uncertainty so no our own uncertainty to no our own minds and the deployment
of that in terms of this overarching homeostasis this the extremization of
minimization of prediction error or free energy or maximization of marginal likelihood or model
evidence underwrites that kind of mental action and may on Mark's view at least be the essential
quality of any feeling or any sentience so he has a lovely phrase called felt uncertainty
in the same way that we visually palpate the work that you know the visual scene with our eyes
what he's suggesting well the way that I interpret his poetry and you may be very cross
if you hear this but the way I interpreted is that you can palpate your your own uncertainty
palpate you can feel your own precision and furthermore you know and have prior beliefs about
the way that that uncertainty should be deployed or changed and you update your beliefs about
that precision and the mechanisms that do that may well be those that are at the heart of
the feelings and the right quality of experience of the kind that the mark would describe to
consciousness that felt uncertainty yeah it's interesting with Freud because obviously a lot
of it in terms of the the drives was this I'll say it was in an interesting way I mean the way he
framed it was in terms of the psychological hierarchy that he was trying to give as a model
was this element of tension reduction rooted in our our biological and evolutionary nature
if you were to make a comparative analysis here you would say that that was probably a passive
approach right because it's always something is happening how do we how do we resist how do we
how do we get rid of the tension reduction is it in a way a kind of passive way as opposed to maybe
say the you know philosophy of Frederick Nietzsche who had a more active way of trying to understand
to energy and drives and power things of that nature okay so some of the further questions I
want to ask you are since we've done a very nice or you've done a very nice job of explaining the
the free energy principle I would I want to ask about how it applies and then a little bit of
some criticism so I guess the one connection here is about consciousness so as we've been
alluding to people many people have ideas about consciousness where resides how it functions so
everyone from Chalmers to Demasio to obviously Mark has has made some pretty extraordinary
uh research on this in terms of finding it in the uh in the midbrain in the brain stem
which is fascinating stuff there um and all in a now set I mean there's a bunch of people that
have been talking about consciousness it's sort of trendy how do you based on everything we've
discussed um Bayesian brain free free energy principle how do how do we can this tell us
anything about consciousness more accurately or more clearly about what it could be where it could
be how it functions um what is I guess your your kind of uh stamp on on this topic in terms of
consciousness I think the first thing to say um which is often said by uh philosophers is that
the free energy principle is not a theory of consciousness that sounds um slightly deflationary
but in fact it's quite a useful thing because if it's not a it wasn't designed to explain
consciousness and um it's only people like me have no pretensions to try and get into that game
but it would be very interesting to see if it holds the um the formalism that allows people
to address certain hypotheses or questions about consciousness so that that is deeply engaging and
just for your interest um there's currently just been funded a um John Templeton Foundation
collaborative uh adversarial collaboration to play off uh active inference against information
integrated information theory so there are lots of academics and theoreticians out there who are
sort of um interested in what more formal accounts of sentient behavior will bring to the table in
terms of answering questions about consciousness um so everything I am um saying is contextualized
by the fact that you know the free energy principle is not there to explain consciousness but if you
had to answer some of the deeper or more challenging questions um such as um David Chalmers hard question
and or accommodate um some fundamental dialectics you know Cartesian dualism for example
what space is on offer um from the free energy principle and I think there are some quite clear
answers there and we can take this from a number of directions and I'm going to I'll take two because
they follow on from from um some of your pressing questions about sort of drives you know from
the Freudian perspective um so what what did what would drives look like um from the point of view
of the free energy principle but let's not talk about the free energy principle let's talk about
active inference as an actual process theory for you and me um that um that are if you like
conforming to the free energy principle um so the the first thing that um one has to note
is something we've spoken about before that we have a calculus for beliefs about something
that immediately introduces um a duality in terms of interpreting internal brain states
we can either talk about the probabilistic population dynamics and the information of
neural populations and their activity which would be um intrinsic to the brain you know how
likely is it that my neurons are going to fire in with this particular pattern of this particular
part of the brain in this particular circumstance which of course is you know more of the key
questions we address with neuroimaging or you can under the free energy principle or active
inference say well hang on a second there's another kind of probability structure a belief
space because we've just said for every pattern of neural activity there is encoded an implicit
representation of beliefs about the outside now what that means is technically that not only is
there um a probabilistic description of my neural activity but that neural activity
