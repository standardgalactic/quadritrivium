prior to my posterior when seeing the evidence doing my basing belief update in according to
baserall I will move a much smaller distance from the from the prior belief so the precision
afforded both the prior belief and the likelihood in fact it's the balance the ratio of the two
becomes a really important quantity in any basing brain or any basing scheme in engineering
this would be the Kalman gain for example is how much gain do I afford prediction errors
in updating my estimate of the hidden state that I can't see so that places this this notion of
the the encoding of and the predictions of the optimization of precision center stage in the
basing brain you see this in many many cases you can see it in the context of multisensory
integration so how much precision do I thought do I afford the visual evidence relative to the
auditory sensory data if I'm in a very very well lit room I might ascribe much more precision to
the visual information and that will dominate over my belief updating and my beliefs will be
driven by what I see and on what I hear but if I reduce the precision of that of that visual
information those visual prediction errors and switch off the lights are now in the dark room
that now becomes very imprecise and now the most precise influences of my posterior beliefs
are going to be the the auditory modality so I'm going to listen very very carefully in a dark room
I'm going to pay attention to the auditory sensations not the visual sensations so that
I've used the word attention deliberate because this from a psychological perspective what we're
talking about is deploying the precision in the right way in the right context just is attention
it's what we attempt to and that attention can operate at any level in the hierarchy can be
sort of attention grabbing stuff in a particular quadrant of my visual field some flutter which
is unexplained that can now draw attention at a very low level in the hierarchy or I could
be deploying attention to a very very high level of the hierarchy in terms of who I'm going to listen
to next or who I'm going to place an epistemic trust in what news channel I'm going to select
next so this process of selecting by assigning or affording precision to this or that is this
exactly this mental action that we were talking about before it's just deploying attention in the
right kind of way and that attention mediated through the precision of either prior or likelihood
beliefs has a profound effect on the degree to which I change my mind so it's a really important
aspect of this belief updating at the at the neuronal level the predictive coding theory
it has two classes of neurons which is the prediction neurons and the prediction error
neurons you've mentioned this already but I'm just asking at the neuronal level this is what's
happening within the neurons there you have these two classes of neurons that are essentially
weeding out is this a prediction and how are we parsing out some of the prediction error this
is what's happening at the neuronal level no absolutely and it's nice to you sort of ask
that question because that allows us to connect this predictions of precision or predictability
that underwrites optimal belief updating and Bayesian inference to pharmacology and to the
kinds of neurochemicals that may be aberrant saying things like schizophrenia or depression
or autistic autism and ASD and also implicate all the drugs that have a psychoactive aspect
from psychedelics through to the kinds of drugs that people prescribe for say psychotic depression
so yeah let's just unpack that so now we're going we've done the the Bayes rule and the Bayesian
brain with within our mind's eye free probability distributions or being mixed together in the
right kind of way according to their dispersion on their width but now let's say well how would
that be implemented in a in a Bayesian brain well the implementation just is a Kalman filter it's
just a predictive coding what would that look like well on one view as you say it would just
involve two kinds of populations one encoding the prediction error and the other encoding
the expectations or the hypotheses representations that are generating the predictions that are
sent down to form the prediction error so this again speaks in this recurrent message passing
between the the prediction neurons sometimes ascribed to the cells that live at a slightly
greater depth on the surface of the brain the cortical layers relative or distinct from populations
occurring the prediction error sometimes ascribed to superficial pyramidal cells simply because
they live very much closer to the to the to the surface of the brain so you've got this sort of
reciprocal exchange of messages where you can think of the deep pyramidal cells or the deeper
cells as encoding the position of the posterior so let's say some information comes in from the
sensory epithelia there is a prior belief encoded by the activity of a deep population of deep
cells and they provide a prediction that is now not an apt explanation for this new information
that's coming in there is a prediction error the prediction error is reported by the superficial
pyramidal cells that is then sent forward to change the deep and pyramidal cells at the next
level this is just the belief updating so the now the deeper pyramidal cells that were previously
encoding the prior expectation expectation here is just used as a word to mean the mathematical
average or the most likely value of our of our belief then the the prediction errors can now
be seen as doing this changing your mind doing the belief updating just by driving the activity of
the deep pyramidal cells in proportion to the precision of the prediction error so if you
ascribe a lot of newsworthiness a lot of precision to these kinds of prediction errors
from this modality in this point in time then what you are doing is effectively boosting them
in you know increasing their potency their gain or their drive so that they cause a bigger
belief updating or shift or change of your mind simply because they're driving the
deep pyramidal cells towards the likelihood to a greater extent in a way from the prior
than than had the prediction errors have been been assigned a much lower precision so what
would precision look like from a a neurophysiologist or a pharmacologist perspective well it's just
the excitability of these superficial pyramidal cells encoding prediction errors so that tells
you immediately anything that changes the excitability or the sensitivity of populations
encoding prediction errors under a predictive coding scheme is going to be the physical or
biophysical realization of the of this precision which then you ask well what kinds of things
could change the excitability or the post synaptic gain sometimes in use in neurophysiology
well in the brain there are certain brain chemicals on neurotransmitters whose role
is just to modulate the gain of these kinds of cells and what you then ask them well what
kinds of neurotransmitters well once which many people have heard of so classic
neurotransmitters of a neuromodulatory sort would be things like adrenaline, oxytocin, dopamine,
a certain oxytocin there for for a particular reason that dopamine would probably be the
sort of a post child of this kind of neurotransmitter whether or others you know
astral choline or cholinergic neurotransmission, serotonergic neurotransmission of the kind
that's influenced by say psychedelics and psilocybin for example so you can see immediately
if you've heard of any of these drugs you will know that they can have found effect on the way
you feel or the way that you update your beliefs or respond to changes in sensory contingencies or
changes in light circumstances and of course it is these neurotransmitter systems that are
responsible for setting the gain and computationally thereby the precision on the ability of prediction
errors to drive leaf updating higher in the hierarchy that are used in a therapeutic and also
recreational recreational setting. Yeah it's really important how you're connecting everything here
with not only the two classes of neurons but then also bringing in the neurotransmitters
and how they're also functioning here as well. I want to give you a lot of runway here many of
this will start to tie in together so hopefully listeners will be able to see that but give me
your detailed explanation and analysis and exploration of the free energy principle just lay
it all out for us just describe what it is how it works how it functions and then how it connects
with you know many of the things we've already discussed I'm sure it will come up with active
interference predictive coding theory and Bayesian brain model so just tell us your free
energy principle what it is and how it works and you can be as detailed as you would like.
Right I guess I don't want to exhaust you. No no it's great I it's funny because I feel like at
this point we've done all the warm-up so now we can get to the to the to the entree we get to
the main course here so tell us about the the free energy principle from from from yourself.
Right yeah I I have to confess you know that warm-up was probably a more substantive aperitif
than you might imagine. We've done 90% of the of the heavy lifting here.
In the sense that the free energy principle provides a first principle account of the
mechanics that we have been talking about so I'll try and explain what the free energy principle
is in a second but perhaps just preface that by noting that it plays the same role as Hamilton's
principle of least action and you could even argue the theories that undergo natural selection
evolution so in and of themselves they don't do much heavy lifting of an explanatory sort you know
for example knowing natural selection is a principle by which you and I are here it doesn't
tell me anything about why you've got eyes or a nice little beard or you've got your particular
accent it tells me nothing about that it just tells me there is a mechanism as to how these
things could have emerged so the free energy principle is a little bit like that I'll give you
another analogy Hamilton's principle of least action it's a you know a generic I would say
foundational and principle that underwrites all known physics arguably and yet it doesn't tell
me how on earth I go to throw this ball I can if you tell me all the processes all the mechanics
and the initial conditions of a particular instance of ball throwing I can certainly compute the
trajectory of the ball but in and of itself it doesn't it just tells you the principles
underwrite the actual process of ball throwing I'd actually have to become an expert in ball throwing
to actually realize and apply the method of the principle of least action and I use the
principle of least action because the free energy principle is just a principle of least action
so it's a principle that could be read as a method that could be applied to a particular
instance or circumstance of self-organization or active inference but you're going to have to
write down all the actual aspects of that circumstance in order to make the the principle
do any work and in a sense what we've been talking about in terms of various perspectives afforded
by predictive curling the basing brain embodiment all of these are really processed theories
accounts of a realization of the free energy principle so I just put it setting the scene
and to qualify my statement that the starter who was actually the main meal
all the hard work and the heavy lifting is really in testing these different process theories and
understanding how the free energy principle operates in this particular context with this
particular creature this particular institution this particular aspect of self-organization
so having said that then what is the free energy principle well it's sort of
transmuted to a certain extent depending upon how the story is told nowadays one would really
tell the story from the point of view of a physicist trying to understand
self-organization under a particular constraint and that constraint is that you are
trying to understand the dynamics and the physics and the principles of least action
that would apply to something now that may sound really trivial but it's in fact quite an important
starting point if you're if you want to talk about something then you have to say well what defines
a thing what separates the thing from nothing or from something else and immediately you get into
the game of defining how you'd separate the states of a thing from something else the states that
were external say to that thing and this leads you into the world of Markov blankets and conditional
independences statistical devices that enable you to say that there is some independence or
disentanglability between the states of this thing and the states of everything else and
basically what happens is when you apply Hamilton's principle of least action
to the dynamics of joint systems that possess a Markov blanket that separates the thing
we usually call it a particle from something else then what emerges is basically a Bayesian brain
or a Bayesian mechanics that could be applied to a brain but also to with them a stat all to a virus
which is why I was saying before the way that we deal with things isn't a much we usually start
at you know with very very simple systems so to cut a long story short what you are doing is
engaging the same sort of questions and formalisms that people in physics would engage if they're
trying to understand non-equilibrium steady state dynamics and why is that different from 20th century
physics well because most of 20th century physics was all about equilibrium systems it's all about
some idealized gases it's all about second laws that apply to closed systems and by closed systems
what I mean is that you've got this sort of system of exchangeable particles that's in a heat bath
or in a heat reservoir and I use the word heat bath here because the question that
somebody interested in open systems would be asking where did the heat bath come from
and what's outside the heat bath and how on earth did the heat bath maintain itself
so you now started to ask questions that people in the life sciences have been asking people like
Varela in terms of water poesis you know how on earth does the boundary from my perspective
the Markov blanket the heat bath that contains the idealized internal states of inquiry that
define the particle in question on the system in question how on earth is that maintained
and even more simply it's very existence and persistence what does that imply and if one
just follows through the maths that you would normally apply to an uncontained
states of the system to a contained set of states that are contained within a Markov blanket
that comprises sensory and active states and then what you end up with is a functional expression
or functional form for the dynamics that is formally exactly the same that you would find
in the other kinds of mechanics so you know you can think of the free energy principle as
just basically introducing a different kind of mechanics that is a complement to
on the one hand classical mechanics that would apply to heavenly bodies and massive bodies
where there were very few random fluctuations in play because they're so big or cold
you on the one hand the second kind of mechanics that you'll get in the absence of a Markov blanket
would be statistical mechanics thermodynamics fluctuation theorems that apply to lots of very
hot very small things that don't have conserved dynamics where the random fluctuations dominate
over the classical conserved dynamics of of Newtonian mechanics and you could even apply
to quantum mechanics and the move here is just to work with the complex root of probability
distributions Bayesian beliefs but the wave function squared now becomes a Bayesian belief
but you don't have any Bayesian nuts in either in any of the classical mechanics
or the quantum mechanics or the statistical stochastic mechanics and that's because
none of these mechanics have a separation between the inside and the outside and it
comes back to something you mentioned earlier on which is the notion of hidden states and you
remember you and I should have picked up on that when you were framing Bayesian thinking so the
whole point of Bayesian thinking is there has to be an inside and an outside so there has to be
observable consequences of causes that are unobservable so you know before you can even
talk about inference there has to be something about which you are making an inference and there
has to be some data some observable consequences of these hidden states or hidden causes that now
you plug into your Bayes rule and you know we can then go back to the story about moving a posterior
from a prior given the likelihood of your observable sensory data but just standing back from that
construct means you now have to have a physics that makes a distinction between stuff on the inside
the internal states of the system and stuff that is hidden states that are hidden that
will now support a Bayesian inference and of course this is exactly what is supplied by the
Markov blanket so the Markov blanket is a set of states that intervenes between the inside and the
outside that literally surrounds forms a blanket a shield a veil of a statistical sort that encompasses
entrails the internal states so now what plays out on the surface on the blanket states are now the
sensory data the observations of sensory evidence that are reporting the influence of the external
states on the outside that are hidden from the internal states because they are behind the Markov
blanket so you have to have a Markov blanket that separates the inside from the outside before you
can have a Bayesian mechanics and once you commit to and follow through the maths that would apply
to a partition of a universe into internal external and the intervening blanket states
that I repeat come themselves be divided into active and sensory states then you just get the
free entry principle and all that says is it looks as if any system that is equipped with a Markov
blanket and it has to be in order to define the thing in question will appear to infer
in virtue of the dynamics of its internal states the external states to put that more concretely
there will be an interpretation of the physical internal states as encoding the parameters
of beliefs Bayesian beliefs about external states and by parameters we're just talking
