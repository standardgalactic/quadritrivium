is not throwing billions of data points at your deep learning machine and millions of dollars
to a team of engineers who are trying to um handcraft and tune the parameters of the of
their particular variational autoencoder along short-term memory layers in your convolutional
network instead you will spend you will let the machine itself decide what is the most
informative data it needs to resolve its uncertainty it will run either um on an edge computing device
but it's only running your laptop and it should finish and convert within minutes to days as opposed
to days to months and it will cost you a hundred dollars or even ten dollars as opposed to up to
a million dollars so i'm deliberately completely overstating the benefits but the you know that
reversal of direction of travel is mathematically obvious it hits you in the face when you start to
sort of articulate computation and intelligence in terms of the presence of inference and just
look at the underlying maths in terms of the information geometry and then using things like
the djinsky equality to understand that in terms of the both the computational cost but also the
thermodynamic cost of computation so i think that's going to be um in principle i'm sure i'm
completely wrong i'm talking complete rubbish but in my little fantasy world data mining is a
thing of the past you won't need data farms because instead of going for mining big data these curious
machines will go and mine just the sparse data they need to resolve their uncertainty for what
they are for the context in which they operate so we'll see a move to edge computing with sparse
data but it will be base optimal in a sense it's just returning to the basic principles of optimal
basing design established in the 1950s by people like david lindy sort of revisited by people like
david mckine in terms of active learning in the 1990s and then apparently completely forgotten about
until the active inference movement or pushback against the direction of travel and
sort of standard deep learning approaches or even reinforcement learning without the curiosity
it's it's it's it's incredible to think about all of the avenues that it that this has the
potential to to expand with well i mean i don't know what to say carl you've been so so generous
i mean more than generous with with your time and i i consider it a great privilege and honor
that you have given me over three hours of your time to explain this that's that's quite the gift
and i greatly appreciate that is there any final comments that you want to say or anything that
you want to summarize or anything like that and and then also i'm very impressed with your stamina
stamina and also there's some you know the patience with which you ask your questions
wait for about 20 minutes for an answer that that is quite remarkable so thank you
no i the the pleasure is is all mine you have been very very generous and i am quite sure that
listeners will be very very thrilled to to hear all of your wonderful work that you've been doing
so um can't say enough thanks appreciate it
you
you
