objective function that now replaces utility functions and reinforcement learning it also
replaces the the principles that underlie active learning and things like optimal Bayesian design
in the sense that it grant funds these things and puts both of those two aspects of good behavior
together and in putting them together this objective function that underwrites the right
choices the right behaviors is just expected surprise or uncertainty which means that all
I need to do is to choose those behaviors that minimize or resolve uncertainty or maximize
information gain under prior preferences inherent in my charity model so that last statement is quite
crucial and what what it transpires to be or say the expected free energy transpires to be a mixture
of two components one of which is an epistemic information hungry seeking component and the
other one is a more pragmatic preference seeking component and put them together they are just
then minimizing overall uncertainty or minimizing the expected expected free energy crucially
that epistemic information seeking component is the the thing that underwrites curiosity
so if you look at the artificial curiosity literature the the key problem is has been
how do you articulate and mathematically formalize the drives to resolve curiosity
the sensation seeking the inquisitiveness that characterizes all of us certainly in
certainly in this conversation but you know I think all of us as little scientists just need
to live we have to be curious creatures and the expected free energy is basically that curiosity
that intrinsic motivation that's another word in your neuro robotics developmental neuro
robotics also known as expected salience and it puts it together with the surprise minimizing
aspects endowed by having prior preferences in your charity model I I expect myself to do this
kind of thing or encounter these kinds of outcomes but because I'm contextualizing that with this
information curiosity seeking component I've now got a complete objective function
that essentially equips active inference agents with curiosity so that is what is missing in AI
that no Alexa or no iPhone is ever going to ask you a question because it's curious about you
so the next generation of artificial intelligence well if it complies with the
the you know the variational principles of least action as articulated under active inference
should show a genuine interest in you because it will act or it will select those questions and
those actions or look at these websites or these data engage in this kind of data mining
simply to resolve uncertainty about its charity model of the world and if its charity model of
the world contains you it'll want to know about you and it will ask the best kinds of questions
that will maximally resolve its uncertainty about you so it will be genuinely interested in you
and you know in that sense then I think because it's got this curiosity inherent in its
selection of its actions I think it will then show a kind of artificial intelligence that is
much closer to the generalized artificial intelligence that people have been been aspiring to
but it does rest upon this upon putting the curiosity in as part of the package by minimizing
the expected free energy I have this this chilling a fantasy in my mind as you're telling me this
about you know my my uh Alexa or my my serial my phone asking me questions about just a very
very chilling kind of thing about it but I do agree with you I do think that that's probably the
the next step the next place because of how good algorithms are at trying to predict
based on things that we're searching or looking or things like that you know it's trying to to to
accurately get something if I put a search in google now it takes you know not even two seconds
right you know 10 years ago it took longer and you have to find all these things and it's trying
to curate the things for you that you're searching I could imagine that there's more of a not just
that the the AI is is receptive but then expressive in what they're trying to ask and inquire of you
the the the person that's searching which is there's a little bit more you're right there's like a
uh more of a two-way street there which is um definitely uh it's a little bit of a scary
thought to think about I think there could be really cool utilities to it but I definitely
think there's obviously like many things an inherent danger before I want to ask you about
the imaging techniques you've done because that's I mean as you say your day job is is uh
that's what you do and obviously you've been prolific in in those those areas I just want to
ask one thing just because it's relevant now and I think as we continue moving throughout
this you know second decade I guess of the 21st century
it's about your work with COVID-19 and I know this is a big big area big topic and
a lot of noise about the pandemic in all aspects I just want to ask you just generally you can
briefly just summarize you know kind of how what what your work was I believe was with uncertainty
in predictive models and how we understand things and how we understand um certain types of immunity
and things like that just kind of how you became involved or how you how you think about uh about
you know the the pandemic and and COVID and how um how you've been doing work in in that area
yes of course so um you know the answer to that question does come from my day job
which is using brain imaging and empirical data acquired through a variety of different ways of
peaking or breaching the mark of blanket or looking inside people's heads so you can do that with
things like functional magnetic resonance imaging which gives you sort of whole brain images every
second or so and reports fluctuations in coarse grained neural activity in different parts of
the brain right through to things like magneto and ethnography and equivalent EEG procedures which
give you a much temporary resolved picture or signals reporting electromagnetic fluctuations
in neural activity over your fractions of a millisecond but the price paid is that you lose
the spatial resolution but the point being is that these are ways of looking at the brain in action
and affording data empirical evidence for various hypotheses about the underlying functional brain
architectures of which we have been talking a lot some of the hierarchical architectures that
recurrent message passing entailed by different sacred encoding or other theories and in particular
something from my perspective trying to understand the failures of those architectures in terms of
false inference that ensues from for example breaking the precision control that we've been
talking about and how that might show up in people for example with schizophrenia or depression or
other neurological or psychiatric conditions so that's my day job and the link to the COVID
research is quite easy to demonstrate in the sense that what you are talking about when looking at a
message passing architecture and your own message passing architecture that is doing the belief
updating that is enacting the drives afforded by prediction errors in doing the belief updating
and causing activity in different parts of the brain this obviously can also be expressed as a
communication and a dissemination of information or influences so you've got the spread of messages
and bits of information from one neural population to another neural population
in order to make sense of the brain imaging data you actually have to have an underlying
generative model of this process and now we're talking about a generative model of the brain
that I as a scientist are using to make sense of my excitatory empirical data that comes from
the brain imaging and I deliberately phrased the the fundaments of these generative models in
terms of spreading information among neural populations because of course that is exactly
the same kind of generative model you'd use when trying to model the spread of a virus amongst
the populations that constitute a country or a region or a city so my involvement in the
the modeling of the coronavirus epidemic comes straight from the the observation that the
generative models the states based models the convolution models is a just technical terms
and the kinds of models that we use to make sense of brain imaging time series generated by
populations of neurons could be very quickly and efficiently repurposed to make sense of the
epidemiological time series generated by populations of people that were in various states of infection
symptomatic you know vaccination and the like so for the past two years my weekend job has now been
split behind between something called Bayesian model selection or structural learning which is
basically fiddling with your generative model until it minimizes its free energy or maximizes its
marginal likelihood in relation to the the data that's incrementally becomes available
and different kinds of data on the one hand and then trying to do the free energy principle and
make it simpler and more accessible on the on the other hand so that's how I became involved
you know different levels of engagement working as a panelist on the independent
sage which was a sort of a public facing version was meant to be a compliment a public facing
compliment to the the scientific advisory group on emergencies that they were supplying the
cabinet office and the government with with advice we were much more in its original formulation
sort of public service facing information dissemination and public engagement sort of
initiative run by academics and you know I have been involved on other advisory bodies
largely motivated or resting upon the the predictions made by technical school dynamic
causal modeling of the time series data that allows you to optimize the parameters of that
generative model given all the data you have up until this point in time and then run the model
forward under you sometimes under different scenarios that allows you to make sort of
forecasts about what would happen if I did this or did that that can be useful for
um nuancing the advice given to to you know politicians and decision makers when considering
you know should we relax lockdown rules at this point should we encourage this age group to
take up vaccines for example yeah no that's that's super super salient and instrumental so that's
that's uh that's incredible work um so we've already kind of talked about it so let's let's
get into your day job you're you're with the imaging techniques um so the thing that I think is
your initial claim to fame here is the statistical parametric mapping and then I think also subsequently
the voxel based morphometry these are the two imaging techniques most people will know a CT scan
an MRI scan I do want to ask you about fMRIs some people may know about diffusion tensor imaging
there's all different types of ways of scanning the brain uh so maybe just tell us what these
two things are the statistical parametric mapping the voxels and then just kind of how that sits in
with mapping of the brain uh overall right well you're interested in the notion of a CT scan and
many people will also be familiar with x-rays your images um the peak behind the kerb and get on
you know give you a picture of what's going on on the inside um so statistical parametric mapping
uh can be conceived of as producing x-rays of significance of significant activation
and by activation I mean a change so going back to this notion that the interesting stuff is
in the processes the uh you know from the point of view of the free energy principle the belief
updating so you needed a way of forming x-rays of a certain kind that reported where the belief
updating and the neural activity and the hemodynamic or the blood flow consequences of that hemodynamic
activity where and when they were occurring in the brain so SPM or statistical parametric
mapping is just that it's just it's just the construction of x-rays or CT scans where the
values of the image at any point in the image usually known as a pixel or a voxel correspond
to a statistic testing a particular hypothesis about the pattern of the um the fluctuations in
neural activity over which you have usually some experimental control so when people talk about
activations what they basically mean is has there been uh have I been able to evoke
neuronal or belief updating and neuronal message passing and thereby neural activity
and or everything that supports that neural activity by presenting this kind of stimulus to
the subject uh relative to that kind of stimulus so you're just comparing the evoked responses
over time and then summarizing those differences in terms of a statistic and then putting that
statistic for that whole part of the brain into an image and thereby creating a whole brain map
or a your next statistical x-ray of the functional anatomy so it's now unlike a CT scan which is a
structural anatomy this is now the functional anatomy because you're you're if you like summarizing
a functional process and very similar approaches um you're taken to um in in EEG or electromagnetic
and electrophysiological um procedures and you mentioned voxel based morphology that is simply
the application of this statistical x-ray this SPM like technology to the special case of sequences
of structural images so you're normally in the game we're trying to infer to this group of patients
say with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease do they show a systematic difference in
their structural anatomy again in this instance uh using a SPM or statistical x-ray but in this
instance the statistic is reporting the significance of the difference in the composition of the anatomy
as measured with um with magnetic resonance imaging usually or could be CT scans um by uh
but using here not time series data but usually data points from multiple subjects that are care
that are carefully carefully selected so it sounds like there's a there's a there's an
integration of trying to have the integration of looking at the functional pieces in time of a
process for a structural picture is what it sounds like it's trying to do how you use this for
schizophrenia particularly how did you use these methods to understand more um schizophrenia and
how literally the images of the brain for for individuals with schizophrenia how it looks and
how it functions and maybe just talk about that as well I'll just as a as a as a footnote
I worked inpatient uh with individual and outpatient but inpatient with individuals that
have schizophrenia so I I've uh I've been around these folks for a good part of my career and
they're they're very very fascinating individuals um in terms of personality in terms of their
cognition in terms of their brain functioning and you know being on plenty of uh uh you know
treatment plans and big big big long meetings with psychiatrists and neuroscientists uh trying
to understand um schizophrenia but then also understand and how to try to provide clinical
services to individuals with schizophrenia so I'm curious as well personally almost of of
how how did you use these these techniques to try and understand specifically uh individuals
with schizophrenia right again that's an excellent question and it speaks to the motivation for much
of the theoretical work that we've been talking about so understanding um what has gone wrong in
certain people um qualifying this of course you know certain schizophrenia would not like you to
think that their brains have gone wrong that's right that's right they just have a different
reality that's all exactly um I found that's mathematically true by the complete class there
but that's another story um so so um the way that all this fits together is um in terms of
understanding much of psychiatry and many neurological syndromes in terms of false
inference and if you can understand the experiences of a psychiatric patient in terms of false
inference then now we already have a mechanics that is what we've been talking about active
inference the free energy principle and predicted coding base in brain we already have a mechanics
at hand to ask at what point has there been some aberrant um message passing or belief updating
that could lead to this uh this false inference so you may be asking well why on earth would you
want to cast all of psychiatry as false inference um well it's a very natural way of accommodating
that that's where the symptoms lie that's where the ontology of psychiatry lies it's in belief
updating it's in beliefs about the world so when I talk about false inference I imagine that you're
in a simple sense of type one and type two errors false positives and false negatives
so when you think about say an hallucination what is that what it's just inferring something is there
when it's not it's just a type one kind of false inference what about neglect syndromes like
nausea dissociative syndromes um they are just false inferences of a second kind inferring
something is not there when it is uh and I think you know if you think about it nearly all
psychiatric conditions can be construed in this way either falsely inferring something is there
when it's not and vice versa so what that means is you you now move on to the uh the more challenging
and pragmatic questions well what could account for this kind of um false inference and the questions
then um can be posed either to the structure of the implicit generative model that is
entamed so entailed by our brains or the the process theories that undergird the message
passing and the physiology of that message passing and what you're basically talking about is a form
of disconnection now this disconnection may sound odd to talk you know immediately about
disconnection but remember the architecture of any distributed system is defined by its connectivity
the very notion of a hierarchy depends upon the absence of certain connections that would otherwise
transcend levels in say a linear or subsumption hierarchy so connections are everything in terms
of sculpting and defining the architectures that endow the brain with an implicit generative model
of you know its lived world and furthermore the message passing that you know enacts the drives
and the belief updates um you know the precision weighted prediction has that we've been talking
about and those are just expressions of influences from one part of the brain to the other part of
the brain so it's all about the connectivity and that means that you need to now use the
empirical data in a way that enables you to answer questions about disconnections
and they can come in many flavors you know as a neurologist you know subscribing to
