Checking Converging Dialogues/#121 - Unifying the Bayesian Brain Model and Free Energy Principleï¼š A Dialogue with Karl Friston.txt
 It seems there's a beautiful exchange between two individuals, one of whom is Carl Edwards, a proponent of the free energy principle and active inference in machine learning. The discussion revolves around the inefficiencies of current data-intensive AI models, particularly deep learning, in terms of both computational and thermodynamic costs. Carl argues that by adhering to Hampton's principle of least action (a free energy principle), we can achieve more efficient, less resource-intensive models of intelligence.

Key points from the conversation include:

1. **Energy Consumption**: The global energy consumption by data centers for tasks like e-commerce and data mining is expected to be significant, with projections pointing towards 20-22% of total energy usage by 2025.

2. **Free Energy Principle**: According to Carl, the free energy principle offers a more thermodynamically and statistically sound approach to inference and learning. It suggests that we should minimize the cost of belief updating (which is related to thermodynamic 'cost' via the Zhuninsky equation) and adhere to accuracy constraints.

3. **Sparse Data**: Instead of relying on big data, Carl envisions a future where AI systems only collect the sparse data necessary to resolve their uncertainties, leading to more efficient edge computing solutions that can operate on devices like laptops rather than in large data centers.

4. **Optimal Basing Design**: The discussion references past work from the 1950s by David Lindley and later work by David McKay in the 1990s on optimal bassing, which Carl suggests has been overlooked but is relevant to modern active learning approaches.

5. **Active Inference Movement**: Carl sees the active inference movement as a corrective to the direction of travel in deep learning and machine learning, offering a more principled approach that aligns with fundamental information geometry.

6. **Appreciation**: Both individuals express gratitude for the opportunity to engage in such an in-depth conversation. Carl's generosity in sharing his time and expertise is acknowledged, as well as the patience and stamina in addressing the questions posed.

In summary, Carl Edwards presents a compelling argument for rethinking current AI practices to be more efficient and less energy-intensive by leveraging principles from thermodynamics and information geometry. The conversation highlights the potential for significant changes in how we approach computation and intelligence, with an emphasis on sustainability and practicality.
