Checking Bold Conjectures with Paras Chopra/#25 Chris Fields - Fundamental Reality Can Never Be Understood.txt
 In this conversation, Dr. Chris Fields discussed the concept of holographic principle and its implications for our understanding of information exchange between systems. The holographic principle posits that the amount of information that can be extracted from a volume of space is limited by the surface area of that region, not its volume. This idea extends to all scales, suggesting that even at the quantum level, interactions are fundamentally about exchanging information encoded on the 'surface' of a system, which could be an atom or a black hole event horizon.

Dr. Fields also touched upon the connection between this view of information exchange and panpsychism, the idea that consciousness or experience is a fundamental feature of the universe. He argued that if our experiences are understood as outcomes of our interactions with the world, then it's reasonable to consider that all systems, biological or not, may have experiences as they interact with their environment.

The implications of this view are profound and challenge our traditional ways of thinking about consciousness and observation. It suggests a universe where everything is interconnected through information exchange, and every system has its own form of experience or 'feeling' at some level.

Personally, Dr. Fields mentioned that his panpsychist outlook has likely influenced him to be a nicer person, particularly since he started meditating about 10 years ago.

Overall, the conversation highlighted the interconnectedness of all systems through information exchange and the possibility that consciousness or experience might not be limited to organisms with complex nervous systems, but could be a universal feature of reality.
