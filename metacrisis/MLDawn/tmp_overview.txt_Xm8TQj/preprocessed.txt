============================
Checking MLDawn/Active inference explained with Prof. Karl Friston.txt
1. The question about whether we will ever fully understand how the brain works is complex and touches on deep philosophical issues related to consciousness, selfhood, and metacognition.
2. Professor Friston believes we've made significant progress in understanding the brain but acknowledges that there's still a long way to go.
3. The discussion about understanding the brain involves not just scientific and technical challenges but also philosophical ones, such as those posed by David Chalmers' "meta-problem" or "hard problem of consciousness."
4. Selfhood is a part of what makes humans different from other animalsâ€”it's the idea that one is a person and in charge of their own experiences and actions within their mind (referred to as Jonathan models).
5. The conversation between the host and Professor Friston covered a wide range of topics, including causal inference, the structure of neural networks, and the nature of consciousness.
6. Both parties enjoyed the discussion, which delved into many layers of thought, despite the potential for it to extend for hours.
7. Professor Friston expressed appreciation for the opportunity to speak and shared that he could have continued discussing these topics all night, though he was mindful of the editing process that awaited him.
8. The host apologized for potentially taking too much of Professor Friston's time due to the depth and breadth of the conversation, but Professor Friston assured that it was a worthwhile and enjoyable exchange.
