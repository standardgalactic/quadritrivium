I work on fisheries but I also work on the physiology of fish growth and you could say
that's very esoteric. But fish breathe water and there is no very little oxygen in the water so
they have to work the head off to get the water across the mouth that they can extract the oxygen
that they need. Now that is the work that they have to do and on the other hand for them for fish
it's very easy to grab something to eat but once they have eaten something a big smaller fish
they still have to burn it to link it with oxygen right but they have to extract from the water.
So the big work is not catching a prey the big work is getting the oxygen out of the water into
their bodies the gills are very efficient about 80 percent there is being extracted but but moving
that water is lots of work. What I want to say is they you find that in biology the people
that have projected our mammal consideration which is we have to eat lots of food so in order to
maintain our own temperature at a high level. Well that's the reason why we are not like
reptile eating every six weeks we need to eat all the time and so food is the thing but fish
it's not the thing the thing is for them is is breathing and and you can see the problem they
have with breathing in that they are moving now rapidly toward the poles because the temperature
gets higher. It's true that there is less oxygen in the water but the important thing is that fish
have don't have their own temperature their their own temperature is that of the water
and then the water temperature increase they they need more oxygen and the thing is not
the problem is not so much that they get that the oxygen there is less oxygen in the water it's true
but the big problem is that they need more when when the water is warm so they have a double whammy
they need more oxygen and there is less in it now you find though that most
most doctor work and and thesis work that students do is about food is about the the the fish feeding
well the problem is breathing and now it's being realized now because of global warming
that fish have a problem breathing and that's the reason for example while they move toward cooler
water water that remains cool to toward the poles and and so but in the literature you find all kind
of question that people ask themselves are they moving in the north hemisphere to the north
toward the north are they moving because there is more food there no they're moving there because
they just want to breathe the most of the ocean is getting warmer and that causes the fish to
to want to move forward in the south and you can see this i don't know if if it's one degree here
or there but in the u.s. you you get fish now in new york that before in was uh where in florida
in bc where i live you get fish now that way before in california in australia you get in
sydney fish that were before in in brisbane basically my work on on this oxygen problem
was was my dissertation about 40 years ago and it was totally ignored and now it's it's because
of global warming that that is is being revived it's getting some attention it's it is it breaks
your heart because the other stuff that i do about about shifting baseline about fishing down
mine food web and so on these are these are obvious things is a trivial thing in in a sense but but
the the oxygen thing is the most subtle thing that and you can think about it only if you get rid of
this mammalian bias that we have that food is everything large fish are the ones that are
most that have most trouble because the surface area of the gill divided by the weight is lowest
the the Norwegian are quite explicit about about it this is one country that is located
in high latitude that will see for a while the the an increase of the of the biodiversity and
an increase of the major stocks of fish whereas other countries for example
in a tropics they they they are the the losers again because the fish that that leave the water
are not being replaced by any if you present the the fish catchers predicted fish catchers in
latitudinal zones the the cold tempered countries will benefit and the warm and tropical and
subtropical countries will will be um will be devastated fishery wise and you can see that
on for example um the on our coast the the the the salmon in california are wiped out
right they they are gone they in washington and oregon they are not doing well in bc they are
not doing well but in alaska they're doing very well and in in in arctic alaska they are salmon
ones that are establishing themselves and in we don't know about them because they don't have
they didn't have salmon before so it is happening this this this transition is already happening
and uh with salmon is is very visible because because uh this is there is a major industry
bill built around salmon if you go to a country like like britain they fish now fish that that
were before in spain and the spined fish before that that were in marocco and in other words the
the catch composition of the the the composition of the catch has already changed and we have we
published in in 2013 a paper in nature which which we call the mean temperature of the catch
the the the concept and basically you you assign to each fish species a preferred temperature
which which is uh which is very stable and you can compute then the mean temperature of the catch
which is the the catch multiplied with the temperature of of that fish and uh you average it
over all species and you you you can see in all countries of the world in most countries of the
world the the mean temperature of the catch in start picking up in the 70s now 80s the fish
were very much smarter than us they picked up very early and it the hockey stick the famous
hockey stick that man and and others you you can you can see the fish doing it
