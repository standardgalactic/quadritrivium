the spot each of you out of all the things that you're learning about some people call it the
meta crisis I usually call it the human predicament you're well familiar with the different buckets
of risks and crises we face like what is one thing in coming decades that you're most concerned about
out of out of the whole universe if each of you could just speak to that for a minute or two.
Yeah so for me I just love my food and one of the main things that I'm concerned about is
no longer being able to produce food at the scale that we do currently because
the fertilizer specifies and whatnot won't be available anymore or if not that the fuel for
the tractors that we rely on now to produce this food will just will be reallocated to other places
or just it just won't be there for certain local areas and that's one of the reasons why I'm doing
what I'm doing now is to relearn the old ways of agriculture not to return to an old way but
to understand how do we do this in the absence of oil and machinery I think that's a
I just find that intrinsically motivating to do that because for the you might call it selfish
reason that I love food not that I think the food is going to disappear in my lifetime but
just as a silly example that's why one of those that is one of my main concerns.
It's not silly and I don't consider it a selfish interest and I love food as much or more than
you do Priscilla. Similar to James that's why I entered the field I am in right now I remember
when I told my parents hey I want to go to the college of food agricultural natural resource
sciences at the University of Minnesota and they looked at me and they were like we crossed the
Pacific to escape rice paddies and now you want to go back into food what are we going to tell
your grandmother and I told them you tell her that as long as people eat I will have a job
and it's really the basic currency of our societies because yes we need energy to produce
food but without food there's no peace you can't change the world on an empty stomach
and so I really am concerned about our food and water quality and the the resource wars that are
going to break out militarism is on my mind a lot everyone jokes about world war three we are living
in the apocalypse already and that's one thing that gives me hope when you understand the planetary
boundaries and the social boundaries of human patterns right all empires collapse eventually
and so thinking about it that way means that it really singles down a few of the things you
should be actually caring about and I think food and water is one of them and how are we going to
set up governance models and frameworks at different levels neighborhoods towns cities
municipalities what governance structures are in place so we can navigate these hard conversations
about how to allocate resources because we do have enough food in the world to feed everyone
it's a resource allocation problem and you know a corporate monopolization problem with big food
big ag controlling our food supply chains right now and I feel like it's doable and I don't think
the answer is a million organic farms that's not sustainable or viable it's not about everyone
becoming a farmer that's not how a society functions we need all roles all skills all
types of passions but yeah food and water is something I'm taking on myself to cultivate
skills related to that because I think it's fun like you all have said I love food and so that's
something I'm focused on both in my personal and professional life that's a difficult question
because there's so many uh risks and crises that we're facing to be honest I think I'm more
concerned with the way that we respond to those rather than the risks and crises happening because
I think they will happen and I would love to be proven wrong on that um I think that we will have
food shortages and there will be problems with water and there will be civil unrest um what I am
what scares me more is the way that we respond because if we look through history the times when
the economy's gone bad uh and we've had shortages in terms of resources that has had really really
bad knock-on effects in terms of the version of humanity that we become I mean we've become really
really awful people um so yeah what I really fear is that that this these conversations don't translate
to the things that Priscilla's talking about us actually thinking about different governance
structures and thinking about how we're going to distribute those scarce resources and how we
educate people so they have the skills to manage when we have to relocalize and can't depend on
these long supply chains um rather than just waiting for it to happen and then it turning really really
bad so I guess that's what what scares me yeah if I might just add also that that's also a motivation
for me it's not just my own love of food it's an understanding that when human populations feel the
squeeze and they see another human population over there who's doing well they this human population
who's doing poorly understands also that they can just steal what they have and that gets nasty
and that is sort of a a pattern that you can read from history that tends to happen
so following up on that each of you how do you maintain hope and cultivate resilience in the
face of what you know about the world and and I would be so bold as to say you know more than
the average 23 and 27 year olds about all these risks and systems especially given reading the
news every day of what's going on in Israel and Palestine and Ukraine and it's 45 degrees celsius
today in India which is like 110 or something like that you get daily reminders of this stuff so
how do you maintain hope and practice resilience and healthy habits knowing all this stuff
yeah I don't think we can just magically have hope from some external source I think we have to
actively create hope and yeah I see so much beauty in the world in nature and in people
and in relationships and communities but also in art and knowledge and culture and when I started
realizing the extent to which we're destroying that beauty in its various forms I would shift
between two mindsets on the one's hand I think well it's all fucked anyway so there's nothing I can
do excuse my French and on the other extreme I think that I have to personally save the world
and neither of those are helpful because neither of them lead to action so the mindset I've
currently developed instead through which I find a lot of resilience is firstly to feel
those things so you know I do get really really sad when I hear the news and when I see
nature suffering and people suffering I'm really feeling that but then also feeling
the joy but at the beauty that's still there so and the sort of mantra I use to motivate myself
is how can I use what I have to do what I can to protect some of the beauty and bring it forward
with me into the future and I think that if everyone does that even if it's in a really small way like
taking better care of your back garden or helping out an elderly neighbor if we all use what we have
to do what we can then we're creating hope I would say deep time deep time gives me a lot
of hope because when you zoom out and understand how we got here you realize how recent the current
order of things are dominant global north white capitalist whatever you want to call it society
is so new and back to what others have said before when you understand that it recalibrates your
expectations and that ironically gives me more positivity in the face of the poly crisis because
when you've understood that there are material financial and social limitations it recalibrates
expectations and yes that comes to the period of grief like was mentioned before it also alleviates a
lot of pressure yeah we might have some sort of mad max guns defending farm period but it's not
going to last forever right nothing lasts forever in nature and so nothing bad will last forever in
human human systems yes there will be ecological system impacts that will probably last forever
in the Anthropocene but I I think going back to that social governance like all the dire things
we're seeing in the news those will stretch out for a relatively long period of times compared
to our lifetimes but I know that the earth will rebound we will find a place in the future to
govern ourselves in a way that's equitable and sustainable and just understanding that no revolution
has been peaceful and I don't mean just like the revolution on the streets I mean the revolution
inside doing that healing work that shadow work that unlearning the breaking and creating cycles
and friend circles and families and communities it's not just about your neighborhood it's about
the regional impacts and what gives me hope is cultivating myself it's about gardening cooking
at home foraging being a better biker because right now we're living in an information economy
data knowledge cells in the future that knowledge and data has to be uploaded into our brains
it's a very fair and high 451 situation but knowing skills and having less dependency on
scary supply chains that are fragile gives me a lot of hope and empowerment make friends
with people who know skills that's how you build community it's not about having a million people
behind you and honestly you know there's that often cited often cited number of like you need
2% of the mass to have a critical mass to do something I think it's even less than that now
considering we have relatively stable telecommunication systems right the message can be amplified so
much quicker now and so your community extends beyond geographic boundaries and then what also
gives me hope is communications really trying to use asset-based communications because that really
flips the narrative it goes from deficit and scarcity which is what is used in propaganda
and news and media to really feel like we don't have what we need but we do know what we need
and we do have what we need and it's just again trying to create narratives even the most well
intentioned circles like charities will say we need more volunteers because there's too many
poor hungry homeless folks and I yes but we could also state it in a different way that
really empowers people by saying we have the resources to house feed and uplift everyone
join us in this movement it really you know lands emotionally different in people and it might
instigate action no matter how big or small I think it's this weird world is small and big at the
same time and people do not fit into it but just pick something if it's safe enough to try go for
it I think this this at least in the US the academic system that many of us go through really
kind of pushes for perfection and if it's not going to work don't do it at all but I'm trying
to push back against that myself and not be stuck in this cerebral space of just like despair so
that's my take on it one of the things that really makes me study this and makes me
like want to be a human at this time is the fact that there's no guarantee that we make it through
this bottleneck or these bottlenecks of the coming decades which is like there's a sense of danger in
that and it's kind of scary but at the same time that's what makes it exciting and then also
there are like human experiences that at an embodied level I have felt and I know
like for example I love jiu-jitsu I love training when obviously not when I'm traveling but when
I'm back in a stable environment and there's something about that combat and exerting yourself
so strenuously that after it you're steaming up and there's just sweat pouring off you
and the endorphins that are released at the end of that and the conversations that are
subsequently had with the friends that you have made in the gym there's a comradeship there that
is just a beautiful feeling and so to maintain hope in this situation I know that that's
that's like intrinsically rewarding and valuable and there's there's no amount of theory that's
going to refute that for me I know that that is valuable and so I say to myself okay this is worth
preserving so and then I bounce out and I as Priscilla said I try to gain a perspective and I say
okay across time I would like to preserve this if that's possible how do I go about doing that
and then the how do I go about doing that is the challenge that's the exciting part
and there's no guarantee that we win but why not give it our best shot is how I'm thinking about it
so so building on that you mentioned jiu-jitsu uh Priscilla mentioned a couple things um maybe
each of you could expand a little bit on the practices or uh meditations or skills or new
behaviors that you've incorporated in your personal life as a response to your own
understanding of of the metacrisis the great simplification and how all these things interrelate
um yeah so for me understanding the metacrisis I had to realize that I had several behaviors
and ways of thinking that I took for granted but which were actively reinforcing the super
organism so over the last year I've tried to adopt lifestyle choices and behavior choices
which I can imagine as being more characteristic of a more sustainable system so firstly I really
tried to move away from this constant craving for more and more more and more stuff more and more
stimulation and that's a constant battle um but I've tried very hard to actively slow down my pace
of life to value quality over quantity and to remove as many distractions as possible so that
I can focus on the present and what we have and that's been helped through meditation through
getting off social media and just yeah actively creating space and time for silence um and for
silent reflection and learning to actually crave the silence rather than the stimulation
um so I really enjoyed that and then learning to take joy and pleasure out of stuff that comes
for free I realized that previously a lot of the stuff I found fun was in some way associated with
consumption whereas now um I take a lot of pleasure out of things like time in nature I love going on
long walks time with friends and family an interesting conversation and dancing and writing
and trying to incorporate those things into my daily life and then in terms of mindset changes
I've had a big change related to nature primarily through food because like James I also love food
and I've been putting a lot of more intention and awareness behind what I'm putting in my body
and where it comes from and I'm so lucky that I live in an amazing part of the world with amazing
local produce but this sort of intention behind what I'm putting in my body has made me realize
that my health is totally tethered to the health of nature and of earth's ecosystems and my actions
are impacting that health and that has given me such a profound respect for nature and for all
forms of life right now when I look out the window I see life in the tree I don't just see a tree
and that's a very different mindset to oh I should make the environmentally friendly choice because
of climate change so that's been a mindset a big mindset shift for me and then the other
one I just want to touch on briefly is moving away from closed-minded in-group out-group thinking
so I really tried to actively seek out and engage in conversations with people who have
opinions I disagree with and who come from different backgrounds or beliefs and going
into those conversations with the attitude that I want to learn as much as possible and I'm open
to the idea that I'm wrong and I'm going to update my opinion based on that conversation
and that also has been a big a big mindset shift for me and it's really taught me to be a lot more
open-minded and to realize that I am basically wrong about everything yeah and I do think overall
the more I learn about the metacrisis and the more I develop sort of a nuanced understanding of it I
do think it comes down to a shift in consciousness so yeah I try to live the change I want to see
in the world and hopefully can inspire some people to do the same because if we all collectively
do that then it triggers change higher up. Let me ask you put you on the spot Natasha do you
think there's something unique in your situation or your genetics or your upbringing or are the
changes you made that you just described easily adaptable by people watching this episode
that are 23 and having similar thoughts? I think that definitely these changes can be
adopted by anyone. What I will say is because I've thought a lot about this what I think
is unique in my upbringing is that I was exposed from a young age to very high level conversations
my grandparents lived in this little town in south of France which was like this hub of
international academics and creatives and film directors and artists so from a young age I'd
be at dinner parties with like Nobel Prize winners and that was normal to me and so I learned
from a young age to like crave that learning and to want to be more interested in learning
something new than in whoever I believed in and I think that's led me to where I am now because
my involvement in this space and this work was in no way predicated by me being like a tree
hugging hippie or a radical anarchist or whatever it's purely from that craving for knowledge and then
when finding that knowledge that makes sense being willing to incorporate that so I think
anyone can make these changes but it's about being willing and open to finding out something new
and the idea that everything you might have taken for granted and believed up to that point is wrong.
Thank you. What are some practices or meditation or new things that you've incorporated into your
personal life after integrating this into your mental view of the future? A very basic thing
is something Daniel Schmockenberger mentioned at the Norsegan Foundation he said curate your
social media feed so that the sorts of things that crop up are related to this like the Stockholm
Institute planetary boundaries framework that sort of thing and that's actually that really
works because I find myself going to my phone and then seeing this stuff late at night and my head
is like no I don't want to study that anymore I'm too tired so now I'll just put the phone down
put another thing that helps me sometimes I think of this knowledge as like a burden
sometimes I frame it in that sort of a way and I say oh my god why do I have to know all this
why do I have to be here in this time when all you and me both brother yeah when the
shit's hitting the fan and it's chaotic and it's tumultuous but then I say to myself okay useless
you're here now so let's just be here and see what we can do about this and I sort of recalibrate
or reframe in my mind how I see it and I say to myself all right this is probably one of the biggest
the human predicament the metacrisis slaying the superorganism whatever you want to say is probably
