that I'm here is purely driven by this curiosity and this craving to understand reality and the
world around me as much as possible and to get as close as possible to the truth rather than holding
to any set of beliefs and I think that's yeah also what really motivates me in this field is
that it is it's based on science and it's based on fact and if you're curious enough to go there
yeah this is where we get in addition to that curiosity has also helped me navigate triggers
you have to protect your energy and pick your battles online especially when you're trying to
be a communicator like myself it's not about being this missionary convincing people they
should care about ecological collapse it's really leading with questions if someone disagrees with
you and I try to remind myself why do they think this way and then lead with questions rather than
falling into arguments or that divide that we see so present across geographies and cultures
right now so I love that curiosity framing talking about binaries let's go to the one about
intergenerational relationships with the climate and energy and economic situation
I'm about 30 years older than the three of you and so you know I've I've got 30 years of living
in a world that was largely functional and amazing under my belt now educating younger people
on these things how do the three of you and I'll let each of you speak feel about the
seemingly perpetual intergenerational conflict and blaming in our current
culture and from your perspective is it possible that we could move past such a phenomenon and
how in one word heal everyone needs to heal intergenerational trauma has been a big topic on
my mind a good chunk of my life and I think it's really important to unpack when talking about
conflict and blaming I come from a family of immigrants who fled the Vietnam war I'm Vietnamese
my parents are immigrants and refugees and outside of their story universally there's conflict
militarism war PTSD everyone experiences trauma to some different degree and that really affects
parenting that manifests in money trauma how we relate to the economy and that affects how we
relate to each other as people and so to address intergenerational conflict and blaming I think
we have to then recognize intergenerational value for those of us who are lucky to have elders in
our lives you know I had my grandma I'm eternal grandma and I think about how in the US there's
such a sad attitude about older folks there's ageism in the workplace there's ageism when it
comes to political social values but we have to know that all these movements that we're a part
of now the environmental movement the economic movement they were all founded by people who
came before us right so elders have wisdom and value and Nate I don't think you're an elder quite
yet but in some ways you are like our community elder right you have lots of ideas and experiences
share it right and it comes back to the whole constraint of our economy because capitalism
in the US means that we're bound to our day jobs we have time constraints and then we don't have the
time privilege to then invest in relationships and I think investing in relationships healing
recognizing when our emotions get the best of us is really key to then unlocking
very generative conversations and having intergenerational movements because
it's not young people versus old people at all you need all of us involved and one book I read
recently there's an author a local author here in the state she wrote a book called can we please
give the police department to the grandmothers and I think it was a beautiful exercise of
imagination and how we can then rethink the way we relate to one another rethink what it means
to be safe because at the end of the day we're very emotional beings and everyone is really just
seeking to be heard seen understood and that affirmation is important if we're really trying
to build safety nets safety nets for whom who who is benefiting from these safety nets we think
it's good for us but maybe someone else doesn't feel safe from that safety net so when we begin
to heal and talk about mental health and really holistic health I think it's I think it's going
to be a big part in moving forward to to bridge these gaps yeah I couldn't agree more healing is
important and I remember in my mind I thought of it this way I considered there are sort of
four key elements in like the individual human's life and I call them the most basic basics it's
like food make sure you get your food right make sure you get your exercise right make sure you
get your sleep right but also make sure you get your social relationships right so that speaks to
Nate I think you formulated it by saying something like become a fully stacked behaviorally stacked
human being and you yeah you pointed the same thing sleep food exercise because how can we expect to
face these issues and overcome them if we're in any way ill in terms of our health that's not to say
it's impossible but why not optimize for these elements of human life because we can but to this
point about blaming to be honest I don't really I don't really see it I don't see my generation
blaming the older generation one thing that annoys me is this the fact that it's the older
generations who have all the resources and money but it's the younger generation who has all the
energy but missing the resources and money so there's a clear sort of niche there for collaboration
and why it's not happening I'm not sure so I wouldn't really blame I actually I don't even
think blaming is productive what's the use it gets us nowhere so why not instead of blaming
seek to collaborate and seek to somehow create the mechanisms that can funnel resources from
the older generations to the younger generations and in a collaborative sort of
agreement between all of us yeah I couldn't agree more with that I think it's about collaboration
rather than blaming I really see intergenerational blaming as a huge waste of time and waste of
energy because at the end of the day we're all in this situation together and it's no
individual's fault that we got here but it's everyone's responsibility regardless of what
decades you were born in to contribute towards responding and yeah as James said maybe we have
our generation has more energy or time hopefully over which to enact those responses but there is
no way that we can do it without the experience and also importantly the leverage of older
generations so I would love to see older generations firstly stop saying that it's down to our generation
secondly stops having conversations about these topics in closed rooms amongst academic elite
and instead actively engaging in the intergenerational transfer of knowledge and expertise and skills
so that our generation and younger generations can be equipped as best as possible to face the
challenges ahead and also I'd like to see the older generation engaging themselves in facing
those challenges and many are already but we need more people in all generations doing that
in terms of moving past the intergenerational blaming what I would love to see is if somehow
we could adopt a collective mentality which saw this current version of humanity not as a final
product that either has to be defended by older generations or destroyed by younger generations
but rather as a work in progress and within that having the collective maturity to acknowledge
and accept human fallibility like we're not perfect we're very very far from being perfect
we make mistakes and we get things wrong and that's okay but it means that we have to be
learning from those mistakes we have to constantly be trying to improve and I think if somehow we
could get to that collective mentality it would go a long way to moving past these cycles of
blame because it would mean that we could on the one hand be grateful for what older generations
and prior generations have given us and the experiences they've given us access to while
simultaneously acknowledging that mistakes were made and there was incomplete understanding of
reality which mean that from today we can't make those same mistakes and all of us in all generations
have to do things differently and do things better and we still won't be perfect but at least we can
work towards creating something that we can be proud to pass on to future generations
I'm with Natasha that there needs to be shared values and I think it comes down to a rebranding
issue right I think many of us are disillusioned with ESGs and the global north framework of
environmentalism activism and systems change it's a very global north Eurocentric approach and
recognizing there's a plurality of work that's been done over the years is important in bridging
the narrative right caring about our crises is not a trend it's not something new solidarity is not
you know something that you do now because everyone else is doing it and I think it's really
flipping the narrative of how these conversations are not just happening on podcasts for people who
have time to listen to them they're happening on the ground and it really does come back to what
James was saying it's about this lack of resources how many of us do not have time especially
in the global north where we have day jobs that keep us from advocating for things we want to do
and then you got to wait until retirement when you have time to advocate and lobby so it's this
mismatch between what we're bound to financially and our well-being because everyone needs a paycheck
to survive in parts of the world now and then how can we then cultivate time and space do that
and that's going to take a bit of help outside of the typical at least in the US nuclear family
or young adult living by themselves in an apartment
yeah so that is such a great point the fact that most of us don't even have the time to
engage these topics most of us are too concerned with yeah how to put food on the table
or pay the rent to have time to consider these topics and so this is actually one of the main
reasons why I'm doing what I'm doing trying to figure out I hesitate to call it like an
alternative lifestyle because it sort of has hippie connotations but I'm trying to figure out how
to live a life where I can fully study these topics and also pay the rent so I don't know
how to do that but also then it's actually to your point about like looking to the older
generation to try and teach us better about the world is I wonder of course the older generation
there's value in what they have to say but I wonder if that impulse to you know find an authority
an authoritative figure from which we can be confident about their teachings and how we learn
about the world is itself sort of preventing us from understanding these problems more deeply
because I'm not sure the older generation even knows about how to deal with these problems because
they're so novel again it's not to say there's no use in deriving knowledge from the older
generations like Nate for example the the great simplification thesis is hugely explanatory and
it helped me put the right words to the thoughts I had sort of intuited about the world but then
again I can't just rely on Nate to do the work that we need to do we need to sort of relocate the
locus of authority in each of ourselves as individuals and then work in collaboration
with each other every everybody having done that towards solutions or long-term management plans
that can actually address the novelty of the problems we face is that changing like Priscilla
from five or six years ago when I met you these things climate change was known then but energy
depletion and polarization and addiction and AI and some of the other biodiversity ecological
crises like PFAS and plastics and ocean issues and all these things they weren't really on a
lot of people's radar are these things commonly discussed with age in age groups of 23 to 27
like like you all are or is it is it somewhat rare and a second part of that question is
is it because of ignorance and in energy blindness or systems lack of systems knowledge or is it
because I don't want to talk about this stuff I just want to enjoy my weekend and the beautiful day
and not have to think about these things do you have any thoughts on that?
I think it really depends where you're coming from where you are located geographically and
culturally I feel like when you're talking to us it's a bit skewed right we already give a damn
in the Palestinian lands that that would be a dumb question for me to ask but I think it's
becoming a bit more apparent I am very much sensing in the US and in the left bubbles
that there's this convergence on connecting the dots between economies environments and social
issues and while there is still a huge spectrum of nihilism to paralyzing fear most people
probably fall somewhere within the middle right some people are like I'm just here to make bank
do my job retire and die some people are it's out of my control it's too big I don't know what to
do let's retreat into the woods which is also just another form of dissociation and I think
the narrative happening elsewhere global south and other parts of the world maybe they don't use
the same words that we do but they are thinking about it because they have no choice but to think
about it in the US they're still quite a bit of a buffer for some folks and most folks in the US
still live paycheck to paycheck so we're very much closer to being houseless than billionaires and I
think that squeeze economically is really forcing people to think about more than just what's hurting
their wallet what's hurting their relationships and the future so I think it's becoming more and
more people's radars but they might be doing different things to address it or using different
words they might be advocating um parts of the system which I think is important it's hard to
tackle big picture always I think it's okay if it's a little fragmented and then politically
that the vocabulary is catching on but it's being so quickly co-opted that's why it's so
difficult to have these conversations because you don't know who you're in the room with anymore
someone could say the words sustainable are regenerative and you don't know if they if they
mean green growth are they a techno-optimist or are they an anarchist like it doesn't it's not clear
anymore so that's kind of the the nice thing about it that with this digital amplification
you don't feel as alone sometimes because people are using a shared language but it's also very
quickly co-opted and misinterpreted so it's it's a mix of both I would say thank you James you
wanted to say something and then Natasha yeah sure but uh just to the point about the shared
language thing it's just so important to understand each other and use the same language not yeah the
same language and understand that here's actually what I mean by this but that's so difficult to
flesh all of that out it takes a lot of time like the perfect example for me is the idea of
organic farming to the naive lay person he or she thinks that yeah this is like no chemical this is
pretty natural and all but it turns out that in the industry it just means something like
less chemicals than the industrial agricultural model but so yeah to the question
I think for me anyway I'd be a miss my friend group would be a misrepresentative sample because
obviously I gravitate towards these topics and so I tend to talk about them too and so
I'm surrounded by people who also tend to talk about them but not very many does that make it
easier though I mean I would imagine you you strongly value such a group oh my god I can't
tell you how much I love the people the two people I talk about this stuff with I love them
so much two two of my best friends Sean and my brother Patrick but uh doesn't make it easier
what you mean doesn't make it easier having less people to talk about it with or how do you mean
easier well if it was just you uh in Granada reading this stuff online and thinking about it
is not the healthiest trajectory so if you have other people to share even if you don't come up
with answers just a community I think is really important which is why my class worked because
we had 23 people in a circle talking about these things and sharing because this is heavy stuff
to take on just as an individual person yeah no doubt it makes it easier and that's why
I love that we can have this conversation now because I wonder if it will work like an attractor
and attract other people through the interweb cyberspace to be able to have these conversations
by the time this episode airs our great simplification discord channel will be live and
people can find out where people are in the world and and have conversations either online or in
person because I think that I think that's important Natasha what what do you think
yeah I mean like James and Priscilla I do also gravitate towards people who do care about these
issues and I have an amazing group of friends we have really interesting discussions about these
things I would say that generally there is you know people in our generation do care I mean it's
our future and there is general awareness about all these crises but there are so many barriers
to diving deeper into the sort of root causes and the why of these crises and looking sort of
beneath the surface I think those conversations aren't happening as much as they as I'd like
to see them happening and you know a big part of it is time as we've talked about people have
jobs and you've got to feed yourself and your family and and it takes a lot of time I mean for
me to be honest I spent more time educating myself about this stuff than I did focused on my university
degree in the last year of study like it's a lot of content to get through and also there's one thing
having access to the content and the other thing is being in the mental space to be willing to take
on this content and to really engage with it and I spent a long time in my youth being aware of these
crises but not really caring about going any deeper than that and it wasn't until I was in the mental
space where I'd removed loads of distractions from my life got off social media was creating a lot of
time and space for silence and reflection that then when the content hit me I was willing to
engage with it and get really deep into it so I think there are a lot of barriers that we can work on
removing thank you excellent so I will remind you all that I am not a teacher here I'm just a podcast
host but I just having this conversation this is like the first conversation I've had with more
than one young person at a time since I taught last in 2019 and I do miss the life and vitality and
curiosity and emergence that comes from speaking with young people. Let me ask you put you on
