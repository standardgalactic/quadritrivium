one of the biggest challenges that humans across the whole of our evolutionary history has ever had
to face have to have ever had to face so to me that's quite motivating and I say to myself okay so
either you step up to this challenge and make something of yourself so that you can
address it in whatever way possible and try to make that addressing it as big as possible
because I remember I actually mentioned something like doing the gardening and stuff like this and
don't get me wrong I love all that and I'm here doing the regenerative agriculture stuff but at
the same time I think there needs to be like agents of change who are so disproportionate in
terms of the consequences of their decisions or choices or actions that they're in a position of
power that they can make those disproportionate changes happen the whatever decisions they make
have highly are highly consequential we need to also figure out how to find ourselves in those
positions and I guess they're just a concern comes up it's like okay you you'd want to know
what you're talking about and what you're at when you're doing that so that also is quite
inspiring for me building off what others have said about phone use I think it's a very powerful
tool I myself have started to use social media more as I got older and going back to that generational
thing sometimes I look at gen alpha because I'm gen z and I'm like oh god we're fucked because
you're ipad kids but I also have to think like I don't blame you for wanting to dissociate on your
phone because where else a scary place I dissociate on my phone too I'm subject to that habit as well
but in my role as a communicator for my day job as a friend as a neighbor I'm not going to post
something unless there's a sense of agency that you can gain from it her writing avenues and
pathways that then take action I think it's good to affirm and put out some really emotionally
charged content but I don't want to be a click to this you know where you become complacent and
complicit just because you posted something online and think yep I've done my part I also
don't want to rage farm you know that that's a term rage farming you're just fueling the
fire without really directing people to any channel of action so that's one rule I've
held myself accountable to yes affirm people but also try to provide agency where you can when
you're doing your stuff online and I think it's it's funny this ironic momentum around
reindigenizing right there's the the sense that people want to go back to the land and
live simpler lives and like really change the culture and now today and throughout recent
history certain advocates of that especially indigenous folks global south folks people of color
all other communities that have been socially disadvantaged or marginalized in the past like
that's stuff they've been doing forever but also you know to counterbalance that was not
painting a monolith right I don't think we have to look too far and many from my observations I've
noticed many immigrant families in the US who come here and fully embrace and get ensconced in the
american dream they are fully in survival mode they are just trying to make as much money climb
the ladder and that's a capitalist mindset and then they give birth to children like me who are
very against that so it's very complicated depending where you live the privileges you have it's a
privilege to be having these types of conversations but I think when I am in a space to have these
conversations I'm really trying to cultivate facilitation skills how to hold effective meetings
how to make everyone feel seen and heard in a conversation for effective governance decision
decision making models and I really think that's scalable I think that's going to be pretty key
to understanding the crises and then how to address them because right now no matter what type
enterprise you're in or workplace you're in I think there's room to improve for facilitating
effective like congregations of people to then come to consent or consensus around certain issues
and values then to move forward with that so really if I'm asking people to change then I have
to embody that change myself and again it's not about being perfect it's just about being authentic
and within your realms within the privileges you hold thank you and thank you to all three of you
for putting in the time to to learn this stuff and and be willing to be on camera to to share
some thoughts is there is there any question that you would have liked me to ask that you'd like to
close with some some comments or anything else that each of you would like to say to our viewers
and I do just want to briefly say that if there are young people watching this
who are getting exposed to this content it can be really scary and tough if you don't have people
to talk to about it so hopefully as you said Nate there's going to be like a discord channel
by the time this is out but speaking for me personally I'd be very happy to chat to anyone
who feels like going through this cognitive journey by themselves so just putting that out there
yes I also want to plug the emotional container model you do really need to hold space
for people to process this and I'm proud of the work that I've done with my peers when we
founded a nonprofit called the Overstory Alliance and out of that game movement school and it really
was about educating and then providing a space review to process and then providing perhaps an
avenue for them people to manifest whatever change they want they're interested in interested in
chicken co-op go do that you're interested in building furniture go do that you're interested
in becoming part of the system changing from within that's okay too but yeah really emphasizing
the emotional container key to preserving yourself and not burning out closing remarks I can't really
say much to be honest what I would say is because I'm not sure what it was within me that made me
realize oh no that's not quite true don't believe that or don't fall into that trap
uh maybe there's something sort of innate to humans that can guide us like that and I would
say listen to that inner voice that guides you in that way and don't betray it don't betray it
not for money nor for people in your life who would convince you that no no no this is the way to see
the world I'd just say yeah stay true to that inner voice I didn't Priscilla I don't even know if you
know this but I almost called my class at the University of Minnesota things you always knew
but never knew you knew but it was too convoluted and long so I called it reality 101 uh instead
yeah Priscilla after you left Nate you know a few of us adapted your course to become another
seminar led by students for students and we titled it what to do about a fucked up world
and we just live with humor a humor does a great service to people in healing and navigating and
honestly we live in the age of memes so why not yeah thank you all young humans friends of mine
to be continued and and thanks for being curious and and wanting to um share and try
thanks Nate thanks everyone
