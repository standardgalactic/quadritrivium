manipulated by someone behind the scenes in favor of power. I think that's going to be essential.
Now, I think the question is, are the current iterations of Blockchain, could those withstand
a shift to a new system? And I don't know the answer to that, but I do think the people who are
investing in those tools and building that out, I think they're doing essential work that is likely
to move us to something better. And so even if perhaps some of the incentive structures or
mechanism design behind some of these may or may not work out, it could work out absolutely with
the current set of tools or it could not. I think the endeavors are really important.
I agree with that. So let's circle back to this shifting the super organism idea through
the new enlightenment. So at the beginning of this conversation, you said there were three
major areas to guide the building of new institutions, economics, governance, and
knowledge or epistemics. So how do we begin to shape these three elements to address some of
the issues that I cover on this podcast that we just talked about?
Yeah. Well, so I mentioned the changes in the knowledge systems. I think that's
sort of the biggest part, but they're intertwined. The economic systems, I think we need to get out
of the ruts we have of the current debates, like the debate over socialism versus capitalism.
I think if you start talking about different systems, it's really easy for the conversation to
veer off toward the same debate people have had for years and years and years.
And I think if you spend too much time in that particular rut, you can't think your way out
of it. It's sort of like there's this impetus that's either you're super afraid of capitalism or
you're super afraid of socialism and both of those fears are totally valid. And if we need
something that's different, I think we're going to have to focus more on the feedback loops that
capture, like, is this system depreciating? Like, is there a power to the powerful thing,
a rewriting of the rules of the game by people with power? Is that happening in this particular
institution, which could be like a firm, it could be a government institution, but it could also be
like the institutions that are written on our hearts, like our moral code or what we view as
legitimate or illegitimate uses of power, what we view as the obligations behind money and
debt and things like that. So I think we're going to need to recognize that almost any institution
will depreciate and recognizing when one has started to depreciate and having ways of
channeling resources away from those that are becoming cancerous. And in some ways,
I think this will need to involve some kind of creative destruction of institutions where like
creative destruction, basically it's where we don't want to point adversarial resources toward
things that aren't working, because then you get this big fight and they fight back. But when the
resources just sort of get re-channeled toward like a healthier institution reinvested there,
I think something like that is going to be key to like the changing of the economic structure.
Could you give an example of redirecting resources towards a positive institution?
Okay, I need to think more carefully about, I feel like any example I give is going to be
embedded in something that's really not working right now.
So I mean like capitalism has one source of creative destruction. And it's an imperfect source
and it's subservient to institutions that aren't subject to this kind of creative destruction.
But the source in capitalism is if you have a company that is not doing well,
the idea is that it would financially not work out. Like it's going to go out of business and you
would, and people instead would start buying from some other place. Now that particular
version of this mechanism is no longer working in the way it should be. So there's sort of
institutions at a higher level that are actually influencing that whole game in ways that are
not healthy. So that's a theoretical one version of this. I think you could have similar versions
with social media or like say influencers or podcasts where if you have a thinker who starts to,
I don't know, just talk about ideas that are bad or be disrespectful or something goes wrong
with that thinker, people may just like stop listening to them. So like people are choosing,
I'm not going to put my eyeballs on them. They've started to go crazy. I'm going to go elsewhere.
But that's another one that's like totally out of whack given a couple of layers up inside the
system right now. So like I don't think it's going to be easy to get this right. But I think the
focus if we're going to try to rejigger the system does need to be on those feedback loops
that hold parts of the system accountable to their social value and that instead of
instead of inciting a lot of battles like you there will need to be battles like adversarial
energy and lawsuits and stuff like that. I think something like that will still exist and be
important. But there's not infinite energy for that. So just having ways of re-channeling I think
it's sort of how I'm starting to think about this and I haven't fully fleshed out this vision.
Yeah, that's the task of the channel is to bit by bit try to figure out
what could be an element here. Your channel and your concept of the new enlightenment you are
figuring it out over time because you're curious and then you explore some concept and then you do
a video on it and you're learning and figuring out what paths are false and what paths are
dead ends and what paths are possible. Yes, yeah and the false and dead ends that's actually a
really important point here. I actually think we need a lot of ideas that are not viable because
a lot of times people will put out an idea for a new system and people will look at that with
a critical thinking brain that's been developed inside the current system and they'll say actually
that doesn't work and it's not that the criticisms are wrong it's that okay if we're going to have
a new system it's not going to arrive in anybody's brain fully formed it's more like we're going to
have a bunch of different ideas from different people they're all out on the table and there's
going to be a mixing and a matching and by the time the mixing and a matching leads to an actual
new system it will be different enough that we're going to need different ways of thinking about
critical thinking so I think people need to be not afraid to to put out specific ideas that won't
work. Why? Like why do we because with the more unviable ideas that we see and recognize is unviable
the the more we get steered into the the direction of things that actually might work is that what
you mean? No I mean I mean if we recognize that something's unviable it could be that
that thing that is completely unviable in the current system with people's current set of
expectations and you know mental infrastructure and social infrastructure and all these institutions
it's like okay in this environment that's not viable it could be that if you take like
50 of these unviable ideas and mix and match them together and duct tape them together to
move toward a new system each of them is actually going to function really differently in a new
system so something that's not viable in this system could actually be part like a very viable
part of a different system that we can't yet envision. Got it yeah I agree with that so do you
advise graduate students or do you just teach undergraduates there? I just teach undergraduates.
So so how might graduates of your school and graduates of schools around the world and other
academics begin to work in these areas towards a new enlightenment? Do you have any thoughts there?
Because the academy which you're a part of and I used to be a part of is kind of a miniature
superorganism in many ways. Yeah I mean well I think the first thing is you kind of have to if
you're interested in solving this problem you have to somewhat let go of the incentive structures
inside of academia because if you if you're on the path of oh I'm gonna publish a lot and get my
accolades through the system it will steer you away from this kind of thing so like that's that's
number one is like let that go even if it means letting go career opportunities but then after
that I think there's not going to be just one type of thinker we actually need people who develop
out expertise in really different fields who can talk to each other so it's not about getting rid of
biases like you can't get rid of biases and in some ways following a particular intellectual
pathway is going to lead you down a journey that will create its own biases and that could be good
especially if the biases you're developing are like different enough from current systems so in
some ways I think it's it's about figuring out where does your brain fit in the system like
what are your passions it's like understanding enough of the whole superorganism to find a place
in that that is meaningful to you that you feel like could be one little piece of the puzzle
in rejiggering the system I am going to ask you some personal questions
Ashley that I ask all my guests I'm sure you know what they are what sort of advice do you have
for people aware of these issues choosing to take in the the full enchilada of the
meta crisis and and think about the future do you have any personal advice I think for this
collective action mechanism to happen I think we're going to need people in different like
idea bubbles who are capable of developing trust with people in other bubbles and I think this is
the biggest thing that that anyone can develop but especially people who are into this kind of thing
is that recognizing okay in every little idea bubble people in that bubble are aware of some
problem and they're deeply aware of it and they have this language for like describing the problem
that is a little bit inside the bubble but the problem is a lot of slogans and and like buzzwords
and people come to represent the the bigger idea set and people inside that bubble know oh yeah
that little slogan I understand the depth of that but people outside the bubble what they
experience oftentimes is just people in that bubble dismissing their ideas so like if each
bubble has something they're in touch with it's a real problem they're really frustrated when people
outside the bubble dismiss them and so they start to dismiss those ideas like you're trying to fight
for your problem and you're putting your problem above mine so it's like social media gives us
this intellectual armor for dismissing people who say things that are threatening tasks this is why
this podcast is increasingly difficult because there are so many bubbles that are covered
in the content and I think what you're describing in the past I've referred to as
memetic tribe diplomats that we need translators that can walk between the bubbles and suppress
their own identity in order to broaden the conversation yes that's it that's it that's
so I agree with that advice I agree with that advice and that that may be in our society
one of the the key things that we need I'm really nervous about who no matter who wins
the next election there are going to be these ideological bubbles in this country that are
going to be potentially violent and we're going to need translators no matter who wins we're going
to still face the same set of problems yeah and it's like usually in most of these bubbles even
if there's a little bit of incorrect information or false perceptions and all that there's usually
something inside every bubble that's like that's a serious problem that needs addressed but they
can't hear each other and it's like okay wait all of these problems are connected at the underlying
layer of the system so do you have any other recommendations for listeners aware of the
meta crisis well so I mean my number one recommendation is to try to like learn about
other bubbles but I think my other recommendation is almost it seems counteracting to that which is
we're going to need communities and like strong relationships and I feel like putting your
relationships at risk by trying to learn about the other bubbles through people in your close
relationship circle who disagree with you I do think there's this danger to that because there's
these like the structure that we've inherited from social media has set up ways that that we
can't perceive each other's painful spots we can't perceive the language that's like
contemptuous that our link our tribe uses or is that that's interpreted as contemptuous so like
putting relationships in community above any of this but then with that in mind developing
those skills to cross the boundaries I think that's a hard thing to navigate how would you change
your advice for young people and as a college professor I'm sure at the end of the semester
you become friends and you wear different hats if I recall I was their teacher I was their counselor
I was their coach I was their friend what advice do you give to early 20 something's
headed into the things that we face I mean it's really developing these skills it's developing
the skills especially the in-person skills of just like communicating with people apart from
social media land and sort of recognizing when is the social media space bleeding into these
relationships and into these communities and trying to foster spaces that are separate from that
because I think the in-person skills are essential and they're easy to lose I agree
what do you care most about in the world Ashley I mean I think I care most about like
my relationship with God and like I think the serenity prayer captures it it's sort of like
the wisdom to know the difference between what I can change and what I can't and sort of
following following out what I can actually change and finding my place and letting my place in
the world be different than other peoples and letting them have the space to to be doing something
that I don't understand or can't understand but you know interacting as best as I can with those
people I'm struggling with that too at the moment I'm trying to do too many things and
I think you're right we each have to do what we're best at and let others do what they're best at
I think you also care deeply about learning don't you yes that's that's like an obsession
yeah it's good I curiosity is really important skill especially
for people that can pass the baton to others as teachers like you can
if you could wave a magic wand and there was no personal recourse to your decision what is one
thing you would do to improve planetary and human economic societal futures
well so I don't know if this is allowed in the thought experiment I love the thought experiment
but it would be for everybody to have three communities that they knew well like where
they knew the personalities they sort of had had enough like experience like meeting once a week
or just being together to where they could function as a community handling challenges
challenges and crises because I feel like that would be the the infrastructure upon which a new
economy could be built why three and not one so there is risk with communities and sometimes you
need to take risks to like speak up and say things that will disrupt the power balance of the community
or that will you know be outside of what this community is normally used to hearing and when
you have multiple communities like that it lowers the risk it's sort of like okay if I take this
risk in this community I'm not risking my whole social structure I'm risking a big part of my
social structure but I think it'll make people more willing to take those risks so I do think it
needs to be multiple I like that idea I I recently in episode 100 which comes out next week talked
about people having three core groups one people they just have fun with one people that they have
an intellectual affiliation with and one that they do stuff like hands-on stuff like three different
groups of five to seven core friends because you can't expect that one would have all the things
that you're interested in and I think there is a health and a diversity and a diversification
that happens there so I agree with that idea but that was salient that you said three and not one
yeah no I like that and it lowers the pressure on any one group to be everything to everyone in the
yeah totally agree this has been great so I know we just scratched the surface of your
thinking on these things I will offer that the next let's do a follow-up podcast in 2024
and we'll do it in person we'll find a studio in Northfield or Red Wing or Minneapolis or even
maybe here I could rejigger it and we'll take a deeper dive what's one topic that overlaps between
the two of our interests that you would be willing or interested to take a really deep dive on well
so it's one that you suggested for this podcast and I kind of mixed which is economics in general
like the field of economics you know this is the field that's looking at scarce resources and allocation
of scarce resources and incentive mechanisms it's so essential but you know this group think idea and
the notion that communities of knowledge can be bent toward power even if it's a small amount that
compounds over time I would love to talk with you about that and I think you and I might think of
it like slightly differently and I didn't want to talk about it this podcast because my fear was if
we tried to do it in like five minutes or ten minutes that it would just lead to misunderstanding
and I think we're kind of on the same page mostly but I would love to talk with you about that and
in person would be fantastic okay it is a plan thank you so much Ashley for being here today
for teaching young humans about the world and and for your channel the new enlightenment
and stay warm and be careful of box elder bugs I just recall the the name do you have those there
in northfield you must I know what bugs you're talking about but I yeah I haven't seen one in a
long time there are thousands in the office here and on the walls so I'm I'm gonna have to deal with
that um to be continued my friend definitely if you enjoyed or learned from this episode of the
