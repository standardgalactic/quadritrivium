some of the collective intelligence of their smaller scale and their intimacy with each other
and whatever for survival collective wisdom of their smaller scale yes and now there is collective
intimacy actually and collective wisdom are very deeply coupled because if everybody can know
everyone you can have intuitive mappings to everyone you can care about everyone you can
have shared pathos and you don't want to hurt someone where you hurt if they hurt right as
soon as we get to much larger scale where i don't know everyone i don't trust everyone i don't have
intimacy now i have to have some way of knowing we're in group we are all under the same flag we
all have the same um indicator of some kind uh and now we now i don't get to act in a unique way
to each person i have to have rule sets that mediate it so we start to get this kind of
intelligence rule-based law that is different than wisdom now one could say that all of the
wisdom traditions were trying to there's different ways of saying this having built an environment
that we were not naturally fit to and the way you would talk about this our neurochemistry our
dopamine opioid axis is evolved in a certain environment and then we've created a new environment
for ourselves that we're no longer fit now it's easy to get more calories and in in the early
environment it wasn't so there was a dopamine relationship to always get more calories whatever
now in this environment we're no we're kind of actually in some ways genetically misfit so you
could say the the wisdom was trying to tell us how to deal with the dopamine opioid axis in a
environment that we were no longer evolutionarily fit for to deal with evolutionary mismatch
you could also say it was the wisdom was trying to deal with how do we guide the
collective relationship to the technological powers we have that has some long-term viability built in
number one as you're speaking on this grand arc of history i kind of feel sorry for all
the peoples and the cultures that expressed wisdom and were out competed by the larger entity
number one and number two can we have wisdom with eight billion humans in our current
environment or is wisdom only able to be had with smaller scale smaller groups that aren't faced with
the evolutionary environmental scale limits and pressures in terms of feel sorry for
now with that beginning of an insight talk to any indigenous person and you'll get to get the context
of their life so talk to tyson about this and have them get to share like oh so the colonialist
story was that we were savages that need civil civilized let me actually tell you about what
civilization means what something that was more truly civil was let's say why the habsi
and narrative that our lives were short brutish nasty and mean as the apologism to be able to
genocide the fuck out of us is the dumbest story in human history dumbest and cruelest right
but here's where also the naive technopess misnarrative doesn't work is that if you don't embrace
the tools that will end up being what defines the world if any of them are there
then you don't actually get to have any say in the future and which is why right now
i am advocating for something that recognizes both the problems of tech and the problems of a
multipolar trap where if you just try to get things right for your people and not everybody
you still fail are are we ready to talk about artificial intelligence so the reason i was
talking a little bit about that the evolutionary history of humans was in these smaller scales
and totally different types of environment with oral language rather than written language with
lots of things very different but that unique to humans is the capacity to be more changed
by their environment you could say that our nature is to be very nurture influenced and
as much as you can take a wild animal and train it to be different in a different
environment in one generation how much you can do that with a human is so radically different
and because the other animals are genetically fit to their environment they evolved to have
capacities that work within a niche and yet humans evolved to make tools that would change
our whole environment including make whole new environments right homes and cities and etc we
couldn't come hardwired to a particular environment or a particular way of being because our evolutionary
adaptation was not our bodies our body extended through tools that we change and environments
that we change so we had to be able to upgrade to okay new safety and new environment what language
are we speaking what tools are we optimizing for what type of in in environment are we navigating
we just migrated so we have to come incredibly not prepared for a specific set of things which
is also why we're neoteness for so long right the the human sapien is dependent and helpless for a
very long period of time compared to the chimpanzee or any other close relative and but we also get
our violent sheets don't right keep going yet we have a totally different like we don't come
preset to do the evolutionarily adaptive thing within that environment because our evolutionary
adaptation was to change how we were adaptive meaning which tools and everything we use which
languages we use um which cultures we identify with way more environments way more plastic and
flexible in our behaviors than i mean the the the elephants today are doing similar things to
elephants 10 000 years ago so think about it a human growing up learning how to throw a spear
versus learning how to use chat gpt our very different skill sets and throwing a spear is not
that advantageous today in most cities and most environments even though it's the most advantageous
thing so you don't want a kid growing up with genetically inbuilt spear throwing capacity
you want them growing up to figure out what is the tech stack around me what's the language what
are the goals how do i do that thing which is why they're also fairly useless at everything to begin
with because they haven't imprinted what is useful in this environment yet so the horse is up and
walking in 20 minutes and it takes us a year and you think about the multiples of how many 20 minutes
go into a year for another mammal and you're like wow that's really different but then you look at how
different human culture now to 10 000 years ago and even one human culture to another is right so
now we do we started doing our social science after certain aspects of culture nurture had
become so ubiquitous that we took them for granted like alphabetic language is not natural it is not
natural to have a written language that is not a natural part of the evolutionary environment
that was an invention and then we taught it to everybody and we got and it makes it changes
the nature of mind very fundamentally because rather than relate to the base reality out there i
relate to the mapping of reality to these sounds that are arbitrary and then how those sounds work
so that affects the nature of mind and then i go to school and i learned this is geography and this
is english and this is math and this is history and it's all divided and there's different principles
and the goal is get the right answer not understand why that's not natural so we're ubiquitously
conditioning people and then calling that nature whereas if you go to the few indigenous cultures
that are left you'll see that most of what we call human nature in terms of the current
life experience of sapiens in the developed west is not true for them and so it's important to get
that our relation now do we have a culture that is systemically conditioning what would
most support wisdom so look at what are called wisdom cultures right look at the way that a child
is raised in say pre-mal buddhist Tibet and what they're being developed for and how
fucking amazingly different it is so are we genetically misfit as beings to wisdom no
did we produce a civilization that is misfit to wisdom and then humans are being made fit to that
civilization i.e the super organism i.e molok i.e the mega machine i.e the generative dynamics that
lead to a metacrisis yes and the humans who are born into that who become fit in that are fit for
the thing that is killing its own substrate i get that that is clear but we were selected for
historically at smaller scales and those systems optimized that had intelligence merged with wisdom
to protect the tribe or the smaller unit that dynamic doesn't doesn't map to my knowledge to
eight billion in a global consumption based culture right so the first question is
is it not possible for humans individual humans groups of humans at different scales to
develop wisdom i.e relationship to base reality rather than the symbols that mediated and the
models that mediated and relationship to the wider holes both temporally spatially and which
agents is it pause is there anything about human nature that makes that impossible no
is there anything about the current conditioning environment of the civilizational system not
the biosphere that makes that not what is being incented to be conditioned at scale absolutely
is it possible for the eight billion person thing to continue without the wisdom no it
will self-terminate so there is nothing innate to our biology that is the problem there is
something innate to the particular trajectory of the civilizational system that is and we do
not get to continue this civilizational system and what it conditions in people so then the question
is what does it take to create environments that could condition the wisdom and people that in
turn reinforce those environments right the bottom-up effects of the wiser humans creating
different societies and the top-down effects of different societies having an incentive to develop
different things in the people how do we get that collective individual top-down bottom-up
recursion moving in the right direction given that there is no other answer for humans long term
so last week on the phone you mentioned when we were discussing AI that capitalism
was an early form of compute can use that as a bridge maybe to get us to talking about AI
within a body all the cells in a body have the same genome but they're epigenetically
differentiated so that a red blood cell and the liver cell and a neuron are different and so there
is specialization division of labor that allows synergy across differences and capacities of the
whole system that none of the systems on their own have so the differentiation and then integration
is a thing even at the level of a body right and at the level of a tribe there was specialization
division of labor so that the tribe could do more than any individual person could do if
everyone was trying to do every everything when we got kind of an economic theory of comparative
advantage economic advantage the story of progress and economic advantage is very coupled to this
idea of specialization um division of labor and the increase in the total cumulative complexity
of the space that that facilitated of which capitalism was seen to be the dominant system for
doing so um now i want to say something before going any further which is it is very common that
if one says anything bad about capitalism the default reaction by many people from a historical
perspective is um this guy is a neo marxist and is going to suggest something that had Stalin kill
50 million people and Mao kill 50 million people and blah blah blah and doesn't he realize that
capitalism is the best solution in my in my earth day in my earth day talk i did last week it'll be
out tomorrow um i did word pairings and how the importance of semantics influences our our behaviors
and gives us permissions one of the word pairings was fossil fuels no the reality is fossil hydro
carbons but another was capitalism and communism are both industrial growth based systems so um
i'm i'm i'm with you there on on the exculpatory definitional clause keep going so
when we talk about problems and capitalism they were different expressions but many of those problems
in terms of environmental harm optimizing narrow goals whatever happened in communism happened
under feudalism happened under um various other types of systems that operated at scale
and we're not even going to say that at the very small scale that everything was wise and awesome
that would be a kind of romantic naivete that we don't want to do we don't want to do the naivete
on the other side that says it was hobsy and brutish short nasty and mean like neither the full
romantic tribal picture nor the full regressive they were dreadful animals picture are true it was
complex and different ones were different and whatever um but when we're critiquing capitalism
now it's not that we don't understand why it was selected for the things that it did that were more
effective or how gruesome some of the other systems were it's recognizing that this system
on the trajectory it is happens to be self-terminating so we have to come up with a new thing and the
new thing will be a new thing it won't be a previous thing so i'm saying that so that the
default reaction of why am i listening to these commies is not someone doesn't have to default
into that um but if we have a system even if it was the best and and we can critique democracy
in the same way church hills it's the worst of all governance systems save for all the other ones
when when they're it's the best thing but the best thing is still self-terminating
then we have to do new thinking right and um so capitalism and democracy should not themselves
be golden calves beyond critique but we are going to do the critique that in a way that is
historically informed a quick quick question on capitalism because i've never asked you this
i don't think i've asked anyone this there was never a person or a group of humans that said
hey let's invent capitalism it was always an emergent response to the challenges and the
innovation and and the coordination of intelligence towards problem solving of the day and it took on
momentum and then institutions and everything built on top of it right there wasn't a let's form this
there were definitely points in the process that were important and there were points that
were conscious in the process um what you actually define as capitalism right because
classical capitalism versus kind of neoclassical versus kinsy and are all quite different different
than some of the axioms so um do one could say capitalism started with the beginning of private
property that would be one way that one could talk about one could say it began with surplus
the moment there was surplus and we had to figure out who got to do what with the surplus and
and who has the choice making associated that that's the beginning one could say
no the communism was one answer capitalism was a different answer so it's surplus plus private
ownership and exchange or one could say actually it was only once the medium of exchange was
not itself in in intrinsic value so once we got currencies or you could say actually only
once you had financial services where the currency made made more of itself so the beginning of rent
seeking or loans or debt um or you could go forward to not until you actually have a formalized
banking system which you could say started with the templars or you could say started with dutch
capitalism and the kind of ship based mercantilism so there each of those are various steps in the
story of what we could call capitalism then of course central banking then international
central banking agreements global reserve currencies um blah blah blah right i mean these
are topics that i think for both of us are just intrinsically fascinating to understand how the
human condition evolved and they also happen to be maximally important um what's funny right you and
i have as a in common is we're we are not so motivated by within the existing dominant systems
what is useful to advance success within that system but recognizing that those systems have
limits that we're approaching what is useful within the system is inherently self-terminating
so what is useful long term is not based on what's useful in the system which means you have to go
into what do we even mean by useful what do we even mean by good how did we get here right
so when you're at the end of a particular kind of success paradigm if you recognize that you
have to actually go pretty deep in the historical stack the theoretical stack to even be pragmatically
focused islands of coherence have the ability to shift the entire system says ilia preogen
um so keep keep going on the why capitalism why you think capitalism was an early form of
compute and compute is is relevant to artificial intelligence so in one of our talks we discussed
molok which was kind of uh an analogy for um you're giving you're actually asking the question
now did anyone design capitalism or was it kind of emergent step by step and in so far as they're
as the most significant features of our world are not the result of anyone's intentional choice
it's like who the fuck made that and so being able to anthropomorphize as a thought experiment
what the collective behaviors predispose you can get different kinds of god so adam smith
did this with the invisible hand of the market right that um the progress was defined by this god
of the invisible hand that nobody was choosing the overall topology of the system they were all
doing local point-based choices of i want this product or service at this price i would like
to make a business that provides this product or service and yet the totality of the collective
intelligence that was an emergent property of that moved things in a particular direction
he was defining the invisible hand as a good god right um roughly uh but but he did say
there was an end to that uh benevolence uh and the distant horizon once once we would
exhaust the surplus but keep going so if humans have desire demand for things that
actually improve our lives and we only want things that improve our lives and we're
rational actors who will make a rational choice to utilize the resources that we have intelligently
for the things that improve our lives the most and that creates an incentive niche for people to
innovate how to make goods and services that improves people's lives more at better value
then yes you would get a good god emerging from that decentralized collective intelligence
right and that's kind of the idea of the market and capital mediating that and having this currency
that is not worth anything itself but represents optionality for all forms of value
and so so was the market an early form of artificial intelligence the global market just
in time delivery everything optimized for profit sufficiency etc so if we define intelligence
