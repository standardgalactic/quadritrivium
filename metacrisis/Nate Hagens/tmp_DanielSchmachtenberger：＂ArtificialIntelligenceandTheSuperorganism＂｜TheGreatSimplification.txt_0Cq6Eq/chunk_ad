had time to learn those mythos and be like no no no we're not going to maximum power principle
kill take everything we're going to live in sustainability think seven generations ahead
and there was wisdom about appropriate use of technology and restraint 40 000 years ago
that was my question is we are homo sapiens our appellation which is wise man but any small
percentage of tribes or individuals or nation states or warring clans that pursued a narrow
boundary goal would have out competed those tribes with wisdom not any of them and here we are with
the super organism any of them above a certain threshold right um what what what do you mean
let's say that we had a number of tribes in an area that had all developed some kind of wisdom
by which they bound intelligence and i'm not saying we don't do that today it's called law right
um right right and it's supposedly also what religion is about the development of wisdom
of what is the good life what is worth pursuing and not pursuing in which you get things like
religious law you're not going to work on the Sabbath you're going to take that day to do different
things for instance if you just if you want to think about that as an example you could think
about the Sabbath as an example of law binding a multipolar trap associated with a naive version of
progress if you don't have a Sabbath some people will work seven days a week in the short term
before they burn out they'll get ahead they will get so much ahead because they'll be able to keep
investing that differential advantage and rent seeking behavior that anyone who doesn't will
have no relevance to be able to guide their own lives and now you have a world where no one spends
any time with their kids no one reflects on the religion nobody enjoys their life everything
sucks for everyone because somebody did that thing in the name of progress because they moved
ahead faster so we say no no no you're gonna have a day where you don't fucking progress stuff that's
actually the gist you're not going to be focused on external progress in the world and so there's 27
or 29 ways in Leviticus that you can violate the Sabbath and you'll be killed if you violate it
which seems like just wackadoodle religious nonsense but if you're like wait no you never
have to actually do that if you if you if you hold that law that extremely is everyone's like
all right we're not gonna fuck with the Sabbath now what do I get to do that day I get to reflect
rather than achieve goals I reflect on what are good goals so I get to spend time with my family
I get to spend time with nature I get to read the scripture I get to meditate I don't get to
achieve goals I get to experience the fullness of life outside of goal achieving and I get to
reflect on what goals are truly worthwhile and in doing so bind the multipolar trap that I don't
have to because everybody else is rushing ahead that would be an example of the way religions
were supposed to have something like wisdom that created something like law and restraint to buy
naive versions of progress in a way that was actually better for the whole long term
so two comments there one when I was much younger I had some Jewish friends
and I didn't ridicule them but I was kind of haha you guys have Sabbath today I'm gonna go
to the arcade or go on a boat ride or go fishing or whatever but now as I'm older everything you
just said about the good life and spending time with family and reading and spending time in nature
and not using the internet on a Saturday or whatever sounds freaking wise and makes sense
and appealing to me so maybe with age and maturity I'm flipping from intelligence to wisdom and then
the second thing the implication and maybe this is where you're heading is to uh muzzle or forestall
the risk singularity that is coming from the superorganism we have to have have some Sabbath
equivalent applied to AI it's not just Sabbath equivalent but you know almost all of law is
about restraint right things that you don't do in the presence of having incentive to achieve
narrow goals what are the things that for the collective well-being which also means the capacity
for your own individual well-being for all individuals into the future what are the things
that we say we don't do if you have Samantha on this is a topic she'll talk about cares a lot
about which is there's no definition of wisdom worth anything that is not bound to the concept of
restraint but our but how yeah I don't know how our culture is approaching a biophysical
wily coyote moment in 20 or 30 or 40 years ago before all this over leverage and and
different systemic risk we could have added restraints but now our restraint would would
almost default uh create this this rubber band snapback in the economic systems but we can talk
about that another time well so this is where you end up having
the embedded growth obligation of a system the embedded continuity of a system the kind of
institutional momentum um that partner Zach was writing something recently a couple of people
in the team were contributing and in the beginning it's it was talking about where do we
find ourselves now and it says we find ourselves in the relationship between the life-giving
nature of the biosphere and the life-giving nature of the civilizational system and the
unique point in time at which the ladder is threatening the ongoing continuity of the
former upon which it depends and that what it takes to maintain that civilizational system
will destroy the biosphere the civilizational system depends on so you we must remake the
civilizational system fundamentally we do need civilizational systems we do need technological
systems but we need ones that don't have embedded exponential growth obligations we do need ones
that have restraint we do need ones that don't optimize narrow interests at the expense of
driving arms races and externalities we do need ones where the intelligence in the system is bound
by and directed by wisdom right which is the equivalent of Sabbath plus law plus
emergence now come back to for a moment what the you know ha ha what idiot's reaction you had
when you were young i had a similar one and lots of young people probably even many people who were
raised jewish have a similar one before they understand the full depth of it let's so let's
talk about chesterton's fences for a moment um never heard of that i don't know uh actually the
history of why i've got that name but there's a thought experiment and philosophy that says
called chesterton's fence which is there's a fence up and you think oh the purpose of that fence was
x that's no longer here the fence is ugly and in the way let's cut let's take the fence down
is there a chance that the purpose for the fence included several other things that you don't know
and you don't know that you don't know at them before you take the fucking fence down you better
make sure you actually understand why it was put up and now this comes to a very deep intuition
we were talking about biases earlier in the progress narrative progressives it's funny how
right now that is somehow associated with left in some weird way but like progressive and traditional
is a deep dialectic and neither one are supposed to be the one you choose it's a dialectic you're
supposed to hold them in balance right and um very much in the same way this is an important
point and it relates to holes and wisdom versus narrow goals narrow value sets are as bad as
narrow goals they're a part of it so any value that is a real value exists in a dynamic tension
with other values a dialectical one oftentimes but other values where if you optimize the one at the
expense of everything else you optimize it you get these reducto ad absurdums right so
meaning the optimization of any value by itself can end up looking like evil so if I want to
optimize truthfulness and all I'm going to do is speak the truth all the time then when the
Nazis come and ask me are there any Jews inside I say yes no I don't the truthfulness is not the
only value at that point to the preservation of life and kindness and other things are we can even
see an example where it's like if someone in a naive sense says I'm I'm my value is honesty
there's a bunch of places where you can see a person who in the name of honesty is just an asshole
right and they just say kind of mean things and say it's in the name of honesty we can see
that in the name of say kindness people will lie to say flattering things and avoid painful things
we can see that if you hold them in dialectical tension
you actually get a truth that is more truthful and you get kindness that is more effective
because the kindness that doesn't want to tell the person they're an addict when they are and
nobody does or tell the emperor they have no clothes or say anything painful that is necessary
feedback isn't even kind so sometimes for that value to even understand itself fully there's
this kind of dialectical relationship that helps that come about now here's where I'm coming to
Chesterton's fence and then we'll then I want to hear okay there is a dialectic between a traditional
impulse and a progressive impulse the traditional impulse basically says I think there were a lot
of wise people for a long time wise and smart people who thought about some of these things
more deeply than I have who fought and argued and that the systems that made it through evolution
that made it through made it through for some reasons that have some embedded wisdom in it
that I might not understand fully and it makes sense for me to kind of have as my null hypothesis
my default trusting those systems they wouldn't have made it through if they weren't successful
didn't work and likely the total amount of embedded intelligence in them is more than I've
thought about this thing that's the without knowing it that's the traditional intuition
the progress intuition is we collective intelligence is advancing built on all
that we have known we're discovering new things and we're just and we're moving into new problem
sets where the previous solutions could not possibly be the right solutions because we
have new problems so we need to have fundamentally new thinking obviously these are both true now
on the traditional side the chesterton's fence thing is I might have as a kid or you might have
as a kid thrown out the Sabbath and said that's dumb before we actually understood it because
we understood a straw man version of it said it was stupid and threw it out and so when we're
talking about wisdom and restraint and all like that there is something around are we seeking to
because in the name of progress there will always be something that is focused on restraint that
seems like it's fucking up that progress I could get and I if I don't understand all the reasons
for the restraint that factor second third fourth nth order effects long into the future in the
short term I should do the thing in the short term like no of course I should advance the AI applied
to genomics to solve cancer without thinking through the fact that the fourth order effects
might involve increasing bio weapons capability for everyone and destruction of the world so even
the cancer solutions don't matter in the course of those people's lives and so this is is there a
whole enough perspective to be able to see how the things that are actually wise from a narrow
perspective look stupid two questions one is the metaphor the same as when I was younger I thought
those things were stupid and now I recognize the validity of them that's where we are as a culture
we we are the younger version of Nate in in the the intelligence versus wisdom dynamic I'm I'm
just speculating I think that's probably the case and then two I mean you in in all the people that
I know I know a lot of smart people you're certainly up there but you also have wisdom
and I don't know as many people that have both intelligence and wisdom and you
in my in my sphere rank near the top but is it in our genome is it in the human behavioral
repertoire to hold more than those single values to hold multiple values and wide boundary
views of the world what do you think about that so we said that there is something unique
about the types of in recursive intelligence that lead to technology innovation and the
Anthropocene the superorganism etc in human intelligence relative to other species so
let's talk about the genetic predisposition and the what the predisposition is actually for
and the nature nurture thing a little bit I would say and again everything I'm gonna say
here will be at a high level that is hopefully pointing in the right direction but totally
inadequate to a deeper analysis of all the topics our nature in terms of the genetic fitness of
humans homo sapiens it would be fair to say that our nature selected for being more quickly and
recursively changeable by nurture than anything else
that is individual humans
and the individual human is not the unit of selection and evolution the tribe is
right well the tribe of the band the group of humans
there are sometimes individuals sometimes tribes I don't think there is much of a case
for individual humans surviving in the early evolutionary environment by themselves very
well and the behavior of them as individuals separate from social behavior leading there
are certainly some animals that are largely solitary and they have a different set of
selection criteria than primarily social animals humans are a primarily social but
I mean this was this was EO Wilson David Sloan Wilson's paper
that selfish individuals out compete within groups and cooperative groups out compete selfish
groups so I think I think both are hardwired in us but let's not get detracted by that
actually what I'm saying holds with this the individual there are some selection of an individual
within a social environment but there's no selection of an individual outside of other sapiens
right right and so the unit of selection that is driving the dominant feature for sapiens the
unit of selection is a group that's actually really important thing to think about as opposed
to that the unit of selection is an individual because we have such an individualistically
focused culture today and we think in terms of individual focus way excessively to the actual
evolutionary fitness of an individual outside of a tribe was dead in almost every environment for
most of history so a set of behaviors that made you alienate the tribe was not an evolutionary
strategy for most of the evolutionary basis of humans and the problem now is our tribe is
eight billion strong pursuing profits tethered to carbon which is no longer a tribe the tribe
was capped out at the scale at which there were certain types of communication across that group
that allowed it to be the unit of selection and so everyone knowing everybody everybody being able
to communicate with everyone everyone being able to participate in some choices that then everyone
would be bound by so they stayed in it rather than defect against it which is why you got
kind of dunbar limitations and then there is a series of things where you went from say
couple hundred thousand years of dunbar to huge cities in a relatively short period of time
which is the beginning of the thing we call recorded civilization and we would say that
most of the super organism properties we talk about now were at that junction started
because in the smaller size lots of lying and sociopathy and whatever really don't pay because
people are going to know you're lying and enough people can beat you up if you are very problematic
so we as individual humans because evolutionary selection acted at the tribal unit
but we are have the capacity for wisdom but once the number of people and the self-organization
went to the city-state nation-state size there became downward causation of the
emergent phenomenon at the aggregate level that started to focus on intelligence and out
competed the wisdom of individuals in smaller smaller units yeah the multi-polar trap the
moloki behaviors really took off there because you can think of homo sapiens with tools they
were already different than the rest of nature because they had stone tools and fire and language
so they were already different which is why they had already extincted other species and moved
become the apex predator everywhere right the the beginning of the story is the beginning of
the type of intelligence that leads to recursive innovation recursive abstraction leading to
recursive innovation so when you look at what various people call the defining characteristic
of humans very or the earliest technique that made humans really distinct stone tools fire and
language are three very common ones brought up stone tools and innovation in the domain of matter
fire is innovation in the domain of energy language is an innovation in the domain of intelligence
for information and they were all intelligence applied to those innovations recursive intelligence
of this kind right a group of humans with no stone tools even can't do anything to a mammoth
just with their fangs and claws they just they're not going to hunt a mammoth right
eight eight dudes aren't going to do that and one dude with a spear isn't going to hunt a mammoth
it is the coordination protocols and the physical tech together that led to those capacities so
that both the social tech and the physical tech and so I'm meaning tech here as intelligence
applied to goal achieving the innovation of new fundamental capacities that most broad definition
of tech and so in so for a couple hundred thousand years of sapien you have this very
small size a couple million years of hominids writ large and then we can argue why exactly we
started to get way above beyond the Dunbar number and where we went and beyond the couple Dunbar
numbers into um sumaria egypt gobleci tepe like the first large ones but um one function that
certainly comes up in the analysis is is having already capped out migration as a strategy and
tribal warfare you start getting into resource limits with another tribe you're sharing the
same environment competing for the same stuff you just move when you've moved to all the places
there's nowhere else to move there's resource issues and one tribe is willing to be warring
now the small the other tribes have to unify together to survive so they're willing to sacrifice
