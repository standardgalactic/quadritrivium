yes and and but here's here's one of the challenges though it's easy for a group of humans
or a full culture to optimize one thing it's very difficult to optimize multiple things
at once multivariable inputs and outputs are incredibly complex so optimizing
dollar profits tethered to energy tethered to carbon combining technology materials and energy
that is a thing that was very easy you know akin to the maximum power principle
so I what do you think about that I think that optimization is actually the wrong framework
when you think about everything that matters you're not thinking about optimization anymore
you're thinking about a different thing so optimization is now let's come back to what
is distinct to human intelligence why did that cause a metacrisis or a superorganism
how does AI relate to that and then what it would take what thing other than intelligence is also
relevant to ensure that the intelligence is in service to the to what it needs to be in service to
so we're not saying that humans are the only intelligent thing in nature obviously not nobody
nobody reasonably would say that but there is something distinct about human intelligence
so how do we define intelligence it's fascinating go look up on a bunch of
encyclopedias and you'll see that there are a lot of different schools of thought that define
intelligence differently some do it in terms of formal logic and reason some do it in terms of
pragmatics which is the ability to process information to achieve goals some do it just kind
of from a information theoretic point of view of the ability to intake information process it and
make sense of it and all of these are related I'm not going to try to formalize it right now but
I'm going to focus on the applied side because it ends up it ends up being the thing that's selected
for and it ends up being the thing that wins short-term goals and that obviously we're building
AI systems for so there we can say intelligence is the ability to figure out how to achieve goals
more effectively and so or we can just say the ability to achieve goals we can see that a slime
mold has the ability to achieve goals and it will figure out and reconfigure itself a termite colony
figures out how to achieve goals and it reconfigures itself there's some element of learning
and when you watch a chimpanzee figuring out using this stick versus this stick to get larvae out of
a thing you can watch it innovating and learning how to achieve goals so all of nature has intelligence
what is unique about human intelligence relative to other things relative to other let's just say
animals we could talk about plants funguses all the kingdoms but that gets harder so let's just stick
with other animals well first we realize that we can't talk about this properly because from an
evolutionary perspective there were things between the other animals that we look at now and humans
meaning earlier hominids and so where do we call humans in that distinction so since they're not
around we can mostly talk about sapiens versus everything else on the planet that we're aware
about this point but we can say that the thing we're calling humans starts before homo sapien
probably with homo habilis or australopithecus or somewhere around there having to do with not
we are the ninth we're the ninth homo and perhaps the last we don't know
so people might question what kind of weird anthropocentrism is it that would have you
say that you know that you have some kind of intelligence the whales don't have or the chimps
don't have or whatever and i think it's very fair to say what it is like to be a whale we really
don't know and what about the experience of whaleness the quality of the sentience of it
might even be deeper than ours might be more interesting in some ways totally right like
no no that's a harder problem in kind to address but we can in observing their behavior
say there are types of goal achieving that they clearly don't have the ability to do in a prima
evidenced way that we obviously have the ability to do they have not figured out how to innovate
the tech that makes them work in all environments the way we have they have not even figured out
how to stay away from boats that are whaling boats and so from their most obvious evolutionary
motive how to figure out that thing is not a thing that they've really done and so we can
see in a prima facie sense that they are not innovating in technology and changing their
environment making the equivalent of an Anthropocene in a similar way even when we see the way that
beavers make beaver dams and change their environment or ants do they do it roughly the
same way they did it 10 000 years ago humans don't do it roughly the way we did it 10 000 years ago
so we can see something unique about humans in our behavior related to the innovation in technology
and environment modification in whales defense they don't have opposable thumbs and they're
underwater but um but i'm with you keep going well this is not putting whales down i think
opposable thumbs are pretty significant to the story right i think there are things about the
evolution of homo sapiens that probably have to do with the combination of narrower hips from
uprightness that allowed us to de-weight the hands that allowed them to be more nimble and
opposable with the larger heads that involved neoteness birth and there's this whole complex of
things um and so in no way to saying that humans have more of this particular kind of innovative
intelligence mean have a more meaningful right to exist those are totally separate things right
doesn't mean have a deeper experience of the world those are different things so so let me let me
get back to uh something you just said a minute ago unless this is where you were heading but you
said intelligence is problem solving um en route to a goal and most animals in nature their goal is
is uh well it's security and mating and reproduction but energy uh energy return is a primary goal
in nature to invest some energy and get a higher amount back because that enables all sorts of
other optionality energy calories in nature are optionality for organisms so the problem with humans
isn't the intelligence per se it's the goal i don't even want to call it a problem yet i want to
call it a difference we'll get to the problem in a minute okay so all right um i want to say
something because this is related here about modeling because human intelligence all forms
of intelligence have something to do with modeling they can take in information from the
environment and be able to forecast what happens if they do something enough to be able to inform
their next choice which choice is more likely to achieve some future goal even if future goal is a
second right so let me let me interrupt there doesn't that does that differentiate humans
that we have if we model something that we have the perception and ability to consider time
and how does time factor into intelligence we're not the only animal that has a relationship to
time but we definitely have the ability to have abstractions on time that seem to be unique from
what we can tell and we also have the ability to have abstractions on space and abstractions
on other agents and there's something about that uh the nature of abstraction itself that is related
to the what is novel in human intelligence the type of recursive abstraction and so but there's
a reason i'm talking about modeling there's something a model of reality is taking a limited
amount of information from reality and trying to put together a proxy of that that will inform us
for the purpose of forecasting and ultimately choice making ultimately goal achieving in so far
as the model gives us accurate enough forecasts that it informs actions that achieve our goal
we consider it useful that doesn't mean that it is actually comprehensively right the models end up
being that they're optimizing for a narrow set of sense making just like what we were talking about
before that we optimize for a narrow set of goals and the reason i bring this up is because
all of our models that can be useful even in trying to understand the metacrisis and whatever
themselves can also end up blinding us to being able to perceive outside of those models so when
Lao Tzu started the Tao Te Ching with the Tao that is speakable in words or understandable uh
conceptually is not the eternal Tao it was saying keep your sensing of base reality
open and not mediated by the model you have of reality otherwise your sensing will be limited
to your previous understanding and your previous understanding is always smaller than the totality
of what is um i would even argue that uh thou shall have no false idols a model of reality that says
here's how reality works is the false idol which messes up our ability to be in direct perception
of new things where our previous model was inadequate so i say this because there are places
where a particular thing we're going to say is useful but it is not the whole story and it's
important to get where it's not the whole story so for instance if we talk about energy that doesn't
include the parts about materiality and the parts about intelligence and even if we talk about those
three that's actually not the whole story so it's useful but i'm wanting to call this out
if an animal is eating are they eating only for energy no they're also eating for
uh minerals and for enzymes and for vitamins and for proteins and for fats and not just fats that
will get consumed as energy but they'll become part of the phospholipid membrane of cells and
they're eating for materiality as well right and so it's not true that all energy is fungible
i can't really feed an elephant meat products well even though there's plenty of energy in it
so so so hold on a second so elephants also have what i refer to as the trinity
which is energy materials and technology they they try to get acacia trees they use their trunk or
some other tool and in the acacia leaves are energy the photosynthesis from the sun but also as you
said atoms minerals materials so there it's the same for animals as humans there's a reason why
how so i can't make certain amino acids from other amino acids i can't make some minerals from
other minerals no matter how much calcium i get i get no magnesium from them and i need a certain
amount of magnesium so of course if i don't get enough dietary input of vitamin d we get rickets
and die even if we get plenty of b vitamins and vitamin c and other things and so those nutrients
are non fungible to each other and you need all of them you needed the whole suite that a thing needs
which is why uh there's very interesting health studies that show people who are dying of obesity
are actually dying of diseases of malnutrition because i know we have a diet that has basically
optimized for calories with while stripping all the micronutrients out of them so you can be eating
tens of thousands of calories a day and actually becoming profoundly deficient in minerals and
phytochemicals and other things like that where then your body is wanting to keep eating because
it's actually starving and you continue to give it something that creates a neurochemical stimulus
that says you ate and satiates the hunger thing for a moment but what you're actually starving for
is not in that food um and so i don't i don't want to oversimplify that energy is a part of the story
everything we say is a part of the story but the the totality of the story is more complex
than however we talk about it right there's just there's something so important and sacred about
that because what is wrong about our narrow goal achieving is uh what's upstream from that is our
narrow modeling of reality and what even equals progress who is worth paying attention to how is
it all connected when i make a model that separates it all then i can up regulate this harm something
else but i don't even realize i'm harming something else because that's not in my model
um i don't even realize that that thing that i'm optimizing for isn't the actual thing
or is only a part of the whole thing and probably and then probably by definition we choose models
or inputs into the models that kind of confirm our own built identity up until that moment
and or win in some game theoretic way so if it achieves if the model damages lots of things
but makes me win the war that model will probably win and you can you notice how it's like
okay so we we get the inquisition we get the crusades we get some
fuck and gnarly violent cruel like figuring out how to optimize torture stuff
in the name of the guy who said let he who has no sins among you cast the first stone
and you're like how the fuck did we go from principles of forgiveness and let he who has
no sins cast the first stone into this version that says the inquisition is the right way to
to do that what you see is the interpretations there's lots of interpretations the interpretations
that lead to kill all your enemies and proselytize win in in the winning and short term warfare
not because they're more true or more good but because they orient themselves to get rid of
all of the enemies and have more people come into them and have nobody ever leave the religion
because they're afraid of hell and whatever so there is a and this is an example of there are
models that win in the short term but that actually move towards comprehensively worse
realities and or even self extinction evolutionary cul-de-sacs and i would argue that humanity is
in the process of pursuing evolutionary cul-de-sacs where the things that look like they are forward
are forward in a way that does not get to keep forwarding and at the heart of that is narrowing
is optimizing for narrow goals and at the heart of that is perceiving reality in a fragmented way
and then getting attached to subsets of the metrics that matter models which leads to us
wanting to optimize those models and those metrics and now i would start to define the
distinction between intelligence and wisdom here and that wisdom is related to holes and
wholeness intelligence is related to the relevance realization of how do i achieve a goal a goal
will be a narrow thing for a narrow set of agents bound in time modifying a fixed number of parameters
and so then i would say if human intelligence distinct from other types of animal intelligence
where we don't just have the ability to work within a range of behaviors that are in capacities
that are mostly built into where the primary physical technology is our bodies right the
animals evolved to have claws to have blubber for the cold to have whatever it was that was a
technological innovation to be affected within its environment and it can't become radically more
of that thing by choice by its own understanding it becomes more of that thing through genetic
selection which is super slow and it doesn't control and the mutation that makes the giraffe
have the slightly longer neck or the cheetah a little faster or whatever it is is happening as
the rest of the environment is going through similar mutations so the cheetah is getting a
little faster but so are the gazelles and there's co-selective pressure so that if the cheetah
gets a little faster first and eats the slower gazelles then what's left is the faster gazelles
whose genes inbreed right so you have tiny changes happening across the whole system
and co-up regulating each other so there are symmetries in the rivalry that lead to the entire
system still maintaining its metastability not stability meaning a fixed equilibrium a homeo
dynamics not a homeostasis that continues to increase in complexity over time but that metastability
is the result of that type of corporeal evolution right but then humans adaptive capacity is not
mostly corporeal it's mostly extra corporeal you call it extra somatic meaning outside of just our
body and it's both we can use a lot of calories outside of our body which started with fire
fire was the beginning of us being able to warm ourselves and all of a sudden make new
environments possible and make foods edible that weren't edible before right that was
but that's calories right that's extra somatic calories then our ability to get more
calories from the environment meaning gather more stuff kill more things
involve the innovation of tools right those spears those stone tools allowed a little group of primates
to take down a mastodon the combination of their coordination technologies with each other
because a single person couldn't do it and their stone tools together was able to do that you get
more caloric surplus the agricultural revolution really advanced that the oil revolution really
advanced that but at the heart of how did we figure out how to get oil and how to use it was
intelligence it was this kind of recursive intelligence that figures out I can use this in
service of my goals I wonder if
30,000 years ago some Neanderthal interbreeding with a human could ever imagine that 30,000
years later there would be a brain evolved like Daniel Spongeburgers well check this out
Tyson young caporta I don't know if he's been on your show yet or not
two weeks from now okay so great then you can follow this conversation up with some
things I learned from Tyson and other indigenous people who hold some indigenous wisdom knowledge
have told me similar things that one date back more than the standard current archaeological
narrative of when humans knew certain shit but also with kinds of wisdom that have definitely
been lost in the progress narrative and one of the things that Samantha Sweetwater told me
originally and then Tyson said something similar was that when that many of the indigenous cultures
had a story that when humans develop the first stone tools the apex predator of the environment
Samantha's version was the saber tooth came to the human obviously this is a story right but you
you get what it would mean that the early people had made the story and they said we were the ones
who were taking care of and maintaining the complex diversity of the whole system in this
kind of apex predator role you now clearly are and we're turning over the mantle of stewardship
of the whole to you your job because now you have the ability to destroy the whole ecosystem you
must be the steward of the whole thing and imagine that there is that that even recognizing because
maybe those stone tools were two million years ago right and maybe we already had just killed
a bunch of megafauna extincted them extincted some of our other hominid cousins through
gruesome kind of interspecies genocidal tribal warfare destroyed some environments and already
