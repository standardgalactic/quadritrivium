law of thermodynamics it's almost like an evolutionary theory the idea that any niche that
exists will get filled if there is some energy to extract in a place something will evolve to extract
that energy and we're saying now faster than biology can evolve to do it humans will innovate to
do it we will innovate how to extract the extra energy in a place and so anytime you get an increase
in efficiency you get whole new profitability potentials that weren't there and we end up
going into those so the idea that efficiency is a way of being able to become sustainable
doesn't work as long as there is an either an embedded growth obligation or an incentive around
net growth exactly now there potentially could be ways around that if you had a
jevons paradox uh dividend or something like that where you had an invention and you created all
this uh efficiency gains which were monetized but you had a rule that that bolus of new capital
that came from efficiency was um was devoted to some process or some future outside of the
super organism like building a local ecological watershed with renewable energy or something
that was full cycle then you could short circuit the uh the the efficiency the rebound effect
of the efficiency profits going into the global monetary energy hungry super organism
so the thing that you're saying right now is so consequential if people get it because
you're saying we have to go to a post growth economic system
that as long as the economy and dollars are coupled at all whether it's one for one or 99
percent or 80 percent even if there's efficiency if they're coupled at all in exponential growth
capital system there there just aren't an exponentially more amount of hydrocarbons
and so you and we're already at the point of diminishing return on the quality of hydrocarbons
fracking is shittier oil than the first oil was right it's harder to get to and after fracking
there's nothing that's the source rock there's nothing left after that but go on so we're at
this place where there's this this pegging between gdp and energy we're getting a diminishing return
on our energy source and there's an exponential requirement on capital simply because of interest
right we have to have more capital next year than we have the capital this year for the nature of the
how we set up the financial system so then there starts to become this larger delta of need to
keep having more capital which means need to keep having more energy have less and less easy to
access energy so i have to technologically innovate offshore oil drilling and fracking and
things but eventually you kind of run out of that and then there's a great reckoning so this is
not yet a great reckoning because the intermediate step is you paper over that with central bank
guarantees and and bailouts and and things like that but yes eventually there's a great reckoning
which i'm referring to as a great simplification and yes eventually by definition we will have to
have a post-growth economy if just increased efficiency isn't the answer because of the
jevons paradox what about just move to renewables why is that not good enough we replace all the
hydrocarbons with solar and wind in geothermal that's a whole two-hour podcast on its own but
let me give you some of the the high points as if you you often use this phraseology the difference
between potential and kinetic energy potential energy is unbelievably powerful because it's
sitting there untapped and you can move it especially oil oil is akin to hemoglobin and
our arteries and veins of our global system because it's liquid at room temperature and we
can move oil everywhere which is much different than wood or or coal or human muscle for that
matter at at that scale meaning oil can go through pipelines a lot faster than coal can go over
railroads exactly exactly and its oil is incredibly energy dense which is the amount
of energy you get per unit volume or unit mass renewables are like you have to go to the grocery
store and buy a bunch of ingredients to create a meal whereas the fossil hydrocarbons the meal is
already created so that's a little bit of the difference between kinetic and potential
the energy return is huge from the scale of the industrial infrastructure that's been built if
you think about it we have 500 billion human worker equivalents in the form of fossil hydrocarbons
and so we can't just say those are going to go away and then replace it with renewables first of
all we need those fossil hydrocarbons to build the renewables and renewables is not even a good
term right because an oak tree is renewable if there's an acorn one of my chickens is renewable
as long as the rooster has a fertilized egg with the hen but renewables like require rebar steel
and complicated clean rooms to make the silicone wafers and things like that at best they're
rebuildable because every 20 years or so we need to rebuild them what they do is they are
rebuildable machines that can harness the renewable flows of the sun and the wind
but from the super organism vantage point we are optimizing growth and growth requires more
energy whether it's fossil hydrocarbons or renewables or some combination so from
in 2019 we grew the amount of electricity demand in the world of all kinds
that just the amount of growth and electricity demand was more than all of the solar voltaic
power generation capacity built since the dawn of time so so far all the renewables are growing
very rapidly especially in the last year but the the the amount of fossil fuels underpinning
our society is around the same as it's been 50 years ago which is 83 percent so we're just growing
a bigger system we went we switched from wood to hydro to coal and eventually oil and gas
150 years ago even now today we are now using more wood for human fuel etc than we were 150 years
ago so we keep adding more energy to the system so renewables i am in favor of renewables
but the the current stories that are being told are that we're going to continue to grow by plug
and playing renewable technology for fossil fuels that's not going to happen so i think renewables
can power a great civilization it's just going to look very different than the one we have now
my understanding is that there's three primary reasons that the current
renewable tech path is insufficient and one is this topic of the hydrocarbon energy it takes
to make the solar cell in the batteries the energy return on energy investment calculus is not good
and i want you to get into that the next is that the energy quality is not comparable whether we're
talking energy density or transportability and the third is that there's stuff we do with hydrocarbons
it isn't just energy that is hard to replace in terms of chemistry and manufacturing and so when
we start thinking about getting off of oil and coal we have to think about each of those factors so
can you get in and if there are more please let me know those seem like the primary ones
and so it's like if if we have diminishing return on hydrocarbons and we need them for
manufacturing ongoingly then we have to get off of oil even before we run out of it for energy so
the amount of so we and if we were going to try to replace our current energy including the exponential
growth of the energy with renewables or rebuildables we just don't have what it takes to do that yet
because uh since they're not easily transportable we'd have to build them everywhere what it takes
to do that requires more hydrocarbons now to build all of that okay so just like a cheetah
chasing a gazelle there's an energy payoff there all of our current energy technologies have an
energy input versus an energy output and historically we would get a hundred to one ratio from
oil we would invest one barrel of oil to find a hundred sort of things um that went down to
obvious for anyone who's not used to thinking about industrial capacity to drill oil requires
running a machine that runs on oil so you've got to use some oil to get the oil and now what we're
talking about is using some oil to make the solar cells which means mining the material and manufacturing
and building the batteries and all that stuff right and there is no way right now of using
purely electricity to go deep into mines um it's diesel fuel and machines so um uh yeah there's so
much to unpack here daniel so first of all the energy return on renewables is viable there it's
it's a decent energy return let's let's take some of the recent optimistic reports that say that solar
and wind are 12 to 1 return and let's take the depleting coal is an 8 to 1 return so there's
a lot of difference of what those numbers mean well that means that if you take the life of a solar
panel and you use life cycle analysis that people say and this gets back to that boundary question
where do you draw the boundaries this is what i wrote my phd thesis on back in the day but um
that you will generate 10 times more energy during the lifetime of a solar photovoltaic
um layout than the energy that went into it so that's a pretty good deal not as good as oil
but but pretty good um now coal um is bulky and dirty and uh but you just throw it in a in a
power plant and you burn it and it generates electricity so the story that is the optimistic
renewable story is that on the surface renewables have a higher EROI than energy return than then
for example coal but what they're not taking into account is the full system cost of the energy
because the wind doesn't always blow as is evidence the last six months in Germany which is one of
the reasons that natural that electricity prices are so high because their wind basically didn't
blow for a month um so if you handicap for an intermittence and variability the full system
EROI or energy return on those renewable systems is down to like four to one and our economic
system couldn't function at a four to one return now there this is a really deep conversation but
we could overbuild wind and solar and use the extra when it's really windy or really sunny we
we generate way too much that we don't need and we put that into uh electrolysis and create ammonia
or or use that for other other economic products so we could boost it back up to five to one or
maybe six to one but full system cost fossil fuels are completed meals and we can't replace that
with renewables just to make sure that's clear for everyone one way of thinking about that is that
because of the intermittence you don't have that with oil or coal because you have the oil
stored on site and you can just burn more of it or the coal stored on site you can burn more as
demand goes up in real time and so it is a storage mechanism it's its own battery right it's already
stored energy well it gets back to the has to also have the batteries and so now we're looking at
the cost of the photovoltaic cell the batteries you know in that whole storage creation and
distribution system so natural gas is the perfect fuel for for power plants because no matter what
happens you just flick a switch and you burn it and whether it's windy or sunny or in the middle
of the night or the middle of the day whereas these other fuels have you know bells and whistles
that are required and if you want to make sure that the grid is on natural gas is like the perfect
feel for that of course there are there are emissions that come from it and that's one of the
other stories embedded here but let me tell you another big problem with renewables is that around
20 percent of our energy used globally is electricity and the vast majority of renewable
technology is used to generate electricity there are tons of ways that humans use energy
that can't easily be easily be replaced by renewables generating electricity for example the
big bunker fuel ships that carry things around the ocean you know liquid fuels heating things
like that can't some of those things can be replaced but at a cost and remember the whole
dynamic underpinning industrialization was this giant trade that we did kind of a Faustian bargain
in retrospect where we replaced things that humans used to do by adding thousands of units of energy
more than the humans did and because it was nearly free that was horribly energy inefficient
because we used tons more energy but it was incredibly economically efficient so when we
started that trade 200 years ago by adding huge amounts of energy to processes that humans used
to do manually that raised our wages it raised our profits it reduced the price of stuff and it
ended up being growing with more people so from the year 1500 to now if you take the number of people
and multiply that by the average goods and services per person the human economy is a
thousand times bigger than it was 500 years ago because of this adding energy to technology
to grow the system now you you might you of all people probably you the only people that would say
this is it is true back in the day there were things that we enjoyed in our lives a few hundred
years ago that weren't counted by goods and services in the economic system so is it really a thousand
times bigger yeah there could be some wiggle room there that we bartered and things like that that
were not included in the economic in the economic system but by and large that's it's three orders
of magnitude the the scale difference so you're starting to mention that there are emissions
associated with the natural gas that would otherwise be perfect if there was an unlimited
amount of it so probably the the central environmental story of the world today's climate change and
climate change from you know anthropogenic greenhouse gases which is not only CO2 it's
methane and some other things but mostly it's a CO2 story so that's the other side of the energy
story that you're talking about is the CO2 comes from burning those hydrocarbons right and so the
excessive CO2 equals changes in planetary biosphere and so everybody's very focused on the
uh need to reduce carbon consumption because of not wanting all the CO2 you're talking about
this whole other side which is we're actually running out of the hydrocarbon stores
also of course there's massive environmental impact on the front side of the materials economy
whether we're talking about mountaintop removal mining to get the coal or we're talking about
oil spells associated with getting the oil or we're talking about wars over oil in a whole
like geopolitically tent system based over where the oil distribution is
that that hydrocarbon system has environmental harm on the extraction plus environmental harm on
the waste that's associated but neither of those are factored into the cost of the oil which is
your point that when we're paying for the barrel of oil we're paying whatever it costs some oil
company it what what does it cost them to get it out of the ground plus whatever margin they put
on top of it which does not include what it would take to make more hydrocarbons or to
deal with the environmental impact or certainly to deal with the wars and geopolitical destabilization
as a result of the um you know uh location of it so this topic of why the cost of extraction
is core to what's wrong with economic theory can you unpack that a little bit more yeah so um we
have uh underpaid for the main resource input to our economies for over a century and we've not paid
for the cost of the pollution at all so the prices of everything are are wrong but they're not wrong
from a sense of maximum power that we're trying to get the evolutionary emotional states of our
ancestors in the cheapest way possible to the most amount of people that's what our economic
system is doing right now the problem is and you know this very well is a lot of our you you call
it our attention seconds or uh how we get dopamine and these other things is mostly by frivolous
means that don't give us long-term meaning or whatever so we're de facto turning billions of
barrels of ancient sunlight into micro leaders of of dopamine and calling that an economic success
but there's basically two broad categories of environmental impact one is as you point out
the metabolism downstream of human energy use my friend tim garrett has a chart showing
GDPs since the 1940s and co2 and monoloa and they are like in one for one tract so you can
look at the co2 in the atmosphere um and without knowing anything about the size of our economy
you can interpolate the size of our economy from that so we are functioning as a heat engine and
the oceans and the atmosphere are absorbing this excess co2 the other big environmental
categories what we do with the energy and that would be mountaintop removal or killing elephants
for ivory or overfishing the oceans or or those two things neither of those categories are do we
pay for in the prices of things part of that is a is a metabolic equation and part of it is a value
equation of what humans care about and and and what we want to include but
our prices do not include the negative externalities if you were to include daniel the negative
externalities full wide boundary of our energy use there would not be a single industry on the
planet earth that would be profitable because the the for instance there was a paper written that
shows the full cost of coal if you include climate and other things and it was like 18 to 20 cents
a kilowatt hour when we actually only pay for four cents so if you were to include all the
negative externalities in our prices our economic system would be much smaller and I think one way
out of this I personally have decided we are not going to voluntarily degrow it will never happen
there's too much momentum in the system there's too much inertia to you know political geopolitical
I mean look at what's happened with with COVID in the pandemic we have to print money and bail
people out to keep the economy going we're not going to voluntarily shrink but I think we will
eventually shrink when we run out of the ability to paper over these biophysical phenomenon with
debt and central bank guarantees and too big to fail and artificially low interest rates and
things like that and so this gets to your original premise I think we have to anticipate what might
happen and try to have our system bend and not break because break gets into many of the categories
of the x-rists that you're so fluent in bend means it gives humans another pathway forward
towards a saner longer lasting more meaningful culture and one of the ways we could do that
is get the prices right on the main input to our economies if we were able to
not only carbon but all non-renewable inputs have a tax on anything that's non-renewable on human
time scale so that would be natural gas or copper or fossil water aquifers or sand or
anything like that and then simultaneously remove tax on humans 95% of our taxes right now are on
