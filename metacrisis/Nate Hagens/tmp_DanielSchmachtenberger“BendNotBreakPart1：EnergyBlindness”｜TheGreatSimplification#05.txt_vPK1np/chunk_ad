human labor so if we removed all those you make $50,000 a year you keep your $50,000 you don't have
to pay any taxes but if you bought an iPhone which has all kinds of complicated expensive machinery
metals and minerals in there it might cost $2,000 or $3,000 relative to $500 today so if we had the
prices right we would be better able to innovate in a way that is aligned with our future and we
would probably conserve we wouldn't just fly to the Bahamas on a junket or Vegas or or just buy
shit from Amazon every day to give us a little bit more dopamine so I do think changing the prices
is one avenue but there's one one area that I think we skipped over that I think is important
is the material side so I talked about the the linkage between energy and growth there's also a
linkage between material or atoms and growth so for the last 50 years that relationship has
almost been entirely one for one so every dollar of GDP requires about two pounds of non-renewable
materials so that if an American baby born today will be expected to use 3.1 million pounds of
non-renewable materials in his or her lifetime extrapolating the past forward so this energy
it's not just energy it's energy combined with materials to develop technology so even if we
had abundant energy there would be material limits on earth with many of the especially look at what's
going on right now with lithium and and some of the inputs to electric cars and by the way
I will I will tell our listeners right now that because of our your busy schedule it is
9 0 5 p.m. right now and we're recording this so I might be getting a little slap happy with my
comments but here's another problem with renewals Daniel every barrel of oil and and natural gas
is not just used for gasoline gasoline is only 40 percent of a barrel of oil the rest of it is
heating oil and diesel and fractions that get converted into naphtha and asphalt and tar and
6000 other products like aspirin and football helmets and plastics and fertilizers and condoms
and tents and it's it's unbelievable how many products are made from these fossil hydrocarbons
so if we were just conceptually able to replace all the internal combustion cars on the planet
with electric cars in order to save climate change it wouldn't really it wouldn't reduce our
demand for oil at all it would reduce our demand for gasoline but we would still have all the other
products the 60 percent of the barrel of oil that we would have an economic system and requirement
for so what would we do with the gasoline then flare it or dump it in a river yes we could at
some cost change the refineries to use some of that and divert it towards those other products
but not all of it so that that's also something that gets glossed over in this this massive
shift towards electric cars so you mentioned mining a couple times and that getting electricity
down to do the mining is pretty difficult so that that's done in stored forms of energy like diesel
and whatever and that you were mentioning that there's a correlation of energy and dollars but
also a correlation of material and dollars from the point of view of waste I think when most people
who haven't studied the topic well think about waste they think about what they put in trash at
their house the municipal solid waste and they don't think about the total waste coming out of
industry and just even mining right like just the toxic tailings coming out of the fact that
the nice metals and all the things that we use were a part of a rock and ore where most of that
was useless but actually pretty toxic by the time you smelt it you get you know tens or hundreds
of parts of useless toxic mining tailings for each part of the thing that is useful and those
just go in these massive not landfills but dumps that then every once in a while break and go into
rivers and oceans and mess things up at scale when people start to understand the waste management
issue writ large of which co2 going into the air and ocean is one tiny little thing which is all
of climate change and is literally a tiny little thing and microplastics going into the ocean is
a tiny little thing when people start to think about that our materials economy is depleting
unrenewably from the earth on one side and turning it into waste on the other side and the
all the planetary boundaries the result of that and the whole thing is using energy unrenewably
right so we're using atoms unrenewably moving them by energy unrenewably we have to move to
a closed loop economic system where the new stuff is made out of the old stuff we don't
require an exponential amount more stuff and all of it is on renewable or rebuildable energy
the transition from here to there is fundamental and it requires a totally new economic system
because it can't be based on the same type of embedded growth obligation and there's the huge
question of what does that new system look like and then also how do we get there from here
with the embedded growth obligations and the competitions in the system because if we try
to create a tax nationally and some other country doesn't they benefit relative to us in terms of
their extraction capability which will end up meaning geopolitical and military capability
which means everyone says fuck it and it's just a race to the bottom so when you I mean first I
just wanted to say because you're a teacher you probably have already done this almost nobody
has a sense of like the computer that I'm talking on right now what it took from a supply chain
perspective to make this fucking thing like what I think every high school class should be every
high school should have a class that is what does it take to make one of these cell phones
from the oil to make the plastics to the materials refinement and the the lithography to make the
chips like no single human being knows how to make it it's it's a collection of processes and
components it's pretty much could you imagine a thousand years ago you just showing up with one
of these things they would have thought it was magic absolutely like Taiwan has come into the
center of public news recently and TSMC because of the you know South China Sea's issue but the fact
that we are so dependent on Taiwan because making computerships is so goddamn hard the U.S. has not
been able to do it to be able to like reduce its dependence on Taiwan yet you get a sense of like
the manufacturing that we take for granted is mind-bogglingly complex and you know and it really
is like six continents worth of supply chains to make anything and that's why I am an advocate for
continuing open-ended globalization for luxury things and things like that but for very key
ingredients and and key things like food and shoes and pharmaceutical inputs how long can we have
these six continent supply chains can we have more regional local supply chains for some things
the market is giving us the signal because of the financial response to the pandemic that
you know globalization and profits and everything will continue forward but I
I do think that's a big risk getting back to your your point your question I have a couple of
asterisks there first of all right now yes on the global level we recycle around nine percent
of the material input and that's actually gotten worse rather than better and ultimately yes we
have to have a closed or more closed loop system but how could that evolve because I think
a system away from economic growth and like you say there's no way that in a system right now that
requires debt and central bank support and rule changes and deficit spending by governments
they're not going to add a big tax on on a renewable non-renewable inputs right now because
that would hurt the system so I think we have to anticipate and this is what I'm working with our
colleague Dick Gephardt on the concept of advanced policy which is interventions and
plans and blueprints that our society are going to need in the next decade but that are politically
or socially impossible to happen now to do the research and build constituency into them and one
of them is this this untax project and we're we're doing research with imperial college in
London on looking how this would actually manifest and it's really complicated one of the
long shots but one of the trajectories and destinations we should go for is let's pay
the right prices for the long term to spur innovation in the right direction of the real
futures we're facing and we're just underpaying for all these things which said differently is
we're over consuming based on the long-term viability of of this stuff which is a one-time
endowment that we're burning through 10 million times faster than it was sequestered that is not
a happy thing to say that as a culture we're going to have to consume less and we're going to have
to have some sort of redistribution that accompanies that because attacks naturally would be regressive
everyone is familiar with what it means for the government to subsidize a corporation that's not
profitable because it's critical what you're basically saying is the market as a whole is
being subsidized by nature on a savings account that's about to run out and the entire market for
the most part is mostly not profitable in a way that would be sustainable because of the total
amount of costs that are being externalized and as soon as we run out of the stored free cheap
stuff and stop being able to handle the consequences of the pollution the cost of everything goes up
so much that it forces a restructure of the market and what we think is profitable and possible
by multiples to orders of magnitude what it currently is and that's the break scenario.
Well the break scenario is that the bend scenarios that we have a smaller economy
and we change our cultural objectives away from gdb towards well-being and social capital and
community and other things rather than gadgets the break scenario is that this all happens
without planning without blueprints and airbags and the global supply chains and or the geopolitical
kinetic warfare is the response to these sorts of crises.
Well it seems like bend is us try to proactively avoid the break of fundamentally not being able
to have energy keep up with dollars and if energy can't keep up with dollars and we keep
making fake dollars at a certain point the dollars will start to inflate so much and lose buying
power that faith in them will be lost and whether it's speculation against them or around the banks
or a downgrade of the bonds when you start losing the dollars purchasing power then that can break
a bunch of different ways it can look like shut down of supply chains it can look like wars over
resources but they're all pretty ugly. Right so we are growing our monetary claims
like this and the underlying energy and materials that we're going to need to turn those claims
into real wealth is going like this so the delta between those two is widening by the year
and the game is the plan the way to keep the system going we're kicking the can
and we're not planning for five or ten years from now when that recouples.
So how do you see being able to realistically do a proactive bend model factoring
factoring what it would take to come to global agreement between the major players to do so
because there is a disadvantage in the near term of anyone who bends relative to anyone who doesn't
and so unless you can get all of the major players to do it nobody's going to do it.
This is why I'm talking to you Daniel and others this is a really freaking serious moment
for our civilization for our nation for our culture I know the problems and the constraints
very well I'm not as fluent in the answers I think the answers are a combination of top down
that we have to have plans in place for this sort of economic trajectory and bottom up that
people start I have to start waking up realizing the time we're alive how much energy we use
what really matters in life if you ask a bunch of your friends what are the five best experiences
of their life it's unlikely to be huge exosomatic energy use it's going to be something with their
family or in nature or their friends and so we have to re-tether how we measure success in our
lives as individuals by more social capital and less tech heavy stuff to be pilots of what's possible
I don't think that's going to happen culture-wide but it could happen with a good number of people
that act as kind of a scout team towards a different way of humans using less energy
so I think these things because of human behavior that we are not good as a culture
at deferring the second marshmallow I think we will largely sleepwalk into these moments
which is why working with you and others I want to educate and inspire individual humans
to maybe simplify first and beat the rush and act as examples in their community and their
family and their neighborhood to start living differently in a way that we're going to probably
have to live regardless of what we choose in the near future so as we go back to what you
referenced in the very beginning of the model that a civilization can be thought of in terms of its
infrastructure its social structures and its superstructure the superstructure being how it
defines what the good life is what is fundamentally desirable what what the coordinating values of it
are culture is a way of talking about that you're saying right now hey we actually have to change
and deepen culture as the basis of what we're orienting the whole society to I would like
obviously you and I've talked about a number of these things and then as we're talking about like
the game theory between nations where none of them want to do the thing that is good long term
that disadvantages them in the short term if everyone doesn't because then they lose to whoever
wins in the short term and so you get these just fucked up collective action problems these kind
of race to the bottom scenarios so how do we solve those I think and yeah it's so complex mostly
people find one part that makes sense give up on the rest hope that the market a place of ideas
will solve it meaning that other people solve other parts they focus on their part but then
how all the parts fit together how the whole works nobody's really paying attention to
and so there are people who are just like I'm just going to focus on making renewables better and
hope that they get there in time and other people that are like I'm just going to focus on turning
some waste dreams into new materials or I'm just going to focus on some aspect of culture
I think one of the places that you and I identify identified shared agreement is
that there is critical stuff in our techno sphere in our infrastructure critical stuff in our social
structures or economics governance law and in our superstructure our culture and our values that
all need to evolve together and that they all inter influence each other each of those can
inter influence each other so it's not a solution it's a whole ecosystem of solutions that we have
to work on but they all have to be informed by understanding the problems in the interconnection
of the whole well enough that you don't advantage one part while externalizing the cost to the other
areas so I think we got to do and I appreciate you being available late at night your time I
think we got to do the beginning first part of this thing that is I found meaningful in your
work and was valuable for me to make more central of the embedded growth obligation and finance
being coupled to diminishing returns in energy that are not easily overcomeable through the
current renewable technologies and process or the efficiencies in process and that being a major
fucking thing that we have to deal with and that being connected to so many other things I think
we did a good job of starting that and maybe starting to get to what some of the transition
looks like some of the cultural parts some of the advanced policy parts can be our next conversation
that sounds good let me queue up the next conversation because I know you well enough
as someone who deeply understands the human predicament and you also have what I refer
to as wide boundary empathy but you're also incredibly productive you're a good friend you
do things for for people even if it means more of your time and you just seem really balanced
to me so so one question how do you manage to hold all this existential risk and the the depth of
the implications of the conversation we just had in your head and still manage to defer the marshmallow
and stay sane focus present and be a good human being to the people in your life because I think
that is the whatever you do that that's a formula that a lot more people are hopefully going to be
able to find do you have a couple minute summary of that and then we'll expand on that next next call
I read some of the books and watched so many of uh Krishna marti's lectures as a kid and one of the
things you would see him almost getting frustrated with when he'd be talking to the audience so many
times he's like let's really take this seriously he was fun he was looking at how do we live without
conflict and kind of what is the fundamental basis of conflict and can we overcome it especially as
we're becoming a nuclear and then you know exponential tech empowered species where the
conflict gets more and more consequential and why he's asking that how can we take the
seriousness because he knows that people are sitting there in the audience listening and then
they go home and they just completely fucking forget because they got they got a mortgage to pay and
they got you know children to tend to and they got jones is to compete with and they got whatever
and it's like wait wait are we actually taking seriously the fucking topics we're talking about
because if we do we have to change our life to say it's like it's like the death star is about
to take the planet out and you're on the planet and you realize the death star is going to take
the planet out and you're like we're we're gonna build a community garden and we're gonna work on
making a better school after school program with the pt and you're like wait wait like that's all
cool stuff but the death star is about to take the planet out like join the rebel alliance we've
got to fucking do something about this there's something to be able to like
take the scope urgency magnitude of the thing seriously enough to be transformed by it
and then it's easy to just go into existential angst and and either want to kill yourself or
or just go into hedonism and as a solution because hedonism is actually a reasonable
response to nihilism right yeah we're all gonna die so fuck it let's have some fun but to be like
that's just not an acceptable answer like i can i can die
