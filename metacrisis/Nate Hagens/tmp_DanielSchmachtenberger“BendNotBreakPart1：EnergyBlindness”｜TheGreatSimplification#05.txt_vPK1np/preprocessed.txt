Today's conversation is with my friend and colleague Daniel Schmockdenberger.
Daniel and I met a couple years ago. Turns out he's working on what he refers to as the meta
crisis, how climate and geopolitics and artificial intelligence and everything fit together
into this collective of risks. I had never heard of him and he had never heard of me or my work
or my network looking at energy, money, growth, ecology. We talked on the phone and the first
time I talked to him, I'll never forget it, we talked for three hours and at one time in the
conversation I got goosebumps on my left arm because he connected ideas that were in my head
that I had never connected. Those of you that know Daniel and listen to his podcast know that he
often does someone's thinking for them. He's that sort of an intellect.
Daniel's current main focus is on the risks that social media and artificial intelligence
pose as this exponentially growing function that's hijacking our minds as individuals
and at a cultural level is impeding or even negating our collective ability to orient and
adapt to our current challenges. Daniel and I always talk for hours. I wish I would have recorded
our previous long phone conversations but we decided to start recording with this one.
Our intent was to lay the foundation of what I refer to as the energy blindness of our culture
and how many people miss the relationship between technology, energy, money and growth
and what that means for our future constraints. What we intended on doing is merging my story on
the macro superorganism that we self-organize towards profits. The profits are tethered to energy
which are tethered to carbon and there's a growth imperative in there and merge that
with his story of an AI-induced profit seeking, call it micro-organism, capturing our attention
into a grand synthesis of the human predicament and how we can steer society in the future
towards bending instead of breaking in the coming decade. In an unexpected way,
Daniel ended up interviewing me in this podcast so it was a bit weird but I hope you find it helpful
and interesting background to the part two in the series in the near future which is going to be
taking a deeper dive of how these things fit together and part three will be the bend versus
break, how we should think about this, what we should do as individuals and as a culture. I
hope you enjoy the conversation. Daniel, good to see you my friend. Good to see you my friend.
Happy to be in this discussion with you today. We scheduled this like three weeks ago and I've
had three weeks to think about creative ways to shape my beard to compete with yours and I decided
I'm just going to settle for some beard compersion and be in awe of your beard and compersion is a
word that you taught me which is instead of being jealous you can be happy for other people's
magnificence, well-being, etc. So welcome. I shaved off my giant COVID beard before we did
our podcast. Is that right? Okay. Daniel, you and I have known each other on two years now.
I found you because many of my friends were sending links to your talks saying you guys have to
join forces and have a conversation. We've now spent a couple weeks in person working on
various projects dealing with technology, social media risks to governance and sense making, etc.
And I just feel a deep bond with the fact that you are living your life in a similar way to I am.
I'm not knowing all the answers but striving for some pro-social cultural transition
and educating and inspiring people so I'm very happy that you're on the program.
Yeah, I was really happy that you were starting this podcast and I'm excited about the
things we get to talk about today. So real briefly, for people in my network that don't know about
you could you briefly describe your work a little bit of conciliants project and what you're trying
to do? Yeah, roughly I have been as a kid was interested in environmental topics, social
justice topics, animal rights topics, all different kinds of activism and also then
had a deep interest in kind of system science and looking at how all of those problems had
certain interconnections where you could solve one problem but display some of the problems
somewhere else or had common drivers like perverse economic incentive and collective
action issues and started forecasting and seeing that many of those problems were reaching critical
tipping points of global catastrophic risk and that just kind of got me thinking about how do we
make a mature civilization that can be a safe steward of exponential tech, the power that
exponential tech gives and what is a civilization that makes it through its technological adolescence
look like and so that looked like catastrophic risk, existential risk, kind of assessment and
rethinking our social systems, governance, economics, law, rethinking our kind of cultural
and value systems, educational process and obviously also rethinking our technological
systems, how do we make a techno sphere and a social sphere that are in harmony with the biosphere
long-term and so what we're focused on with Consilience Project right now towards those
kind of big picture goals is how to frame up the actual state of the world, the metacrisis that
so many different environmental issues and exponential tech mediated x-risk issues and
economic and supply chain issues are all part of, right, that there's a profound interconnection
of these things, there's some core underlying stuff that has to get addressed, how do we frame
up the metacrisis well enough and what the design criteria of its solution, it's not one solution,
there'll be lots of different things that have to happen, but what the right design criteria are
that a lot more of the world can start innovating in the, you know, in a well-informed direction
and that's through papers, through kind of strategic education of people in specific
institutions and verticals and, you know, discussions like this and obviously this is
how we got connected from my side was a friend connecting us because of you having a big picture
story on what the kind of metacrisis and overview of the state of the world is, what some specific
near term catastrophic risks that are pretty fundamental are that are being really under
addressed, which I'm excited to actually dive into today even though it's a subset of the whole
topic, the energy blindness topic, because it really is something that you emphasize well and
clearly that it is so underrepresented in the overall assessment of the state of the world,
so yeah, that's a bit. I was happy that you, to discover that you and I both use the same
anthropological reference to frame some of our work. The work of cultural anthropologist
Marvin Harris called cultural materialism. He frames all historical human cultures have
something in common. They have a superstructure, which is the ideologies, the beliefs, the memes,
the stories that the culture tells. In the middle is the structure, which is the institutions and
the rules and the laws and the economic system, but underpinning it all is the infrastructure,
which is the energy and the throughput and the waste streams and how the system functions.
You and I both agree that what's coming in the coming decades is we're going to have to solve
all three of those. We're going to have to move them together. I think that's what we're going
to talk about today, is a lot of people work on just one of those areas, and we're going to need
all synthesized. The energy, materials, growth, money, technology, story, when we talk about
cultural transitions, that is not as fluent and as frequently dove into as social cultural change.
So, I thought today you and I could take our version of a deep dive into that.
Though it is a bit of a strange thing to do, this being one of the early shows in your new podcast,
I like the idea of me getting to ask you some questions regarding your core
frames in this area, since we've dialogued a lot and I happen to know them. I think they're
important and it's always tricky when you have expertise in a topic and you host the podcast,
you're holding context for other people's content. This might be a nice way to get some of the core
content through so that your listeners and maybe future people coming on the show will have that
as some of the context to speak into. So, I would like to talk with you specifically about
the bend not break model as you propose it and energy blindness and why that is both near-term
and central. Though that is obviously a subset of all the things for us to talk about and hopefully
we'll do more of these. Does that sound good? Yeah, great. So, I have a elevator pitch about the human
predicament and how we got here and then there's a lot of components there but maybe I'll just
start with that and then you just dive in and interject and push back and ask questions.
So, energy is fundamental to nature. Energy is the currency of life. In natural systems,
organisms and ecosystems that self-organize around any energy capture have an evolutionary
advantage. If you don't have surplus energy as an animal, you can't reproduce and have misses and
have homeostasis and everything. So, the ratio of energy return to the energy invested as caloric
pursuit in nature is a huge driver and that also applies to human systems and we've been a species
for 300,000 years and for 290,000 of those years we were hunter-gatherers. We worked 20 hours a
week and the rest of the time rested and told stories and everything and then when the climate
changed around 10,000 years ago, it warmed and stabilized in no fewer than seven places on earth.
Did we stop our hunter-gatherer ways and start more agricultural ways and what we were doing there
is spending, we were time minimizing, we were accessing more energy surplus and we were able
to store it. It wasn't just meat that would go bad after a week, it was grain which we could store
and that would even out the feast or famine in coming months and what that allowed to happen
is we had access so we could have more higher population, we could trade with other areas,
we could devote other people to be warriors or priests or accountants or guards or whatever
and so the agricultural revolution changed everything about humans and you fast forward
to nation states and beyond and we started to expand around the world and then we happened upon
a vast bounty of energy surplus that was stored underneath the earth and since the 1800s or so
we have been drawing down this energy battery which is the stored carbon and hydrocarbons in
the form of oil, coal and natural gas 10 million times faster than it was sequestered by the daily
trickle charge of photosynthesis in the deep past of earth and our economic system is treating
this as if it were interest when it actually is our principle. This fossil hydrocarbons are
unbelievably powerful relative to what humans did with muscle and animal labor before them.
One barrel of oil Daniel and I'm sure you know this has 5.7 million British thermal units worth
of energy which translates to 1700 kilowatt hours of work potential. You or I digging ditches or
hauling hay bales or planting potatoes generate around six tenths of a watt of power in a workday
versus 1700 and 60 kilowatt hours so one barrel of oil does around five years of our work
and all we have to do is pay for the cost of extraction from getting it out of the earth so
if it costs $50 for us to get it out of the earth we sell it to the market at 60 and our
economic system treats that as if it were just the same as any other $60 an expensive haircut or
some food or some earmuffs or whatever it is and energy is needed for absolutely everything in
our economies. There is no substitute for energy other than another form of energy.
Basically we have now we need energy for everything that results in a good or service in our GDP so
right now it doesn't have to be this way in the future but right now GDP is cannot decouple from
energy because it's a measure of how much stuff we burn it's goods and services and there's energy
that is required to refine deliver maintain run and dispose of every product on earth
and we can get into that a little bit but let me finish the the the thesis so we now are in a
culture that optimizes for growth and we as individuals as families as small businesses
as corporations as nation states we are trying to maximize financial surplus money profits which
are tethered to energy which are tethered to hydrocarbons and we can't stop or slow down because
the system requires growth to continue and to pay off the financial claims from the past
and so what we're doing is we're kicking the can with various rule changes with debt etc
and we have to continue to grow but the growth is tethered to energy and the only way that we're
continuing this right now is by central banks and governments blowing up their balance sheets in order
to keep goods and services flowing to large populations so what has happened is the market
or the downward causation of a higher level system than human individuals
is imposing rules on our behavior that are out of our control and so we are de facto the human
species right now is functioning as an energy hungry superorganism it's not like a hive mind
like the Borg it's that we as individuals are individual cells of a larger entity that is
compelled to grow and you brought up the word energy blind most people think that technology
is what drives the human progress machine and it's really the combination of technology and energy
that has brought us to this point but technology is dependent on energy so one day when we don't
have this amount of cheap energy at scale technology is going to play a much different role
yeah I think all of the really important points are touched on there and I just want to take this
time and unpack them I'll kind of start from the beginning we could say that this is a kind of
thermodynamic perspective that is focused on the fact that for an evolutionary perspective to exist
the traits that are going to get selected for involve an animal moving
involve you know some kind of metabolic process in the core to all of that is the
ability to harvest energy from the environment one of the deepest definitions of life is actually
an entropy pump something that can take more energy from the environment and externalize its
entropy and so then you're looking at the way that human technology starting with stone tools
and then agricultural tech and then industrial tech allowed us to harvest more energy from our
environment than other animals to be able to do future surplus stuff and then to be able to compete
with others over the future surplus and grow populations faster and how how fundamental of
a kind of defining characteristic this thermodynamic combined with competitive or like it's a
thermodynamic and then evolutionary theory together where the tech ends up evolving
our capacity to extract energy and use energy for more stuff which increases our kind of
ability to win at wars and economic wars and whatever else driving an arms race of the ability
to extract externalize etc faster driving ultimately fragility of the planet writ large
i don't think we've ever talked about this but have you heard of the fourth law of thermodynamics
loosely defined called the maximum power principle please explain it so in nature organisms
and ecosystems that self organize around capturing energy surplus as i said earlier
have an evolutionary advantage so if you if they've taken aerial views over a forest transect
and the hottest place is the the road where nothing's growing the coolest place is where
an old growth redwood tree is growing because it's dissipating more energy so in nature those
those ecosystems that are able to capture more energy have an advantage and it it ends up resulting
in a scaling law called cleaver's law which is that animals energy use scales to the three
quarter power of their size and this works for mice all the way up to blue whales and so the
size of the organism show dictates how much energy it uses well lo and behold if you aggregate all
the countries in the earth the the slope of global gdp is right around the the size of the gdp to
the two-thirds power it's not exactly the same but the relationship holds even as a biological
organism the whole human economy yeah so you mentioned initially two types of surplus and
extraction both of which were hydrocarbon the first one being grain with the advent of the plow
and baskets kind of early agriculture revolution the second being um oil and coal hydrocarbons
that time i think it is kind of interesting that they are both calories they're both measures of
energy they're both hydrocarbons they're both uh sun impounded by plants turned into hydrocarbons
as stores of energy um and one of them is being generated every season oh or kind of in real time
the agricultural one the other one is from you know tins or hundreds of millions of years of
storage um but they're both about developing more technology one case the plow the second case like
the oil drill and refinery to be able to extract stored sunlight yeah i can i call it current
sunlight which is crops old sunlight which is trees maybe you'll chop down a hundred-year tree
and then ancient sunlight which is tends to hundreds of millions of years ago and you're right
you can use technology to to access those pools of of potential energy so to go back to the agriculture
revolution going from hunter gatherer to an agrarian culture in the plow uh you were mentioning
the key thing being that grains were more storable than say what you could hunt and gather
meats and berries and stuff more storable means you can make it through the famine and grow the
population faster and then if you grow the population faster you can win a tribal warfare and now
you also have more stuff that is worth invading for another tribe so now you have to do defense and
military and all the things that go along with having that surplus and now for the first time
the economics of needing to deal with surplus come about so private property ownership and
inheritance and all those things was like it was a big deal that particular transition that was when
that was when our species ate the apple in the Garden of Eden it's interesting you know just if
it's not clear that was also kind of in one way the beginning of the Anthropocene yep because before
that you want nature to be pretty much the way it is to hunt and gather from this is the first
time you want to start clear cutting an area to turn it into agriculture land for lots of grain
because in a gather environment there's not enough grain to be useful you've got a row crop it to then
be able to drag a plow behind it so you can kind of consider the beginning of the Anthropocene and
the beginning of extraction of stored energy corresponding together yeah no that's right and
what also happened um is that's when inequality really started to occur we were always
in equal in terms of status and respect and things like that but we were always incredibly
equal in terms of consumption because we didn't have anything we didn't have stuff to carry around
with us everyone's actual consumption of of outside of the body calories was pretty much the same
but once we started soaring surplus that's when the the hierarchies started yeah the beginning
of the thing we call civilization that started scaling well beyond the Dunbar number which
equalled how to domesticate wild type humans that would have otherwise been Dunbar tribal
right and I bring that up because there is and we could talk about this another time but just
briefly there's a lot of binary discussion about human nature and I strongly believe that
one of the generator functions of civilization is who we are as evolved organisms and our
evolutionary psychology and we are incredibly plastic and our cultural plasticity is even
greater than our individual plasticity but to say that that humans are this way there's thousands
of examples of how cultures and humans lived in the past and we just look around us and think this
is how humans are and it's we are living an anomaly with this massive massive amount of
exosomatic energy and and before I forget to say the point exosomatic energy is energy that we consume
but not by eating it's outside of the body so inside the body the average American consumes
like 2,500 calories outside the body the average American consumes over 200,000 kilocalories per
day in the lights and the airplanes and the shopping centers and the libraries and the buses etc
so we are the only species that massively uses energy outside of the body and that is only made
available by the fact that we're accessing this pool of stored hydrocarbons so I can get back to
that but it's it's just we we completely are blind to the fact that our current global culture
uses five 100 billion barrel of oil equivalents worth of coal oil and and gas we use around 30
billion barrels of oil and the rest is is coal and natural gas but that works out to at five
five years per barrel that means we have a global labor force of 500 billion human equivalents
relative to five billion real human workers excluding children and and old people so we
have like a hundred to one armies of fossil workers standing behind us and the economic system
only treats their value as the cost of extracting them from the earth and so economics textbooks
have completely missed this and economists aren't dumb they just told the wrong story as we were
going up this this moonshot of growth that we've had this last century they have all kinds of
complicated formulas that explain it most of the story is now capital and labor that we apply those
two factors to our economy and then this resulting riches and progress and and productivity when the
reality is a good deal of that can be described by this additional labor that is in the form of
fossil carbon and hydrocarbons which is energy so it's easy to see once we have oil that is running
industrial engines and the tractor replaces the plow and the and the automated or the industrial
mill replaces you know kind of human labor we can see the labor there but if we go back to
the earliest examples of what you're calling extra somatic or extracorporeal energy there's
the storage for human consumption which was the grain but then there's also the usage of it for
things other than just human caloric consumption but that are part of our life and you can see that
going all the way back arguably to harvesting fire right like that you could kind of see that as
the beginning of starting to use energy probably mostly in the form of wood drive entropy to meet
human needs in a way that was totally different than the rest of the animal kingdom and so if we
to just kind of finish out that early part of the story before hunter-gatherer ended with
kind of agrarian or before the agrarian mark of being able to do agriculture or store grains
there was the stone weapons and the fire going all the way back to pre-sabian right homo habilis
kind of time where the stone weapons meant that we could hunt we increased our predatory capacity
relative to the animals faster than they could evolve increasing their capacity to evade it in
a way that didn't happen for any other animal because they weren't evolving their tools they
were just evolving physically and there's a cemetery of that evolution so we were able to move from
we were able to over hunt an environment and then rather than have our population get checked
move to the next place and over hunt that one so even in that long hunter-gatherer time and burn
stuff up for the usefulness of fire to make cold environments hospitable to us and food that wouldn't
have been so you can see we kind of started doing that with the beginning of like fire and stone tools
then we did it way more with agriculture then we did it way more with industrial and then way
more again with kind of information and but they're all steps in that same story absolutely
absolutely we are uh an innovative creative curious problem solving can kicking species
but the big two movements were the agricultural access of grain and storing it we had been
couple million individuals and down to a hundred thousand individuals many times
over the last several hundred thousand years and then agriculture within a few millennium we were
200 million and now we're sometime next year we'll cross eight billion but if you think about the
oil story becomes so big which is where you're going to emphasize is because before oil we were
half a billion people that's right right and well from half a billion to eight billion in like
that much time because of the industrial revolution
so 10 000 years ago
animals mammals relative to humans were like 99 percent of the biomass now humans in our
livestock if you weigh all of us we're 98 percent of the mammalian biomass on the planet
but if you look back now versus 10 000 years ago the amount of total animal biomass on the
planet today is 700 percent what it was 10 000 years ago how can that be because we've added
that enormous bolus of fossil productivity to the food supply so the agricultural revolution
was when we used technology to use the Haber-Bosch process to take natural gas
and create ammonia fertilizer which added nitrogen to the fields 60 percent of the nitrogen in our
bodies today has a chemical signature coming from natural gas so we've massively boosted the food
supply directly from fossil carbon and hydrocarbons so not only did we originally gain
extra storable calories hydrocarbonized with grain and then we start getting extra hydrocarbons in
the form of oil we use the oil ones to be able to increase the manufacture of grain and other
agricultural products by orders of magnitude yes and there's there's a common stat out there
that's actually slightly incorrect but for most of our history our agricultural system was a net
energy producer we would spend a certain amount of calories with our muscles and our animals
and we would get more calories than that back but now our our food system is a massive energy
sink we spend 10 to 14 calories for every calorie that we produce the the misnomer is that 10 calories
of fossil fuels are added to get one calorie of food the truth is it's like two calories of fossil
but then the the 10 to 14 comes from the processing the packaging the delivering the cooking
so our entire food system it uses 10 times the energy that it it produces in in you know full
full cycle and this is due to oil and natural gas and we just look at the end product and don't
think about the full system that created it so when we talk when you're mentioning that the
that energy is pretty pegged to the economy that the total GDP of the world and total energy use
are pretty closely correlated because lots of things that we make out of one material we could
make out of another material there's a lot of different conductors and insulators and whatever
but they all require energy that's pretty fundamental and that whether we're moving
that value in the economy is moving atoms around in the physical world or bits around in the virtual
world both of those require energy this seems to be also very fundamental to where you're going in
terms of the viability of the economy that the embedded growth obligation is in the economy
but that creates an embedded growth obligation the extraction of energy and we're getting to
diminishing returns on the earth's stored ability to keep giving that and that that's
really fundamental to what the near-term future portends can you unpack that a little bit yes
lots of things to say there so no matter how you make a cup whether it's a coconut or gold
or ceramic or glass or aluminum you need energy no matter what so you can get better and you can
get more efficient over time but energy is required for any any process so over the last
well before 1970 the relationship was almost one for one every time we grew our GDP we grew our
energy use at around the same percent then we started to get efficient in the 1970s and for
instance we were a lot of places were using oil and power plants and burning natural gas is much
more efficient we started to get used coal in a smarter way we started to do new inventions that
would use a little bit less energy to get the same product so in the last 50 years we there's two
trends there's GDP has been growing and energy use grows almost the same rate but at around 99
percent so on average we get one percent more efficient and that matters after 50 years you
you're using 50 less energy than you were 50 years ago but no matter what next year if you have a
factory where you make 100,000 cars and you decide to expand your your business and you want to make
200,000 cars you're going to use almost twice as much energy so de facto they're incredibly linked
but here's where there's a couple of misunderstandings some countries have decoupled their economic
output from their energy use there's something called the energy intensity of GDP which is how
much energy we need to generate a dollar of GDP the United States the United Kingdom are service
based economies so we actually have gotten much more efficient generating GDP by using less energy
but the the important thing from the superorganism vantage point which is our future sustainability
our ecosphere our climate our oceans is what the whole human system does and the whole human system
is is extremely tightly tethered over 99 percent because the United States and the United Kingdom
in America the average American consumes 57 barrels of oil worth of fossil fuels per year
but we import another 17 or so from China in we don't import the oil from China we import the
televisions and the plastic salad bowls and and things like that the energy was burned in China
we pay dollars for it and it comes here so it's our it's part of our consumptive footprint
but the bottom line is that globally energy and GDP are tightly linked one other caveat I would say
there the last five to eight years it seems to be globally a little bit more decoupling and this
is an artifact of this massive blowoff in the financial markets due to central banks because
of the way that pension funds are treated in in the GDP calculations and when and if I would say if
or I would say when stock markets recalibrate that relationship will tighten back up
around the 99 plus percent okay so that second point equals I would just call it financial
manipulation where you can make more dollars that are not actually indexing more goods and
services and that'll end up re-correcting but in so far as the dollars are indexing goods and
services you're going to get a pretty tight correlation I want to come back to and it's
important because sometimes people will see a financial manipulation and treat it as if
they're decoupling and then change our forecasts of energy viability and you're like no not really
you're kind of missing the point here so I think that's really important I want to underscore it
but I want to come back to the nation's one for a moment because what you're saying is okay so
this kind of wealthy nation that doesn't do its own manufacturing and production and
waste management and largely exports kind of tech services can make it seem like it has higher
GDP relative to its own domestic energy use but it's bullshit because it's just exporting all of its
like really high energy intensive stuff to the manufacturing that's happening somewhere else
it then imports the product of and I find this like I find this for so many things you can take
a country that has a good genie coefficient but it's just because it exported all the cheap labor
to somewhere else that it depends upon to get its stuff so you're like you don't really have a good
genie coefficient your economic inequality that's needed to make your civilization run is still very
high because you just buy your shit from cheap labor from somewhere else yeah well this gets to
your whole objective of your work is is sense making and and information because on all these
issues you can draw your boundaries somewhere and come up with an answer and what humanity needs
is wide boundary thinking we need to look at the larger boundaries because then we know what
what doors are shut and which ones remain open so yeah we need to look at the wider boundary
this is why I think your superorganism perspective is really important because of course you can have
a what looks like a local improvement in one area that actually is and now it's cool we should
understand that as a prototype but oftentimes it's not really a local improvement it's just
externalizing the harm somewhere else and then measuring inside of a of a boundary something
that crossed the boundary and so this is where we have to say okay for the superorganism as a whole
that the countries that have to do the agriculture and the manufacturing and the cheap labor and the
whatever now let's look at the metrics and say for a civilization that depends upon the whole
thing because the countries don't depend on themselves they depend on six continent global
supply chains and they depend on the commons of the oceans and all like that so we really have to
look at the superorganism writ large to really make any sense of it it doesn't involve externality so
if people haven't read your paper um on on superorganism uh issue I think it's fundamental
but I want to come back to this other thing that you were saying about increases in efficiency
that energy does get slightly more efficient can you explain the jevons paradox to people for
for people who aren't familiar with it because it seems like a lot of people have hope that we're
going to solve the energy issue by increases in efficiency so um William Stan Stanley Jevons
was a 19th century economist who paradoxically predicted that the massive beneficial invention
of the steam engine which made things way more efficient than horses uh or what came before
paradoxically would end up having humans use a lot more energy even though it was more efficient
that's because most more people could afford things uh things would be done faster they would build
more of these steam engines and that is of course what happened so today um I think this
let me first sidetrack and and talk about um the two types of technology um so first of all
technology is deflationary because the market system and innovation and people are incentivized
to make better inventions so over time things that are tech heavy like uh flat screen TVs
will get cheaper and cheaper until the asymptotically you you just can't get them any cheaper but so
tech is deflationary the counter to that is depletion which is that we've accessed the best
fossil hydrocarbons that are the main input to our economies and then
we have to access the next harder tranche etc eventually there's nothing left but we're not
there yet so these two forces uh between technological deflation and resource input
inflation are battling so when we think about technology there's really two categories of
technology the first tech the first category is ways to make our uh energy use our energy capture
more efficient for example we could develop new uh solar voltaic cells that are more efficient
or we could take a power plant and the amount of energy that we input we get more electricity out
of that the second type of technology is inventing new ways or ways that humans use energy that we
used to do manually and now we have machines do it or new ways like facebook that we never had
before and now it's a new vector for energy use so it's that second category of technology
that dominates our global technology portfolio which ends up building more and more things
that are a vector for more energy use next year now jevons paradox means that if something gets
more efficient the people will buy more of it or the savings that they have from saving money on
that thing will be spent at walmart on some things that they bought from china so what ends
up happening is efficiency is in service of the super organism to a large extent so efficiency
as long as we have gdp as our cultural goal where the market system and individual and and uh
corporations and and businesses optimize profits via gdp efficiency will just feed more money into
that system in a in a positive feedback loop and we'll use more energy in the future did that make
sense yeah i want to go a little bit deeper here because i think people really having an
intuition for this paradox is so important the idea that there's stuff that we do that mediates
our current quality of life and we can make it more efficient like it seems like that is a way
to be able to have less impact on the planet we can do shit more efficiently so we can use less
stuff and still have the same quality of life except that's never what happens right the jevons
would be true if the scale was capped great and so the jevons paradox says you were kind of
mentioning from the demand side people buy more shit at walmart but also from the supply side
there are certain products and services that are just not profitable to make yet but if i drop the
price of energy enough is one of the inputs whole new market sectors open up there's whole new
businesses and industries that can now be profitable and uh so this what you're calling the fourth
law of thermodynamics it's almost like an evolutionary theory the idea that any niche that
exists will get filled if there is some energy to extract in a place something will evolve to extract
that energy and we're saying now faster than biology can evolve to do it humans will innovate to
do it we will innovate how to extract the extra energy in a place and so anytime you get an increase
in efficiency you get whole new profitability potentials that weren't there and we end up
going into those so the idea that efficiency is a way of being able to become sustainable
doesn't work as long as there is an either an embedded growth obligation or an incentive around
net growth exactly now there potentially could be ways around that if you had a
jevons paradox uh dividend or something like that where you had an invention and you created all
this uh efficiency gains which were monetized but you had a rule that that bolus of new capital
that came from efficiency was um was devoted to some process or some future outside of the
super organism like building a local ecological watershed with renewable energy or something
that was full cycle then you could short circuit the uh the the efficiency the rebound effect
of the efficiency profits going into the global monetary energy hungry super organism
so the thing that you're saying right now is so consequential if people get it because
you're saying we have to go to a post growth economic system
that as long as the economy and dollars are coupled at all whether it's one for one or 99
percent or 80 percent even if there's efficiency if they're coupled at all in exponential growth
capital system there there just aren't an exponentially more amount of hydrocarbons
and so you and we're already at the point of diminishing return on the quality of hydrocarbons
fracking is shittier oil than the first oil was right it's harder to get to and after fracking
there's nothing that's the source rock there's nothing left after that but go on so we're at
this place where there's this this pegging between gdp and energy we're getting a diminishing return
on our energy source and there's an exponential requirement on capital simply because of interest
right we have to have more capital next year than we have the capital this year for the nature of the
how we set up the financial system so then there starts to become this larger delta of need to
keep having more capital which means need to keep having more energy have less and less easy to
access energy so i have to technologically innovate offshore oil drilling and fracking and
things but eventually you kind of run out of that and then there's a great reckoning so this is
not yet a great reckoning because the intermediate step is you paper over that with central bank
guarantees and and bailouts and and things like that but yes eventually there's a great reckoning
which i'm referring to as a great simplification and yes eventually by definition we will have to
have a post-growth economy if just increased efficiency isn't the answer because of the
jevons paradox what about just move to renewables why is that not good enough we replace all the
hydrocarbons with solar and wind in geothermal that's a whole two-hour podcast on its own but
let me give you some of the the high points as if you you often use this phraseology the difference
between potential and kinetic energy potential energy is unbelievably powerful because it's
sitting there untapped and you can move it especially oil oil is akin to hemoglobin and
our arteries and veins of our global system because it's liquid at room temperature and we
can move oil everywhere which is much different than wood or or coal or human muscle for that
matter at at that scale meaning oil can go through pipelines a lot faster than coal can go over
railroads exactly exactly and its oil is incredibly energy dense which is the amount
of energy you get per unit volume or unit mass renewables are like you have to go to the grocery
store and buy a bunch of ingredients to create a meal whereas the fossil hydrocarbons the meal is
already created so that's a little bit of the difference between kinetic and potential
the energy return is huge from the scale of the industrial infrastructure that's been built if
you think about it we have 500 billion human worker equivalents in the form of fossil hydrocarbons
and so we can't just say those are going to go away and then replace it with renewables first of
all we need those fossil hydrocarbons to build the renewables and renewables is not even a good
term right because an oak tree is renewable if there's an acorn one of my chickens is renewable
as long as the rooster has a fertilized egg with the hen but renewables like require rebar steel
and complicated clean rooms to make the silicone wafers and things like that at best they're
rebuildable because every 20 years or so we need to rebuild them what they do is they are
rebuildable machines that can harness the renewable flows of the sun and the wind
but from the super organism vantage point we are optimizing growth and growth requires more
energy whether it's fossil hydrocarbons or renewables or some combination so from
in 2019 we grew the amount of electricity demand in the world of all kinds
that just the amount of growth and electricity demand was more than all of the solar voltaic
power generation capacity built since the dawn of time so so far all the renewables are growing
very rapidly especially in the last year but the the the amount of fossil fuels underpinning
our society is around the same as it's been 50 years ago which is 83 percent so we're just growing
a bigger system we went we switched from wood to hydro to coal and eventually oil and gas
150 years ago even now today we are now using more wood for human fuel etc than we were 150 years
ago so we keep adding more energy to the system so renewables i am in favor of renewables
but the the current stories that are being told are that we're going to continue to grow by plug
and playing renewable technology for fossil fuels that's not going to happen so i think renewables
can power a great civilization it's just going to look very different than the one we have now
my understanding is that there's three primary reasons that the current
renewable tech path is insufficient and one is this topic of the hydrocarbon energy it takes
to make the solar cell in the batteries the energy return on energy investment calculus is not good
and i want you to get into that the next is that the energy quality is not comparable whether we're
talking energy density or transportability and the third is that there's stuff we do with hydrocarbons
it isn't just energy that is hard to replace in terms of chemistry and manufacturing and so when
we start thinking about getting off of oil and coal we have to think about each of those factors so
can you get in and if there are more please let me know those seem like the primary ones
and so it's like if if we have diminishing return on hydrocarbons and we need them for
manufacturing ongoingly then we have to get off of oil even before we run out of it for energy so
the amount of so we and if we were going to try to replace our current energy including the exponential
growth of the energy with renewables or rebuildables we just don't have what it takes to do that yet
because uh since they're not easily transportable we'd have to build them everywhere what it takes
to do that requires more hydrocarbons now to build all of that okay so just like a cheetah
chasing a gazelle there's an energy payoff there all of our current energy technologies have an
energy input versus an energy output and historically we would get a hundred to one ratio from
oil we would invest one barrel of oil to find a hundred sort of things um that went down to
obvious for anyone who's not used to thinking about industrial capacity to drill oil requires
running a machine that runs on oil so you've got to use some oil to get the oil and now what we're
talking about is using some oil to make the solar cells which means mining the material and manufacturing
and building the batteries and all that stuff right and there is no way right now of using
purely electricity to go deep into mines um it's diesel fuel and machines so um uh yeah there's so
much to unpack here daniel so first of all the energy return on renewables is viable there it's
it's a decent energy return let's let's take some of the recent optimistic reports that say that solar
and wind are 12 to 1 return and let's take the depleting coal is an 8 to 1 return so there's
a lot of difference of what those numbers mean well that means that if you take the life of a solar
panel and you use life cycle analysis that people say and this gets back to that boundary question
where do you draw the boundaries this is what i wrote my phd thesis on back in the day but um
that you will generate 10 times more energy during the lifetime of a solar photovoltaic
um layout than the energy that went into it so that's a pretty good deal not as good as oil
but but pretty good um now coal um is bulky and dirty and uh but you just throw it in a in a
power plant and you burn it and it generates electricity so the story that is the optimistic
renewable story is that on the surface renewables have a higher EROI than energy return than then
for example coal but what they're not taking into account is the full system cost of the energy
because the wind doesn't always blow as is evidence the last six months in Germany which is one of
the reasons that natural that electricity prices are so high because their wind basically didn't
blow for a month um so if you handicap for an intermittence and variability the full system
EROI or energy return on those renewable systems is down to like four to one and our economic
system couldn't function at a four to one return now there this is a really deep conversation but
we could overbuild wind and solar and use the extra when it's really windy or really sunny we
we generate way too much that we don't need and we put that into uh electrolysis and create ammonia
or or use that for other other economic products so we could boost it back up to five to one or
maybe six to one but full system cost fossil fuels are completed meals and we can't replace that
with renewables just to make sure that's clear for everyone one way of thinking about that is that
because of the intermittence you don't have that with oil or coal because you have the oil
stored on site and you can just burn more of it or the coal stored on site you can burn more as
demand goes up in real time and so it is a storage mechanism it's its own battery right it's already
stored energy well it gets back to the has to also have the batteries and so now we're looking at
the cost of the photovoltaic cell the batteries you know in that whole storage creation and
distribution system so natural gas is the perfect fuel for for power plants because no matter what
happens you just flick a switch and you burn it and whether it's windy or sunny or in the middle
of the night or the middle of the day whereas these other fuels have you know bells and whistles
that are required and if you want to make sure that the grid is on natural gas is like the perfect
feel for that of course there are there are emissions that come from it and that's one of the
other stories embedded here but let me tell you another big problem with renewables is that around
20 percent of our energy used globally is electricity and the vast majority of renewable
technology is used to generate electricity there are tons of ways that humans use energy
that can't easily be easily be replaced by renewables generating electricity for example the
big bunker fuel ships that carry things around the ocean you know liquid fuels heating things
like that can't some of those things can be replaced but at a cost and remember the whole
dynamic underpinning industrialization was this giant trade that we did kind of a Faustian bargain
in retrospect where we replaced things that humans used to do by adding thousands of units of energy
more than the humans did and because it was nearly free that was horribly energy inefficient
because we used tons more energy but it was incredibly economically efficient so when we
started that trade 200 years ago by adding huge amounts of energy to processes that humans used
to do manually that raised our wages it raised our profits it reduced the price of stuff and it
ended up being growing with more people so from the year 1500 to now if you take the number of people
and multiply that by the average goods and services per person the human economy is a
thousand times bigger than it was 500 years ago because of this adding energy to technology
to grow the system now you you might you of all people probably you the only people that would say
this is it is true back in the day there were things that we enjoyed in our lives a few hundred
years ago that weren't counted by goods and services in the economic system so is it really a thousand
times bigger yeah there could be some wiggle room there that we bartered and things like that that
were not included in the economic in the economic system but by and large that's it's three orders
of magnitude the the scale difference so you're starting to mention that there are emissions
associated with the natural gas that would otherwise be perfect if there was an unlimited
amount of it so probably the the central environmental story of the world today's climate change and
climate change from you know anthropogenic greenhouse gases which is not only CO2 it's
methane and some other things but mostly it's a CO2 story so that's the other side of the energy
story that you're talking about is the CO2 comes from burning those hydrocarbons right and so the
excessive CO2 equals changes in planetary biosphere and so everybody's very focused on the
uh need to reduce carbon consumption because of not wanting all the CO2 you're talking about
this whole other side which is we're actually running out of the hydrocarbon stores
also of course there's massive environmental impact on the front side of the materials economy
whether we're talking about mountaintop removal mining to get the coal or we're talking about
oil spells associated with getting the oil or we're talking about wars over oil in a whole
like geopolitically tent system based over where the oil distribution is
that that hydrocarbon system has environmental harm on the extraction plus environmental harm on
the waste that's associated but neither of those are factored into the cost of the oil which is
your point that when we're paying for the barrel of oil we're paying whatever it costs some oil
company it what what does it cost them to get it out of the ground plus whatever margin they put
on top of it which does not include what it would take to make more hydrocarbons or to
deal with the environmental impact or certainly to deal with the wars and geopolitical destabilization
as a result of the um you know uh location of it so this topic of why the cost of extraction
is core to what's wrong with economic theory can you unpack that a little bit more yeah so um we
have uh underpaid for the main resource input to our economies for over a century and we've not paid
for the cost of the pollution at all so the prices of everything are are wrong but they're not wrong
from a sense of maximum power that we're trying to get the evolutionary emotional states of our
ancestors in the cheapest way possible to the most amount of people that's what our economic
system is doing right now the problem is and you know this very well is a lot of our you you call
it our attention seconds or uh how we get dopamine and these other things is mostly by frivolous
means that don't give us long-term meaning or whatever so we're de facto turning billions of
barrels of ancient sunlight into micro leaders of of dopamine and calling that an economic success
but there's basically two broad categories of environmental impact one is as you point out
the metabolism downstream of human energy use my friend tim garrett has a chart showing
GDPs since the 1940s and co2 and monoloa and they are like in one for one tract so you can
look at the co2 in the atmosphere um and without knowing anything about the size of our economy
you can interpolate the size of our economy from that so we are functioning as a heat engine and
the oceans and the atmosphere are absorbing this excess co2 the other big environmental
categories what we do with the energy and that would be mountaintop removal or killing elephants
for ivory or overfishing the oceans or or those two things neither of those categories are do we
pay for in the prices of things part of that is a is a metabolic equation and part of it is a value
equation of what humans care about and and and what we want to include but
our prices do not include the negative externalities if you were to include daniel the negative
externalities full wide boundary of our energy use there would not be a single industry on the
planet earth that would be profitable because the the for instance there was a paper written that
shows the full cost of coal if you include climate and other things and it was like 18 to 20 cents
a kilowatt hour when we actually only pay for four cents so if you were to include all the
negative externalities in our prices our economic system would be much smaller and I think one way
out of this I personally have decided we are not going to voluntarily degrow it will never happen
there's too much momentum in the system there's too much inertia to you know political geopolitical
I mean look at what's happened with with COVID in the pandemic we have to print money and bail
people out to keep the economy going we're not going to voluntarily shrink but I think we will
eventually shrink when we run out of the ability to paper over these biophysical phenomenon with
debt and central bank guarantees and too big to fail and artificially low interest rates and
things like that and so this gets to your original premise I think we have to anticipate what might
happen and try to have our system bend and not break because break gets into many of the categories
of the x-rists that you're so fluent in bend means it gives humans another pathway forward
towards a saner longer lasting more meaningful culture and one of the ways we could do that
is get the prices right on the main input to our economies if we were able to
not only carbon but all non-renewable inputs have a tax on anything that's non-renewable on human
time scale so that would be natural gas or copper or fossil water aquifers or sand or
anything like that and then simultaneously remove tax on humans 95% of our taxes right now are on
human labor so if we removed all those you make $50,000 a year you keep your $50,000 you don't have
to pay any taxes but if you bought an iPhone which has all kinds of complicated expensive machinery
metals and minerals in there it might cost $2,000 or $3,000 relative to $500 today so if we had the
prices right we would be better able to innovate in a way that is aligned with our future and we
would probably conserve we wouldn't just fly to the Bahamas on a junket or Vegas or or just buy
shit from Amazon every day to give us a little bit more dopamine so I do think changing the prices
is one avenue but there's one one area that I think we skipped over that I think is important
is the material side so I talked about the the linkage between energy and growth there's also a
linkage between material or atoms and growth so for the last 50 years that relationship has
almost been entirely one for one so every dollar of GDP requires about two pounds of non-renewable
materials so that if an American baby born today will be expected to use 3.1 million pounds of
non-renewable materials in his or her lifetime extrapolating the past forward so this energy
it's not just energy it's energy combined with materials to develop technology so even if we
had abundant energy there would be material limits on earth with many of the especially look at what's
going on right now with lithium and and some of the inputs to electric cars and by the way
I will I will tell our listeners right now that because of our your busy schedule it is
9 0 5 p.m. right now and we're recording this so I might be getting a little slap happy with my
comments but here's another problem with renewals Daniel every barrel of oil and and natural gas
is not just used for gasoline gasoline is only 40 percent of a barrel of oil the rest of it is
heating oil and diesel and fractions that get converted into naphtha and asphalt and tar and
6000 other products like aspirin and football helmets and plastics and fertilizers and condoms
and tents and it's it's unbelievable how many products are made from these fossil hydrocarbons
so if we were just conceptually able to replace all the internal combustion cars on the planet
with electric cars in order to save climate change it wouldn't really it wouldn't reduce our
demand for oil at all it would reduce our demand for gasoline but we would still have all the other
products the 60 percent of the barrel of oil that we would have an economic system and requirement
for so what would we do with the gasoline then flare it or dump it in a river yes we could at
some cost change the refineries to use some of that and divert it towards those other products
but not all of it so that that's also something that gets glossed over in this this massive
shift towards electric cars so you mentioned mining a couple times and that getting electricity
down to do the mining is pretty difficult so that that's done in stored forms of energy like diesel
and whatever and that you were mentioning that there's a correlation of energy and dollars but
also a correlation of material and dollars from the point of view of waste I think when most people
who haven't studied the topic well think about waste they think about what they put in trash at
their house the municipal solid waste and they don't think about the total waste coming out of
industry and just even mining right like just the toxic tailings coming out of the fact that
the nice metals and all the things that we use were a part of a rock and ore where most of that
was useless but actually pretty toxic by the time you smelt it you get you know tens or hundreds
of parts of useless toxic mining tailings for each part of the thing that is useful and those
just go in these massive not landfills but dumps that then every once in a while break and go into
rivers and oceans and mess things up at scale when people start to understand the waste management
issue writ large of which co2 going into the air and ocean is one tiny little thing which is all
of climate change and is literally a tiny little thing and microplastics going into the ocean is
a tiny little thing when people start to think about that our materials economy is depleting
unrenewably from the earth on one side and turning it into waste on the other side and the
all the planetary boundaries the result of that and the whole thing is using energy unrenewably
right so we're using atoms unrenewably moving them by energy unrenewably we have to move to
a closed loop economic system where the new stuff is made out of the old stuff we don't
require an exponential amount more stuff and all of it is on renewable or rebuildable energy
the transition from here to there is fundamental and it requires a totally new economic system
because it can't be based on the same type of embedded growth obligation and there's the huge
question of what does that new system look like and then also how do we get there from here
with the embedded growth obligations and the competitions in the system because if we try
to create a tax nationally and some other country doesn't they benefit relative to us in terms of
their extraction capability which will end up meaning geopolitical and military capability
which means everyone says fuck it and it's just a race to the bottom so when you I mean first I
just wanted to say because you're a teacher you probably have already done this almost nobody
has a sense of like the computer that I'm talking on right now what it took from a supply chain
perspective to make this fucking thing like what I think every high school class should be every
high school should have a class that is what does it take to make one of these cell phones
from the oil to make the plastics to the materials refinement and the the lithography to make the
chips like no single human being knows how to make it it's it's a collection of processes and
components it's pretty much could you imagine a thousand years ago you just showing up with one
of these things they would have thought it was magic absolutely like Taiwan has come into the
center of public news recently and TSMC because of the you know South China Sea's issue but the fact
that we are so dependent on Taiwan because making computerships is so goddamn hard the U.S. has not
been able to do it to be able to like reduce its dependence on Taiwan yet you get a sense of like
the manufacturing that we take for granted is mind-bogglingly complex and you know and it really
is like six continents worth of supply chains to make anything and that's why I am an advocate for
continuing open-ended globalization for luxury things and things like that but for very key
ingredients and and key things like food and shoes and pharmaceutical inputs how long can we have
these six continent supply chains can we have more regional local supply chains for some things
the market is giving us the signal because of the financial response to the pandemic that
you know globalization and profits and everything will continue forward but I
I do think that's a big risk getting back to your your point your question I have a couple of
asterisks there first of all right now yes on the global level we recycle around nine percent
of the material input and that's actually gotten worse rather than better and ultimately yes we
have to have a closed or more closed loop system but how could that evolve because I think
a system away from economic growth and like you say there's no way that in a system right now that
requires debt and central bank support and rule changes and deficit spending by governments
they're not going to add a big tax on on a renewable non-renewable inputs right now because
that would hurt the system so I think we have to anticipate and this is what I'm working with our
colleague Dick Gephardt on the concept of advanced policy which is interventions and
plans and blueprints that our society are going to need in the next decade but that are politically
or socially impossible to happen now to do the research and build constituency into them and one
of them is this this untax project and we're we're doing research with imperial college in
London on looking how this would actually manifest and it's really complicated one of the
long shots but one of the trajectories and destinations we should go for is let's pay
the right prices for the long term to spur innovation in the right direction of the real
futures we're facing and we're just underpaying for all these things which said differently is
we're over consuming based on the long-term viability of of this stuff which is a one-time
endowment that we're burning through 10 million times faster than it was sequestered that is not
a happy thing to say that as a culture we're going to have to consume less and we're going to have
to have some sort of redistribution that accompanies that because attacks naturally would be regressive
everyone is familiar with what it means for the government to subsidize a corporation that's not
profitable because it's critical what you're basically saying is the market as a whole is
being subsidized by nature on a savings account that's about to run out and the entire market for
the most part is mostly not profitable in a way that would be sustainable because of the total
amount of costs that are being externalized and as soon as we run out of the stored free cheap
stuff and stop being able to handle the consequences of the pollution the cost of everything goes up
so much that it forces a restructure of the market and what we think is profitable and possible
by multiples to orders of magnitude what it currently is and that's the break scenario.
Well the break scenario is that the bend scenarios that we have a smaller economy
and we change our cultural objectives away from gdb towards well-being and social capital and
community and other things rather than gadgets the break scenario is that this all happens
without planning without blueprints and airbags and the global supply chains and or the geopolitical
kinetic warfare is the response to these sorts of crises.
Well it seems like bend is us try to proactively avoid the break of fundamentally not being able
to have energy keep up with dollars and if energy can't keep up with dollars and we keep
making fake dollars at a certain point the dollars will start to inflate so much and lose buying
power that faith in them will be lost and whether it's speculation against them or around the banks
or a downgrade of the bonds when you start losing the dollars purchasing power then that can break
a bunch of different ways it can look like shut down of supply chains it can look like wars over
resources but they're all pretty ugly. Right so we are growing our monetary claims
like this and the underlying energy and materials that we're going to need to turn those claims
into real wealth is going like this so the delta between those two is widening by the year
and the game is the plan the way to keep the system going we're kicking the can
and we're not planning for five or ten years from now when that recouples.
So how do you see being able to realistically do a proactive bend model factoring
factoring what it would take to come to global agreement between the major players to do so
because there is a disadvantage in the near term of anyone who bends relative to anyone who doesn't
and so unless you can get all of the major players to do it nobody's going to do it.
This is why I'm talking to you Daniel and others this is a really freaking serious moment
for our civilization for our nation for our culture I know the problems and the constraints
very well I'm not as fluent in the answers I think the answers are a combination of top down
that we have to have plans in place for this sort of economic trajectory and bottom up that
people start I have to start waking up realizing the time we're alive how much energy we use
what really matters in life if you ask a bunch of your friends what are the five best experiences
of their life it's unlikely to be huge exosomatic energy use it's going to be something with their
family or in nature or their friends and so we have to re-tether how we measure success in our
lives as individuals by more social capital and less tech heavy stuff to be pilots of what's possible
I don't think that's going to happen culture-wide but it could happen with a good number of people
that act as kind of a scout team towards a different way of humans using less energy
so I think these things because of human behavior that we are not good as a culture
at deferring the second marshmallow I think we will largely sleepwalk into these moments
which is why working with you and others I want to educate and inspire individual humans
to maybe simplify first and beat the rush and act as examples in their community and their
family and their neighborhood to start living differently in a way that we're going to probably
have to live regardless of what we choose in the near future so as we go back to what you
referenced in the very beginning of the model that a civilization can be thought of in terms of its
infrastructure its social structures and its superstructure the superstructure being how it
defines what the good life is what is fundamentally desirable what what the coordinating values of it
are culture is a way of talking about that you're saying right now hey we actually have to change
and deepen culture as the basis of what we're orienting the whole society to I would like
obviously you and I've talked about a number of these things and then as we're talking about like
the game theory between nations where none of them want to do the thing that is good long term
that disadvantages them in the short term if everyone doesn't because then they lose to whoever
wins in the short term and so you get these just fucked up collective action problems these kind
of race to the bottom scenarios so how do we solve those I think and yeah it's so complex mostly
people find one part that makes sense give up on the rest hope that the market a place of ideas
will solve it meaning that other people solve other parts they focus on their part but then
how all the parts fit together how the whole works nobody's really paying attention to
and so there are people who are just like I'm just going to focus on making renewables better and
hope that they get there in time and other people that are like I'm just going to focus on turning
some waste dreams into new materials or I'm just going to focus on some aspect of culture
I think one of the places that you and I identify identified shared agreement is
that there is critical stuff in our techno sphere in our infrastructure critical stuff in our social
structures or economics governance law and in our superstructure our culture and our values that
all need to evolve together and that they all inter influence each other each of those can
inter influence each other so it's not a solution it's a whole ecosystem of solutions that we have
to work on but they all have to be informed by understanding the problems in the interconnection
of the whole well enough that you don't advantage one part while externalizing the cost to the other
areas so I think we got to do and I appreciate you being available late at night your time I
think we got to do the beginning first part of this thing that is I found meaningful in your
work and was valuable for me to make more central of the embedded growth obligation and finance
being coupled to diminishing returns in energy that are not easily overcomeable through the
current renewable technologies and process or the efficiencies in process and that being a major
fucking thing that we have to deal with and that being connected to so many other things I think
we did a good job of starting that and maybe starting to get to what some of the transition
looks like some of the cultural parts some of the advanced policy parts can be our next conversation
that sounds good let me queue up the next conversation because I know you well enough
as someone who deeply understands the human predicament and you also have what I refer
to as wide boundary empathy but you're also incredibly productive you're a good friend you
do things for for people even if it means more of your time and you just seem really balanced
to me so so one question how do you manage to hold all this existential risk and the the depth of
the implications of the conversation we just had in your head and still manage to defer the marshmallow
and stay sane focus present and be a good human being to the people in your life because I think
that is the whatever you do that that's a formula that a lot more people are hopefully going to be
able to find do you have a couple minute summary of that and then we'll expand on that next next call
I read some of the books and watched so many of uh Krishna marti's lectures as a kid and one of the
things you would see him almost getting frustrated with when he'd be talking to the audience so many
times he's like let's really take this seriously he was fun he was looking at how do we live without
conflict and kind of what is the fundamental basis of conflict and can we overcome it especially as
we're becoming a nuclear and then you know exponential tech empowered species where the
conflict gets more and more consequential and why he's asking that how can we take the
seriousness because he knows that people are sitting there in the audience listening and then
they go home and they just completely fucking forget because they got they got a mortgage to pay and
they got you know children to tend to and they got jones is to compete with and they got whatever
and it's like wait wait are we actually taking seriously the fucking topics we're talking about
because if we do we have to change our life to say it's like it's like the death star is about
to take the planet out and you're on the planet and you realize the death star is going to take
the planet out and you're like we're we're gonna build a community garden and we're gonna work on
making a better school after school program with the pt and you're like wait wait like that's all
cool stuff but the death star is about to take the planet out like join the rebel alliance we've
got to fucking do something about this there's something to be able to like
take the scope urgency magnitude of the thing seriously enough to be transformed by it
and then it's easy to just go into existential angst and and either want to kill yourself or
or just go into hedonism and as a solution because hedonism is actually a reasonable
response to nihilism right yeah we're all gonna die so fuck it let's have some fun but to be like
that's just not an acceptable answer like i can i can die
failing trying but i can't not be applying myself to see if there is a way through
and it does end up looking like threading a needle right it does the that quote in the
book of roman something about the path to heaven is uh steep and narrow and the path to hell is
wide and many so i was just exposed might have been similar for you i was exposed to these things
young enough that all the other ways of living that don't ensure that living gets to keep happening
for everybody just could just seem nonsensical they couldn't even compute as a thing i could do
no i i feel the same way i feel now is a time on this planet that being alive and being aware of
these things we can make a difference and for me the things that keep me going are conversations
like this i have six or seven people like you in my network and it's like a a shot of adrenaline
of social adrenaline when i talk to you that's what i want to try to scale is to make people
aware of how the big picture fits together we use a hundred times more energy than we need
in america in europe it's 50 times more i mean this isn't a red line disaster we have to navigate
a glide path that humanity and earth's ecosystems make it through this and for me is sharing this
goal of an era with other humans is what makes me allows me to cope and be fired up to to work on
at the next day i remember when i was a kid there was this famous saying in activism i don't remember
who it's attributed to originally that if you aren't outraged you aren't paying attention and
it's true like if you go to a factory farm or you go to a sweatshop or you go to a open pit mine
or a landfill like fuck you'd be pretty outraged and then it's like how do you do your normal stuff
in face of that and then at the same time i would read gibran or hafez and and and the artist and
the poet and the mystic would say if you aren't overwhelmed by the beauty of life you aren't paying
attention and it was like how to hold both of those at the same time because it's only because
life is beautiful that i'm outraged that it's not being respected but if i'm only outraged i'm not
actually connected to what is deeper than the outrage which is the love of life that that other
emotion is in relationship to so then it's like okay if i'm outraged all the time i'm actually
not honoring the thing itself and yet the outrage serves a function and so it's like how do i hold
my connection to the beauty of life to just appreciate it right now because we might all
we might all get taken out by a super volcano or an asteroid or a kerrington event tomorrow
so how do we just like be with the beauty of it now in a way that's honoring and have that motivate
us working on how to ensure the highest quality of life for all life now and into perpetuity
simultaneously like that that's part of the dialectic personally for me
perhaps because i'm a little bit older than you i think you do that better than i do i've
been outraged for over 20 years and the super organism has gotten stronger during that time
but friends dogs in nature are what keep me going and let's try to change some hearts and minds
thank you for participating in this definitely to be continued my friend and i hope to see you
