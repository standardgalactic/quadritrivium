because in a gather environment there's not enough grain to be useful you've got a row crop it to then
be able to drag a plow behind it so you can kind of consider the beginning of the Anthropocene and
the beginning of extraction of stored energy corresponding together yeah no that's right and
what also happened um is that's when inequality really started to occur we were always
in equal in terms of status and respect and things like that but we were always incredibly
equal in terms of consumption because we didn't have anything we didn't have stuff to carry around
with us everyone's actual consumption of of outside of the body calories was pretty much the same
but once we started soaring surplus that's when the the hierarchies started yeah the beginning
of the thing we call civilization that started scaling well beyond the Dunbar number which
equalled how to domesticate wild type humans that would have otherwise been Dunbar tribal
right and I bring that up because there is and we could talk about this another time but just
briefly there's a lot of binary discussion about human nature and I strongly believe that
one of the generator functions of civilization is who we are as evolved organisms and our
evolutionary psychology and we are incredibly plastic and our cultural plasticity is even
greater than our individual plasticity but to say that that humans are this way there's thousands
of examples of how cultures and humans lived in the past and we just look around us and think this
is how humans are and it's we are living an anomaly with this massive massive amount of
exosomatic energy and and before I forget to say the point exosomatic energy is energy that we consume
but not by eating it's outside of the body so inside the body the average American consumes
like 2,500 calories outside the body the average American consumes over 200,000 kilocalories per
day in the lights and the airplanes and the shopping centers and the libraries and the buses etc
so we are the only species that massively uses energy outside of the body and that is only made
available by the fact that we're accessing this pool of stored hydrocarbons so I can get back to
that but it's it's just we we completely are blind to the fact that our current global culture
uses five 100 billion barrel of oil equivalents worth of coal oil and and gas we use around 30
billion barrels of oil and the rest is is coal and natural gas but that works out to at five
five years per barrel that means we have a global labor force of 500 billion human equivalents
relative to five billion real human workers excluding children and and old people so we
have like a hundred to one armies of fossil workers standing behind us and the economic system
only treats their value as the cost of extracting them from the earth and so economics textbooks
have completely missed this and economists aren't dumb they just told the wrong story as we were
going up this this moonshot of growth that we've had this last century they have all kinds of
complicated formulas that explain it most of the story is now capital and labor that we apply those
two factors to our economy and then this resulting riches and progress and and productivity when the
reality is a good deal of that can be described by this additional labor that is in the form of
fossil carbon and hydrocarbons which is energy so it's easy to see once we have oil that is running
industrial engines and the tractor replaces the plow and the and the automated or the industrial
mill replaces you know kind of human labor we can see the labor there but if we go back to
the earliest examples of what you're calling extra somatic or extracorporeal energy there's
the storage for human consumption which was the grain but then there's also the usage of it for
things other than just human caloric consumption but that are part of our life and you can see that
going all the way back arguably to harvesting fire right like that you could kind of see that as
the beginning of starting to use energy probably mostly in the form of wood drive entropy to meet
human needs in a way that was totally different than the rest of the animal kingdom and so if we
to just kind of finish out that early part of the story before hunter-gatherer ended with
kind of agrarian or before the agrarian mark of being able to do agriculture or store grains
there was the stone weapons and the fire going all the way back to pre-sabian right homo habilis
kind of time where the stone weapons meant that we could hunt we increased our predatory capacity
relative to the animals faster than they could evolve increasing their capacity to evade it in
a way that didn't happen for any other animal because they weren't evolving their tools they
were just evolving physically and there's a cemetery of that evolution so we were able to move from
we were able to over hunt an environment and then rather than have our population get checked
move to the next place and over hunt that one so even in that long hunter-gatherer time and burn
stuff up for the usefulness of fire to make cold environments hospitable to us and food that wouldn't
have been so you can see we kind of started doing that with the beginning of like fire and stone tools
then we did it way more with agriculture then we did it way more with industrial and then way
more again with kind of information and but they're all steps in that same story absolutely
absolutely we are uh an innovative creative curious problem solving can kicking species
but the big two movements were the agricultural access of grain and storing it we had been
couple million individuals and down to a hundred thousand individuals many times
over the last several hundred thousand years and then agriculture within a few millennium we were
200 million and now we're sometime next year we'll cross eight billion but if you think about the
oil story becomes so big which is where you're going to emphasize is because before oil we were
half a billion people that's right right and well from half a billion to eight billion in like
that much time because of the industrial revolution
so 10 000 years ago
animals mammals relative to humans were like 99 percent of the biomass now humans in our
livestock if you weigh all of us we're 98 percent of the mammalian biomass on the planet
but if you look back now versus 10 000 years ago the amount of total animal biomass on the
planet today is 700 percent what it was 10 000 years ago how can that be because we've added
that enormous bolus of fossil productivity to the food supply so the agricultural revolution
was when we used technology to use the Haber-Bosch process to take natural gas
and create ammonia fertilizer which added nitrogen to the fields 60 percent of the nitrogen in our
bodies today has a chemical signature coming from natural gas so we've massively boosted the food
supply directly from fossil carbon and hydrocarbons so not only did we originally gain
extra storable calories hydrocarbonized with grain and then we start getting extra hydrocarbons in
the form of oil we use the oil ones to be able to increase the manufacture of grain and other
agricultural products by orders of magnitude yes and there's there's a common stat out there
that's actually slightly incorrect but for most of our history our agricultural system was a net
energy producer we would spend a certain amount of calories with our muscles and our animals
and we would get more calories than that back but now our our food system is a massive energy
sink we spend 10 to 14 calories for every calorie that we produce the the misnomer is that 10 calories
of fossil fuels are added to get one calorie of food the truth is it's like two calories of fossil
but then the the 10 to 14 comes from the processing the packaging the delivering the cooking
so our entire food system it uses 10 times the energy that it it produces in in you know full
full cycle and this is due to oil and natural gas and we just look at the end product and don't
think about the full system that created it so when we talk when you're mentioning that the
that energy is pretty pegged to the economy that the total GDP of the world and total energy use
are pretty closely correlated because lots of things that we make out of one material we could
make out of another material there's a lot of different conductors and insulators and whatever
but they all require energy that's pretty fundamental and that whether we're moving
that value in the economy is moving atoms around in the physical world or bits around in the virtual
world both of those require energy this seems to be also very fundamental to where you're going in
terms of the viability of the economy that the embedded growth obligation is in the economy
but that creates an embedded growth obligation the extraction of energy and we're getting to
diminishing returns on the earth's stored ability to keep giving that and that that's
really fundamental to what the near-term future portends can you unpack that a little bit yes
lots of things to say there so no matter how you make a cup whether it's a coconut or gold
or ceramic or glass or aluminum you need energy no matter what so you can get better and you can
get more efficient over time but energy is required for any any process so over the last
well before 1970 the relationship was almost one for one every time we grew our GDP we grew our
energy use at around the same percent then we started to get efficient in the 1970s and for
instance we were a lot of places were using oil and power plants and burning natural gas is much
more efficient we started to get used coal in a smarter way we started to do new inventions that
would use a little bit less energy to get the same product so in the last 50 years we there's two
trends there's GDP has been growing and energy use grows almost the same rate but at around 99
percent so on average we get one percent more efficient and that matters after 50 years you
you're using 50 less energy than you were 50 years ago but no matter what next year if you have a
factory where you make 100,000 cars and you decide to expand your your business and you want to make
200,000 cars you're going to use almost twice as much energy so de facto they're incredibly linked
but here's where there's a couple of misunderstandings some countries have decoupled their economic
output from their energy use there's something called the energy intensity of GDP which is how
much energy we need to generate a dollar of GDP the United States the United Kingdom are service
based economies so we actually have gotten much more efficient generating GDP by using less energy
but the the important thing from the superorganism vantage point which is our future sustainability
our ecosphere our climate our oceans is what the whole human system does and the whole human system
is is extremely tightly tethered over 99 percent because the United States and the United Kingdom
in America the average American consumes 57 barrels of oil worth of fossil fuels per year
but we import another 17 or so from China in we don't import the oil from China we import the
televisions and the plastic salad bowls and and things like that the energy was burned in China
we pay dollars for it and it comes here so it's our it's part of our consumptive footprint
but the bottom line is that globally energy and GDP are tightly linked one other caveat I would say
there the last five to eight years it seems to be globally a little bit more decoupling and this
is an artifact of this massive blowoff in the financial markets due to central banks because
of the way that pension funds are treated in in the GDP calculations and when and if I would say if
or I would say when stock markets recalibrate that relationship will tighten back up
around the 99 plus percent okay so that second point equals I would just call it financial
manipulation where you can make more dollars that are not actually indexing more goods and
services and that'll end up re-correcting but in so far as the dollars are indexing goods and
services you're going to get a pretty tight correlation I want to come back to and it's
important because sometimes people will see a financial manipulation and treat it as if
they're decoupling and then change our forecasts of energy viability and you're like no not really
you're kind of missing the point here so I think that's really important I want to underscore it
but I want to come back to the nation's one for a moment because what you're saying is okay so
this kind of wealthy nation that doesn't do its own manufacturing and production and
waste management and largely exports kind of tech services can make it seem like it has higher
GDP relative to its own domestic energy use but it's bullshit because it's just exporting all of its
like really high energy intensive stuff to the manufacturing that's happening somewhere else
it then imports the product of and I find this like I find this for so many things you can take
a country that has a good genie coefficient but it's just because it exported all the cheap labor
to somewhere else that it depends upon to get its stuff so you're like you don't really have a good
genie coefficient your economic inequality that's needed to make your civilization run is still very
high because you just buy your shit from cheap labor from somewhere else yeah well this gets to
your whole objective of your work is is sense making and and information because on all these
issues you can draw your boundaries somewhere and come up with an answer and what humanity needs
is wide boundary thinking we need to look at the larger boundaries because then we know what
what doors are shut and which ones remain open so yeah we need to look at the wider boundary
this is why I think your superorganism perspective is really important because of course you can have
a what looks like a local improvement in one area that actually is and now it's cool we should
understand that as a prototype but oftentimes it's not really a local improvement it's just
externalizing the harm somewhere else and then measuring inside of a of a boundary something
that crossed the boundary and so this is where we have to say okay for the superorganism as a whole
that the countries that have to do the agriculture and the manufacturing and the cheap labor and the
whatever now let's look at the metrics and say for a civilization that depends upon the whole
thing because the countries don't depend on themselves they depend on six continent global
supply chains and they depend on the commons of the oceans and all like that so we really have to
look at the superorganism writ large to really make any sense of it it doesn't involve externality so
if people haven't read your paper um on on superorganism uh issue I think it's fundamental
but I want to come back to this other thing that you were saying about increases in efficiency
that energy does get slightly more efficient can you explain the jevons paradox to people for
for people who aren't familiar with it because it seems like a lot of people have hope that we're
going to solve the energy issue by increases in efficiency so um William Stan Stanley Jevons
was a 19th century economist who paradoxically predicted that the massive beneficial invention
of the steam engine which made things way more efficient than horses uh or what came before
paradoxically would end up having humans use a lot more energy even though it was more efficient
that's because most more people could afford things uh things would be done faster they would build
more of these steam engines and that is of course what happened so today um I think this
let me first sidetrack and and talk about um the two types of technology um so first of all
technology is deflationary because the market system and innovation and people are incentivized
to make better inventions so over time things that are tech heavy like uh flat screen TVs
will get cheaper and cheaper until the asymptotically you you just can't get them any cheaper but so
tech is deflationary the counter to that is depletion which is that we've accessed the best
fossil hydrocarbons that are the main input to our economies and then
we have to access the next harder tranche etc eventually there's nothing left but we're not
there yet so these two forces uh between technological deflation and resource input
inflation are battling so when we think about technology there's really two categories of
technology the first tech the first category is ways to make our uh energy use our energy capture
more efficient for example we could develop new uh solar voltaic cells that are more efficient
or we could take a power plant and the amount of energy that we input we get more electricity out
of that the second type of technology is inventing new ways or ways that humans use energy that we
used to do manually and now we have machines do it or new ways like facebook that we never had
before and now it's a new vector for energy use so it's that second category of technology
that dominates our global technology portfolio which ends up building more and more things
that are a vector for more energy use next year now jevons paradox means that if something gets
more efficient the people will buy more of it or the savings that they have from saving money on
that thing will be spent at walmart on some things that they bought from china so what ends
up happening is efficiency is in service of the super organism to a large extent so efficiency
as long as we have gdp as our cultural goal where the market system and individual and and uh
corporations and and businesses optimize profits via gdp efficiency will just feed more money into
that system in a in a positive feedback loop and we'll use more energy in the future did that make
sense yeah i want to go a little bit deeper here because i think people really having an
intuition for this paradox is so important the idea that there's stuff that we do that mediates
our current quality of life and we can make it more efficient like it seems like that is a way
to be able to have less impact on the planet we can do shit more efficiently so we can use less
stuff and still have the same quality of life except that's never what happens right the jevons
would be true if the scale was capped great and so the jevons paradox says you were kind of
mentioning from the demand side people buy more shit at walmart but also from the supply side
there are certain products and services that are just not profitable to make yet but if i drop the
price of energy enough is one of the inputs whole new market sectors open up there's whole new
businesses and industries that can now be profitable and uh so this what you're calling the fourth
