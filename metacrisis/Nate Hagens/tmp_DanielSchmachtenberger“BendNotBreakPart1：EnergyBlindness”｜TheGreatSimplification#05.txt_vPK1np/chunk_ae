failing trying but i can't not be applying myself to see if there is a way through
and it does end up looking like threading a needle right it does the that quote in the
book of roman something about the path to heaven is uh steep and narrow and the path to hell is
wide and many so i was just exposed might have been similar for you i was exposed to these things
young enough that all the other ways of living that don't ensure that living gets to keep happening
for everybody just could just seem nonsensical they couldn't even compute as a thing i could do
no i i feel the same way i feel now is a time on this planet that being alive and being aware of
these things we can make a difference and for me the things that keep me going are conversations
like this i have six or seven people like you in my network and it's like a a shot of adrenaline
of social adrenaline when i talk to you that's what i want to try to scale is to make people
aware of how the big picture fits together we use a hundred times more energy than we need
in america in europe it's 50 times more i mean this isn't a red line disaster we have to navigate
a glide path that humanity and earth's ecosystems make it through this and for me is sharing this
goal of an era with other humans is what makes me allows me to cope and be fired up to to work on
at the next day i remember when i was a kid there was this famous saying in activism i don't remember
who it's attributed to originally that if you aren't outraged you aren't paying attention and
it's true like if you go to a factory farm or you go to a sweatshop or you go to a open pit mine
or a landfill like fuck you'd be pretty outraged and then it's like how do you do your normal stuff
in face of that and then at the same time i would read gibran or hafez and and and the artist and
the poet and the mystic would say if you aren't overwhelmed by the beauty of life you aren't paying
attention and it was like how to hold both of those at the same time because it's only because
life is beautiful that i'm outraged that it's not being respected but if i'm only outraged i'm not
actually connected to what is deeper than the outrage which is the love of life that that other
emotion is in relationship to so then it's like okay if i'm outraged all the time i'm actually
not honoring the thing itself and yet the outrage serves a function and so it's like how do i hold
my connection to the beauty of life to just appreciate it right now because we might all
we might all get taken out by a super volcano or an asteroid or a kerrington event tomorrow
so how do we just like be with the beauty of it now in a way that's honoring and have that motivate
us working on how to ensure the highest quality of life for all life now and into perpetuity
simultaneously like that that's part of the dialectic personally for me
perhaps because i'm a little bit older than you i think you do that better than i do i've
been outraged for over 20 years and the super organism has gotten stronger during that time
but friends dogs in nature are what keep me going and let's try to change some hearts and minds
thank you for participating in this definitely to be continued my friend and i hope to see you
