stayed at about 2, 2.2, 2.3 billion people
because the planet couldn't feed more than 2 or 2.3 or 4
people, billion people.
But a couple of German guys figured out
how to liquefy air under great pressure and temperature, which
provided the source of nitrogen needed to create fertilizer.
I mean, humans have known how to make fertilizer forever.
We just didn't have enough free nitrogen on planet Earth
to do it until Haber and Bosch came along, figured this out.
And all of a sudden, we could fertilize the world
and we could start growing the population because fertilizer
expanded the productivity of the soil.
And so most of the problems that we have on planet Earth today,
in my opinion, are because we got too many people.
And we got too many people because of fertilizer.
But you can't do fertilizer without petroleum, mostly
hydrogen from natural gas, other fossil energy.
So those are Schmeel's four pillars of modern civilization.
And I mean, I'm as sympathetic as I know
you are to people that put the environment first.
And I think you do and I do.
But when they talk about, well, let's just
get off of fossil fuels, they're cutting the pillars off
of the four elements that uphold modern civilization.
It's OK if you want to do that.
But it's not that it's got real consequences.
I mean, you're bringing down the civilization
that you want to keep.
So you can't have it both ways.
