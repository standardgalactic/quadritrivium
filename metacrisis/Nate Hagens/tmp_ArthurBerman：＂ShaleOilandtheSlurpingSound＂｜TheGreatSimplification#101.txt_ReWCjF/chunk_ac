not optimizing for an ultimate amount of oil from that region they're optimizing for getting it
out of the ground faster to sell it for monetary return well i'm going to give them credit and
say that i think that that somebody said hey we we we can get even closer than we thought before
because this basin is so special uh because you know we're we're using all this really great new
technology and our fracks are but but but let me let me finish where i was going they will
they will drill let's just say eight wells per square mile they'll drill all eight of them before
they complete any one of them because you use a rig to drill and you bring in a different rig
to actually do the fracking and and the completion and so they'll drill all eight wells they'll move
the drilling rig off they'll move you know a completion rig on and they'll run the pipe and
they'll you know do all the things they do they'll do the fracking and and then all eight of them
pretty much will start producing at the same time and part of the idea there is actually
to frack in between them to get the maximum amount of contact with the reservoir possible
and so i i'm willing to i'm willing to say that i believe i mean the the guys that run these companies
you know they're not they're not i mean they're smart and and and i think that they they were
convinced maybe they still are convinced that what i'm saying is wrong and probably or or
they really believe that what you're saying is right and if you're right they're just gonna go
and find another shale play and and develop that one in the same way well perhaps but let let's
keep perspective on this part of the reason that investors don't want to give these shale companies
any more money is because their view is is that those guys destroyed a lot of capital
over the last and and there's a very prominent climate change story out there definitely right
definitely but but the first strike against them was hey we've been giving you money for a decade
and you haven't made us any kind of decent returns so uh we're not giving you any more money uh and
i think that happened before the climate awareness started growing but they they kind of coincided
but so the companies have a reputation and a history of doing things that are not good for
investment investor returns and and still we look at all the sectors in the s and p 500
and the irony is is that energy is the most important sector to our lifestyles and our
future uh perhaps not to the environment but to the way our economy works today and it has
among the lowest returns and is among the lowest of the sectors in terms of its percent
of of the of the s and p 500 you know it's like four four and a half percent so
can you talk about rig count um yeah rig count um and what what is rig count and why is it important
and and how can the current rig count situation inform the prognosis that you're laying out here
well on on a on a very simplistic and logical basis uh you don't you don't produce any oil
unless you drill a well and so there ought to be pretty much a one-to-one correlation between
how many rigs are working drilling wells and how much oil you should expect to get out of the ground
sometime in the near future and that's always been rig count is something that for all of my
professional career when that data comes out usually on a on a on a friday everybody pays
the tension okay did the did the rig count for oil go up or did it go down did the rig count for
gas go up or go down and investors would you know they don't worry too much about what happens this
week or that week but over time uh you know hey it's it's gone down for the last four weeks
that's looking bad for supply longer term supply though right because there's a lag from when the
well is drilled to when the first production comes out well yeah and part of that is because of what
i just described that you're gonna you're you're gonna drill six seven eight wells before you even
go in to complete them and so if it takes you let's just say for argument's sake a month
to drill each well then and let's say you got eight wells then you got you know you you spend
eight months drilling the wells you got a rig working all the time one rig and you drill eight
wells and it takes the eight months let's just say and then you got to go in and complete all those
wells and maybe that takes you you know another month and a half and then you got to get them hooked
up to production and by the time they you know it's it's easily a year or so before any oil is
flowing at all and by the time that rate builds up to the point that it actually makes the difference
you're talking you know 18 to 24 months and so the rig count is is increasingly disconnected
from the production itself so right now that this 13.1 million barrels a day that we're seeing
in late 2023 as a record that everyone's like look at the USA record production and oil
is an artifact of the rigs that drilled in early 2022 and late 2021?
Yeah generally I mean you know it's gonna vary from operator to operator but yeah you're
yeah it's it's an artifact of something that happened a fair amount of time ago
and so things could be looking really kind of dire and yet it would be 12, 18, 24 months before we
started seeing the effect of that in production. So then there's two things that we can speculate on
well one thing we can know and one thing we can speculate on today we can look at the rig count
which in a second I'm gonna ask you what it is but then also the well productivity
you're saying is a 50% decline in the Permian in the last few years so to stay flat we would
need to have twice as many wells if the production is is only half of of what it used to be yes?
Yeah I mean you know so we're yeah you're exactly right and what is the rig count doing these days?
The rig count today is
let's just say it's you know it's five or six hundred wells for oil I mean I'm just kind of guessing
that so we are yeah we're looking at for you know for the US we're talking about something like
800, 800 wells overall. 800 rigs or 800 wells? 800 rigs I'm sorry so US and Canada's 800 US is like
600, 625. And how does that compare to a couple years ago? Oh well you know before before prices
collapsed in 2014 I mean we were you know we had several thousand wells drilling all the time but
there was like a revolution in technology that took place after that that collapsed in prices
and we went to a completely different kind of rig that was much more efficient could drill wells
a lot faster and so everything we thought we knew about rig count had to be recalibrated in 2015
and 2016 and what's happened here in the last uh well since COVID really in the last two or three
years is that the the rig productivity the amount of oil that can be attributed to the drilling by
one rig has has increased yet again. Now a lot of people get that confused they look at this
drilling productivity report that the EIA puts out every week and they say oh it keeps going up
that's great well yeah but rigs don't I mean you need to drill a well to produce oil but rigs
don't produce oil wells produce oil and and and I think a lot of a lot of people either confuse
that or lose sight of that so you know having having a very productive rig is good for costs
but it isn't necessarily uh doing anything for you know for your oil for the kind of oil supply
that you need in the future. My point is that just like uh you know when I bought my first car if
if it wasn't performing the way I wanted to I could pull over and you know open the hood on that VW
bug and take a screwdriver and adjust the timing in five seconds close it get back in the car and
perform better. I can't do that today because the technology in in my car is so complex that I don't
even know you know where to find the timing in my car and that's what's happened with with the
oil rigs too that that the technology has just gotten so sophisticated that to make that direct
connection oh my car is not working very well on turn a screw uh or to say well we've got 600 wells
and and we used to have 700 I don't even know what that means anymore because the wells are more
the the rigs are more productive so there's an increasing disconnect between what how many rigs
you have and what oil you're going to be producing in the future. I always tell people look at the
number of wells that are producing wells that are being added every month that's what we need to know
about. So we have reached the end of the easy part of this interview yeah now it's going to go into
the hard questions oh no maybe my dog will bark and interrupt us. Let me summarize first so you've
laid out that that shale oil tide oil is 70% of US production and its existence forestalled a
peak in US production and world production earlier this century that we just in the US
hit 13 million barrels which was an all-time high but that that was largely from wells that
were drilled 18 to 24 months ago and your recent research is shown as not only of the the Hainesville
and the Eagleford and all the other shale plays peaked and are in permanent decline but the
Permian which is the granddaddy of them all is still growing but that you're seeing the EUR the
well productivity has dropped 50% from 2019 right and and you think the most likely reason
to this is they're over drilling and they're cannibalizing to get more oil out now without
really a plan for the future and I think you mentioned that today given the day that you're
seeing is that we would need a hundred dollar a barrel oil at some you know reasonable discount
rate for new drilling to make sense in these plays is that a fair summary it's a fair summary and
let me you know you know give the necessary caveat here and that is to say that there is uncertainty
particularly in evaluating recent production you don't have a tremendous amount of of history
in a new well so when I'm looking at 2023 production I don't even yet have a year
of monthly production to look at so I'm having to say well it looks like it's declining pretty
much the way 2022 and 2021 did but I could be wrong uh but what I'm not wrong about Nate
I'm not wrong about the fact that 2019 was higher than 2020 which was higher than 2021
which is higher than 2022 I'm very confident that there is a progressive decline in well
performance over the last four or five years now the in the Permian in the well in the Permian and
the Eagle Ford in the Bakken they're all doing the same thing and and the and and what I'm what I'm
reasonably confident but less confident in is that the the most recent data the 2023 data
is following that same decline trend and that's what'll be 50% of 2019 if I'm wrong
and I have to revert and say well actually you know I'm only confident back to 2022
then I'm going to say oh okay so the decline instead of being 15% is 38% or something it's
still pretty it's still pretty severe but you know so I have to be careful here I don't want to
you know I don't want to overstate the certainty of the very recent data but it but it's looking
it's it's looking like 50% so if we played this podcast to a boardroom of oil executives like
Harold Ham and other uh you know long time us energy e and p experts how much of them would
agree of of what you're laying out here and where might they disagree gee that's a great question
well I mean we've got I mean Harold Ham just recently told Bloomberg or somebody that we
really need to start thinking about what he called tier three reservoir which is you know he called it
the really rough rock Scott Sheffield who is the CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources which just sold
itself to Exxon he said the Permian is going to peak in five years and he said that several months
ago so my my sense is is that if if those boardroom doors were closed tight and there was no press in
the room my sense is is that Scott Sheffield and Harold Ham would say yeah we pretty much agree with
you I don't know that of course but they wouldn't they wouldn't say that publicly
I know that you uh your analysis working on this the last month or so because we've been talking
about it is kind of a backward backward looking you're looking at the EURs and the well productivity
in the last decade or so in these regions but could you hazard a guess where that 13 million
uh um production might be in five years or 10 years or 20 years
yeah well um the future is tough but my my of course there's there's above ground reasons and
and you know the the the geology and the oil situation is its own thing let's for the moment
leave out Saudi Arabia and Iran and war and credit and financial issues just on a depletion
geology a standpoint well but there there is another factor that doesn't have anything to do with
geopolitics and that's money capital and and I've already set the stage for this that I mean I sat
next to uh you know to a uh a mezzanine banker uh you were in the same room back in January down
in the Bahamas and he kept leaning over to me and saying yeah nobody will lend these guys any
money nobody wants to lend the oil companies any money um and and that so so the so the geology
is one thing but it takes capital to drill the wells and if we're if we start to see
the kind of thing that I anticipate and I'll answer your question in just a second that that
the production starts to decline then the next question is where are we going to get the money
to do it and the question that comes after that is how long will this take to correct
and we don't know where we're going to get the money to do it right now but I just told you that
there's like a two-year lag from actual drilling to getting any oil out of the ground well that
assumes that you've already made the decision to drill you've got a rig lined up your leases
are all set to go and you have all your permits in order so so one implication from the sentence
you just uttered is the amplitude of of change in the next decade could be wild because when
we're faced with scarcity and shortages and a recession or worse because oil price is it's
unavailable at the quantity we want it so the price has to go up that's when they send out the rigs
and the investment and we're going to have to wait 18 to 24 months to get a meaningful increase
but that meaningful increase is not going to come from a snap of a finger there's now a cap
that's going to be declining I mean this is this is the real deal the slurping sound is upon us
right and there's uh I mean we the the I imagine that that most of the people that listen to this
podcast you know don't pay daily attention to the oil markets but they're they're probably aware
of the fact that hey you know prices are are lower than a lot of people a lot of producers
would like them to be right now that's why OPEC is about to have a meeting in vienna to figure out
how much to cut so they can get prices back up so oil prices today are you know in the in the low
70s well it wasn't that long ago at the peak of the ukraine invasion that they were 120 dollars
so how does oil price vary between 50 dollars over a relatively short period of time and the
answer is that we're forever in a tug of war between oh my god we need more supply we're
feeling really urgent about supply but oh my god oil prices have reached a level at which it's
slowing down the economy and demand is is therefore weak and then you add in the interest rates that
the federal reserve and other central banks have had to use to get the inflation or try to get
inflation under control which by the way is related to oil price also um and it gets to be a very
heady and complex mix but but the the dichotomy the struggle the fugue if you will is between
how the economy is performing and the demand that results and the urgency of supply which
needs higher price and the two are always in conflict and and and just about the time that
we think we're making progress on getting wells drilled sentiment turns really sour and the
market says oh my god demand is weak you know we got to stop drilling wells and i i know i know
very credible analysts right now who think that oil price is going to stay around 80 dollars
for the next two or three years now that seems difficult for me to accept but that's what they
say so getting back to the can you give us like a a best case medium case and worst case um given
the implications of what you're saying here and i and i'll point out that if you're right about this
the geology all the sudden perhaps becomes the least important aspect because if this is recognized
and the reality unfolds then it it opens up a huge sort of systemic can of worms in the world
it certainly does and and looking at the world um my my best case i i i would be i would be very
surprised if if oil production increases in the next say six months uh or into 2024 my guess is
that it will increase very very slowly and essentially be on a plateau and then start
declining often to the future and by 2040 or 2050 i would not be surprised if production were
20 lower than it is today and i'm not basing that off of you know the kinds of uh peak demand
kinds of concerns that oh we're you know we're all going to be driving electric cars and i i'm not
basing it on that at all i'm basing that on my sense of of a combination of the geology
the the commercially available uh low hanging fruit if you will and there's very little of that
and the finance side the capital side that says okay if we need more oil here's the money let's
go after it i'm i'm very very concerned that that that the second part is not there it's just not
there well one of the reasons it's not there is because of the next question i'm going to ask you
a lot of the followers of this podcast uh which i'm quite proud of um
have a value system beyond the human sphere and they deeply care about the natural world and
the sink capacity of our biosphere in our oceans and they might be listening to you saying this is
good news this is all good news except for what you just said because if we're only down 20 or
30 percent in oil in the next 10 or 20 years we need to be down 100 percent um what do you think
about all that well if you're down 20 on blood oxygen you might be dead that's what i think about
that now i i'm i'm in that camp nate i mean i'm totally in the camp that says that we need to
decrease our consumption of all energy not just fossil fuels but particularly fossil fuels and
we need to do that in order to to stop destroying the ecosystem of the planet from which we get all
our wealth um you know it's it's some of it is is certainly a lot of it is because i i love nature
but on a purely pragmatic basis i mean if we continue to destroy the ecosystem on which the
entire food chain ours included you know if we are destroying it then we are we are going to
