destroy our own prosperity our own so-called human flourishing if you will to to use an expression
that that's kind of uh in common use out there that we cannot separate ourselves our our fate our
prosperity from that of the planet but my but the concern that that that i have and i know that you
share is that our entire society's metabolism is based on an oil economy and and and if if we if we
if we stop that supply too quickly then things collapse i mean and and and and that results in
in levels of of of chaos and social and civic disorder governance problems geopolitical strife
that that just makes life almost impossible so the people that want to get off oil i'm with you
a hundred percent in an ideal world i'd like to get off oil too but not at the not at the cost
you know of of having you know the frankenstein mob outside my house wanting to you know to to
to you know to to come in and take everything i have and i don't think anybody wants that
it's it's it's a very difficult balance to to try to uh to try to maintain between being able to
carry on a life that has an equality to it and also not destroying the planet i i don't know
what the answer is my guess is that we're not going to get a lot of choice in how that answer
unfolds we're going to have to live with what happens so you're kind of calling peak oil as
likely 2018 to now plateau with a a decline in it coming in the in the coming years i am
what about shale plays tight oil plays arctic plays you mentioned it briefly on a prior podcast
but could you briefly recap why the u.s. experiment is unlikely to be repeated as a global extension
of of oil supply in in the coming decade sure there there are a lot of overlapping spheres
that have to be considered yeah there's a ton of shale in the world but only marine shale
and this is purely empirical only marine shale has ever worked for a tight oil play
and of that marine shale you know let's just for argument's sake let's say 25 percent of
the shale in the world is is marine shale of that marine shale you know some of it is uncooked
like what we just talked about in colorado in utah so if we take what percent of that marine shale
has been buried deeply enough has experienced enough heat and pressure to generate the petroleum
you know maybe we're talking 25 percent of that now of that how much remains buried at a depth
that has enough pressure to be produced by some means fracking or whatever to the surface and
just for argument's sake let's say 25 per percent of that and of that how much of it is in an area
in which we can actually access and drill that we're not in the middle of you know new york city
or the grand canyon or at 30 000 feet or you know that so there and and then we we layer into that
that very few parts of the world have a a fiscal system in which the owner of the land actually
gets paid for having somebody produce the oil under his land that's a very unique situation
to the united states canada argentina and a handful of other countries in most parts of the
world a rig moves on to your your property and you don't get squat in return and therefore people
say no we're not going to allow that so you take all those overlapping spheres and say well
where is all the overlap occurring and the answer is we've already we've already identified most of
those places they're in north america they're in parts of argentina there are areas in russia
that seem to fit that comparison there are very few places that actually that actually meet all
those overlapping criteria for shale the arctic i mean that's a whole nother that's a whole nother
rabbit hole of of cost and expense and geopolitical conflict and uh you know when i when people say
arctic i'm thinking okay best case scenario uh we might start producing something up there in 25
years um that's a really best case so if you know people who think oh well we're just going to make
it happen no i mean we got territorial disputes between you know between russia the united states
china i mean this is that that's that's so far removed that um it's a future possibility but
it's it's not going to meet our our urgent needs in in any kind of reasonable time period
i know you're not an expert on this and i don't know of any experts on this but how could artificial
intelligence change the story that you've laid out here right and you're you're correct i'm i'm
not an expert on artificial intelligence i i'd like to say that for all the reading i've done i
should be but i'm not because this is a really hard thing to know if you're not on the inside and i'm
not but um artificial intelligence is not going to change the geology of planet earth
um artificial intelligence is most likely to change in a good way or in a in a commercial
way the technology that we use to produce uh the oil and natural gas and you know god knows what
else you know lithium so an even larger straw perhaps yeah larger straw and and ideally you
would think that artificial intelligence would help us make better decisions uh perhaps decisions
you know not to drill wells uh 300 feet apart when our best science tells us it should be a thousand
but we knew that we already knew that and we did it anyway um but but you know so so to me there
the idea that artificial intelligence is is going to find ways of of of of adding new reserves
i'm very skeptical of that because i think maximum power principle and i mean humans are very good
at at at knowing what it is that's useful and how to find it they don't always know how to get it
in a way that makes sense but i think we know an awful lot of that so ai could do a lot for
technology could do a lot for decision making and and i can't begin to say uh how important that is
or is not but um for the the leaps and bounds that i understand that ai is making i still suspect
we're talking about many years before it actually could make a difference in our energy supply now
maybe i'm wrong but my fear is is that people are going to start using it to to find better
ways of fighting wars or displacing humans from factory floors um but but i could be i'm probably
wrong on that well i don't think you're probably wrong you you might be wrong but i i don't disagree
with you so once this is all realized um five years from now we have lower production the
permean is past peak um there's economic crises knowing humans will probably blame all that on
some exogenous factor and not on geology and the fact that we've used a larger straw to take out a
finite resource central to our economic institutions um but on that trajectory i've asked you this
before and i'll ask it again given your new research um does it make sense for ai or some
external body to coordinate the drilling in the oil that we have remaining in this country and in
other countries for them in a more planned way so that we don't cannibalize and we actually
increase the e you are because we're not um taking someone else's pizza as it were uh under the earth
is there a role for for some sort of a coordinated strategy beyond the lots of little pin cushion
dots owned by different corporations well there's always room and and and yeah but i mean what
when was the last time we ever had a coordinated effort uh to meet any of our needs except in
wartime um i'm i'm just not i i'd like to be more optimistic here except that it just doesn't seem
that humans are very good at that and and if if the let's just say that the ai agreed with me
which is that the best forward strategy for humanity in the earth is for humans to use less
energy uh nobody wants to do that well because ai is ai is here but the market gdp in profits is
above it in the hierarchy so at least for now that that's not going to happen what we are we are
we already know that though i mean that's my point yeah i mean and and i know there are lots of
people out there who will disagree with this but um i think they disagree with because of ideology
but i mean i look at the world and you know like you i you know i go around and i give talks and
people say yeah but i mean what's the solution i mean you know you you got to tell us what the
solution is and i say the solution's easy use less energy well they don't like that that's not a
solution to them they want to know well you know can't we use hydrogen isn't nuclear the solution
i mean they they want something that allows us to keep on growing the way that we have that doesn't
cause any fundamental discomfort in their lifestyle and i just don't see that that those things are
compatible that the solution is one that will create considerable not unbearable but considerable
discomfort in our lifestyle and our economic prosperity as you know i agree with that i i
think there are no longer any non radical pathways out of this um and we're going to have to uh use
less but it's the systemic implications of a peak and decline in oil that i am focused on
this has been very enlightening um i want to ask you one final question but do you is there
anything that you would like to summarize and and um you know hit uh a harder tone on on anything
you've outlined today probably not on anything that i've outlined uh we came close to it when you
asked me you know do i think that our political leaders are fighting these wars right now because
they're aware of what you're talking about i i don't know what they're aware of and what they're
not aware of but uh i think anyone who believes that the war in ukraine is about uh territorial
or ideological differences between russia russians and ukrainians uh really needs to uh well probably
needs to listen to helen thompson's podcast that you did a little while ago anyone who thinks that
what's going on between israel and and hamas right now is some secular issue that you know that that
ultimately revolves around forming a you know a two-state solution in israel uh i i think you
know really needs to study well listen to helen again but you know study the history of of the
middle east and how it's fit into the geopolitics of the world uh since at least the beginning of
the 20th century it's all about resources and energy all these wars ultimately are well well
just to put a fine point on that we're talking about decline of us production uh because of what
you've outlined and discovered on the permean uh well productivity a reminder that two-third uh
half to two-thirds of the world's remaining oil reserves are within six seven hundred miles of
of israel yeah like so there's a reason that we're over there there has and and and and us foreign
policy has always been focused on the middle east as has the foreign policy of the united kingdom
and france and russia and i mean germany i mean this is this is not known to to everyone but uh
you know look at history and and and you will you will see it very clearly um it's not lost on anyone
so you sent me um uh supporting slides for this conversation which we will share uh as we always
do in the in the show notes on the main site the great simplification dot com on our last podcast
i asked you what you would like to come back on the show and discuss and i believed you said
you want to talk about renewable energy energy properties energy density nuclear and how
um those are not going to replace the energy quality of oil and gas is that still what you
would like to do on our next conversation this was a little research thing that you just came upon
with kerry king and so i wanted to give you a podium to highlight this but what would you
like to talk about next time now absolutely and and and not not from the perspective of oh
renewables are no good and we need to you know we need to no it's not it's not that at all i think
i i think that renewables uh nuclear all these things are are certainly they are part of the
energy landscape and they will be an increasing part going forward but i i really would like
a platform to explain why a lot of the popular conceptions about what they can do are going to
be hugely disappointing we cannot run this civilization on on on renewable energy and
and i think that's that's important to understand because we either then have to say well we're
going to have to continue with fossil fuels or we're going to have to change the kind of
civilization that we live in one or the other maybe there's a third option i'm not considering
yep uh i look forward to that conversation it will be after your trip and after my taking
january off from recording so february march we will have you back and continue to be uh energy
pitbull uh curious analyst trying to figure this all out thank you for your your analysis
