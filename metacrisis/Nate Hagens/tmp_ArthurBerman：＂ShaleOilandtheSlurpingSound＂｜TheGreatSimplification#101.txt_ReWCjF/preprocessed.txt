Even though the new wells are not performing as well in terms of how much oil they'll make over
their lifetimes, their daily rates early on are much, much higher. And so we're getting
a whole lot of that production early on. That's what technology has done for us. It's like
I'm sucking on a milkshake and suddenly you gave me a wider straw that has a bigger diameter.
I could suck more faster. It doesn't add anything to the well.
I'd like to welcome my friend and colleague Art Berman back to the podcast. I think this is his
fifth appearance on The Great Simplification. This is a very important and serious topic we
discussed today, which is the fact that shale oil responsible for most of the growth in world
oil output in the last decade has been hydrated and cannibalized other wells.
And we just hit a new peak in U.S. production, but Art will explain this is coming at a cost of
massively declining well productivity, where wells are producing 50% less per well than
they were just three or four years ago. And that this will manifest in both shale oil peaking
and global oil peaking. Art says that we have effectively used a larger straw and are much
closer to that slurping sound at the end of a milkshake. Of course, we're already a couple,
three million barrels below the all-time peak in the end of 2018, and the world economy has
continued to grow. Stock markets are near all-time highs, so a few million barrel decline in oil
does not portend the end of civilization. But it has major implications for coming decades if
oil supply, even if we wanted it to grow, is no longer able to grow and will be in
effectively permanent decline starting about now. Very important conversation,
please welcome my colleague, Art Berman.
Art, great to see you. Nate, always good to see you too. This is our fifth podcast together,
I believe. Wow. And what you may not know, but my phone told me today is this is our
three thousandth time of talking. Is that all? No, I'm kidding. I think it did. Well,
it's probably about right. So you have been hard at work on some new, very important
oil-related research, which we're going to unpack today. For those people that have
not heard our previous episodes, let me do a brief recap of assertions and please chime in
if I'm missing something. So we talked about what is oil? It comes from ancient oceans and seas
buried under geologic time and pressure. How important it is to our economies? Energy is
incredibly important and oil is effectively the hemoglobin of our modern system.
We're nearing metaphorically the bottom of the barrel because we found all the conventional
plays and now we're adding unconventional, including shale oil. There's plenty left,
but the ability to extract it and grow what we have now is at issue and how fast they decline
might be another issue. We also talked about how in a barrel of oil, there are many other products
in addition to gasoline, including an especially diesel fuel, which is one of the most important
products in the global economy, and that we have to refine those products off sequentially.
In other words, you can't just divvy up a barrel, every barrel, into all the pieces and extract
less per se. We also talked about how increasingly what we call oil by the energy information
agency and other analysis is not really oil and in the United States, our growth in production is
increasingly have a larger fraction of what's called natural gas plant liquids, which get
processed into you use the term baggies quite often. What we call oil is not necessarily the
oil of the past generation and lots of economic implications of all that. Is that a fair two
minute recap? Excellent. Yeah, that's perfect, Nate. When we talk about how much oil is there,
we talk about global oil production, which of course is a misnomer because it was produced
long ago. We're extracting it and refining it and turning it into products that humans use.
Is it fair to say that that is a composite of three things? One is all of the wells that
have been drilled in the past and the technology that's still getting oil from those wells and
fields stacked on top of that is the new wells that are drilled and then the technology that's
involved in that. Then the third would be what is this stuff we're getting out of the ground?
What is the composition of it? How useful is it? Is it a lot of sulfur? Is it heavy? Is it light?
Is it natural gas plant liquids? Do those three things tell the story of how much oil we're
extracting? They do and I would simply call category three oil quality. Oil quality, good, good.
Tell us about your new discovery that you've been working around the clock to analyze
the past month or so and we're going to unpack it together. Sure. I was asked to help on a project,
a mutual friend of ours up at the University of Texas asked me if I would help him put together
a US oil and gas production model going back to where the data begins for convenience around 1950
and to give him the necessary parameters that he could use to model that for a much bigger macro
analysis. Now I should be embarrassed but I'm not that I have never gone back that far and done
anything more than just look at production but what I had to do for Kerry King was to actually look
at how what was the well-performance like in 1950 and 1960 and 1970 and having done that
it gave me some really new perspective on the peak oil movement if you want to call it that,
that you and I were both involved in in the early part of this century. And are still involved in.
Well and we still are, right, you know, some of us don't give up. We continue to believe that a
finite resource eventually will become scarce. Well if someone's hair was on fire we would
feel compelled to continue to tell them their hair was on fire which is a metaphor for our
preparation as a society for coming decades but go on. For sure. So what I learned first of all
was how right we were that the productivity of the average well in the United States and let me
just say I'm not being U.S. centric here but I mean 1950 the U.S. produced something like 70 75
percent of the oil in the whole world. So I mean particularly back then it was really important
and we are still today the largest producer and it is our recent production increase say from 19
or 2010 to the present that of which all of the growth in oil production has come. So
the United States is not just important it's kind of critical in the mix but what I what I
discovered was that back in the 1950s and 1960s the average well was a pretty darn good well in
the United States you know it was 150 200 000 barrels per well on average by the late part of
the 20th century that had dropped down to about 20 000 barrels a day. Now 20 000 barrels a day
sounds like a lot of oil and it is as a consumer but there's hardly a company in the world that
can afford to produce a well that only makes 20 000 barrels in its lifetime and I didn't
realize exactly the magnitude of of how urgent it was to find new reserves and so
that was an aha and then when when the tight oil and the deep water and the the offshore
Gulf of Mexico started coming on those average wells were from you know five to fifty times
more productive than even the really good wells back in the mid part of the 20th century
and the shale wells were in the same category so so on the one hand what it showed me it it
it really emphasized how dire our situation was in 2000 2005 we were living off of wells that were
that weren't commercial to produce for all intents and purposes and it also emphasized all this
unconventional oil offshore deep water shale how what what a step change it really was
on a per well basis I mean it was it was huge and back in the peak oil days I was one of the
people that was saying oh this stuff is you know it it it it's never going to be commercial and
and if it is it can't contribute all that much well I was very wrong we were all very wrong
that was kind of the problem with peak oil but the real the the real jaw dropper in the study
I guess was looking at US production today it's declining at a at a very precipitous rate and
the shale plays again the average well performance is declining at a really concerning rate so what
that says is we're heading back to where we were in the 1990s and early 2000s unless I've got something
very very wrong in other words the unconventional plays bought us about a decade or a decade and
a half and now we're we're probably looking at something well nothing's ever the same as it was
but something a situation that's potentially similar to when we were worried about peak
oil the first time around lots of questions first of all you just said US production is is
declining didn't we just hit an all-time new slightly new high well I didn't say US production
was declining I said the performance of US wells is declining but you're absolutely right the US
just barely exceeded 13 million barrels of crude oil and condensate a day which was the pre-covid
peak back in early 2020 and so some of us probably did not expect that to happen I didn't rule it out
but I was a little surprised when it did and what's more surprising is that the experts in the US
government the Department of Energy believe that the average production for 2024 is going to be a
little bit more than 13 million barrels a day and they may be right I'm not saying they're wrong
I'm simply saying that if I'm right about the per well performance dropping off and it's not
just dropping off it's been dropping for several years it's going to be increasingly difficult
to maintain that level of production so I want to underscore I'm not saying that the EIA the
energy information agency administration is wrong I'm just saying that there there are some challenges
that that go into that forecast or projection that I wasn't aware of until I did this work
so so what does that actually mean US well performance does that mean the total amount
of oil that has ever gotten from a well or the per day or can you explain yeah so there's there's a
lot of ways to measure it but the simplest way is what we call estimated ultimate recovery
which is how much oil and gas of course an average well makes over its commercial lifetime so at
some point I mean the well might go on making three barrels four barrels a day forever and
ever but at some point you don't get enough revenue from what's being produced to even break even
on your operating expenses so I mean you have to operate a pump you have to run electricity
you've got to pay staff to you know in the office and in the field and so at some point you reach
a level where you just say okay you know that's it at least for our company we can't afford to
produce this well anymore and so that's what it is it's simply a projection you take the all the
production history that you have the data and and you and you project it out at some defensible
rate that's consistent with the previous historical data out to an economic limit and you add it up
integrate under the curve and that's your e you are estimated ultimate recovery and so what I was
to go back to where I was before if an average us well let's just say in 1990 made 20 000 barrels
of oil in its lifetime the average us well in 2020 made 325 000 barrels so so 15 times as much
more oil per well per well and so the the better your individual well is the fewer new wells you
have to drill in order to maintain the level of supply that the country and and and the world needs
so that's good news it is good news it's excellent news the bad news is is that that that well
performance that average lifetime production per well is declining now there's another
component and I'm going to I'm going to circle back to your question about how how come us
production is at a new peak and the answer is is that there are two parts there are rates
and reserves reserves are the estimated ultimate recovery for all practical purposes
how much the well is going to make or the field is going to make or the state is going to make or
the country is going to make over a certain period of time the other component is how fast
does it come out of the ground and what I saw and and this doesn't surprise me at all is that even
though the new wells are not performing as well in terms of how much well oil they'll make over
their lifetimes their their daily rates early on are much much higher and so we're getting a whole
lot of that production early on that's the that's what technology has done for us it's like uh I'm
sucking on a milkshake and suddenly you gave me a wider you know a straw that has a bigger diameter
I could suck more faster it doesn't add anything to the well uh the well still you know uh produces
the same amount as before but I get it out sooner and faster and that's what's responsible I believe
for the 13.1 million barrels a day is even though the wells are going to perform more poorly in terms
of their lifetime recovery they're front end loaded and we're getting extra exceptionally
high rates early on and that's what's boosting us production so the disconnect here between this
view and the conventional extrapolate today forward into the future financial view is that
um this new high production brings us much closer to the slurping sound of um of depletion in in these
in these wells whereas looking nominally at busting through 13 million barrels a day again
people could just extrapolate that forward look at the growth from 2020 to now and extrapolate
that forward to 2030 and that's not going to happen well that that that's my sense of it um
I've been wrong before but it's as I said a little while ago it just gets increasingly difficult to
do that and we add to that the fact that um investors are not too keen on drilling on giving
oil and gas companies money these days back not very many years ago in 2015 2016 investors were
lining up to throw money at the oil companies that's not the case today and there are a lot of
reasons for it but mostly the oil companies are having to get by on on the internal cash they
generate which is substantial at the moment because oil prices have been up to a hundred
dollars hundred and twenty dollars a barrel but uh it's very difficult to grow any business
without getting some money from the outside and and right now investors uh just I mean nobody's
lending I shouldn't say nobody but effectively nobody's loaning oil companies money and maybe
that'll change if the urgency starts to to get more severe but for right now that's not the
case and I think most people the market particularly thinks no we're we're transitioning to an electric
economy you know we're going to hydrogen and nuclear and renewables and you know that's what's
gonna that that's what's gonna power the future not not oil and gas do oil and gas companies
want money need money for drilling and and upstream investment oh yeah they desperately I mean it's
you know a well an onshore well and in in Texas or New Mexico and the Permian basin and we're talking
you know six seven eight nine ten million dollars per well depending on how deep it is and you know
how how if if we need six seven eight nine ten million dollars what would be the kind of minimum
EUR estimated ultimate recovery of a well to make that financially plausible again it's a
combination of rates and reserves but to give you a simple answer today we need pretty nearly
300 000 barrels per well at around a hundred dollars spot price to break even and that includes
all the operating costs and you know the overhead and the interest on debt and everything like that
plus an eight percent discount out into the future and and is this known in the industry I would assume
yeah I think absolutely I mean you can't book a reserve unless you can show that it's commercial
at current rates at current prices and that it includes I think the SEC actually requires a 10
percent return to book a reserve how much of that 300 000 barrels can you just give me a rough
estimate of if that well is drilled how soon with conventional technology and the current kind of
well performance do we get like 70 or 80 percent of that out in the first year or two or is it take
20 years to get it or what's that like now most of the most of the if the well hasn't paid itself out
in three or four years it never will so these wells are again front-end loaded they're gonna
they're gonna decline you know 40 50 60 percent over the first year or two and that's not a bad
thing I mean there's a lot of people that that criticize shale plays because they have high
rates of return well unfortunately you know I've got news for them and that is that you know all
the really commercial plays in the world have high rates of decline you want as much cash early on as
you can get to pay out your gigantic upfront expense it's the time value of money so there's
nothing intrinsic from a financial standpoint high rates of return are fine it's just for the
for the rest of us looking forward to a what are we going to do for an energy supply in 10 years or
15 or 20 years that it starts to look a little bit concerning so let's look at some of the graphs
you sent me some slides which we will share to the viewers can you walk me through what we're
looking at in slide number two yeah slide number two this was actually a slide that you asked me
to make and I've updated I think it's real illustrative of what's going on but please
explain it so this is this is us production going back you know to 1900 pretty much and and what
I've done here is to divide it into the green is is conventional you know like onshore bread and
butter kind of oil production that peaked in around 1970 peaked for the first time and then
Alaska came on mostly Prudhoe Bay that's the the yellowish orange and that brought us up to pretty
much the same level again by you know the the mid 1980s and the offshore then then started actually
after the war that's the blue the second world war and and and all of that then was in fairly
serious decline by the time period I was talking about you can look at 2008 on the on the graph
we were down from nearly 10 million a day to half that amount 5.1 million barrels a day
and that's when shale came in that's the you know the Mount Everest in red that says tight oil
and that boosted the us production up to where it is today pretty nearly 13 million barrels a day
and so what this graph shows is just how incredibly dependent the us supply is on this relatively new
source of oil called tight oil or shale oil and everything else with a few additions here and
there is still on the same depletion trajectory that it was beginning in 1970 okay let's let's
stay in this graph I have I have several questions first of all the yellow which is not a contiguous
part of the united states but is part of the 50 united states it looks like it's unless it's a
spandrel of your graphic technique it it looks like it's approaching zero well it is and this is
not this is not an incremental chart this is you know these are actual values and so the
Alaska production despite the best efforts of of the the companies that produce that oil on the
north slope and the Alaska state government are are struggling to even keep the the pipeline that
brings it from the north part of Alaska down to where it can be marketed I mean that that pipeline
is is is going dry they've simply you know they they've largely depleted the the supply now companies
are up there drilling and it's not like it's gone to zero but you know a company can make money but
it's not contributing a lot to to the overall us supply okay and then stripping out the red section
which is the tide oil which I'll get to in a second the rest of it the conventional the
alaskan the offshore are all looking a lot like cantorail or something that I mean the whole
the whole amount is is in decline and and seemingly accelerating that's certainly that's
that's what the data says yes exactly right so how much of our oil in the united states
that we extract is tide oil versus the rest roughly 70 percent 70 percent is tide oil
yes and so what's what do we drill next after tide oil no one knows Nate that's I mean but
this is where we were in in 2005 before the tide oil came on the scene it's like okay what are we
gonna do next and the answer up until that time had been well let's go explore elsewhere in the
world let's you know let's drill wells off offshore brazil or off of west africa or let's
you know try to find some new frontier areas in the the onshore basins of africa and at this
moment I mean we never know you know what what's still out there but it it it seems as though
we've we've we pretty much know what's commercially available and what's not and the answer is we
don't know we don't know where where we're gonna go it are there more tide oil plays well you know
somewhere in the world there are and and they're being they're being worked on and developed but
in the united states you know we've pretty much tried all of them I mean there was a big
flurry of you know let's try every tide oil play and shale gas play that we can imagine
this was back in 2010 through 15 and most of them prove not to be very commercial and so we're kind
of down to the the three the three shale oil plays the permy in the bock and in the eagle
ford that worked and of those three two of them are are pretty much in decline and the
permean still growing slowly but your analysis of the permean well performance suggests that the
permean two is about to peak and decline the average well performance is has peaked and declined
but it's being held up by extra exceptionally high rates and the large number of wells that
have already been drilled we're making up making up for it on volume that's exactly right that's
what we're doing and so I'm not I'm not saying that that we should you know the people should be
looking for the permean basin to to roll over and and and decline in the next three months six
months nine months twelve months is certainly possible but it's not that simple I mean there's
there's you know there's 40 or 50 000 tight oil wells out there and and and there's a there's a
considerable lag between drilling bringing them online and actually having them build to you
know to some respectable level of a couple of years so you know there's there's an error there's
there's a window in which we don't quite know what's coming next but we do know that the average
well performance in terms of what it'll make over its lifetime is lower so so staying on
slide two then looking at the red which is the tight oil there was a peak which I guess was
2019 before COVID or something and then we had a decline and then a new peak just recently is that
correct right so that that that first peak was just as COVID began so again there's a lag
all of the production in the United States the well yeah for for several weeks I mean almost
all of it got shut in because there was simply no place to store the oil I remember I remember
and and but but it took a while you know for that you know to show itself in on this scale
but then after COVID in uh 2021 and 2022 money came back in there was storage that was freed up
and and it's it's pretty well built since then but again the build has been in the Permian the
Bakken and the Eagle Ford and there's a couple of other less important plays the Niobarara and the
Woodford etc you know those are sort of baseload those are those are just kind of flatlining
so this is mainly mainly Permian base in west Texas and and southeastern New Mexico
that have accounted for this increase recent increase and and looking at the graph without
understanding everything you just said if this were a stock price and not a a measure of geological
provinces stacked together one would say all time hi we're gonna off to the races it's a buy
yeah exactly yeah we're we're going to the moon right however and I learned this from you the
tidal oil the shale oil shale where it is is where all the other oil migrated from it is the source
rock there's nothing left after that except perhaps oil shale which is not fully cooked
can you comment on that right so there we've known about what's called oil shale for
I don't know 100 years at least this is these are source rocks that are a lot of them at the surface
in places in Colorado and Utah mainly and so these are I mean these are rocks that if you
walk up near them you'll smell the oil you know you hit them with a hammer and there's oil that's
that's you know they're saturated you know to to some extent with the oil but as you said
they haven't been buried deeply enough they haven't they haven't been cooked they haven't been in the
kitchen long enough so they're they're immature source rocks for the most part and what has to
happen is for us to use it and there were great schemes back in the 1970s you know to mine the
stuff and heat it you know cook it in in giant ovens or you know to even you know use nuclear
energy to somehow heat it up to you know to try to hasten the the the thermal maturation process
there are obvious environmental problems that got in the way and despite several false starts I mean
you know that that's not going anywhere as far as I know but if you had to bet and U.S. oil
production declines as you are inferring and we're going to get to some projections on that
would you guess that well we could we could either find other tight oil plays in addition to the
Permian and the Eagleford are there any of those and and if not are we gonna try to do
oil shale wow so as I said a little while ago I I think we've we've pretty much sampled
all the the tight oil plays and shale gas plays in the United States including places like Alaska
and at some price some very much higher oil price some of them may actually
become commercial but none of them were were successful there are deeper horizons within
the you know the Bakken and and and the Permian that certainly I mean I would go too long before
I tried to artificially cook the oil shales of Colorado and Utah again the environmental concerns
out there just overwhelming okay so back to this graphic I remember when I asked you to make this it
was four years ago because the U.S. had just peaked and we were talking about global oil peak
so the U.S. just made a new peak of around 13 million barrels and we still consume what 2021
well that yeah that's that's refined products so there's right you know we're comparing
apples and oranges a little bit but yeah right this this is crude oil and 20 is is gasoline
jet fuel kerosene et cetera right but it has the world made a new peak because I think the world
peak of all liquids to my knowledge is still fourth quarter of 2018 yes and and so we are
we are still a couple of million barrels a day below that as of the the latest data that I have
is is may of 2023 we can we can project that forward and say well you know we're on track to
beat that peak too but you know we'll see about that except if if the U.S. is imminently peaking
because of the well performance issue that you just outlined and the Permian the U.S. has long
ago peaked if you exclude the Permian actually maybe you you sent me a graph on that would you
like to describe graph number three yeah number three shows four things the blue is all U.S. crude
oil and condensate production including the November 2023 13.1 million barrels a day which is
will be a little bit lower just below 13 million the EIA says in December then the the orange line
is all the tight oil that's about nine million barrels a day a lot of it and so you know that's
that's where the the 70 percent comes from nine out of 13 okay yeah and then the next line down
the red is Permian so six of that nine is six of that nine comes from just one of the shale
oil regions it's the granddaddy it's the big one yeah it is and then the gray line at the bottom
is that that orange tight oil minus the Permian so it's a little bit less than three million barrels
a day but back to where we were a bit ago on on on the first graph this just shows how incredibly
dependent the United States is on on tight oil and the Permian in particular and the world though
too right didn't you say that the majority of oil production increase in the last 13 years is
just from this red sliver here right and and there there there's a there's a graph that shows that
as well and I think that's our slide five and so on on this graph I'm showing world conventional
in green deep water and oil sands and other you know kinds of dribs and drabs of less conventional
supply in orange and then the tight oil is in blue and and you can you know just in your mind
draw a flat line across there starting you know back in 2005 or 10 at the very most and see that
all the other oil in the world except for tight oil has at best been flat and so all of the growth
in world supply has been the blue since at least 2010 and and and someone might say well it's only
you know seven or eight million barrels a day how important is that and the answer is it makes
all the difference in the world I mean that's you know that's because I mean even one million
barrels a day of deficit in supply is enough to drive oil prices up to a hundred and twenty
dollars a barrel I mean that's what OPEC has been doing here for the last couple of years they've
been withholding oil to try to keep the price up so the the we use so much oil to keep the world
running to keep our our factories and machines and houses and I mean everything we do relies on oil
and so we're if we're down one percent we're screwed I don't think a lot of people understand
that and I think when we talk about oil peaking and and real simply peak oil means that we're
dependent on a finite resource that has incredible energy density and work potential
that replaces what humans used to do manually and it will one day hit a maximum and then decline
that is a given but when we talk about that we're not running there there's two implications I think
and I'll ask for you to chime in one is we're going to have to figure out in coming decades and
century what we're going to do when we have 80 percent as much oil 60 percent as much oil 40
percent as much oil 10 percent as much oil down into the future that is an important question
that society really if we had wisdom and foresight would be addressing but the second
which is more of the focus of the my work with this podcast and my organization is
once we stop growing and start declining that calls into motion all sorts of
deltas differentials between society and finance and government expectations
of what extrapolating the past forward to a reality so there's a there's a what do we do
about our financial claims once energy especially oil starts to decline that's a separate question
and one with with hugely important consequences how do we fight our wars
you know we use an awful lot of a lot of a lot of oil just to to move all that equipment around
but you know about you said that oil is hemoglobin think about it as oxygen okay think about if
if you're if a person's oxygen saturation dropped five percent what would happen I mean it's only
five percent right but I mean very likely you would have you might collapse you would certainly
have to sit down you'd be like I mean you couldn't function with a couple of percent less oxygen
saturation in your blood and that that would be the effect of of losing just a couple of percent
of oil supply for for the for the world's metabolism let me put you on the spot here
you mentioned war is it possible that the powers that be actually understand everything that you've
presented today and this may be one of the reasons that the United States is aggressive in Ukraine
and Russia and the Middle East etc because now is the time when we do have an abundance
quote unquote as we're looking at production but underneath that is the well performance which
is in decline and that implies a much different next decade the military is always extraordinarily
mindful of and sensitive to their energy and oil supply much more if if if politicians and the
State Department had the same perspective as the military we would not be in the situation we're
in today because they know what it takes to run an army and it takes the hell of a lot of oil I mean
one of the reasons that the United States that Franklin Roosevelt made a bargain with the king
of Saudi Arabia in 1945 was because he believed he knew that one of the main reasons the United
States was victorious over Germany and Japan was that the United States and its allies had
better access to oil I mean period you can't run an army all those jeeps and all those supply
lines and all those tanks you can't run an army without oil and so he at a time when the United
States was the Saudi Arabia it was the OPEC plus of the world in 1945 Roosevelt was he talked to
the king of Saudi Arabia on his way back from Yalta you know he just got done dividing up the
world between Churchill and Stalin and and oil was so much on his mind that that he had a meeting
with the king in the Red Sea in the Suez Canal to talk about how Saudi Arabia could help us and
we could help them and of course in 1945 I mean Saudi Arabia was just you know it wasn't on everybody's
mind it was a relatively new kingdom and I think it had founded in 1932 or something like that so
he was you know he was way ahead because he was listening to his military guys he just
got done fighting a big war so he was attuned to the military perspective on energy and oil
so I'm gonna get back to the global perspective in a second but let's um let's drill down on
on your findings so you've basically with your analysis you did for Kerry King
showed that the Perwell EUR estimated ultimate recovery in the Permian has dropped by like
50% in the last few years is that correct yep that's sadly correct and and other than we drilled
the best first and now we're going after other ones what what can explain why that happened
it's a very good question Nate and one that I have struggled with um and my most likely explanation
is that we've over drilled it that we have drilled our wells too close together and so what's happening
is is that the wells are cannibalizing one another's production that they have a there's a radius away
from each individual well to which or through which oil will naturally flow to the lower potential
energy in the wellbore and if you drill another well within that drainage radius of that of the
first well both wells are going to go on producing but they're going to be they're going to be
cannibalizing each other's supply and so both wells will end up producing less in their lifetime
if that makes sense to you it makes sense like when I was eating a pizza with my brother
sort of same sort of situation exactly but but let me ask you this are those competing wells
drilled by the same company or are they sometimes different companies even that have
different leases that are adjoining in the past you know back in the in the days of the you know
the the black and white movies you know the the gushers and all of that everybody was drilling
trying to you know steal his neighbor's oil but today it's not the case I mean very often more
often than not it's the same company you know that's drilling these kind of pitchfork patterns
of wells that are all coming off of of the same drilling pad and and why are they doing that well
you know they're the answer is I don't know but the maximum power principle well yeah let's get
as much out as we can right now but I remember back you know five six seven years ago reading
society a petroleum engineer papers in which they had analyzed all sorts of great new technologies
micro seismic data to and they were saying look you know we can't have these horizontal wells
much closer than seven eight nine hundred feet apart because if we do they're going to cannibalize
each other's production or interfere with each other's production now in the permean basin
we've gotten a whole lot closer than that and and the permean has because it's such a monster
of productivity has rewritten a lot of the rules about what works but I my my sense is
that we we've gone too far I can't say that categorically but that's my most likely explanation
so to simplify it to help me understand it let's say that a company or two companies
have two adjoining properties property one and property two and they look at all the seismic
and the mapping and both of them say we're going to get 10 units of oil out of here
and so they build all their expectations on that but then what happens is they drill them both
at the same time and because underneath the ground that oil is liquid and and flowing and
permeable that they actually neither one of them gets 10 they might get nine and eight respectively
because the the two plots are right next to each other is it something like that
it's actually worse than that what it what it is is that these companies if you have a square
mile of land one mile by one mile on the surface they will plan to drill six seven eight wells
the same company in that square mile all from the same surface location and that you know and it
looks like a rake the the you know the the map of the of the horizontal wells underground looks
like a rake okay it's got all these these times coming off of it and so they they know ahead of
time that they're going to drill at least a you know half a dozen or more wells that are going to
end up being much closer to each other than the thousand feet apart because they're because they're
not optimizing for an ultimate amount of oil from that region they're optimizing for getting it
out of the ground faster to sell it for monetary return well i'm going to give them credit and
say that i think that that somebody said hey we we we can get even closer than we thought before
because this basin is so special uh because you know we're we're using all this really great new
technology and our fracks are but but but let me let me finish where i was going they will
they will drill let's just say eight wells per square mile they'll drill all eight of them before
they complete any one of them because you use a rig to drill and you bring in a different rig
to actually do the fracking and and the completion and so they'll drill all eight wells they'll move
the drilling rig off they'll move you know a completion rig on and they'll run the pipe and
they'll you know do all the things they do they'll do the fracking and and then all eight of them
pretty much will start producing at the same time and part of the idea there is actually
to frack in between them to get the maximum amount of contact with the reservoir possible
and so i i'm willing to i'm willing to say that i believe i mean the the guys that run these companies
you know they're not they're not i mean they're smart and and and i think that they they were
convinced maybe they still are convinced that what i'm saying is wrong and probably or or
they really believe that what you're saying is right and if you're right they're just gonna go
and find another shale play and and develop that one in the same way well perhaps but let let's
keep perspective on this part of the reason that investors don't want to give these shale companies
any more money is because their view is is that those guys destroyed a lot of capital
over the last and and there's a very prominent climate change story out there definitely right
definitely but but the first strike against them was hey we've been giving you money for a decade
and you haven't made us any kind of decent returns so uh we're not giving you any more money uh and
i think that happened before the climate awareness started growing but they they kind of coincided
but so the companies have a reputation and a history of doing things that are not good for
investment investor returns and and still we look at all the sectors in the s and p 500
and the irony is is that energy is the most important sector to our lifestyles and our
future uh perhaps not to the environment but to the way our economy works today and it has
among the lowest returns and is among the lowest of the sectors in terms of its percent
of of the of the s and p 500 you know it's like four four and a half percent so
can you talk about rig count um yeah rig count um and what what is rig count and why is it important
and and how can the current rig count situation inform the prognosis that you're laying out here
well on on a on a very simplistic and logical basis uh you don't you don't produce any oil
unless you drill a well and so there ought to be pretty much a one-to-one correlation between
how many rigs are working drilling wells and how much oil you should expect to get out of the ground
sometime in the near future and that's always been rig count is something that for all of my
professional career when that data comes out usually on a on a on a friday everybody pays
the tension okay did the did the rig count for oil go up or did it go down did the rig count for
gas go up or go down and investors would you know they don't worry too much about what happens this
week or that week but over time uh you know hey it's it's gone down for the last four weeks
that's looking bad for supply longer term supply though right because there's a lag from when the
well is drilled to when the first production comes out well yeah and part of that is because of what
i just described that you're gonna you're you're gonna drill six seven eight wells before you even
go in to complete them and so if it takes you let's just say for argument's sake a month
to drill each well then and let's say you got eight wells then you got you know you you spend
eight months drilling the wells you got a rig working all the time one rig and you drill eight
wells and it takes the eight months let's just say and then you got to go in and complete all those
wells and maybe that takes you you know another month and a half and then you got to get them hooked
up to production and by the time they you know it's it's easily a year or so before any oil is
flowing at all and by the time that rate builds up to the point that it actually makes the difference
you're talking you know 18 to 24 months and so the rig count is is increasingly disconnected
from the production itself so right now that this 13.1 million barrels a day that we're seeing
in late 2023 as a record that everyone's like look at the USA record production and oil
is an artifact of the rigs that drilled in early 2022 and late 2021?
Yeah generally I mean you know it's gonna vary from operator to operator but yeah you're
yeah it's it's an artifact of something that happened a fair amount of time ago
and so things could be looking really kind of dire and yet it would be 12, 18, 24 months before we
started seeing the effect of that in production. So then there's two things that we can speculate on
well one thing we can know and one thing we can speculate on today we can look at the rig count
which in a second I'm gonna ask you what it is but then also the well productivity
you're saying is a 50% decline in the Permian in the last few years so to stay flat we would
need to have twice as many wells if the production is is only half of of what it used to be yes?
Yeah I mean you know so we're yeah you're exactly right and what is the rig count doing these days?
The rig count today is
let's just say it's you know it's five or six hundred wells for oil I mean I'm just kind of guessing
that so we are yeah we're looking at for you know for the US we're talking about something like
800, 800 wells overall. 800 rigs or 800 wells? 800 rigs I'm sorry so US and Canada's 800 US is like
600, 625. And how does that compare to a couple years ago? Oh well you know before before prices
collapsed in 2014 I mean we were you know we had several thousand wells drilling all the time but
there was like a revolution in technology that took place after that that collapsed in prices
and we went to a completely different kind of rig that was much more efficient could drill wells
a lot faster and so everything we thought we knew about rig count had to be recalibrated in 2015
and 2016 and what's happened here in the last uh well since COVID really in the last two or three
years is that the the rig productivity the amount of oil that can be attributed to the drilling by
one rig has has increased yet again. Now a lot of people get that confused they look at this
drilling productivity report that the EIA puts out every week and they say oh it keeps going up
that's great well yeah but rigs don't I mean you need to drill a well to produce oil but rigs
don't produce oil wells produce oil and and and I think a lot of a lot of people either confuse
that or lose sight of that so you know having having a very productive rig is good for costs
but it isn't necessarily uh doing anything for you know for your oil for the kind of oil supply
that you need in the future. My point is that just like uh you know when I bought my first car if
if it wasn't performing the way I wanted to I could pull over and you know open the hood on that VW
bug and take a screwdriver and adjust the timing in five seconds close it get back in the car and
perform better. I can't do that today because the technology in in my car is so complex that I don't
even know you know where to find the timing in my car and that's what's happened with with the
oil rigs too that that the technology has just gotten so sophisticated that to make that direct
connection oh my car is not working very well on turn a screw uh or to say well we've got 600 wells
and and we used to have 700 I don't even know what that means anymore because the wells are more
the the rigs are more productive so there's an increasing disconnect between what how many rigs
you have and what oil you're going to be producing in the future. I always tell people look at the
number of wells that are producing wells that are being added every month that's what we need to know
about. So we have reached the end of the easy part of this interview yeah now it's going to go into
the hard questions oh no maybe my dog will bark and interrupt us. Let me summarize first so you've
laid out that that shale oil tide oil is 70% of US production and its existence forestalled a
peak in US production and world production earlier this century that we just in the US
hit 13 million barrels which was an all-time high but that that was largely from wells that
were drilled 18 to 24 months ago and your recent research is shown as not only of the the Hainesville
and the Eagleford and all the other shale plays peaked and are in permanent decline but the
Permian which is the granddaddy of them all is still growing but that you're seeing the EUR the
well productivity has dropped 50% from 2019 right and and you think the most likely reason
to this is they're over drilling and they're cannibalizing to get more oil out now without
really a plan for the future and I think you mentioned that today given the day that you're
seeing is that we would need a hundred dollar a barrel oil at some you know reasonable discount
rate for new drilling to make sense in these plays is that a fair summary it's a fair summary and
let me you know you know give the necessary caveat here and that is to say that there is uncertainty
particularly in evaluating recent production you don't have a tremendous amount of of history
in a new well so when I'm looking at 2023 production I don't even yet have a year
of monthly production to look at so I'm having to say well it looks like it's declining pretty
much the way 2022 and 2021 did but I could be wrong uh but what I'm not wrong about Nate
I'm not wrong about the fact that 2019 was higher than 2020 which was higher than 2021
which is higher than 2022 I'm very confident that there is a progressive decline in well
performance over the last four or five years now the in the Permian in the well in the Permian and
the Eagle Ford in the Bakken they're all doing the same thing and and the and and what I'm what I'm
reasonably confident but less confident in is that the the most recent data the 2023 data
is following that same decline trend and that's what'll be 50% of 2019 if I'm wrong
and I have to revert and say well actually you know I'm only confident back to 2022
then I'm going to say oh okay so the decline instead of being 15% is 38% or something it's
still pretty it's still pretty severe but you know so I have to be careful here I don't want to
you know I don't want to overstate the certainty of the very recent data but it but it's looking
it's it's looking like 50% so if we played this podcast to a boardroom of oil executives like
Harold Ham and other uh you know long time us energy e and p experts how much of them would
agree of of what you're laying out here and where might they disagree gee that's a great question
well I mean we've got I mean Harold Ham just recently told Bloomberg or somebody that we
really need to start thinking about what he called tier three reservoir which is you know he called it
the really rough rock Scott Sheffield who is the CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources which just sold
itself to Exxon he said the Permian is going to peak in five years and he said that several months
ago so my my sense is is that if if those boardroom doors were closed tight and there was no press in
the room my sense is is that Scott Sheffield and Harold Ham would say yeah we pretty much agree with
you I don't know that of course but they wouldn't they wouldn't say that publicly
I know that you uh your analysis working on this the last month or so because we've been talking
about it is kind of a backward backward looking you're looking at the EURs and the well productivity
in the last decade or so in these regions but could you hazard a guess where that 13 million
uh um production might be in five years or 10 years or 20 years
yeah well um the future is tough but my my of course there's there's above ground reasons and
and you know the the the geology and the oil situation is its own thing let's for the moment
leave out Saudi Arabia and Iran and war and credit and financial issues just on a depletion
geology a standpoint well but there there is another factor that doesn't have anything to do with
geopolitics and that's money capital and and I've already set the stage for this that I mean I sat
next to uh you know to a uh a mezzanine banker uh you were in the same room back in January down
in the Bahamas and he kept leaning over to me and saying yeah nobody will lend these guys any
money nobody wants to lend the oil companies any money um and and that so so the so the geology
is one thing but it takes capital to drill the wells and if we're if we start to see
the kind of thing that I anticipate and I'll answer your question in just a second that that
the production starts to decline then the next question is where are we going to get the money
to do it and the question that comes after that is how long will this take to correct
and we don't know where we're going to get the money to do it right now but I just told you that
there's like a two-year lag from actual drilling to getting any oil out of the ground well that
assumes that you've already made the decision to drill you've got a rig lined up your leases
are all set to go and you have all your permits in order so so one implication from the sentence
you just uttered is the amplitude of of change in the next decade could be wild because when
we're faced with scarcity and shortages and a recession or worse because oil price is it's
unavailable at the quantity we want it so the price has to go up that's when they send out the rigs
and the investment and we're going to have to wait 18 to 24 months to get a meaningful increase
but that meaningful increase is not going to come from a snap of a finger there's now a cap
that's going to be declining I mean this is this is the real deal the slurping sound is upon us
right and there's uh I mean we the the I imagine that that most of the people that listen to this
podcast you know don't pay daily attention to the oil markets but they're they're probably aware
of the fact that hey you know prices are are lower than a lot of people a lot of producers
would like them to be right now that's why OPEC is about to have a meeting in vienna to figure out
how much to cut so they can get prices back up so oil prices today are you know in the in the low
70s well it wasn't that long ago at the peak of the ukraine invasion that they were 120 dollars
so how does oil price vary between 50 dollars over a relatively short period of time and the
answer is that we're forever in a tug of war between oh my god we need more supply we're
feeling really urgent about supply but oh my god oil prices have reached a level at which it's
slowing down the economy and demand is is therefore weak and then you add in the interest rates that
the federal reserve and other central banks have had to use to get the inflation or try to get
inflation under control which by the way is related to oil price also um and it gets to be a very
heady and complex mix but but the the dichotomy the struggle the fugue if you will is between
how the economy is performing and the demand that results and the urgency of supply which
needs higher price and the two are always in conflict and and and just about the time that
we think we're making progress on getting wells drilled sentiment turns really sour and the
market says oh my god demand is weak you know we got to stop drilling wells and i i know i know
very credible analysts right now who think that oil price is going to stay around 80 dollars
for the next two or three years now that seems difficult for me to accept but that's what they
say so getting back to the can you give us like a a best case medium case and worst case um given
the implications of what you're saying here and i and i'll point out that if you're right about this
the geology all the sudden perhaps becomes the least important aspect because if this is recognized
and the reality unfolds then it it opens up a huge sort of systemic can of worms in the world
it certainly does and and looking at the world um my my best case i i i would be i would be very
surprised if if oil production increases in the next say six months uh or into 2024 my guess is
that it will increase very very slowly and essentially be on a plateau and then start
declining often to the future and by 2040 or 2050 i would not be surprised if production were
20 lower than it is today and i'm not basing that off of you know the kinds of uh peak demand
kinds of concerns that oh we're you know we're all going to be driving electric cars and i i'm not
basing it on that at all i'm basing that on my sense of of a combination of the geology
the the commercially available uh low hanging fruit if you will and there's very little of that
and the finance side the capital side that says okay if we need more oil here's the money let's
go after it i'm i'm very very concerned that that that the second part is not there it's just not
there well one of the reasons it's not there is because of the next question i'm going to ask you
a lot of the followers of this podcast uh which i'm quite proud of um
have a value system beyond the human sphere and they deeply care about the natural world and
the sink capacity of our biosphere in our oceans and they might be listening to you saying this is
good news this is all good news except for what you just said because if we're only down 20 or
30 percent in oil in the next 10 or 20 years we need to be down 100 percent um what do you think
about all that well if you're down 20 on blood oxygen you might be dead that's what i think about
that now i i'm i'm in that camp nate i mean i'm totally in the camp that says that we need to
decrease our consumption of all energy not just fossil fuels but particularly fossil fuels and
we need to do that in order to to stop destroying the ecosystem of the planet from which we get all
our wealth um you know it's it's some of it is is certainly a lot of it is because i i love nature
but on a purely pragmatic basis i mean if we continue to destroy the ecosystem on which the
entire food chain ours included you know if we are destroying it then we are we are going to
destroy our own prosperity our own so-called human flourishing if you will to to use an expression
that that's kind of uh in common use out there that we cannot separate ourselves our our fate our
prosperity from that of the planet but my but the concern that that that i have and i know that you
share is that our entire society's metabolism is based on an oil economy and and and if if we if we
if we stop that supply too quickly then things collapse i mean and and and and that results in
in levels of of of chaos and social and civic disorder governance problems geopolitical strife
that that just makes life almost impossible so the people that want to get off oil i'm with you
a hundred percent in an ideal world i'd like to get off oil too but not at the not at the cost
you know of of having you know the frankenstein mob outside my house wanting to you know to to
to you know to to come in and take everything i have and i don't think anybody wants that
it's it's it's a very difficult balance to to try to uh to try to maintain between being able to
carry on a life that has an equality to it and also not destroying the planet i i don't know
what the answer is my guess is that we're not going to get a lot of choice in how that answer
unfolds we're going to have to live with what happens so you're kind of calling peak oil as
likely 2018 to now plateau with a a decline in it coming in the in the coming years i am
what about shale plays tight oil plays arctic plays you mentioned it briefly on a prior podcast
but could you briefly recap why the u.s. experiment is unlikely to be repeated as a global extension
of of oil supply in in the coming decade sure there there are a lot of overlapping spheres
that have to be considered yeah there's a ton of shale in the world but only marine shale
and this is purely empirical only marine shale has ever worked for a tight oil play
and of that marine shale you know let's just for argument's sake let's say 25 percent of
the shale in the world is is marine shale of that marine shale you know some of it is uncooked
like what we just talked about in colorado in utah so if we take what percent of that marine shale
has been buried deeply enough has experienced enough heat and pressure to generate the petroleum
you know maybe we're talking 25 percent of that now of that how much remains buried at a depth
that has enough pressure to be produced by some means fracking or whatever to the surface and
just for argument's sake let's say 25 per percent of that and of that how much of it is in an area
in which we can actually access and drill that we're not in the middle of you know new york city
or the grand canyon or at 30 000 feet or you know that so there and and then we we layer into that
that very few parts of the world have a a fiscal system in which the owner of the land actually
gets paid for having somebody produce the oil under his land that's a very unique situation
to the united states canada argentina and a handful of other countries in most parts of the
world a rig moves on to your your property and you don't get squat in return and therefore people
say no we're not going to allow that so you take all those overlapping spheres and say well
where is all the overlap occurring and the answer is we've already we've already identified most of
those places they're in north america they're in parts of argentina there are areas in russia
that seem to fit that comparison there are very few places that actually that actually meet all
those overlapping criteria for shale the arctic i mean that's a whole nother that's a whole nother
rabbit hole of of cost and expense and geopolitical conflict and uh you know when i when people say
arctic i'm thinking okay best case scenario uh we might start producing something up there in 25
years um that's a really best case so if you know people who think oh well we're just going to make
it happen no i mean we got territorial disputes between you know between russia the united states
china i mean this is that that's that's so far removed that um it's a future possibility but
it's it's not going to meet our our urgent needs in in any kind of reasonable time period
i know you're not an expert on this and i don't know of any experts on this but how could artificial
intelligence change the story that you've laid out here right and you're you're correct i'm i'm
not an expert on artificial intelligence i i'd like to say that for all the reading i've done i
should be but i'm not because this is a really hard thing to know if you're not on the inside and i'm
not but um artificial intelligence is not going to change the geology of planet earth
um artificial intelligence is most likely to change in a good way or in a in a commercial
way the technology that we use to produce uh the oil and natural gas and you know god knows what
else you know lithium so an even larger straw perhaps yeah larger straw and and ideally you
would think that artificial intelligence would help us make better decisions uh perhaps decisions
you know not to drill wells uh 300 feet apart when our best science tells us it should be a thousand
but we knew that we already knew that and we did it anyway um but but you know so so to me there
the idea that artificial intelligence is is going to find ways of of of of adding new reserves
i'm very skeptical of that because i think maximum power principle and i mean humans are very good
at at at knowing what it is that's useful and how to find it they don't always know how to get it
in a way that makes sense but i think we know an awful lot of that so ai could do a lot for
technology could do a lot for decision making and and i can't begin to say uh how important that is
or is not but um for the the leaps and bounds that i understand that ai is making i still suspect
we're talking about many years before it actually could make a difference in our energy supply now
maybe i'm wrong but my fear is is that people are going to start using it to to find better
ways of fighting wars or displacing humans from factory floors um but but i could be i'm probably
wrong on that well i don't think you're probably wrong you you might be wrong but i i don't disagree
with you so once this is all realized um five years from now we have lower production the
permean is past peak um there's economic crises knowing humans will probably blame all that on
some exogenous factor and not on geology and the fact that we've used a larger straw to take out a
finite resource central to our economic institutions um but on that trajectory i've asked you this
before and i'll ask it again given your new research um does it make sense for ai or some
external body to coordinate the drilling in the oil that we have remaining in this country and in
other countries for them in a more planned way so that we don't cannibalize and we actually
increase the e you are because we're not um taking someone else's pizza as it were uh under the earth
is there a role for for some sort of a coordinated strategy beyond the lots of little pin cushion
dots owned by different corporations well there's always room and and and yeah but i mean what
when was the last time we ever had a coordinated effort uh to meet any of our needs except in
wartime um i'm i'm just not i i'd like to be more optimistic here except that it just doesn't seem
that humans are very good at that and and if if the let's just say that the ai agreed with me
which is that the best forward strategy for humanity in the earth is for humans to use less
energy uh nobody wants to do that well because ai is ai is here but the market gdp in profits is
above it in the hierarchy so at least for now that that's not going to happen what we are we are
we already know that though i mean that's my point yeah i mean and and i know there are lots of
people out there who will disagree with this but um i think they disagree with because of ideology
but i mean i look at the world and you know like you i you know i go around and i give talks and
people say yeah but i mean what's the solution i mean you know you you got to tell us what the
solution is and i say the solution's easy use less energy well they don't like that that's not a
solution to them they want to know well you know can't we use hydrogen isn't nuclear the solution
i mean they they want something that allows us to keep on growing the way that we have that doesn't
cause any fundamental discomfort in their lifestyle and i just don't see that that those things are
compatible that the solution is one that will create considerable not unbearable but considerable
discomfort in our lifestyle and our economic prosperity as you know i agree with that i i
think there are no longer any non radical pathways out of this um and we're going to have to uh use
less but it's the systemic implications of a peak and decline in oil that i am focused on
this has been very enlightening um i want to ask you one final question but do you is there
anything that you would like to summarize and and um you know hit uh a harder tone on on anything
you've outlined today probably not on anything that i've outlined uh we came close to it when you
asked me you know do i think that our political leaders are fighting these wars right now because
they're aware of what you're talking about i i don't know what they're aware of and what they're
not aware of but uh i think anyone who believes that the war in ukraine is about uh territorial
or ideological differences between russia russians and ukrainians uh really needs to uh well probably
needs to listen to helen thompson's podcast that you did a little while ago anyone who thinks that
what's going on between israel and and hamas right now is some secular issue that you know that that
ultimately revolves around forming a you know a two-state solution in israel uh i i think you
know really needs to study well listen to helen again but you know study the history of of the
middle east and how it's fit into the geopolitics of the world uh since at least the beginning of
the 20th century it's all about resources and energy all these wars ultimately are well well
just to put a fine point on that we're talking about decline of us production uh because of what
you've outlined and discovered on the permean uh well productivity a reminder that two-third uh
half to two-thirds of the world's remaining oil reserves are within six seven hundred miles of
of israel yeah like so there's a reason that we're over there there has and and and and us foreign
policy has always been focused on the middle east as has the foreign policy of the united kingdom
and france and russia and i mean germany i mean this is this is not known to to everyone but uh
you know look at history and and and you will you will see it very clearly um it's not lost on anyone
so you sent me um uh supporting slides for this conversation which we will share uh as we always
do in the in the show notes on the main site the great simplification dot com on our last podcast
i asked you what you would like to come back on the show and discuss and i believed you said
you want to talk about renewable energy energy properties energy density nuclear and how
um those are not going to replace the energy quality of oil and gas is that still what you
would like to do on our next conversation this was a little research thing that you just came upon
with kerry king and so i wanted to give you a podium to highlight this but what would you
like to talk about next time now absolutely and and and not not from the perspective of oh
renewables are no good and we need to you know we need to no it's not it's not that at all i think
i i think that renewables uh nuclear all these things are are certainly they are part of the
energy landscape and they will be an increasing part going forward but i i really would like
a platform to explain why a lot of the popular conceptions about what they can do are going to
be hugely disappointing we cannot run this civilization on on on renewable energy and
and i think that's that's important to understand because we either then have to say well we're
going to have to continue with fossil fuels or we're going to have to change the kind of
civilization that we live in one or the other maybe there's a third option i'm not considering
yep uh i look forward to that conversation it will be after your trip and after my taking
january off from recording so february march we will have you back and continue to be uh energy
