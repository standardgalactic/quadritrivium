part of the united states but is part of the 50 united states it looks like it's unless it's a
spandrel of your graphic technique it it looks like it's approaching zero well it is and this is
not this is not an incremental chart this is you know these are actual values and so the
Alaska production despite the best efforts of of the the companies that produce that oil on the
north slope and the Alaska state government are are struggling to even keep the the pipeline that
brings it from the north part of Alaska down to where it can be marketed I mean that that pipeline
is is is going dry they've simply you know they they've largely depleted the the supply now companies
are up there drilling and it's not like it's gone to zero but you know a company can make money but
it's not contributing a lot to to the overall us supply okay and then stripping out the red section
which is the tide oil which I'll get to in a second the rest of it the conventional the
alaskan the offshore are all looking a lot like cantorail or something that I mean the whole
the whole amount is is in decline and and seemingly accelerating that's certainly that's
that's what the data says yes exactly right so how much of our oil in the united states
that we extract is tide oil versus the rest roughly 70 percent 70 percent is tide oil
yes and so what's what do we drill next after tide oil no one knows Nate that's I mean but
this is where we were in in 2005 before the tide oil came on the scene it's like okay what are we
gonna do next and the answer up until that time had been well let's go explore elsewhere in the
world let's you know let's drill wells off offshore brazil or off of west africa or let's
you know try to find some new frontier areas in the the onshore basins of africa and at this
moment I mean we never know you know what what's still out there but it it it seems as though
we've we've we pretty much know what's commercially available and what's not and the answer is we
don't know we don't know where where we're gonna go it are there more tide oil plays well you know
somewhere in the world there are and and they're being they're being worked on and developed but
in the united states you know we've pretty much tried all of them I mean there was a big
flurry of you know let's try every tide oil play and shale gas play that we can imagine
this was back in 2010 through 15 and most of them prove not to be very commercial and so we're kind
of down to the the three the three shale oil plays the permy in the bock and in the eagle
ford that worked and of those three two of them are are pretty much in decline and the
permean still growing slowly but your analysis of the permean well performance suggests that the
permean two is about to peak and decline the average well performance is has peaked and declined
but it's being held up by extra exceptionally high rates and the large number of wells that
have already been drilled we're making up making up for it on volume that's exactly right that's
what we're doing and so I'm not I'm not saying that that we should you know the people should be
looking for the permean basin to to roll over and and and decline in the next three months six
months nine months twelve months is certainly possible but it's not that simple I mean there's
there's you know there's 40 or 50 000 tight oil wells out there and and and there's a there's a
considerable lag between drilling bringing them online and actually having them build to you
know to some respectable level of a couple of years so you know there's there's an error there's
there's a window in which we don't quite know what's coming next but we do know that the average
well performance in terms of what it'll make over its lifetime is lower so so staying on
slide two then looking at the red which is the tight oil there was a peak which I guess was
2019 before COVID or something and then we had a decline and then a new peak just recently is that
correct right so that that that first peak was just as COVID began so again there's a lag
all of the production in the United States the well yeah for for several weeks I mean almost
all of it got shut in because there was simply no place to store the oil I remember I remember
and and but but it took a while you know for that you know to show itself in on this scale
but then after COVID in uh 2021 and 2022 money came back in there was storage that was freed up
and and it's it's pretty well built since then but again the build has been in the Permian the
Bakken and the Eagle Ford and there's a couple of other less important plays the Niobarara and the
Woodford etc you know those are sort of baseload those are those are just kind of flatlining
so this is mainly mainly Permian base in west Texas and and southeastern New Mexico
that have accounted for this increase recent increase and and looking at the graph without
understanding everything you just said if this were a stock price and not a a measure of geological
provinces stacked together one would say all time hi we're gonna off to the races it's a buy
yeah exactly yeah we're we're going to the moon right however and I learned this from you the
tidal oil the shale oil shale where it is is where all the other oil migrated from it is the source
rock there's nothing left after that except perhaps oil shale which is not fully cooked
can you comment on that right so there we've known about what's called oil shale for
I don't know 100 years at least this is these are source rocks that are a lot of them at the surface
in places in Colorado and Utah mainly and so these are I mean these are rocks that if you
walk up near them you'll smell the oil you know you hit them with a hammer and there's oil that's
that's you know they're saturated you know to to some extent with the oil but as you said
they haven't been buried deeply enough they haven't they haven't been cooked they haven't been in the
kitchen long enough so they're they're immature source rocks for the most part and what has to
happen is for us to use it and there were great schemes back in the 1970s you know to mine the
stuff and heat it you know cook it in in giant ovens or you know to even you know use nuclear
energy to somehow heat it up to you know to try to hasten the the the thermal maturation process
there are obvious environmental problems that got in the way and despite several false starts I mean
you know that that's not going anywhere as far as I know but if you had to bet and U.S. oil
production declines as you are inferring and we're going to get to some projections on that
would you guess that well we could we could either find other tight oil plays in addition to the
Permian and the Eagleford are there any of those and and if not are we gonna try to do
oil shale wow so as I said a little while ago I I think we've we've pretty much sampled
all the the tight oil plays and shale gas plays in the United States including places like Alaska
and at some price some very much higher oil price some of them may actually
become commercial but none of them were were successful there are deeper horizons within
the you know the Bakken and and and the Permian that certainly I mean I would go too long before
I tried to artificially cook the oil shales of Colorado and Utah again the environmental concerns
out there just overwhelming okay so back to this graphic I remember when I asked you to make this it
was four years ago because the U.S. had just peaked and we were talking about global oil peak
so the U.S. just made a new peak of around 13 million barrels and we still consume what 2021
well that yeah that's that's refined products so there's right you know we're comparing
apples and oranges a little bit but yeah right this this is crude oil and 20 is is gasoline
jet fuel kerosene et cetera right but it has the world made a new peak because I think the world
peak of all liquids to my knowledge is still fourth quarter of 2018 yes and and so we are
we are still a couple of million barrels a day below that as of the the latest data that I have
is is may of 2023 we can we can project that forward and say well you know we're on track to
beat that peak too but you know we'll see about that except if if the U.S. is imminently peaking
because of the well performance issue that you just outlined and the Permian the U.S. has long
ago peaked if you exclude the Permian actually maybe you you sent me a graph on that would you
like to describe graph number three yeah number three shows four things the blue is all U.S. crude
oil and condensate production including the November 2023 13.1 million barrels a day which is
will be a little bit lower just below 13 million the EIA says in December then the the orange line
is all the tight oil that's about nine million barrels a day a lot of it and so you know that's
that's where the the 70 percent comes from nine out of 13 okay yeah and then the next line down
the red is Permian so six of that nine is six of that nine comes from just one of the shale
oil regions it's the granddaddy it's the big one yeah it is and then the gray line at the bottom
is that that orange tight oil minus the Permian so it's a little bit less than three million barrels
a day but back to where we were a bit ago on on on the first graph this just shows how incredibly
dependent the United States is on on tight oil and the Permian in particular and the world though
too right didn't you say that the majority of oil production increase in the last 13 years is
just from this red sliver here right and and there there there's a there's a graph that shows that
as well and I think that's our slide five and so on on this graph I'm showing world conventional
in green deep water and oil sands and other you know kinds of dribs and drabs of less conventional
supply in orange and then the tight oil is in blue and and you can you know just in your mind
draw a flat line across there starting you know back in 2005 or 10 at the very most and see that
all the other oil in the world except for tight oil has at best been flat and so all of the growth
in world supply has been the blue since at least 2010 and and and someone might say well it's only
you know seven or eight million barrels a day how important is that and the answer is it makes
all the difference in the world I mean that's you know that's because I mean even one million
barrels a day of deficit in supply is enough to drive oil prices up to a hundred and twenty
dollars a barrel I mean that's what OPEC has been doing here for the last couple of years they've
been withholding oil to try to keep the price up so the the we use so much oil to keep the world
running to keep our our factories and machines and houses and I mean everything we do relies on oil
and so we're if we're down one percent we're screwed I don't think a lot of people understand
that and I think when we talk about oil peaking and and real simply peak oil means that we're
dependent on a finite resource that has incredible energy density and work potential
that replaces what humans used to do manually and it will one day hit a maximum and then decline
that is a given but when we talk about that we're not running there there's two implications I think
and I'll ask for you to chime in one is we're going to have to figure out in coming decades and
century what we're going to do when we have 80 percent as much oil 60 percent as much oil 40
percent as much oil 10 percent as much oil down into the future that is an important question
that society really if we had wisdom and foresight would be addressing but the second
which is more of the focus of the my work with this podcast and my organization is
once we stop growing and start declining that calls into motion all sorts of
deltas differentials between society and finance and government expectations
of what extrapolating the past forward to a reality so there's a there's a what do we do
about our financial claims once energy especially oil starts to decline that's a separate question
and one with with hugely important consequences how do we fight our wars
you know we use an awful lot of a lot of a lot of oil just to to move all that equipment around
but you know about you said that oil is hemoglobin think about it as oxygen okay think about if
if you're if a person's oxygen saturation dropped five percent what would happen I mean it's only
five percent right but I mean very likely you would have you might collapse you would certainly
have to sit down you'd be like I mean you couldn't function with a couple of percent less oxygen
saturation in your blood and that that would be the effect of of losing just a couple of percent
of oil supply for for the for the world's metabolism let me put you on the spot here
you mentioned war is it possible that the powers that be actually understand everything that you've
presented today and this may be one of the reasons that the United States is aggressive in Ukraine
and Russia and the Middle East etc because now is the time when we do have an abundance
quote unquote as we're looking at production but underneath that is the well performance which
is in decline and that implies a much different next decade the military is always extraordinarily
mindful of and sensitive to their energy and oil supply much more if if if politicians and the
State Department had the same perspective as the military we would not be in the situation we're
in today because they know what it takes to run an army and it takes the hell of a lot of oil I mean
one of the reasons that the United States that Franklin Roosevelt made a bargain with the king
of Saudi Arabia in 1945 was because he believed he knew that one of the main reasons the United
States was victorious over Germany and Japan was that the United States and its allies had
better access to oil I mean period you can't run an army all those jeeps and all those supply
lines and all those tanks you can't run an army without oil and so he at a time when the United
States was the Saudi Arabia it was the OPEC plus of the world in 1945 Roosevelt was he talked to
the king of Saudi Arabia on his way back from Yalta you know he just got done dividing up the
world between Churchill and Stalin and and oil was so much on his mind that that he had a meeting
with the king in the Red Sea in the Suez Canal to talk about how Saudi Arabia could help us and
we could help them and of course in 1945 I mean Saudi Arabia was just you know it wasn't on everybody's
mind it was a relatively new kingdom and I think it had founded in 1932 or something like that so
he was you know he was way ahead because he was listening to his military guys he just
got done fighting a big war so he was attuned to the military perspective on energy and oil
so I'm gonna get back to the global perspective in a second but let's um let's drill down on
on your findings so you've basically with your analysis you did for Kerry King
showed that the Perwell EUR estimated ultimate recovery in the Permian has dropped by like
50% in the last few years is that correct yep that's sadly correct and and other than we drilled
the best first and now we're going after other ones what what can explain why that happened
it's a very good question Nate and one that I have struggled with um and my most likely explanation
is that we've over drilled it that we have drilled our wells too close together and so what's happening
is is that the wells are cannibalizing one another's production that they have a there's a radius away
from each individual well to which or through which oil will naturally flow to the lower potential
energy in the wellbore and if you drill another well within that drainage radius of that of the
first well both wells are going to go on producing but they're going to be they're going to be
cannibalizing each other's supply and so both wells will end up producing less in their lifetime
if that makes sense to you it makes sense like when I was eating a pizza with my brother
sort of same sort of situation exactly but but let me ask you this are those competing wells
drilled by the same company or are they sometimes different companies even that have
different leases that are adjoining in the past you know back in the in the days of the you know
the the black and white movies you know the the gushers and all of that everybody was drilling
trying to you know steal his neighbor's oil but today it's not the case I mean very often more
often than not it's the same company you know that's drilling these kind of pitchfork patterns
of wells that are all coming off of of the same drilling pad and and why are they doing that well
you know they're the answer is I don't know but the maximum power principle well yeah let's get
as much out as we can right now but I remember back you know five six seven years ago reading
society a petroleum engineer papers in which they had analyzed all sorts of great new technologies
micro seismic data to and they were saying look you know we can't have these horizontal wells
much closer than seven eight nine hundred feet apart because if we do they're going to cannibalize
each other's production or interfere with each other's production now in the permean basin
we've gotten a whole lot closer than that and and the permean has because it's such a monster
of productivity has rewritten a lot of the rules about what works but I my my sense is
that we we've gone too far I can't say that categorically but that's my most likely explanation
so to simplify it to help me understand it let's say that a company or two companies
have two adjoining properties property one and property two and they look at all the seismic
and the mapping and both of them say we're going to get 10 units of oil out of here
and so they build all their expectations on that but then what happens is they drill them both
at the same time and because underneath the ground that oil is liquid and and flowing and
permeable that they actually neither one of them gets 10 they might get nine and eight respectively
because the the two plots are right next to each other is it something like that
it's actually worse than that what it what it is is that these companies if you have a square
mile of land one mile by one mile on the surface they will plan to drill six seven eight wells
the same company in that square mile all from the same surface location and that you know and it
looks like a rake the the you know the the map of the of the horizontal wells underground looks
like a rake okay it's got all these these times coming off of it and so they they know ahead of
time that they're going to drill at least a you know half a dozen or more wells that are going to
end up being much closer to each other than the thousand feet apart because they're because they're
