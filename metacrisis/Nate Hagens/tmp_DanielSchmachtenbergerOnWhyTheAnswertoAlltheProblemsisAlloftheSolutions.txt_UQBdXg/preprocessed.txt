people can get uh fundamentalist about their particular solution because if you're working on
something you should really care about it but in really caring about it you can become overly
narrowly focused so when I was first starting to try to wrap my head around like what is upstream
from all of these various problems or what are the underlying causes that everything from
nuclear war to environmental degradation to animal rights issues to class issues what do
these things have in common what do not a specific solution for one thing but a solution
for civilization doing better look like I of course read the work of people and also had the
fortune to talk to a lot of people that it's been their life thinking about these things and work
on them and would ask their analysis and I got so many answers that sounded like this
you know at the end of the day whenever somebody uses a phrase like that at the end of the day
or the key is you can usually expect a reductionist thing to come next um not always but you like
you know sometimes you want to pay attention to that at the end of the day uh really the thing
we have to shift is the economy because perverse economic incentive is under the whole thing
there's no way that as long as you have a for-profit military industrial complex as the
largest block of a global economy that you could ever have peace there's a anti-incentive on it
as long as there's so much money to be made with mining etc like we have to fix the nature of
economic incentive and I'd be nodding I'm like this makes perfect sense right and then somebody
else would be like you know the core of the thing that we have to address is education
because you can have so much change occur in a generation if those children are growing up
different as as different as it is learning Chinese as your first language versus learning
English we're so neuroplastic by the time we're adults we're not that neuroplastic we're kind of
screwed if you get education right we want adults who care about the animals and the oceans and
the can tend to all of these things and can think complexly if we really get education right we'll
be able to solve everything it's upstream from all that and like I'm nodding I'm like oh yeah this
is it and then somebody else would be like no really the thing is it's about media because
we're continuously being bombarded and that was before social media then it was social media
we're being continuously bombarded and we are ready to go do a capital riot or a George Floyd
protester riot or whatever it is based on the stuff that's coming in if we could change the media
environment of what people were in taking it would change all of these things and someone else like
none the thing is really at the end of the day it's about government and law and how do we get
that right because the economic incentive wouldn't be that same issue if we could govern it properly
if we could force the internalization of the price of carbon and get carbon pricing properly
and get costs of everything proper all that would be fixed but we have to do that through law so
how do we fix governance and law and then somebody else would be like you can't because law is written
by lobbyists that get paid for by somebody and wherever the economic motive is is what's going
to pay for that which is why you you have to think about economics and law together so the key is
political economy and how do you get that so and on and on people would say no really the key is
actually parenting what we've really got to do is restore the family because before education by the
time that kid goes to school at five or six that so much of their identity and psyche and value system
is already set it happens early on we have to actually change the entire culture to have parenting
emphasize raising better kids from the beginning and what I came to learn is they were all right
right somebody else would be everything you're saying is so anthropocentric the key is the
fucking environment because we're none of us or anything without the environment like you have
to prioritize that everything else doesn't matter that much and what is an economy like
we can breathe without money we can't breathe without air and so be less anthropocentric and
focus on the integrity of the environment because that's upstream from everything and so what I
learned was the answer to all of the problems is all of the solutions
there is not a series of chains there's an ecology of series of change it's
so often someone says what is the solution it sounds like someone's saying like
what species is the forest like I don't know what you're even asking like a forest is lots of
species lots and lots and if it's an old growth forest it's even more complexly interacting
so what is the solution there's not a solution there's lots of things that need to happen so
if anything I want patterns of how to think about it and I want frameworks for how to think about it
and I don't want people to attach to those frameworks because they'll be useful but also
limiting and to realize the cultural aspects do involve education and media and parenting
and religion and lots of other things and the structure of cities and you know and the
political economy aspects and well lots of things and so and the getting past the
zealotus and reductionist focus and being able to get how do all these things come together
is key to understanding properly
