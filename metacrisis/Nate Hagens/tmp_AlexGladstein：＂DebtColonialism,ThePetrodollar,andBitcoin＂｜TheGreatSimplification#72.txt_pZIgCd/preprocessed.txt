today i'm joined by the chief strategy officer of the human rights foundation alex gladstein
this conversation is jam packed we just scratched the surface of these highly relevant topics
and it was still the longest podcast i've ever done we covered topics from freedom of information
debt as a tool to uphold despotic leaders the origin of the petrodollar monetary colonialism
and eventually bitcoin alex also serves as the vice president of the first strategy of the oslo
freedom forum and has connected hundreds of global dissidents in civil society groups with
business leaders technologists philanthropist journalists and artists with the objective
of promoting free and open societies i learned quite a lot on this podcast on things that i
kind of thought i knew especially from the perspective of the global south geopolitics
and the monetary and not resource prosperity of the west i expect alex to be back on this
program we have a lot to talk about i hope you can listen to this it's long listen to it in pieces
it's jam packed please welcome alex gladstein
alex gladstein good to see you great to see you excited i've seen you i've seen you before
but i didn't know who you were at the time briefly i was happy to come down for one of your lectures
at stanford i i live in the area and um i was excited to see someone whose work inspired me
and made me think so thanks for the work you do well uh thank you for the work you do which i've
learned a little bit about and that's uh gonna be what we discussed today um i think we have a
lot to cover this uh may not be a balaji tim ferris eight hour podcast but it's it might be a long
one i hope to cover human rights which is your main expertise monetary privilege which is a new
concept to me even though now that i've read and thought about it it makes total sense and ultimately
bitcoin um and how that relates to those other two uh topics so maybe we just start with your
background what is it that you do alex and and how did you arrive at this place
yeah so for 15 years since 2007 i've worked for the human rights foundation which is a
nonprofit based in new york founded by former political prisoners and people whose families
were imprisoned for their ideas uh from around the world the organization was founded with a mandate
to focus on authoritarian regimes so by our standards that's about 4.3 billion people in
today's world in 95 countries who don't have the same kind of checks on government power that we
might have in the united states or japan or germany so that's half the countries in the world and
half the population plus or minus 53 of the world's population lives in a place that doesn't have
you know free speech property rights uh the ability to have free and fair elections etc
yeah so i the point being that i did a lot of things through my career i started as
essentially a student um with an internship my first summer job was to help get outside
information to the cuban underground library movement before they had internet in kuba uh
so i helped my latin american colleagues who were able to freely travel there bring all kinds of like
outside movies and and information in and people would go in their homes and share them it was
extremely kind of soviet uh soviet vibes but it made a big difference actually before the regime
finally uh crumb you know sort of crumbled and and acknowledged that they'd have to bring in
internet so that was my first experience in the with the job this is a real real naive question
and i may be interrupting you because i don't know a lot about this and i should but in those
authoritarian countries do they have access to like youtube videos well this was back in 2007
when the cuban people didn't have internet like the only way you could get internet really was
by going to like a western embassy and it was like tightly monitored expensive these days
most people have internet access in some way shape or form or or they can go somewhere with
internet access um but like the point being that through my career i did a lot of work with people
who had a lot of problems accessing information due to their government i spent a lot of time on
our north korea program which helps refugees who've escaped from north korea send information back in
that country is still probably the most closed off society in the world and people have been using
information technology to bridge that gap for 20 years now first with dvds then with usb sticks now
with uh smartphones and sd cards and even some sort of satellite type internet and i think with
the rise of starlink you're looking at a decade here where you know eventually the the internet
kind of saturates almost everybody on the planet well given uh and i want to let you get back to
answering my question on on what you're doing and what the human rights foundation is but how
how central is information to people's lives i mean you take it for granted that we can access
the collective information of the history of our species on google here in the united states but
in these authoritarian countries etc how important is it to access information for people in their
everyday lives well i i think for all the work that we do whether we are in business and energy
and environment and working for labor rights uh just building communities access to information
is essential but not only is it essential to prevent uh disaster and social uh basically
deterioration i'm marcia sen wrote about this how how lack of information can cause famine right
that's something he he won awards for uh for his work on this and i think it's it's quite true he
was looking at famines basically in india and in china and at the end of the day it's it's um
much more difficult to have a famine or to have a collapse in food supply in an open society
where people can share information and aren't living in fear there's the famous sort of
town square test like can you go to your town square and just criticize the government without
fear right so that's the difference between a fear society and a free society so this this was
kind of the environment that i um let's say grew up in working in this environment meeting
dissidents from around the world who didn't have the same privileges i did uh information
and technology was a really important part of that but so we're just basic basic basic concepts
basic civil liberty stuff free again free speech property rights uh freedom to believe
in what you want to believe in freedom to associate um and freedom from torture and and
from arbitrary detainment so so these kind of really basic civil liberties are things that
everybody strives for uh i've found that out by meeting people in every possible society culture
that this is not like a west it is not a western thing to not want to be tortured or to not want
to like speak your mind like these are these universal constructs um i i think there's nuance
to that but but at the root it's it's entirely true and and i spent my career looking at how
technology impacts that can help that or can hinder that when you were much younger like
high school or early college were you aspiring to be a a business major or a systems biologist or
something or did you have an experience as a young man that that made the things you're talking about
now uh very important and passionate to you yeah i was really interested in math and physics i
went to school for engineering actually but the uh big events in my life that shaped me where i was
kind of like the 9-11 generation so i i lived nearby new york city 9-11 happened when i was
10th grade um had a big impact on me the iraq war had a huge impact on me i was a junior senior in
high school watching that whole debate unfold and then going to college in the 04 to 08 period of time
during the early years of the iraq war when the protests were really alive during the surge all
of that um that really colored my view and and made me move into looking at international relations
and away from engineering and i just thought it was very important and i got fortunate enough to
get an internship at the human rights foundation in 2007 so i had a job going into the great financial
crisis which was which was really nice um and i stayed there uh i had opportunities to pursue
scholarship but i i decided to stay and i think that was a great decision i totally respect
scholarship but i obviously it's a very inward looking thing for for many years at the beginning
of your career at least and i feel like i've had an opportunity to like just learn from so many
people through the work we do you know beyond programs at href that are direct support for
people under authoritarian regimes we do a lot of gatherings so we have this thing called the
oslo freedom forum this is the 15th anniversary of it actually this year in june norway and it brings
together activists and dissidents and puts them on stage and has all the influential people in
the audience so we tried to sort of flip the davos model in davos it's like the powerful people are
on stage and the activists are prevented from accessing and they're protesting outside in the
freezing weather that's normally how it goes so we were like let's actually flip that let's put
the dissidents and troublemakers on the stage and let's let's have the billionaires and the
philanthropists and the influencers sit in the audience and listen so that's kind of the goal
we've had and and it's similar to the human rights foundation it's always had this focus on on
dictatorship um and on how can we just help people expand their own freedom i mean the main thing that
i learned as a as a in the iraq war generation is that freedom cannot be imposed it should not
be imposed it has to come from within and that's all these folks that we work for asking for i mean
i i have a really really good friend his name is vladimir karamurza he's a really famous russian
activist he just received a sentence this week of 25 years in prison he was outside of russia he went
back into russia to protest against putin's war and now he's going to be in prison for decades and
you know he'll be another soul senetsan i really do think so the guy's so eloquent powerful and brave
and what he always would say is that he said russians will bring democracy to russia stay out
of it uh but the least you can do is stop treating putin like like a legitimate world leader that
that's what his advice was to us like stop having dinners with him at the white house and and and
stop treating him and his cronies you know like anybody else so he was he was sort of calling
for us to just stop helping but i think the activist community i've met has taught taught me
very um deeply that again this freedom democracy stuff it can't be imposed it's got to be grassroots
and i've just seen evidence of that over and over and over again and and that's another
thing that's driven my interest in technology and open source code especially is that communities
form around this stuff everywhere in the darkest places in the world and we can help without being
kind of whatever imperialistic about it like we can just contribute to what they're doing
and help them on their own terms and that's kind of the philosophy that i think ahrefs had and that
i've had i have so many questions so you started at uh as an intern and now in 2023 you are the
chief strategy officer for human rights foundation at a time when in the global poly crisis with
energy depletion with climate change with a big geopolitical war with uh dollar hegemony at risk
with all these other things human rights are about to be a major issue in in coming years and decades
so how do you even strategize as the chief of strategy for such an organization with such a
large potential um quiver of of arrows of of needs yeah so we have my day job and then we
have my personal interest so what's important to understand about the day job and the human
rights foundation is that human rights is an industry and it has a certain amount of funding
and nearly all that funding comes from the west it comes from europe and united states mainly the
us so the grants that are given out globally for human rights work come from a small group of people
who are pretty homogeneous and um they understandably empathetic like i understand this that they
like to invest in their own backyard which makes sense if you're american you want to see an
improvement of human rights in the united states if you're in france you want to see an improvement
of human rights in france i have no issue with this but the outcome of this is that something like
90 of all the money spent on human rights work in the world gets spent in the west um so you have
kind of this like self-enforcing kind of feedback loop happening where if you are like a chinese
dissident or a group working in china there's no money for you you have no money i mean maybe you
get five ten thousand dollars here or there but you're scraping by and i mean if you're in a lesser
known dictatorship forget about it laos uh um you know you're living in madagascar you're living
in togo i mean there's there's just so little funding or resources for your struggle um so that's
why we do what we do is we find that people who live in authoritarian regimes have just have less
resources it's not necessarily a moral statement about uh democracies being better i've seen democratic
governments do the worst things i mean the invasion of iraq's a great example it's more
about the architecture like as an american i can start an organization i can i can donate to the
eff i can sue the u.s government i can't we can hold our leaders accountable relatively speaking
there's 80 000 non-profits in the united states we can leak stuff we can change the course of history
now that of course that gets tested look at wiki leaks but the point is it's possible
you live in saudi arabia no like you it's starting starting and a human rights group is illegal
some cases you can quite literally get your head cut off so i think this is the key distinction
that i try to walk is understanding a how fortunate i am but b how much more we can improve
as democracies and i the money piece really woke up my senses to the ladder like how how
exploitative we've actually been globally and how much we are responsible for a lot of these
dictators i didn't quite understand that until i learned about the global monetary system
so uh let's let's move on to that um you wrote a book uh called check your financial privilege
from last year in your book you begin by stating that anyone born into a country with a reserve
currency like the euro the yen the pound or the dollar has a financial privilege relative to 90
percent of the world population born into weaker systems can can you expand on that and and carry
on with what you were just saying we often hear about check your privilege right it's in a variety
of contexts i think that people need to check their financial privilege that's the point of the book
i would i realized as i checked my own privilege as i learned about it is that very few people on
earth have the benefits we have is let's just as speaking as i guess two americans here um
about a billion people live in a liberal democracy that has property rights and a reserve currency
meaning that their governments can essentially print money to buy things abroad like oil or
industrial materials etc um and that allows them to have cushy kind of social programs
this is this is one aspect obviously what we'll get i'm sure at some point into how this ties into
fossils and access to fossils as well but but the point is that only about a billion people
live in societies where the their government has a currency that's strong enough where
they can literally just print it and buy stuff now the u.s is the is the uh obviously key example
of this the biggest example we live in the world's first debt empire um never before has there been
a world empire that's been a a debtor empire every other empire before the u.s was a creditor empire
it it owned stuff it had a lot of assets the united states biggest export is is debt um and it's
just unique we've never seen this before and it definitely coincides with the transition of the
global monetary system from being based being tied on to gold something that's in the physical world
something that's scarce to not being tied in gold anymore to being tied to what we call fiat
money which is issued by decree so you can kind of see this map out and this is what i spend a
lot of time looking at but the point being that in this day and age there are a handful of nations
that can that can sort of print these claims and buy things like oil and then everybody else can't
so you have the other whatever six seven billion people and we're talking pre 2022 here pre the
putin invasion of ukraine which which we'll get to which has changed a lot of things i think and
set a lot of things in motion but when you had breton woods and like breton woods too kind of
these systems we were very fortunate and this allowed our countries to to basically subsidize
a lot of things in our societies and our think about the financial technology that we have like
it's just so easy for most americans and europeans to send money to each other to spend money abroad
to use dollars in africa or latin america people are happy to take them to access capital markets
to invest in stocks to you know hedge with all kinds of things you know the vast majority of
the world's population has no access to that their local fiat currency sucks that their best
bet at a savings technology is usually sheet metal or cattle i'm talking for the majority of the
world's population they can't teleport money to anybody on earth on demand and they live a very
different life and and i think that i just didn't really quite grasp that until i took a look at it
more closely so there's really two two layers here of of financial privilege one is the the
salaries and gdp per capita and income that is the product of living in the global west
on the backs of energy surplus there's the actual wealth and income inequality issue
but the second is in parallel living in a country that has its own reserve currency which makes
access and commerce and money moving and all those things like seamless and easy and and we
take it for granted yeah and again the us and the eu until recently had done a pretty good job
on inflation for a long time and and you know people you can't really remember i mean you have
to go back to the 70s to obviously write that you're i'm sure your listeners commiserate i mean
it's unprecedented what we're seeing now two years ago tons of people were telling me
inflation is impossible inflation is impossible in western society like this is literally what i
think the economic orthodoxy thought and i guess what they weren't humble enough like they didn't
understand that it could happen here too and i think it has happened here too and i think our
financial privileges is temporary it comes in waves and by looking at what happened in the 70s
i think i think we can learn a lot you know one thing that i thought was fascinating taking a page
from leftist scholars and marxist scholars is that there's a lot of things you can say about
just briefly going back to great depression and why the western world had this huge economic crisis
and obviously there's a debate between the the kensians and the austrians about well is it because
we left the gold standard or did we we not leave it soon enough etc etc right there's a third argument
though advanced by uh the authors of this book called capital and imperialism which is a terrific
book i don't necessarily agree with the conclusions but it's it's a really really interesting read
on history and they quite simply argue that a lot of the crisis that the western world faced at the
end of the 20s and 30s was because the british empire was collapsing and you had the like center
of the western financial system lose access to cheap labor and goods that it had been accustomed
to having for hundreds of plus years this just makes so much sense to me so that's like step one
step two is when the access to fossils themselves decolon you had decolonialization there right
so you had oil access which was traditionally managed by western powers at least for several
decades when oil first became a thing western companies seven sisters all that and then you had
like the opac nations actually take control you had the power shift um and guess what that led to
massive inflation in the west right so when we couldn't exploit the oil the energy uh for cheaper
than the market value um no any longer we we lost the ability to subsidize our nations and to
subsidize our currencies so i think this starts to map you start to see this happen every time we
pull like the west pulls back from power over the rest of the world we have economic crises
and this is so obvious in the 70s to me like literally like you you know right as opac start
to come into its own they decide to raise the price of oil the us goes into an inflationary
spiral makes an s to go off the gold standard it set everything else in motion so i've been
fascinated by looking at this and also by looking at the reverse what the us does impacts everybody
else so we hear a lot about the fed mandate right um the fed has a mandate low employment to keep you
know to keep inflation and check these things what people don't realize is what's not in the fed's
mandate is the livelihood of everybody else in the world so both in the early 80s and and last year
when the fed raised interest rates really fast um politically right for to to quell a domestic
issue at home in both cases we had inflation out of control right so the fed says okay we're
going to jack interest rates really fast this absolutely crushes the global south absolutely
crushes so in the 80s you had the third world debt crisis which caused the suffering of tens
of millions of people an uncountable number of deaths from starvation lack of nutrition etc
child mental nutrition and now you're seeing it again in the last 18 months you're seeing both
economic and political collapse all across the global south currencies collapsing the imf having
to come in and bail out countries the government's being toppled so i think what i've been really
interested in is is looking at both how economic stability and our comfort and our quality of life
our way of life in the west it relies on like resources elsewhere and then also looking at
how our decisions about how to retain stability and comfort and reduce inflation for for for
the average person um hurts other people so it's this really interesting back and forth
that i've been trying to trace out so there's a parallel to uh climate change and the environmental
movement is we don't include the prices of externalities and the price of our things so
we privatize the gains and the the losses are held by the commons and the environment right
it's the same thing in the us is where we're taking the gains from having the global reserve
currency the seniorage from the us dollar being the reserve currency and the benefits of spending
more than we have so we get all this stuff delivered to the united states but not the
responsibility of the financial impact of our monetary decisions on the rest of the world
right well i mean people say it very simply we export inflation right and i the authors of
capital imperialism said something really clear and distinct to me which which makes a lot of sense
old school imperialism or colonialism had had kind of a one main goal and that was to reduce
economic instability and inflation inside our societies by causing wage deflation in the periphery
and by taking cheap goods and labor from that those places and inputting them into our societies
so with super cheap goods and labor and by pressing down on the wages elsewhere
we could raise up the quality of life and make it uh less likely that that there would be mass
protest and overthrow of governments in the west and and that was has been sustained since the age
of colonialism through the international monetary system is is that a byproduct of our decisions
or is that a tacit goal of the decisions it's a really good question i you know it could be one
of these path dependency things it it i highly doubt that like again somebody was in a room and they
like mapped all this out um but it is an outcome of the system and something we don't speak about
and it hardly matters to the victims you know that's kind of the point like yeah if you're a
victim of a structural adjustment policy in the 1980s somewhere in latin america does it
does it matter to you whether the west uh intentionally did it or whether it was a
byproduct of their way of life i don't think it matters right so can you uh explain the mechanics
of why a sharp sudden increase in interest rates by the federal reserve in the united states
who's focusing on domestic inflation domestic issues causes a financial crisis abroad is this
because foreign countries have to use the dollar and they denominate their debt and dollars and so
all of a sudden what they what they owe suddenly spikes in amount yeah so i'll try to just briefly
outline two phenomena which which which lead to this and then i'll explain why the rates
the rise in rates hurts people um basically you have breton woods right you have world war two
you have the us and the allies getting together in new hampshire in a hotel to figure out what
the international monetary system is going to look like um they wanted an international system
canes wanted the bank core this was going to be an internationally managed currency with like
kind of percentage based participation from all the world nations sounds very kumbaya and obviously
you know it didn't happen because the u.s had the most gold because we didn't get wrecked in world
war one um and in the 20s we had a inflow of gold from all these other countries so because we had
the most gold and gold was the ultimate monetary good we got to make the rules so we said no no
bank core everybody's going to use the dollar redeemable at $35 per per ounce of gold meaning
other central banks would collect dollar claims and then they could redeem them for gold at $35
per ounce of gold now bear in mind the u.s government had already made it illegal to hold
gold inside the united states this is what fdr did in the early 30s in order to fund the new deal
was to confiscate the gold from all of america that's how he paid for it um it's something that
i think a lot of people have a political affinity for on the left because they like fdr but if this
happened today in any dictatorship we'd be like screaming about it i mean he he literally took
away like good money from people and replaced it with paper uh it's a kind of an outrage and
it's amazing it doesn't get more discussion these days was was that widespread or just sporadic
around i mean i'm sure there would be gold hidden somewhere that they no one knew about right was
it a really widespread around the nation that happened i mean executive order 6102 you can go
look it up it it um it mainly did not involve like yeah jack booted thugs at people's houses
because all the gold was usually kept at banks and centralized institutions so the government was
able to confiscate the gold the treasury was able to confiscate the gold of the fed by the way so
they took all the feds gold and they replaced it with claims and then they also rounded up all the
gold in regional banks companies etc americans couldn't own own gold again until the 70s until
i think 75 um it was illegal to own gold it was illegal to own gold absolutely look it up executive
order 6102 so first thing the american government did was take away the ability for the for the people
to escape inflation um this is called financial repression so this is what how they funded all
their programs from the 30s to the 70s was in many ways having the uh basically inflation rate
above the the you know the interest rate so if you're like owning us debt you're negative
you're not making money you're losing money um this is this is called financial oppression this is
what's happening right now when you have whatever when you have seven percent uh cpi and the fed
funds rate set like five percent or whatever you get my drift right you're losing some money there
so this was like par for the course for 40 years and and the american government first they took
away the ability for the american people uh to to hedge against that and then in 1971 they took away
the ability of the world to hedge against that so between 44 and 71 you had breton woods one which
was all these other central banks uh used dollars on the premise that they could redeem them for gold
now what happened in the 60s is that after jfk was assassinated you had a huge increase in american
fiscal spending on both the vietnam war and the great society stuff so you had guns and butter so
by the late 60s all these other governments were like america can't they can't like they can't actually
back this up and and the gold was dwindling it was crazy how much the gold our gold reserves
actually reduced uh to the point where in the summer of 71 the french sent a battleship to
new york city to redeem their gold to go to gall did this and and his and his his administrations
and and his successors they did this they sent a battleship to new york city and this this trip
and the british also tried to claim several billion dollars of gold and this triggered nixon to
meet with his advisors that august and go on television and deliver what's known as the
niction shock and and basically tell the world hey sorry all those claims that we said we would
redeem for gold we're not going to do that anymore so we rug pulled the whole world and all of a
sudden all these governments around the world had given their gold to us or to someone else
and they had gotten these little pieces of paper and then those papers will no longer back by
dollars and what happened was between 71 and 75 the dollar devalued against the german mark by 50
percent so the dollar started to to go into freefall basically we had huge inflation in the
united states and like i said before this was really exacerbated by our our losing control over
energy production i think these are extremely tied together so when did the petrodollar um
was born yeah so basically nixon and kissinger uh created the petrodollar not washington and
adams like this is uh our founders were extremely skeptical of the centralized monetary systems um
but these guys uh were total um opportunists right um they care less about the external costs
nixon famously was was saying there's there's a in the watergate leaks there's something where he
says uh i don't give a shit about the lira he was they were asking about italy and he was like i
don't care about them so these guys had no empathy for for our even our allies at the time and um
what what they realized is in order to fund vietnam and the great society stuff without getting
massive protests in the street they needed to find a way for someone to start buying american debt
like in large quantities so they hired a guy named williams william simon off wall street he
worked at salomon brothers he sold bonds this was his job to sell debt so they hired william simon
to be treasurer that's what i did i sold bonds at salomon brothers but go on great so you go back
in time it might have been you so they hired him off wall street to run the government's bond sales
program okay so simon goes so what what do you do when you're like oh man we got to sell our debt
you find someone who's got the most money in the world and who had the most money in the world in
1973 saudi arabia i mean the amount of money of capital the capital account in opac because of the
rise of the price of oil and dollar terms from whatever it was two to twelve dollars it was so
astronomical the saudis and opac they didn't know what to do with all this money they couldn't possibly
invest it internally so we sent despite the war despite us being you know back and forth and on
different sides with regard to israel we sent simon out there he went to jeddah then the crown
prince came to dc that later in 74 and then nixon went to saudi arabia and and met the king and all
this this is all in the history books none of this is speculation this is all in that you go back
you look at new york times articles and what what we came to an agreement was was called the petrodollar
pact and there's four elements to the petrodollar pact number one the saudis would price oil in
dollars and and enforce the rest of opac pricing oil in dollars meaning like before that point what
before that point what was it priced sure i mean it was it was you before that point like
you you could obviously dollars were dominant because it it we had the largest economy and
dollars are flowing around everywhere it was dollar diplomacy right but like it wasn't um
like you could do a deal with opac to use your fiat currency to buy oil like this was possible
now keep going when yeah sure so so when when this was starting to when this was enforced
it just has so many network effects uh like basically it really crowds out everything else
and it really makes the dollar it increases demand for the dollar obviously if you have to find dollars
to pay like if malawi needs oil they they can no longer print their own currency or use the currency
of a local african nation they have to get dollars well how does malawi get dollars they can't print
them they have to export stuff to the united states or to an ally um which means that we can control
their society we can tell them what we want and we can change their internal structure and we can
force them to make stuff we want this is how all of us agricultural policy has gone actually it's
gone hand in hand with energy policy so these countries now have to earn dollars instead of
serving their own needs and becoming sovereign and productive they have to pay debt back in dollars
now just as an aside at the same time the petrodollar is coming to an existence the imf and world bank
are are really surging into the scene in the global south and all this debt that's flowing in
in the 70s uh is dollar denominated so keep that in mind for later like so you're getting this massive
amount of dollar denominated debt going into the global south a lot of it is from these earnings
so to stay on the petrodollar uh number one is that the saudis and opec uh mandate that
you can only pay us in dollars to buy oil and number two is what's called petrodollar recycling
we're going to recycle the dollar profits back into us debt and that was done um in some ways
through the euro dollar system which i'll explain in a second but basically you had these two elements
on the Saudi side on the american side what we agreed to do was sell them weapons at a lower
than market rate and protect them so that was the petrodollar pact and that's colored all of our
relationship with Saudi Arabia ever since including up till today where it seems to be unraveling but
like i know i can get into that but you see you have not only our relationship with Saudi Arabia
but our the entire global economic system it's colored that for the last totally yeah yeah
what i what i'll just point out is that i'm not i think the petrodollar is really important
especially in the 70s i mean the dollar was collapsing um and you look at like pre petrodollar
the british pound still accounted for like a sizable amount of petroleum trade after it
basically went to zero so it's definitely a transitionary moment and i think that um yeah go
ahead well i was just going to say you know what else happened in 1970 71
us non uh shale oil peaked um growth in global oil production at uh hit its all-time production
growth it was growing at seven or eight percent a year there 1971 was the all-time peak of that
growth rate yeah um 1971 was in the genuine progress indicator which is a measure of GDP
that subtracts out the bats that's when that peaked and Richard Nixon also did something
positive here was 1970 was the first earth day but sorry to interrupt you keep going Alex no no
it's fine and we're gonna stay on this so we just described the petrodollar system now that's
that's a political system that is not a free market outcome that was a political negotiation
and Greenspan who was in the Ford administration kind of as this thing was ha as this thing was
being fleshed out through the 70s he's on record saying that it was uh a you know not a market
decision however at the same time you have the euro dollar system which is worth describing briefly so
back in the 50s the soviet allies in europe they they didn't want to have their savings
in rubles for obvious reasons uh that's a weak currency um they wanted dollars uh so
they basically were able to create dollar contracts at banks outside the purview of
u.s government these are called euro dollars they're just dollars that are outside the u.s
banking system so these started to spread and they were created entirely without permission or
authority of the u.s government this is a free market phenomenon um globally free market is what
i mean um and by the 60s 70s uh that they start to increase in size there's more and more and more
euro dollars so you have to know that there's there's two things happening here one is a free
market interest in having the dollar okay but the other one is a political design that they're both
important it's impossible to say which one's more important but like let's just consider
they're both key for for what we're about to get to so what ends up happening is the saudi's
opec they have this incredible amount of money they invested back into the u.s banking system
the u.s banking system and the euro dollar system they have in europe they have all these dollars
okay so they do dollar denominated debt to the global south this is in the late 70s
an astonishing amount i mean you basically had a late 1920s kind of bubble in in sovereign debt
sales to uh to the global south so you had like little banks in the midwest of the united states
lending to angola stuff like that it was like completely crazy so there was a huge bubble
if you're a farmer or a small business person in angola and you have an idea and you need funding
for it just to use your example you would eventually get a million dollar loan from some bank in
illinois and you would be in your own country with your customers paying the angola currency
but you would have to pay your debt back your interest and eventually your principal
in us dollars i mean i wish it was that uh balanced what was actually happening is that
the farmers in iowa were depositing their money um and building up a banking system
in the midwest that was then making loans to a government a corrupt government in angola
which was not sharing any money with angolan farmers which was buying weapons uh stocking
up the police force paying interest off debt to the imf very very little of this money actually
made it to the people unfortunately but it was a massive bubble um incredible incredible amounts
of money 200 300 growth from the 78 to like 81 82 and then what happens um the the the age of
cheap credit ends right so you have all of this dollar denominated debt in all these countries
that can't print dollars so that they need dollars to get oil and and and often food commodities
things like that that they also need dollars to pay back their debt right now now we get back to
the the rising interest rates so vulgar now uh raises rates now they were high they were six seven
eight percent or whatever they were nine percent ten percent he raises them almost to 20 percent
so all of a sudden the cost of capital globally skyrockets it becomes extremely difficult for
all these countries to pay their debt that's back it becomes extremely difficult to afford everything
there's massive price inflation in the global south um and what happens can i ask a quick question
yeah yeah so if if in preceding those days if you borrowed money in us dollars the angle in
government presumably it was a 10-year loan or something that had a fixed rate so why would uh
rates going from seven to 20 affect the previous borrowings that no it is not like a us 30 year
fixed rate no no no no these rates are adjustable um and they would get renegotiated through something
called the paris club which folks should look up but basically just to be very brief we can
get into details later but world bank loans are very long 10 20 30 years and they often get read
adjusted through the paris club um the imf loans were supposed to be short term and they were
supposed to be fixed but again what what happens is that um you have a two-year imf loan for whatever
amount of money and your mabutu in zaire let's say horrible human rights abuse are you getting
bailed out by the imf for for unfortunate reasons um then you run out of money and the imf says well
are you gonna pay us and you're mabutu and you say no and what ends up happening is that they
they say fine we'll give you another loan and what's happening here is that and and and what's
and what happens in the 80s when mexico becomes the first country to to trigger to declare bankruptcy
and basically start the third world debt crisis when the united states in the west bailed out mexico
we weren't bailing them out for the because of empathy for mexican people or we weren't bailing
mabutu out because of empathy for zaireans we're bailing these these countries out to save our
own banks so what happened is our western banks got so over leveraged on debt to these nations
that if those countries collapsed we'd have a 1930s financial crisis so that's why in the 80s
and then again in the 90s and 94 with the peso crisis 98 with the 97 98 with the asian financial
crisis um the the european crisis 2010 11 12 every time another part of the world is about to collapse
we can't have that because that would mean that our banks have to write assets down they don't
want to do that they would rather extend more debt that's always been the solution so that's
why there's been an exponential rise in uh global south debt since the early 70s so i and anyway
go ahead alex yeah but i didn't know this uh my girlfriend and i are watching uh for the first
time actually the sopranos right now and boy it sure sounds like there's a lot of parallels
in the story that you're telling yeah no so so basically but volker's not like he's not mean
i don't think he doesn't want these people to suffer it's just not as part of his he's not
thinking about it i mean does he does powell know about the fact that shrillanka is collapsing in part
because of u.s financial policy i mean i don't know does powell or yellen or ben anking know about
the the carbon footprint of quantitative easing no that's that's a byproduct it's not in their
mandate right so the the point being that these interest rate hikes really harm a lot of people
abroad because not only do they create massive price inflation like just give you an example
the ft does a good job covering what's happening in egypt right now classic case could read reads
like the 1980s like the average egyptian is paying more and more money for brett astronomically more
than they were a couple years ago meanwhile the government's getting bailed out by the billions
by the imf now what's the government going to spend that money on the military so it can
keep itself in power this has just been the case forever and what ended up happening in the 80s
and what i fear is happening now in a lot of the world in the developing world is that you move
money out of the equation the number of hours you have to work to get a thousand grams of protein
or rice it's actually increasing so we would think that with technological deflation and with the
innovation of humans and all these advances in sterilization refrigeration health care all these
things you would have thought that in like the 70s and 80s between 1970 and 1990 that people all
around the world would have had to work less for the same amount of meat or rice now that's
certainly true in the west uh and the the increases in efficiency were crazy subsidized in large part
because of fossil fuels but in these other parts of the world where fossils were more scarce and
where there wasn't as much access to that sort of thing and they were getting squeezed by imf structural
adjustment policies squeezed by the rising cost of capital by the u.s government the amount of
hours you had to work to get a thousand grams of rice in peru for example or beef in some cases doubled
over a 15 to 20 a period of time so this is what i mean when i say wage deflation is this also what
you mean by um when you use the term monetary colonialism that's a very specific brand of
this what i'm describing is the general relationship between western powers and we'll call it the
developing world or the third world of the global south whatever you want to use but basically you
have the west and you have the developing world and the relationship for hundreds of years has
been somewhat similar first it was naked imperialism and then now it's more of a financial repression
story there are unique and specific instances of what i would refer to as monetary colonialism
that are that are good examples of this and and the most obvious case is found in west africa
and central africa so for example the french used to have straight up imperialism over a massive
amount of the global south including most a huge chunk of africa right so in the 50s and 60s they
were forced to decolonize they didn't want to they fought an unbelievably horrific war in algeria
because they really wanted that that gas there they ultimately had to leave but they really
didn't want to give up claims over these uh 15 countries in west and central africa from senegal
to togo to mali uh central africa and republic um for different a couple different reasons
one was cultural and linguistical they wanted to keep spreading the french language and culture
and and one was resource-based like they wanted the the uranium that was in the sahara desert
in these countries uh france gets lauded i think properly for having a really great nuclear program
but what most people don't know is for decades all of that uranium was essentially stolen from
their monetary colonial subjects in the sahara in places like chat and mali um so an an enormous
amount of like french um culture and prosperity and standards of life were subsidized by repressing
these people in 15 countries in africa and it was through the currency so basically it's called
this on the street people called the sifa it's the colonial french frank that's what it's still called
today um there's a really good book about this called africa's last colonial currency um yeah
i think your readers will find it really interesting um and i also have a chapter in my book check
your financial privilege on it but essentially the sifa is controlled by france it used to be
tied to the frank and then now it's sort of tied to the euro but between 44 when it was invented
in nine in the late 90s it was devalued 99.9 against the frank so basically the the french
squeezed all this economic life out of these countries and if you look they are not only
are all 15 authoritarian states so no democratic development um also they're like seven or eight
of them are the poorest countries in the world we're talking like guinea besa uh niger etc so
chad so these countries were stripped of their prosperity in an industry by france intentionally
and it's it's a shocking thing it's totally shocking like people
and the country and the country itself like when like the country for a long time these
countries had to had to keep a hundred percent of their reserves like their national earnings in
forex in paris and when they wanted to have some france would charge them so france got access
to all this capital they also had a market to sell expensive stuff too so you go down to like
Dakar all the cars are french because french just sold stuff to these countries and then there's
this thing where like if you are in ivory coast and you want to build a bridge or something you
have to first go to french um big you know uh contractors and and and offer the job to them
at a higher the market rate and only if they refuse can you go to the americans or chinese
similarly if you're selling coffee you have to go to the french first sell below market rate
and only if they refuse can you sell someone else so it's basically this is today or in the
past this is today now certain things have changed very slightly but the colonial currency continues
to exist today and all these countries are still in it because french prop france props up dictators
throughout the region um to to protect the system so it's pretty intense but basically what i'm saying
here is that um this is an this is an this is a an extreme example of the broader thing i'm
describing which is that western countries through the currency exploit um peripheral nations
and and and they subsidize their way of life this way so i should probably alex just shut
up and let you tell us what's important and i'd not ask you any questions because i have like
a hundred questions and you have a hell of a lot to say but i am going to interrupt here and say
two things uh one thing and then one question so until this conversation the way i think about
inflation and deflation is we have the deflationary impulse from new innovation and technology and
mass producing uh high definition television sets and because we get better at at those processes
that's paired with energy depletion where oil and copper and and materials are getting
less concentrated and they're more costly to extract and that ripples into our price system
but now realizing it that's kind of a western perspective because there's a third dynamic
that influences our our prices and our ability to afford things and that is this global financial
well uh colonial uh um monetary colonialism is what you said because those inflationary
deflationary pulses that i impulses that i just described in angola or chad or somewhere else
aren't as relevant as where the where their currency comes from and what they need to pay for
things well then you're totally right but i just add two things that you're hinting at like it's
also about get us getting cheap labor abroad like i mean if we had to make everything that we use in
the united states with our wages like our stuff would be way more expensive so obviously we've
outsourced a ton of that to china and elsewhere um and that's really important is that to slavery
in your book in your mind i mean i i think that the system is is corrupt and
unethical i mean it's evil in many ways i mean it's uh but it's it's not like you can point to
one person it's it's a it's an outcome of of the way the history is unfolded so it's really crazy
in my language it's uh it's an emergent property of past decisions that have resulted in this energy
i'm a total i'm a classic liberal i love freedom i love capitalism um but it's it's we don't have a
counterfactual here like we have our world where this is an outcome of our system now you can argue
that what we're doing you know no true scotsman thing you can say well this isn't capitalism and
i would say that's actually right because everything's totally centrally planned you have the petrodollar
you have us trade policy that prevents nations from trading equally with each other everything's
controlled so there's a little bit of that but but it's hard to separate our way of life from
exploiting other nations is what what i'm saying and just to give you a stat that that i think is
important again the point here is that these systems we've developed over time the fiat currency system
the world bank the imf the international financial system uh followed the age of of colonialism
and imperialism and and tried in many ways to replicate it and again the point was the resource
flow so here's a crazy stat that your audience probably doesn't know and i didn't know until
last year in 1982 the flow funds permanently switched from previously the global north sending
resources and investment to the global south to coming the other way around so since 1982 there's
been a growing drain of resources we're talking everything investment grants remittances commerce
all that stuff black market white market all of it um since 82 it's been flowing our way so global
south countries have been subsidizing us since 82 permanently and it started as a trickle and now
it's trillions of dollars a year so in many ways we've perfected this art of like exploiting the
other and this is the this is the stat so in 2015 the drain was 10.1 billion tons of raw materials
and 182 million person years of labor so that's 50 percent of all goods and 28 percent of all
labor used to that year by high income countries so all you need to do is think about it this way
pretend you didn't have half the you know pretend half our goods weren't like subsidized and pretend
28 percent of our labor wasn't subsidized what would happen to prices in new york and in philadelphia
like they'd be a lot higher so i'm just visualizing this as a giant siphon from the global south to
yes and it's all made possible with debt so basically the the whole system was the whole
idea was replace the the the warship and the gun and the bayonet with debt so debt became the weapon
and look like anyone listening from the global south that does not learning here probably much
like they know this they've lived this they've seen this they've seen wage deflation they've seen
stuff get worse i mean we talk about in america how wages have been stagnant since the 70s for
the lower middle class which is true i mean it's stagnant i mean in some of these countries you saw
20 to 30 decrease in gdp so one fact that i learned that was shocking when we talk about the human
toll of all this and you know forget the environmental toll for a second just on the human toll um
when a country like mexico which is a classic country that's had a lot of dealings with lending
with imf etc when when their gdp contracts by like two percent their mortality rate deteriorates by
one percent so think about when your g you know so like if you have a hundred million people
and your gdp goes down two percent you're you're you're losing a million people prematurely right
so think about um the 70s and 80s during what culminated in the third world debt crisis you had
countries that lost 10 20 30 percent of their gdp i mean so these these policies killed tens
of millions of people but they'll never be in accounting they'll never be any justice i mean
no one will ever go to prison in fact larry summers who was the head of the world bank's
economic unit in the early 90s he like went to the white house and now he's on twitter telling us
what to do like none of these people will ever suffer any consequences for anything they ever
did and that's just something that we have to accept do you think people like that are aware of
the things that you're saying or were they focused on helping what their mandate was and these were
like spandrels or externalities there's a pretty famous in summer in the high levels yes they're
culpable and they're guilty because there's there's even a memo that summers wrote in the early 90s
that leaked uh where he basically was suggesting that we dump all of our toxic waste in africa
like that guy totally knows i remember that quote i remember that quote yeah yeah he's but that was
that was an environmental guilty thing that wasn't this debt is a cycling yeah but they i i think
that 80 to 90 percent of the employees at these institutions who by the way are paid extremely
well i mean they love their jobs um they they i think they're doing good and it's like sort of
the banality of evil thing right like i don't i wouldn't expect like they just don't know they
just don't know i think you really have to zoom out to see this i mean the argument i'm trying to
make in my this what i've just discussed is laid out in my new book that came out yesterday actually
called hidden repression um how i didn't know that bank uh uh cell exploitation is development
and i i i i just hope that like all i'm asking is that people educate themselves on this and come
to their own conclusions you know let me ask you a personal question and i'm gonna ask you some
personal questions at the end of this interview too but at the beginning of this you told me
that your work at human rights foundation is helping global dissidents and uh and human rights
and living in fear is is a terrible thing some of the things you've dropped on this podcast
even so far are pretty threatening to the status quo i know there's a lot of environmental
dissidents in south america that that pay for their uh courage with their lives because people
don't want to hear that are you ever afraid of of what you're saying because it's so profoundly
against the cultural narrative or the the western privilege i think that no um because i work with
all these dissidents who literally like some of them have been killed right so i think i i take
for i don't take anything for granted i but i take my advantage of my opportunities will put it that
way like i'm happy to do this and i just hope people can learn i mean i i'm trying to walk this
line between again i i'm a huge believer in western civilization at its at its core values
and the american revolution and what it stood for at the time in terms of being anti-imperial um i'm
a hundred percent on board with the values what i'm not on board with is is what's happened since
right so i think that we need to improve the problem is that a lot of people who say stuff
that i've said on the show so far will then all of a sudden go and be like pro ccp or pro puden
or pro dictator or pro chavez that's wrong dictatorship is the enemy dictatorship is
what we're fighting against uh we need to like work out the kinks in our liberal democracies
and improve them not go simp for some dictator so i've been really like embarrassed by the
number of people on the left who see some of the stuff i'm seeing but then they go ahead and say
well america's evil let's let's go support putin this is this is a horrific thing and you see a lot
of like uh people on the left and on the far right there's the the horseshoe theory right
they're like ah ukraine's fake like uh bits of nato war whatever like all this crazy stuff you see
it's crazy so i'm trying to walk a line between knowing that like the free society is what we want
and that individual rights are really important and that we want to protect individual freedom
like this is so key and at the same time try and understand the costs of our system like what has
our system imposed on others and i'm just trying to help people think about that and ultimately i
think it recalls for monetary reform which probably pushes us to the next part of the conversation
yes let's go there so how did you when did you become interested in bitcoin as a as a part of
the suite of responses to the challenges that you just laid out yeah and pre-bit just before we get
to bitcoin last thing if you're listening so far i just would ask you is it fair that four percent
of the world's population can impose rules on the rest of the world is it fair that a small group
of unelected old white men for the most part in virginia get to decide the cost of capital for
everybody i think the system is profoundly unfair i've benefited from it my entire life i'm a i have
this financial privilege um but i'm asking you just to think about what it's like for other people
both at the retail level of like can you send money to your friends like this is just non-trivial
for some people like try to send a western union or a bank wire to mozambique or to south korea even
it's like impossible and it's expensive and it takes a lot of time and sometimes it doesn't even
make it um that they have to deal with a lot so all i'm asking is just just put yourself in their
shoes and that's what brought me to bitcoin so before you you continue is there a way to have
modern complexity globalization six-continent supply chains with 100 to 200 countries each
having their own cost of capital i mean that's highly impractical it had to go this way yeah i
mean i think what you probably would have seen had the petrodollar not happened is just more of a
multipolar world like i think the u.s is always going to be really dominant no matter what currency
paradigm we have um but it reached so there might have been five or six currencies and yeah
or three i mean or even two but like i mean and look one outcome of the petrodollar system was
defeating the soviet union the cold war which was good so i mean there's that i mean i think we
should be balanced about this but how did that briefly how did that well we got to print money
we got to we got to click a button to buy oil and they had to dig it out of the ground how's that
like that's that's pretty much it i mean that that was one of the big you and then think about
all the trickle down effects from that so so just just to let's i mean i have this in my
earth they talked that i gave last night it'll be online next week is we talk about um the american
way of life or the you know and and that is a lot of it is because of our um accident of geology
where we this country is a bunch of ancient oceans and we have natural gas and coal and we have
90 plus energy independence but a big part of it is the hegemony that we get from the us dollar
and the seniority and the benefits that you've been describing so and i would say pre pre pre
shale revolution or pre our ability to use technology to make things cheaper we'll just say
right there was a moment there like late 90s people were freaking out about the euro
i mean my i make an assertion i know it's provocative but i think one of the major
reasons we invaded iraq was to protect the petro dollar i don't think it was to bring democracy
to iraq i don't think it was to fight terrorism i don't think it was to take away i totally knew
to and i don't think it was for oil because we had all we we don't we didn't get any oil from over
there but what was threatening was stom selling tens of billions of dollars of oil to germany
and france in euros that was a problem get this there's a newsweek article by howard fernandes
get this there's a newsweek article by howard fineman from june oh three you go look at it
and it just notes at the end oh a couple weeks later the iraqis are back to selling the oil for
dollars like it's like yeah that was fixed so i'm not saying it's the only reason we went in there
but it's certainly at the top for me and if you david graber has a great piece of debt in his book
debt uh rest in peace he has an awesome section on this about the petro dollar and about the iraq
it's really good and about vietnam people should read it it's excellent how do you as uh the united
states sorry just just just to finish that so um there was a moment there were like uh things were
getting remember how expensive oil got like it was it was dicey right there um so we we were we were
freaking out like about a lot of things and then technology sort of bought us another decade and
would also bought us another decade was china coming into the wto and us being able to sell
treasuries a trillion dollars of treasuries to china and as the luke roman is great on this
macro economist and so is lin alton both of them are excellent to follow they really point out how
yeah so basically in 08 between 08 during basically during and after the great financial crisis
that was the peak of dollar hegemony never since then these countries have been selling off our
debt and buying gold so we're kind of we're kind of going back to this uh world where countries
probably are going to start settling in gold more and more and less and less in american claims
and this was obviously expedited by russia's invasion of uh ukraine and the the sort of uh
g7 decision to freeze western financial assets that were held by the russians so all these other
dictators are looking at that and saying uh no thanks no thanks we're going to hold something
that you guys can't remotely confiscate right but we've managed to keep the system alive but
i think that it it can't last forever no monetary empire lasts forever and it's not
going to be china sorry like sorry ray dalio like if you look at every reserve currency
okay it was always based at its core and freedom and property rights and rule of law whether it
was the dutch or the british uh or the americans like the at least at home there was like a court
system where there was rule of law the chinese don't have this no one's going to trust the
chinese government to issue currency they have a closed capital account they don't want the
trippin dilemma that's not going to happen so it's going to be i think the dollar the trippin
dilemma is a situation a country gets into when it becomes the reserve currency whereby normally
when you are uh when your currency gets really strong um your wages you know and things get
very expensive your your currency gets gets strong your and your exports become uncompetitive
so people stop buying them and and your currency starts to get weaker this is like a
natural balance in the order of things but with the trippin dilemma the the difference is that
the reserve currency everybody else needs it so the dilemma is that the issuer of the reserve
currency goes deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper into debt um while its currency remains
pretty strong instead of weakening like normally if you're like if you had the United States had and
right but but but if you're like malawi you're gonna go bankrupt and have hyperinflation
like but if you're in the United States we have this massive demand for dollars so the the dilemma
is that our if you look at any like you know uh account reading of the United States since the
70s it's insane it's like this right it's like we have this insane deficit of 30 trillion dollars
that keeps growing by one to one one and a half trillion every year again this is the only debt
empire in history so there's no precedent for this we've never seen this before so
I'm about nine questions behind but this is all good I'm already concluded that you're
gonna have to come back for around two but let me just ask you this there's around 40% of the
watchers of this podcast are from the United States yeah and quite a few from from Europe
um
how can someone not feel a little bit of shame from hearing the story
that you've unpacked here in the prior hour I think it's it's a fair uh I mean when I went
through the all this research I've been doing the last few years on these topics I go through
shock surprise disappointment shame and then and then and then and then we'll get to this
but the inspiration part like they could that could be better it could we could change things not
for the past but for the future I I would recommend next time you're in New York or Rome or Berlin
or London and you're at a particularly beautiful place looking at all this incredible civilization
that we've built just consider that yes a lot of it is because of freedom and of of our values yes
of of property rights and free speech and constitutional democracy and all that absolutely
and those are worth fighting for it's also because we stole resources and labor from from poor nations
for a long time um and that's something we don't think about and and it's it's just the truth and uh
I know people don't want to look at the truth or deal with the truth but the truth is both um and
that that upsets everybody because there's a lot of Marxists who say no it's not because of freedom
screw freedom it's only because of exploitation and then there's a lot of like sort of pro cat like
neoliberal people who are like ah not really exploitation it's all because of how great our
markets are and all this stuff like the the truth is that it's both and I know that doesn't it's not
like a it's not a clean picture for people you know and it's somewhat a lot predicated on the 100
billion barrel oil 100% coal oil natural gas that are are underpinning yeah and this and again
let's move to bitcoin but like the last thing I'll say is just that we've had such an incredible
opportunity to take advantage of fossils and a lot of other countries haven't and and that
almost entirely has dictated their development in many ways like what how could they access those
fossils and what could they what could they do with them a lot of countries like Nigeria
they have a bunch of oil but they can't do what they want with it like they have to sell it and
then for dollars to get money to pay back debt and to buy food so you have this whole system
where Africa as a continent imports 85% of its food which is insane because it should be feeding
the world you know so here's a really naive question and then yes please let's get to
your interest in in bitcoin yeah um does the average person in Nigeria or Mozambique or Angola
understand the the premises that you've laid out here are they are they angry at the United States
in the west because we have the global reserve currency or are they just discontent because
they can't afford things that they would like and and there's other issues well just like I was ignorant
about my country until recently I would assume most people are pretty ignorant about this stuff
because it doesn't impact their daily lives that being said people that I've met I can only speak
for who I've met my personal experiences on my travels um and in my work they're very aware
that when the IMF comes uh for austerity things get worse I mean this is super obvious to anyone
who's lived through any of this stuff and so the IMF is uh is the the the Soprano's equivalent of
Polly Walnut I mean honestly it's like the grim reaper like the the the um the and you know we
structural adjustment which is this policy that these countries have to have to do when they take
when they get when they borrow money from the IMF or or more recently from the World Bank
you know they have to raise taxes reduce subsidies for food and energy they have to shrink their
economy they have to you know devalue the currency I mean this is never asked of the west like the
United States and the and Germany and they've never had to structurally adjust like in fact
because we're democracies like we refuse and that's why the IMF and World Bank like working
with dictators that's what drew me to research this thing in the first place I was like why the
hell are we giving we bailing out Suharto and Marcos and Mobutu these criminals these war crimes
what's going on why are we supporting them so the implication is that in order to label ourselves
as democracies we have to be international authoritarians well I think the the the the friction
I've uncovered I think in my research is that and it's just kind of it should be I would be
obvious to an alien I think an alien coming and looking at the thing uh would be that our system
uh has powerful nations exploit the weak I mean it's pretty simple and and and that is
exacerbated by the money so look I I spent uh 10 years working with activists from these countries
all around the world from these authoritarian nations and I saw the problem they had with money
not necessarily on the global macro front but on the like I couldn't set up a bank uh
you know this dictator shut off my bank account my currency sucks like I can't receive a wire from
you when you want to give me a grant like just basic logistical stuff is so hard for so many people
and then they kept telling me about they're using bitcoin and I'm like what like the first
time was WikiLeaks Julien Assange spoke at the Oslo Freedom Forum in 2010 I met him in person and a
year later six months later Satoshi Nakamoto the creator of bitcoin had their last public post
where whoever they were he she they they said let's not let's let's hope that WikiLeaks doesn't use
bitcoin we're not ready the software project was too vulnerable this was in December 2010
six months after Assange spoke at my event and I met him six months later Satoshi disappears
Assange posts the a bitcoin address to the WikiLeaks account the rest is history the US
government came in and shut off any way to pay or donate to WikiLeaks through Visa or PayPal or
whatever so so you had to use bitcoin now bitcoin at the time was like worth a dollar like it wasn't
worth anything no one trusted it but guess what it worked for this purpose and we saw that and
that was interesting fast forward to years 2013 um two things happened a bunch of Ukrainians who
were gathering to be what would later be made on square wrote to us and said could you help us do a
fundraiser we our bank accounts got cut off can you send us some bitcoin and Gary Kasparov who's
our chairman we worked on this together there's still this reddit post from that from 2013 you
can see this so we helped get them some bitcoin into our surprise it worked I mean again bitcoin
wasn't worth much but like it it allowed money to go beyond the control of the state which was
important for our work the other thing that happened that year is this woman named Roya Mahbub
who's a good friend of mine started using bitcoin in her work in Afghanistan to pay the
women who worked for her company the software company she was a pioneer had a female only
software company she couldn't pay the girls in cash because the male relatives would take it they
couldn't open bank accounts but they had phones so she paid them in bitcoin and it worked and it
gave them freedom um so those two things weighed heavily on my mind but I'm like a skeptic like
if I do a personality test I'm a 99 percent skeptic so like I was like okay okay fine this
bitcoin thing but I kept kind of ignoring it we started accepting bitcoin donations in 2014 at
href so we started getting some bitcoin I started to get it a little more but it wasn't really until
2017 late 2016 early 2017 that I like was like oh my god we have to actually have a program here
where we link bitcoin folks with activists so we can help them just just like we helped activists
learn how about encryption so in 2010 no activists used any sort of really personal encryption on
their phones outside of western experts I mean it was really not done fast forward 10 years everybody
used a signal so you had a 10 year time where everything changed I think that's going to be the
case from like let's say 2018 to 2028 I think over that decade every activist is going to use bitcoin
whether they like it or not it's kind of like it's not a philosophical thing it's like email
like do I care about the political beliefs of the people who created email no I'm using it because
it's obviously better than sending something in the mail that's bitcoin to me like I don't care
about who created it I'm using it because it allows me to transmit value from A to B with no
questions asked to anyone in the world in an instant for a cheap for very cheaply and for very fast I
mean that's that's why I would use it right so let me level set a bit here yeah I know enough
about bitcoin to be dangerous I am in the space of energy depletion peak oil yes fiat currency
end of growth climate change environmental issues biodiversity systems ecology and I would say the
vast majority of people in that space are either ignorant about bitcoin or antagonistic about bitcoin
because how much it requires energy to mine and that energy 100 contributes to climate change but
so my interest in bitcoin came about because I could see two or three steps ahead that at every
can kicking moment in the global west that the US and other central banks would
not choose austerity that we would print more money to offset our problems and therefore there
would be not only a continued but an accelerated biophysical debasement of our monetary representations
of reality and there had to be some alternatives to that I actually bought bitcoin at 70
dollars and I sold it at 100 thinking I was smart I bought it again at 700 and I sold it
at 300 because this thing sucks yeah and you know and the other other things over the years
but you came into your interest of bitcoin not because of the potential demise or devaluation
of the US dollar but because you wanted to be able to quickly and cheaply get funds to your global
freedom of dissidents on on the human rights issues so you talked about sending money to you
you in yeah I didn't buy I didn't own any bitcoin until 2017 like I had been exposed to it for like
six years and I was like this thing is I just wasn't sure you know so so but couldn't you mentioned
the Ukraine example yeah back in the Maidan revolution yes couldn't you use PayPal or
Western Union or things like that no because the these people had their bank accounts closed down
they had no way to receive money there was no so I mean so they didn't have a bank account but
they did have a phone or a computer yeah yeah Ukraine is very wired I mean and here's the
interesting thing countries that have been hit hardest by you you talk about how we're not
going to have austerity here correct like politicians will do stimulus right that's that's
written on the wall what what we'll do is we'll have austerity there over there where we can't
hear the screaming of all the people who are suffering that's going to happen that's happening
as we speak right now now those countries are the ones that are adopting bitcoin the most rapidly
if you look at the per capita usage of bitcoin and cryptocurrency it is highest in places like
Turkey Argentina Nigeria places where the local fiat system is collapsing and that should be just
very rational to any I mean that makes sense to most people what it what is the per capita
percentage number of people that use it in those countries versus the US do you know
okay so this was um 2022 a global report ownership of bitcoin and cryptocurrency
percent of internet users aged 16 to 64 who own bitcoin or some form of cryptocurrency
uh the worldwide average is at around 10 and the US is at 12 Thailand's at 20
Nigeria 19 Philippines 19 South Africa 19 Turkey 18 Argentina 18 Indonesia 15 Brazil 15 so I've
just named I've just named the six six of the biggest recipients of IMF eight ever okay Brazil
Indonesia Argentina Turkey Philippines Nigeria Thailand oh my god so just 15 and 20% does it
show all the countries in the world what are the bottom few I'm just like the least ownership do
you have that yeah I mean and again this is like one data point a lot more needs to be done but a
lot of very advanced countries like Japan Italy Poland Israel um and and China uh who knows there
I mean yeah who knows so all all I'm saying is that like you have two drivers for bitcoin
adoption one is like fiat collapse like your local currency is collapsing um and the other one is
political repression so like in China like we don't know the true bitcoin stats because right
it's impossible to know but what we do know is there's a ton of bitcoin adoption in China
well the other thing is yeah many of those countries that you mentioned there is no fiat
collapse because they don't have any fiat they have to use US dollars yeah exactly and
in general I think there's there's that's that's kind of what I just said is is a good thing for
you to think about like there's two reasons to want bitcoin digital gold digital cash it's either
that you want a better savings technology and your government bonds are just not doing the job and
you want something that over 10 years is going to really like hold your purchasing power uh which
is what gold has done gold has held its purchasing power since ancient Rome like the cost of a beer
in ancient Rome is the same amount of gold as it is today it's kind of crazy or the amount of
gold it cost to buy a bread in the time of Nebuchadnezzar is the same as amount as today in
Whole Foods like pretty much like it has preserved purchasing power because there's no such thing as
alchemy you can't just like make gold out of silver or whatever you got to dig it out of the ground
and it gets harder and harder to dig now bitcoin it's similar to that but it's also digital cash
it can be it has vulnerabilities but it can be quite private and it's unstoppable so it's like
cash it's like me paying you the government doesn't have to know about it they can't socially engineer
us it's just a payment like a bear instrument payment like we used to do but it's on the internet
so it does these two things really well and those things are going to be really in demand this this
decade if you just think about two words devaluation and deplatforming those are going to increase
exponentially over this decade all over the world what's what's deplatforming
what they did to wiki leaks kicking them off paypal or kicking them off patreon for not having
the right politics now first it'll start happening to extremists on the edges but then it starts to
come to the center and you're you'll see that okay you are the very first guest out of 70 that
i've had talk about bitcoin and you are a um a global expert on it would you be willing to
like talk to me like i am a junior high school student um just because i want to get some of
the foundational tenets uh before we get into some of the advanced questions which i i've been thinking
about um what real briefly maybe just give short one to two minute answers uh and and we can get
through a bunch of questions what was the foundational philosophy of creating bitcoin or
whoever created it they wanted digital cash they wanted an internet of money that's what
satoshi nakamoto wanted if you read the white paper they wanted an ability for two internet
users to transact without a third party in the middle there's a lot of reasons for that a reliance
on third parties has led to both again devaluation in our currency which is most obviously seen
in the global south but also now it's being seen in the west that was something that wasn't the case
when satoshi made bitcoin we had the global financial crisis sure but we didn't have high
inflation in the dollar but guess what there was high inflation like all across the world at that
time outside of like the core right and then at the same time they were worried about censorship
t flat t platforming so again devaluation to platforming they were worried about third parties
saying no and this has this is just growing like you know you have a lot of reasons to want to have
just a quick transaction with somebody else without some without having to ask permission
so bitcoin is what we call permissionless it might be that you were in the united states during
operation choke point under obama and your dad blew glass that people used to smoke pot in
and he got debanked i met a bitcoin developer who is that person she hurt she got into bitcoin
because her dad ran a small business and was debanked by operation choke point could be that
you're a sex worker it could be that you um are involved in guns you know that you're a gun trainer
god knows what it could be that you want an abortion and you live in mississippi or something
like that there's a lot of reasons why people want to have private digital transactions that
don't give away their identity and i think it's absolutely core for democracy a good example
is hong kong when the hong kong students and activists were protesting against the ccp takeover
in 2019 they they had to use the subway system like in any large urban area you have to use
subways right and they didn't want to use their octopus card which is like their metro card to
to get on the subway because it could be tracked and then they could be fired from their job or
suspended from their university if they saw somebody getting off at a protest so they would
line up with cash to buy one-time use cards huge lines there's photos of this all over
so i really think it's important for us to have digital cash if we want to defend our democracies
this is really really important um but in any event i think that bitcoin is very simply separation
of money in state it's a way for us to just peer-to-peer transact as individuals on the internet
and it's basically emalable money i mean that's that's that's the longest short of it and um
technically there's eight billion humans and it's if you do have a cell phone or a computer
you you are part of that monetary open society that could technically have bitcoin i mean it's
it's it's very similar to email protocols like the bitcoin protocol is a protocol like anything
any client can speak to it you can build any client that speaks to it so any bitcoin wallet
in the world i mean i have ones on my phone that are made in argentina israel all over
they all speak the same language just like email speaks the same language just like google
or yahoo uh or aol all could communicate with one another because it was open right so bitcoin is
open it's open money for everybody so i've sent bitcoin to to i can send bitcoin to the west bank
from my living room in california in three seconds like the fact that people don't understand that
this is a revolution it just blows me away how is that not interesting to you you know and does
anyone else in the money to the west bank you know does anyone else in the world other than you
and whoever received that in the west bank know that that happened uh if we follow the right steps
no they have no idea uh if we are lazy yes you can be seen um and in fact the us government has
arrested a lot of people who have been sloppy with bitcoin um who've used it for crime and it's
it's fair to say that in its early days it was used for a lot of what i would consider crime
i think that now accounts for a tiny percentage of its overall use but i i think to focus on that
is very similar to focus on the aspect of crime during the early encryption debate in the 1990s
so senator biden at the time and and president clinton wanted to ban encryption they wanted
clipper chips in american phones they wanted to have full access to all in uh digital communications
because they they were worried about uh uh terrorists and criminals and pedophiles now
guess what if they had their way we'd have no privacy united states of america i mean we'd have
like a police state um but they lost uh the courts ultimately sided against them we don't
have clipper chips and we have signal on our phones instead now guess what do all drug dealers and
criminals use signal of course but that's not a reason to take it away from us it's going to be the
same thing with bitcoin at the end of the day to what by 2030 most people will use bitcoin in some
way or another and it'll just sort of be like email like it's it's it's it's an advancement in this
area and our policing will have to adapt to it that's kind of my take on that and that element
of it i have more fundamental basic questions but on your prediction there by 2030 how confident
are you of that very i mean i just the existing currencies are failing like they're not doing
well and they're not sufficient for the world's population like there are billions of people
who are unbanked uh but many of them have access to a phone they like this idea that money today is
so gated like you have to have id you have to prove yourself you have to like show that you're
somebody to use money to me is totally unnatural like it should be a basic human right to transact
with one with somebody else in the world so this has led to the exclusion the financial
exclusion of so many people like what you need to know is that kyc and aml policies are financially
exclusionary they leave out the most vulnerable and disenfranchised people in the world
and that's not fair kyc is know your customer exactly okay so i have some some holes to poke
in what you just said but but let's again for the benefit of of my systems ecology audience
that is accounting and the decline of mammalian species and keep building in the ocean yes let's
start what what is blockchain let's just briefly start there so satoshi um created bitcoin as a
decentralized money system for the world and the only way to do it without corruption inside the
system was to decentralize the issuance of money uh the issuance is what always wrecked all these
other experiments with digital cash with e-money with e-cash there was always like an issuer who
could get arrested or who could print a bunch of money and and devalue your savings so the question
was how do you decentralize issuance and they did this through something called nakamoto consensus
which which is is related to what we call proof of work so this is a a computational competition
so this is why people buy bitcoin mining machines and they run them all around the world and they
compete what they're doing they're not printing bitcoin they're they're receiving it as a as a
reward for work so if you prove that you've done a certain amount of work in the bitcoin
system you get you get new bitcoins and these bitcoins started at 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes
this was in 2009 in january 2009 when satoshi started the system and every four years that
amount of bitcoin that comes into the system gets cut in half we call it a halving so for four years
there was 50 coming in every 10 minutes then 25 and 12 and a half an hour at 675 that's going to go
all the way to zero in the year like 21 30 so ultimately there's a limited amount of bitcoin
that will ever exist that's the most important property of bitcoin is that if there's 21 million
of them that no one will be able to like print more that's very unique among all digital currencies
in fact bitcoin is the only digital currency that's not virtual meaning it has a tie to the
real world meaning because you have to expend electricity to to to to to move it along it has
a tie to the physical world in in in all these other currencies don't that's that's what i was
so interested in your work like you're showing how the currency system got detached from the real
world decades ago i think this offers a compelling different model where the reserve the base money
that we use could actually be tied to real world resources and i think that's going to be very
healthy for us but anyway like all this is to say that satoshi didn't use the word blockchain
they used the word called time chain so blockchain was invented later to describe
the fact that like the information that's stored in bitcoin is done on different computers it's
not done in one place it's like in the cloud on like thousands of distributed computers
and then people went on to make a lot of other blockchain tokens and cryptocurrencies and stuff
like that and so how long is the blockchain now uh it's like 300 gigabytes and everybody who runs
a full bitcoin node has every single transaction that dates back to january 2009 and it's stored
in the ones when you sent bitcoin to people in ukraine exactly yeah all of them all all of them
are there um all mean but we'll say like all bitcoin transactions are there now there are
new technologies that allow you to use bitcoin without proof of work called that that basically
it's layered money this is important to actually note just like society went from using gold as
money to paper notes to credit cards like we layered money right we sacrificed um certainty
for convenience like we layered money bitcoin will also layer so there's like a thing called
the lightning network which is a way for you and i to transact instantly and very privately with
bitcoin without any proof of work so without any uh mining but it's still using bitcoin
but it's not a hundred bitcoin it's not a token it's not some other crypto it's called it's bitcoin
but there's ways to use bitcoin where we're like not on the chain so it's not accurate to say that
all of the transactions are in the chain um but basically you have a canonical record of all
bitcoin activity yes going back to the beginning so let's just say that this does scale and your
predictions are correct yeah then perhaps once the trust and the network effect um of this really
expand globally maybe a higher percentage of the transactions would be in this layered way
oh totally or something new in the actual blockchain yeah it's not just lightning is what
i'd prefer because it's still sovereign like you you can use lightning in a way where you control
it where you can be around bank that's the motto of bitcoin but what's likely gonna happen is what's
happening now is custodial like basically people buy bitcoin on coinbase or whatever
and they think they have bitcoin they don't they have a paper claim to bitcoin they have a claim
on bitcoin and this is what we found out with ftx is that you had like i don't know people had they
thought they had eight billion dollars on ftx or whatever worth of bitcoin and there was zero so
this is why it's so important in bitcoin to to control your own funds to self custody um we do
not want to be rugged so it's very important if you own bitcoin to to to learn how to own it yourself
this is super super important um because if it's not your not your keys not your coins that's what
we say so uh briefly um you described that this is uh a physical cost using electricity what is
the the difference between proof of stake and proof of work and why is this important well
briefly in proof of stake the people who own the most of the thing get to determine the state of
the ledger and the rules of the system so it's kind of like a centralizing effect it's like a
it ends in some sort of oligarchy that's like the end of that road uh bitcoin and it's blend
it's special brand of proof of work is is much more decentralized um the the fact that you have
a lot of hash rate uh does not allow you to control bitcoin and it doesn't allow you to take
my bitcoin or change the rules and there's a really good book on this if you're interested in the
politics of it called the block size war by jonathan beer basically back when bitcoin was
more vulnerable in 2017 people who controlled 81 of all the mining in the world tried to change
bitcoin and they failed because the owning a lot of hash rate does not allow you to control bitcoin
but owning a lot owning 81 of all of the ethereum or all of the whatever coin that's on proof of
stake does allow you to control that coin so it's it's very fundamental it's very very fundamental
and very important that we have one coin that cannot be manipulated by the rich by the billionaires
that's key that's key so a common pushback um on bitcoin is that it's a heavy energy use item
to to create a currency in effect so um how much energy does it take to mine bitcoin maybe you
could along the way describe what is mining and what is your uh well what is the case for
justifying this energy usage sure so there was this big hubbub with green piece is very antagonistic
towards yeah towards bitcoin that i read recently but go ahead yeah it's a great this is a great
conversation i think it's important um bitcoin is processed issued stabilized by mining mining
is the act of expending electricity feeding it to the bitcoin network um this started with
laptops and home computers at the beginning and as more people join the system bitcoin has
this very special thing called the difficulty algorithm so every 2016 blocks which is about
two weeks 2016 times 10 minutes um the the the difficulty resets so if there's been like a
lot more people joining the network it goes up so that it is so that the amount of time it takes to
mine those blocks stays at 10 minutes so the network stabilizes that way like for example
when china when the ccp banned bitcoin mining two years ago and like the network lost 70% of its
electricity it didn't die what happened is a few days later it adjusted way down and everybody was
at the same level of difficulty the math problem became easier way easier yeah exactly so the more
people mining the harder the math problem um it's and it's basically very simply it's like
it's just computers that are specialized these days called asics to to to to guess numbers it's
just guessing and you're trying to get uh like a certain number it's called that you're looking
for something called the nonce um and it's like a very very very very very tiny number
and you're just trying to find it and you have these computers just going going going and every 10
minutes or so somebody finds it and then that person helps secure the a bunch of transactions to
the chain and then we move on and we build from there it's like it's kind of like a quite hot and
amber and they get compensated for that uh energy yeah they get they paid in two ways they get paid
with the block subsidy which right now is is 6.75 bitcoin and and will decrease over time to zero
it's kind of like a bootstrapping mechanism ultimately there won't be a subsidy and then
they also get paid fees so when i send you some bitcoin i attach a small fee so over time the fee
market will be what drives bitcoin uh mining the the fee the fee market rather than the mining market
well the the what miners will be getting in return for expending electricity will be fees
ultimately rather than the reward for solving them right now it's like almost it's like 90
there's a website you can check out uh called clark moody's dashboard it gives you all the
data but right now it's like 95 percent uh subsidy five percent fees over the next 50 years that'll
change to the other way around okay that's part of my question dude i have so many questions
yeah so 50 years from now let's just say at some point it switches so that it's five percent
subsidy or reward or amounts and 95 fees at that point does the whole network use less electricity
than than today i mean these things are extremely hard to predict i'm not going to pretend to make
predictions but over time i think you have two important factors um one is that uh there will be
an increased demand for bitcoin generally so there'll be more and more people mining
okay so there will be like on one hand more energy except except 50 years from now there's
going to be 20 and a half million of the 21 million coins already minted so there's there's
going to be minting fewer and fewer coins right yeah but the miners won't be worried about that
they're you're going to be trying to make the the money off the transaction fees that are people and
institutions and governments spending i mean there's there's um what i'm saying is that the the the
amount of new bitcoin being issued becomes less relevant in the future and eventually goes to zero
like uh or or the project fails like for bitcoin to succeed fees have to drive bitcoin miners
from a pure economic perspective like they have to make enough money off just the fees alone
50 years from now or else the project doesn't work so so it has to be used as a store of value
and a store of commerce in the future for it to work 100 and i think what's most likely is that
on-chain bitcoin transactions like that take 10 20 30 minutes will become very expensive in
relative terms and they'll be kind of like settlement like kind of like what fedwire does
or what central banks do or you know like maybe for very very very big things you may do an on-chain
transaction but for like retail any if you're someone and you want to use bitcoin to buy coffee
you're like send a remittance like you're not going to be using on-chain you're going to either
be using custodial bitcoin through a service or you're going to use something like lightning so
in any event like you won't be paying that fee okay so i have my own response to this question
one of the few that i have an opinion on in this topic but how how do you justify
yes the large energy use of mining for bitcoin
because because it's a double expenditure of energy right you spend energy when you create
the currency and then when you buy something with it that's another claim on energy and resources
in the world yes in a sense yes i i think that the most important thing is to acknowledge that
bitcoin is valuable to a lot of disenfranchised people around the world that's like the thing
i've uncovered in my work so yep once we established that and and i know that people
be skeptical about that but you just got to go talk to people like talk to people in legos talk to
people and i'm not skeptical you've convinced me no but a lot of i just fair to be skeptical
people should go out and do their homework but do do honest homework on this and you will learn that
that bitcoin is important for tens of millions of people around the world and and if you and if
your work is is successful you hope that tens of millions turns into hundreds of millions or or
billions yeah i mean from the human point of view and again we're about to get to the environment
like it would be fair if there was one currency standard for the world that no one could manipulate
like that would be equal rules for everybody this is not some sort of redistribution a scheme
you're not going to be able to um you know take from people remotely but it ensures
equality of monetary opportunity it means that like jeff bezos no longer can call up the fed
and get like a bailout like it's the same rules for everybody it doesn't mean that there's not
going to be rich and poor or huge inequalities or any of that stuff but it does mean that it's
going to address something very key in that we've had this thing called the cantillon effect
where the people who create the money uh get to give it to their friends first and they benefit
the most and then it the effects trickle down so as far as the energy stuff once you understand
that it's valuable then well then we have to start thinking in context so for example
and we'll do two things number one is like what kind of energy is bitcoin using and then how much
so i don't i like to think of it in raw energy as well as carbon footprint right these are two
kind of key key ways to look at it so raw energy yes bitcoin uses the amount of electricity of like
a small to mid-sized country and it fluctuates it could be poland it could be argentina the
cambridge electricity uh cambridge bitcoin mining website has has this data right you can see the raw
amount of electricity expended what i think is important to realize there are two things context
so the world's big countries use a lot more energy than the world's small countries so for
example like um i think norway uses more electricity it's four million people than the bottom 40
countries in the world combined so first of all we have this vast energy inequality that i've seen
you talk about so that's one thing to understand when we say like uh well argentina well what if
i were to tell you that um you know air conditioners in the united states use like way more electricity
than argentina right so when it comes to carbon footprint which is what i'm particularly interested
in um bitcoin has a smaller carbon footprint than the cruise ship industry for example and um
i think about that a lot because like cruise ships are great i understand they give people
jobs but ultimately it's a luxury thing for people if no one's going to die if we don't have
cruise ships um bitcoin's not a luxury for a lot of people it's going to end up becoming like a
lifeline for for many many people so i think it's all about the value proposition like do you think
it's important for us to spend our very scarce energy on i say yes based on what i've seen so
you're saying that it requires energy and that's a good thing because if it didn't require energy
or a biophysical cost it could be corrupted and the whole logic for why it works wouldn't wouldn't
hold correct it needs to consume a real world scarce asset um and i don't mean scarce in terms of
non renewable i just mean like not infinite not easily producible um the second part of what
go ahead yeah go ahead no no no go ahead no no the second half of this that i find really interesting
is that there's a guy named daniel batten he's a he's a kiwi an environmentalist from new zealand
who's done a lot of work on this he's got incredible data and charts so by his metrics um so bitcoin
is already like more than half renewed powered by nuclear plus renewables and it's increasing it
at six percent a year in this direction but by by what he's seeing now why does this make sense
this makes sense for for now because in our current climate like we have entered we have
deflation in renewables like they're they're getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper
i know a lot of that's because of government subsidies but it is what it is like it they're
getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper for now i know that you have like opinions on
that but um i do bitcoin miners are only going to use the cheapest possible energy their margin of
profits really tiny so like they cannot compete with like a residential consumer of energy they
cannot pay ten cents a kilowatt hour they can only pay like three four five six you're already
starting to get like it's too expensive so that's why you see bitcoin miners in cyberia in experimenting
with otak off the coast of hawaii that's why you see them um in you know that's why what this is a
great thing uh to learn about why was all the bitcoin mining in china because the chinese
government overbuilt hydro in the south central part of the country and you just had massive dam
spinning and it wasn't the energy wasn't going anywhere it was being curtailed so people were
like oh we'll take that so they were taking all of this and then when the rainy season ended they
had to go up to this dirty coal up in where shenzhen is and use that until they got kicked out by the
ccp two years ago but the reason why all the miners were attracted to china in the first place was
because of this massive excess hydro energy that nobody was using so generally speaking bitcoin
miners use energy that nobody else wants or that would be wasted otherwise so this is one of the
other things for now increasingly so we don't see uh we have enough we have no evidence that
this won't continue to be the case well no i it's i can foresee i can easily foresee a time
10 20 years from now where coal is the cheapest energy uh because we we've then bitcoin miners
would use coal maybe i should be very honest about that right right so so here's the point i wanted to
make um i think there's a superficial critique from especially the climate movement that oh my
god you're you're burning uh energy to create this currency how unsustainable is that well think
about the energy implications of our of our us dollar of the petro dollar we create it used to be
95 percent now around 80 percent of our money is created when a commercial bank makes a loan
and there is no tether at all to anything scarce or any resource now it's down to about 80 percent
the other 20 percent is created when the government has a deficit and they don't have enough money to
pay for it and they create money uh they spend it into existence also there is no like when a dollar
is created there is the tiny tiny tiny energy connotation of the linen that it's printed on
but that's minuscule the major impact is we have created trillions of dollars instantly in claims
on copper oil forest dolphin habitat every war that the us has fought abroad since 67 has been
paid on the national credit card so literally spending into existence uh for example like
americans are on the hook to pay one trillion dollar we've already paid a trillion dollars on
interest alone for the afghan iraq wars we're gonna pay another trillion by 2030 so all of the 911
post-911 wars are credit card wars so exactly you're right all of these things we're doing out there
with these massive like oil like oil power ships and all this stuff is all possible because of the
currency system 100 percent and so that is a egregious use of energy that the critiques by
greenpeace and others of bitcoin don't take into account like this is our real monetary system
is a huge burden on energy like i mentioned before that what is the carbon footprint of
quantitative easing we have these artificially low interest rates and printing all this stimulus
the us military alone i mean the us military is the largest consumer of fossils so in the world so
like by the way i really respect the fact that you um you use the semantic term of fossils
as opposed to fossil fuels well i mean name them fossil fuels that that adds power to us
using them as fuels but go on yeah the the point being that um we the bitcoin is an experiment i
mean i i think it's going to succeed it could fail for a variety of reasons but it's small
relatively today okay but what we've seen is that it for macroeconomic reasons it uses primarily
energy that's wasted or stranded and this tends to be increasingly renewable for now for now um
and i think that's really interesting because the u.s it's a lot cleaner it's a lot greener than the
u.s energy grid like by far um so i it's funny that like the new york times loves evs even though
the the human costs of as you pointed out of electric cars are egregious in terms of where
you get the the rare earths and stuff are um and then and then you know but then they attack
bitcoin mining machines i mean a bitcoin miner is an electric car it's just a user of energy it
has a bitcoin miner is just as is only going to be as green as what energy is used to power it
and guess what bitcoin miners use a greener grid a greener you know portfolio than evs do so it's
like i think people just miss that point it's very important like bitcoin mining itself has no
emissions it's the energy that's used to power it so we have to look at what exactly is powering it
and what's really amazing what i'll just say that's that's that i think is important is that never
before have humans been able to take advantage of stranded energy for economic purposes in the same
way like we tend to settle on rivers like along places where we can like power and electrify
so you have all this stranded geothermal energy on the western coast of the north america uh
south america in the rift valley you have potentially otek in the oceans none of this made any sense
to to harness because it was always far away from where people lived now with a starlink
and bitcoin miners you can just take advantage of that you can also very importantly make a lot
of money mining bitcoin off of uh methane emissions um from both gas fields and landfills
we're just starting to uncover what that's going to mean but like basically bitcoin could run for
the next 50 years off of landfills alone off of just the the emissions of landfills alone
so what you're saying is we're not technologically there yet like over the next 10 years you're
going to see companies and entrepreneurs start to figure out how to mine bitcoin off landfills
and off of methane emissions and in jungles and in in the middle of the ocean like this is this
none of this has happened yet it's all starting to emerge
is does it assume all that advanced technology that might turn waste into a potentially stable
currency uh alternative in the future does that require higher and higher bitcoin prices
to manifest yeah i mean i i look i think that overall yes if bitcoin
does not increase in value to a certain extent it's gonna be hard to economically make things work
um i i think that bitcoin will become really valuable for the two reasons i laid out earlier
because of deep platforming and devaluation i think people are gonna want an open neutral
currency i think that that's going to like people are gonna really want that in the future um and
people already really wanted across the global south now here's the thing so let me give you
a micro example that helps color my thinking on this friend of mine uh his name's eric hersman
he's a he's out in kenya he's born in sudan he's a entrepreneur there he started a company called
gridless um and what they do is they they do originally had nothing to do with bitcoin it was
micro hydro energy grid stuff so they go to a village that has a stream running through it um
they bring in a micro hydro they drop it in they run a little tube they put a fish guard on it the
water comes back zero environmental impact and now all of a sudden the town has cheap energy now
typically you know who's gonna make the investment on that and how are you gonna make money on that
is the big question so they've figured out that bitcoin mining is is is how you make the money
so you come in right away you mine bitcoin and you start making money and the town gets electricity
which doesn't have and it gets it way cheaper than it otherwise could and the company that comes
in the investment doesn't have to be bill gates like they're not altruistic they're making money
also so what you're going to start seeing in east africa with the gridless and other companies
are huge tracts of people who've never had electricity before coming online as a result
of bitcoin mining because no other there's no other thing in the world that that can harness
that energy the same way it is a very unique type of energy consumer um and the other thing that's
really cool about bitcoin is because i'm interested in energy grids it's the best demand response
technology we've ever seen because of the way that it can turn off precisely perfectly anytime
it's not like a steel factory where if you turn off for too long the steel will set you have just
like it's that these bitcoin miners can turn off on a dime like this so what i think is gonna end up
happening is a lot of these grids are gonna have overbuilt renewables doing bitcoin mining
and then that can just shift into whatever the the grid operators need it you're seeing this in
texas already which is really interesting so i have like 20 more questions but i think we are
going pretty long so let me um uh let let me hit the high questions and then yeah maybe you could
introduce me to your friend eric to talk about the energy and you could come back totally to
take a deeper dive in this so i understand the i now understand the logic on monetary sovereignty
and open societies and freedom and monetary colonialism and some of those issues i have
long understood and been aware of the demise of fiat currencies from a limits to growth perspective
but isn't what you're describing a serious threat to national government's currencies and fiat's
currencies especially exactly at a time when they're becoming insolvent so i think first and foremost
it's a threat to dictators because if you think about what bitcoin is and what uh america is premised
on it's it's really like three things free speech private private private property and open capital
markets um and bitcoin exemplifies those things it gives anybody in the world private property
real private property not private property that you have to rely on the government to protect
you can protect it with math you can actually own something that you can pass on to future
generations with math this is a huge revolution you don't need id you could be anybody in the world
gives you private property it gives you free speech no one can censor your bitcoin transaction
which you now is powering social networks by the way um nostra is the big one that that i'm
following that's really interesting um and it also is 24 7 available it's an open capital market
china the ccp putin they need three things they need censorship confiscation and closed
capital markets they cannot power the yuan uh or the ruble without these things so i think
at first yes dictators will like bitcoin because they can go around sanctions do this stuff
but ultimately it's a disaster because it moves power of the economy of the money into the hands
of the people and away from the government that's really bad for dictators my optimistic view is
that it's really good for democracies a good democracy should be okay with people having power
with people having power over the government with the government serving the people so i think
what ends up happening is some of our excesses in america get paired back like for example like
social welfare is paid for by taxes in america it's not paid for by borrowing so if we all
of a sudden had a bitcoin standard or whatever we wouldn't have any problems paying for social
benefits we'd have problems paying for wars in asia that's what we'd have problems paying for
and you know what maybe the citizens would eventually say screw that we're not going to
have wars in asia so i i think that there's a lot of nuance here but i'm very hopeful about a system
that has a little more restraint to it i think that we've both taught ourselves that we need this
flexibility but what does the flexibility give us i mean it's created a monster i mean for the
average american this system since post-71 political economy has not been great but if you're in the
one percent it's been amazing so yes they will fight it a hundred percent a hundred percent
well this gets to another one of my questions is if bitcoin let's just say i've told my friends
this for a long time that i think there's a 50 chance that bitcoin goes to 500 000 and a 50 chance
it goes to zero but in in the case that it does go up astronomically like 20 30 50x from where it is
doesn't the cantaline effect apply here in spades in that those early adopters of bitcoin will be
trillionaires so there is a serious wealth inequality in the world
so it's a really good question that i thought a lot about and i think that's one of the reasons
i spend a lot of time advocating for communities that i care about to learn about bitcoin like i'd
never say to invest to buy bitcoin i say invest your time in it learn about it um if nothing else
it teaches you about money and about the world around you which i think is is really helpful for
people um i think that ultimately it is going to reduce some of the grossest inequalities we have
like i told you it's it's not a redistributionist scheme like if like tax policy for governments
is going to have to change like it's going to have to be more like consumption tax like it's
it's just is um but like for example the whole system we were talking about for the like first
hour of this conversation is predicated on one country being able to mint the reserve currency
like if brazil wants 30 30 billion dollars and we are allied with brazil well it's paperwork
we'll just give them 30 billion dollars if bitcoin is a reserve we have to be like wait a second who's
bitcoin like it becomes much more of a careful thing okay much more we have to be much more
reasonable about it we have to much be more more prudent about it so i think that it introduces
a lot more uh caution to what governments do with their spending it ties them to their people
a lot more one of the reasons why we had these wars in america that have been really destructive
i think to our country over the last 20 25 years is because the government doesn't have to tax that
for them or do war bonds so like world war two was almost entirely paid for by direct taxation
that citizens knew about or by war bonds so americans bought the equivalent of like three or four
trillion dollars of war bonds something like uh 80 million americans bought war liberty bonds during
world war two and there was a draft and taxes were very high okay fast forward to today no draft
taxes uh there are no war taxes and there are no war bonds at all so it's all paid for on the credit
card that's very damaging to democracy even philosophers like cunt knew about this they said
if if you borrow to fight it's not good for your country so i think our system is just out of control
when it comes to this sort of thing like it needs to be paired back a little bit and i think your
work on like how our our credit system has become completely detached from the world around us is
is one of the reasons you see so much destruction and inequality could bitcoin survive a great
simplification when i sat there and saw your last presentation i was thinking to myself like
this is kind of what it looks like i mean i think this they could happen at the same time because
i think what the great simplification is on one level and in in your terms is is directly related
to fossils right um and the bubble coming down but it also represents the the collapse of sovereign
debt and you know one of the things is this you got what you got whatever it is an 80 90 trillion
dollars of sovereign debt 50 60 trillion dollars of corporate debt you have a hundred 15 trillion
dollar plus debt market right and the problem with so much of that debt is that it's what i would
consider odious odious debt is debt that is borrowed by a government without the population
consenting and so much of what the imf and world bank lent to the world over the last 70 50 60 years
has been odious like to dictators to corrupt government officials and so much of what those
governments now there's not as much direct borrowing from the imf or even from china it's
still really important it's half of the debt 60 percent of the debt of the global south is still
like borrowing but 40 percent is bonds but that's just the government selling out their people for
you know for for you know selling out the future of their people so between bonds and debt you have
just it's just this enormous amount of odious debt and i think that has to unwind one way or another
and it's not going to be pretty it's going to be very difficult i think that unwind will coincide
with your simplification but i think ultimately we will have debt government debt governments will
always be able to borrow we're going to have community debt we're going to have municipal
debt we're going to have corporate debt but it will have i think a much less exaggerated role in the
world and i think more will be done with value for value local community peer-to-peer transactions
and i think that the ingenuity that gets unlocked by the whole world being on the same currency
standard is incalculable i mean today like the wage disparities that happen and the exploitation
that happens because of the different currencies is is unfathomable and if we were all on the same
currency wow i just think it would make such a massive difference i'll give you one small
practical example if you want to send money to nigeria today the government imposes a fake rate
of 450 naira per dollar naira is the currency they use there that if you send to western union your
recipient only gets 450 per dollar but the street rate is 750 meaning the government steals 300 naira
per dollar for every dollar that goes you send bitcoin your recipient gets the actual full 750
so imagine if all of a sudden we had an equal world where we were all using one currency
i mean i think that's that's the vision and it's it's going to have a cost a big cost
and one of those costs is going to be energy the question is what kind of energy does it use
and that's an open question i think that like things like otak are so fascinating to me you know
if i'm a u.s government treasury official uh becoming aware of the things that you've said
here i would be yeah quite scared how can the government shut down bitcoin or its usage the
way that fdr did with gold and how do government central bank digital currencies fit into this
conversation yeah well remember when i said that bitcoin has two thousand and sixteen blocks um and
then and then there's an adjustment in its difficulty that's 6102 backwards and satoshi's
birth meaning executive order 6102 which fdr passed to outlaw gold and satoshi chose april fifth as
their birthday april fifth is the day that fdr passed 6102 so i think i think there's a lot of
evidence that shows that satoshi was trying to create something that couldn't be taken from the
from the people um so far so good i mean i i think it's very unlikely that there's some sort of network
attack on bitcoin what we're seeing which is much more likely which we've seen for years is attacks
on bitcoin users so you're going to see governments make it illegal governments tax it do all these
things i think that's much more likely but at the same time you have game theory like this is a
rival risk world you're going to have some of these small nations and i've been very critical i'm
like one of the main one of the few prominent bitcoin voices that's very critical of bukele
and al salvador but i'm not critical of his bitcoin long critical of his authoritarianism
and his prison industry stuff like i think that how did that work out by the way when al salvador
linked their currency to bitcoin it was like twice as high as it is today well okay so first
of all i think it's exaggerated the role bitcoin has played like basically the government has said
it's bought some bitcoin it that they use dollars down there that's one of the reasons he did it
is because he's not sacrificing anything he doesn't control the monetary policy the fed does
and he doesn't get bailouts so i think it was a good idea for them to to push bitcoin as
something that people can use but ultimately it's had a pretty limited effect in the country like
it's it's not something that's really taken over but the broader question is is we've had
some 80 and 90 drops in in bitcoin three or four times at least and if that continues in
the future and we have countries that are linking poor financially poor citizens of the world
i can't have such a swing in their property uh what do you think about that yeah i find it
very unlikely that government like one possibility is that we could go to a kind of a breton wood
system with bitcoin eventually like i mean you're already starting to see countries start to go
back to gold right this is clear like you read the ft every day there's more countries trading
gold buying gold selling debt moving away from fiat going back to gold okay so i think it's
possible you could see governments start using bitcoin as like a savings instrument like for
for reserves but i think we're pretty far away from like governments and big banks and stuff like
that and people using bitcoin as like currency i i think that that's pretty far away and i think
that that probably just doesn't happen until bitcoin is less volatile which i think will
take a long time so i think these things kind of naturally kind of fit together like we're not
you're right i'm not going to use bitcoin as my daily currency if it's fluctuating like that
so it would have it would have to it have to chill out it has to get bigger like look think about
this way at its peak bitcoin was like a trillion dollars right at its peak when it was like 69
thousand or whatever so gold is 10 trillion so the gold market moves but it's not like bitcoin
like a one percent change in gold's like a big deal like bitcoin just moved like three percent
today so but but if bitcoin was 10 times bigger it's going to be a lot less volatile and the
bigger and bigger and bigger it gets the less volatile it gets so this is just i think to
me kind of straightforward if it if it does succeed it ends up getting less volatile more
people use it it becomes more acceptable but there's a you started with zero and if you're
going to go from zero to world reserve currency it's not going to be a straight line like it's
going to be a roller coaster but uh i don't know we'll see i think the geopolitical outcome of bitcoin
is totally like who knows what matters to me as a human rights activist is that it's an incredibly
important tool for for activism and i think for environmentalists and for people concerned with
energy all eyes have to be on the dynamics of the energy consumption like what how is it what
is it consuming what is the trajectory um and if you're if you want to actually get involved
and make a difference how can you help um because this thing's not stopping there's no political
reason why the only way the the way to kill bitcoin would be to issue sound money that's not
going to be devalued ever again and that and and that's not going to be censored that would kill
bitcoin or or or or take down the internet yeah but even that like is not a way to like if the
internet goes down like globally for 24 hours like the bitcoin just doesn't move anywhere
doesn't kill bitcoin like you'd have to like we'd have to live in a world with literally without
internet which i just see seems very impractical but but but if you may but if governments were
responsible then you wouldn't need bitcoin and it would die people wouldn't feed it energy uh but
until that day people will feed it energy so so the question is governments are never going to be
responsible i don't think exactly so so so why like the prospective environmentalists like
daniel batten is that they're proactive they've seen what bitcoin does they understand the value
proposition they know it's gonna grow so they're saying okay how can we seed investments so that
people start to realize that they can make a lot of money mining bitcoin off of landfills and off of
methane and off of renewables instead of fossils like i think that's a rational way forward if you
care about this that's just something i think i care about so let me ask you one more bitcoin
question and then i'm gonna get into closing questions and congratulations alex this will be
the longest podcast i've ever done um it's been a lot of fun i realized by the way i'm just to say
i'm so appreciative of your open mind uh and your willingness to talk uh it's really fun and i really
really respect that um so thank you dude i'm i'm trying to figure it out everyone has a piece of
the story and uh i'm learning i i i started this podcast to share knowledge with the systems ecology
network i had but in in doing this i've learned a ton from people like you and others i i saved
this piece we have to mention this okay just i don't know if your listeners know what otek is
but it's like a way to harness energy from the different thermal layers in the ocean and it
really hasn't made sense because like how are you going to get the energy from a barge out in the
ocean to the land where people need it so it's kind of just been like this idea there's been some
it's it's not a new idea i mean it's been around for a long time but now think with bitcoin mining
so there's there's this guy named Nate Harman he's got a project out in hawaii where otek is is
basically if you where where has there been exploitation in the tropic seas that's where
otek makes sense that's where it works doesn't work with cold water so like it's so perfect
as a serendipity thing that like you could have these otek farms which are just these
boats or barges with like a liquid in a u shape and it just moves the liquid and it powers right
you could have this all over the global south creating electricity and and it could be bootstrap
by bitcoin mining like bitcoin miners would be the first customers of all these otek farms
then eventually they would elect they would connect it to the land and power everything else
i think the role of bitcoin as a bootstrapper for new experimental renewable energies is
is really important and really interesting and there's nothing else that can approximate that
so anyway i just wanted to leave that kind of hopeful message out there before we go to the
well building building on the hopeful message just so that i can visualize what you're visualizing
pick a date 15 20 years from now yeah um and how does bitcoin change or improve
what i view and i think you view as a post growth world that will we're gonna have a warmer temperature
there probably will be uh i mean probably the middle of the distribution there will be more
humans they will probably be materially poorer on average than today due to because we'll be on the
downslope of the carbon pulse there will be international migrations and you know political
upheaval and all kinds of things you know what's the paint a picture of what that looks like that
future that where bitcoin is much more prominent than it is today so i think bitcoin is the life
boat not the iceberg i don't think it's a magic panacea i think it's it's a practical tool that
people can use uh voluntarily no one can force bitcoin on you in fact they're going to try to
force you away from it um if it if it works for you you can use it and if you're a business
person or an entrepreneur an engineer or just somebody needs to send money home from your job
like you can use it it's it's a tool it's a practical tool that listeners should learn how
to use and should learn should not should educate themselves about i think it's not going to save
us from what i really believe will happen this sort of simplification type thing um i don't know
how much of it is related to financial crisis versus an energy crisis i mean obviously they're
very tied together but i do think we're in a bubble and that bubble will unwind and i think that
the majority of the world's population already knows what that feels like and we in the west
don't like Sri lankans know what that feels like because they're experiencing it right now
it means you wait three hours for gas at petrol stations it means that your currency goes to zero
it means that you don't have any food it means that people starve now we don't we have not experienced
that in the west in a long time obviously except in ukraine i guess if you want to say that's a
western country because we've sheltered ourselves from that i think that could happen here but that
doesn't mean bitcoin won't be a valuable tool for everybody again i think it's a lifeboat it's
a tool you should learn how to use it it'll be really useful i think it's going to be valuable
because things could get difficult in this next 20 30 40 years i think and what it will do is it
will preserve value over time and will allow you to do what you want to do i i'm i know that there's
a lot of like right-wing crazy stuff about central bank digital currencies around there these days
but a lot of it's true like the governments do want to control your energy and food consumption
and and they want to prevent you from buying certain things and they're going to do that
through digital cbdcs and bitcoin is the alternative i mean is the plan b so i think like again it's
not a panacea it's not some magic wand thing it's a tool it can be used for good it can be used for
bad but it will transform the world so i think people should really educate themselves about it
yeah the cbdcs that would be another conversation topic because i do think we're
headed that way and i think you're right it's because they want to control the money supply
and then they could go negative interest rates and it wouldn't have the crazy impact on our current
financial system okay this was awesome you have uh you're a follower of this podcast so you know
what's coming next a few closing personal questions sure you are a great simplification
fluent and you've thought about this and have been clearly working in this sector as a career
choice do you have any personal advice to the listeners not financial per se but at this global
time of of metacrisis yeah i think as we move through this it's so important to be empathetic
understanding with people who've already gone through a great simplification because they can
teach us so much so i would try to learn more about the third world debt crisis like talk to
people you know from the global south like learn about what that how did they get by like they
didn't go anywhere they're still there like that's the thing about the simplification i think it'll
happen it doesn't end to humanity it's just it's a massive setback and it's going to be a tragedy
and it's going to be really difficult but we're going to keep going so uh just like in peru in
the 1980s they had a great simplification it became twice as hard to earn the same amount of calories
and guess what they're survived and a lot of they they thrive they figured out a way to thrive so
let's talk to our fellow human beings who've already gone through the great simplification
and let's learn from them that would be like the biggest piece of advice i could give you and
let's stop living in our in our bubble our post 71 western bubble you're the first person that has
said that and i i couldn't agree more um and that is what i think is going to happen too it's going
to be a tragedy and it's going to be chaotic and we're going to get through it and that's this
conversation is how do we best get through that towards some saner uh more desirable and i can
tell you someone 1980 in peru would have loved to have 24 seven access from a phone to an asset
that could not be seized or confiscated by their government that would have been really useful
and that's the thing uh whether it was political oppression like my ancestors fleeing the holocaust
or whatever like or countless syrian or eritrean refugees i've met like afghans like like people
have not had an opportunity to bring their property and wealth with them or to or to preserve it in a
time of distress until now and the number of people i've met who've literally brought their life with
them through bitcoin whether it's on a flash drive or by memorizing the seed phrase is pretty
astonishing and it's just it's pretty cool like it it is a way out so at least i think i think it
can help i i i think it can help at worst it becomes uh at worst it it's a tool that's helpful um
you know so we'll see wearing my systems ecology hat i have to think about this more but it does
almost seem like bitcoin could be one of the another cans to kick in service of the maximum
power principle and it will be good for those humans that adopt it but may not be good for the
ultimate ecological overshoot but i'm gonna i'm gonna withhold my opinion on that i mean that's
very possible yeah um so what about young young people i heard uh a crying child in the background
how would you change your advice to young humans listening to this i think that young humans are
going to get a lot of good advice i think that the unique one i can give is i think that young
people should learn about money i think we can put bitcoin aside for a second like when i was
growing up i had i went to a good public school in the united states uh we didn't learn about money
we didn't learn about personal money we didn't learn about credit cards we didn't learn about the
way banking system works we didn't learn about the dollar abroad we didn't learn about any of that
stuff and you know what it's just as important as all the other subjects you learn in school and
it's not taught so i guess as families as communities we need to teach our children about what is money
what is credit like and i know there's different theories and people argue but great let's get
our kids involved in those debates do you remember what i said uh at my lecture at stanford when i
was talking about money i said a lot of things when i was 14 yeah my dad had the conversation
with me that was kind of awkward about where babies came from uh which i which i already knew
but he never had the talk with me about where money comes from yes yes yes which none of us
really know um so look you want to have your look some some people are they think they believe in
commodity money and some people believe in in credit money and and it's fine just teach your
kids what you know i mean it's important for them to learn and then they'll like pick their own holes
and they'll find their own way but if you're 16 17 and you've actually thought about this
i think it'll really help you get ahead it'll help you plan your life it'll help you be more
responsible um especially when you can learn a little bit about interest rates and about borrowing
i think that that's that's really important yeah anyway what do you care most about in the world
alex well i'm biased i'm an rights activist i care about freedom because i think it's so
central because without freedom it's difficult for us to improve as humans it's difficult for us
to stop annihilating the environment i mean the stuff i've seen in my research and the people i've
talked to based on authoritarianism in the global south has led to an exploitation i mean has led to
just the enormous pillaging of natural resources i mean forget emissions for a second i mean the
environmental crimes that happened not only during the imperialism but just in in the 60s and 70s
and 80s alone in the amazon in west papa and all these places is totally unspeakable and it happened
because there's no rule of law in those places i mean these multilateral lending institutions
they like suharto as a client because they're not going to have to deal with street protests or
supreme court they could just deal with the dictator and that's it so i i think freedom is so
important because without freedom we can't protect our planet like we have a program at the human
rights foundation called defending the defenders where we support environmentalists from from inside
dictatorships now most of them are in prison or you've never heard of them if you're an environmentalist
environmentalist in egypt or in iran or in china you're either dead in prison or in exile you can't
be an environmentalist in these places so i think it's so so important that we address freedom first
and foremost or at least in the conversation coming to the united states i mean we we we could see it
i'm telling you i mean i mean look at india i know and again greenpeace you know that's for
another conversation but you know greenpeace in india was de-platformed from their bank a few years
ago it's going to happen to all environmentalists at some point or another like you will wake up in
your money will be no longer working you will find out very quickly as a non-profit organizer
that if your money doesn't work it's very difficult to do your activism so that's why i want to get
all these these podcasts uh on on record quickly yeah i'm mostly kidding um so if you could wave
a magic wand what is one thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures or or should
i guess well i mean i guess it's pretty obvious from the context of our conversation but it would
be awesome if all countries were liberal democracies uh i understand that may be impossible and maybe
even my work points to the fact that liberal democracy can only exist if if there's countries
to exploit i don't know i don't know we don't have a counterfactual but i will say that i do
believe in democratic peace theory more or less i don't think that democracies like to fight each
other for a variety of reasons mainly because the people are holding the government accountable
and i think that if all nations were somewhat more democratic or you know liberal democratic
there'd be a lot less violence a lot less exploitation and we would address planetary
challenges much better so that's the wand i would wave is to turn all the authoritarians
into democrats but i understand that that requires a total transformation of our own systems
and and some of our psychologies perhaps yes yeah so awesome dude so good to take a deep dive with
you um i've recently chosen to do this format where i interview a guest for the first time and and
give them a a a mic to explain their passion and their expertise and their worldview but if i had
you back again what is something a sub a subset of of this conversation what is one topic that
you're super passionate about that we could take a full deep dive just in that one thing
yeah i'll give you three three quick examples that i that i love sorry i mean we'll just do it i mean
one would be just going kind of more deep into the the imf world bank thing it's just such an
incredible story crazy story of how these institutions came to be and what they do and
how they basically get away with what they do um the second thing would be the french colonial
currency i would love to come on with someone a friend of mine from togo for example to help
explain it to your audience it's a shocking thing it's a shocking thing that this thing still exists
the third thing is the israeli palestine uh currency thing i did a really deep dive into this and
what most palestinians have told me they don't even know is that when uh there were nobel prizes
given out for the aslo accords something that happened at the same time was called the paris um
paris accord uh paris agreement paris protocol sorry paris protocol and the paris protocol was
an agreement that arifat signed giving up all monetary rights for palestinians so they don't
have their own currency they can't have their own currency they can't have their own central bank
they don't control any of the labor laws with regard to people going in and out with west bank
into israel um that was something that that they gave up to get political independence um
now we find out later that that's not a good trade-off like you you need economic and monetary
independence to be free as a nation this is absolutely clear so today palestinians use the
currency of their occupier can you imagine like how psychologically damaging that is so i've met
a whole bunch of palestinians in gaza i spoke to a guy in gaza over telegram who's who's he's
really into bitcoin it's the only way he can get money from his family it's crazy so there's a whole
bunch of bitcoin stuff happening in palestine i think that would make for a really interesting
episode and i can bring on a friend from from palestine so those would be my three suggestions
yeah awesome lots going on in the world that i'm unaware of uh it's it's a big story and a big
challenge that we face thank you for all your work on human rights thank you for your time today
and uh to be continued my friend yes thank you so much man really appreciate the conversation
