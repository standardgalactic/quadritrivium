texas already which is really interesting so i have like 20 more questions but i think we are
going pretty long so let me um uh let let me hit the high questions and then yeah maybe you could
introduce me to your friend eric to talk about the energy and you could come back totally to
take a deeper dive in this so i understand the i now understand the logic on monetary sovereignty
and open societies and freedom and monetary colonialism and some of those issues i have
long understood and been aware of the demise of fiat currencies from a limits to growth perspective
but isn't what you're describing a serious threat to national government's currencies and fiat's
currencies especially exactly at a time when they're becoming insolvent so i think first and foremost
it's a threat to dictators because if you think about what bitcoin is and what uh america is premised
on it's it's really like three things free speech private private private property and open capital
markets um and bitcoin exemplifies those things it gives anybody in the world private property
real private property not private property that you have to rely on the government to protect
you can protect it with math you can actually own something that you can pass on to future
generations with math this is a huge revolution you don't need id you could be anybody in the world
gives you private property it gives you free speech no one can censor your bitcoin transaction
which you now is powering social networks by the way um nostra is the big one that that i'm
following that's really interesting um and it also is 24 7 available it's an open capital market
china the ccp putin they need three things they need censorship confiscation and closed
capital markets they cannot power the yuan uh or the ruble without these things so i think
at first yes dictators will like bitcoin because they can go around sanctions do this stuff
but ultimately it's a disaster because it moves power of the economy of the money into the hands
of the people and away from the government that's really bad for dictators my optimistic view is
that it's really good for democracies a good democracy should be okay with people having power
with people having power over the government with the government serving the people so i think
what ends up happening is some of our excesses in america get paired back like for example like
social welfare is paid for by taxes in america it's not paid for by borrowing so if we all
of a sudden had a bitcoin standard or whatever we wouldn't have any problems paying for social
benefits we'd have problems paying for wars in asia that's what we'd have problems paying for
and you know what maybe the citizens would eventually say screw that we're not going to
have wars in asia so i i think that there's a lot of nuance here but i'm very hopeful about a system
that has a little more restraint to it i think that we've both taught ourselves that we need this
flexibility but what does the flexibility give us i mean it's created a monster i mean for the
average american this system since post-71 political economy has not been great but if you're in the
one percent it's been amazing so yes they will fight it a hundred percent a hundred percent
well this gets to another one of my questions is if bitcoin let's just say i've told my friends
this for a long time that i think there's a 50 chance that bitcoin goes to 500 000 and a 50 chance
it goes to zero but in in the case that it does go up astronomically like 20 30 50x from where it is
doesn't the cantaline effect apply here in spades in that those early adopters of bitcoin will be
trillionaires so there is a serious wealth inequality in the world
so it's a really good question that i thought a lot about and i think that's one of the reasons
i spend a lot of time advocating for communities that i care about to learn about bitcoin like i'd
never say to invest to buy bitcoin i say invest your time in it learn about it um if nothing else
it teaches you about money and about the world around you which i think is is really helpful for
people um i think that ultimately it is going to reduce some of the grossest inequalities we have
like i told you it's it's not a redistributionist scheme like if like tax policy for governments
is going to have to change like it's going to have to be more like consumption tax like it's
it's just is um but like for example the whole system we were talking about for the like first
hour of this conversation is predicated on one country being able to mint the reserve currency
like if brazil wants 30 30 billion dollars and we are allied with brazil well it's paperwork
we'll just give them 30 billion dollars if bitcoin is a reserve we have to be like wait a second who's
bitcoin like it becomes much more of a careful thing okay much more we have to be much more
reasonable about it we have to much be more more prudent about it so i think that it introduces
a lot more uh caution to what governments do with their spending it ties them to their people
a lot more one of the reasons why we had these wars in america that have been really destructive
i think to our country over the last 20 25 years is because the government doesn't have to tax that
for them or do war bonds so like world war two was almost entirely paid for by direct taxation
that citizens knew about or by war bonds so americans bought the equivalent of like three or four
trillion dollars of war bonds something like uh 80 million americans bought war liberty bonds during
world war two and there was a draft and taxes were very high okay fast forward to today no draft
taxes uh there are no war taxes and there are no war bonds at all so it's all paid for on the credit
card that's very damaging to democracy even philosophers like cunt knew about this they said
if if you borrow to fight it's not good for your country so i think our system is just out of control
when it comes to this sort of thing like it needs to be paired back a little bit and i think your
work on like how our our credit system has become completely detached from the world around us is
is one of the reasons you see so much destruction and inequality could bitcoin survive a great
simplification when i sat there and saw your last presentation i was thinking to myself like
this is kind of what it looks like i mean i think this they could happen at the same time because
i think what the great simplification is on one level and in in your terms is is directly related
to fossils right um and the bubble coming down but it also represents the the collapse of sovereign
debt and you know one of the things is this you got what you got whatever it is an 80 90 trillion
dollars of sovereign debt 50 60 trillion dollars of corporate debt you have a hundred 15 trillion
dollar plus debt market right and the problem with so much of that debt is that it's what i would
consider odious odious debt is debt that is borrowed by a government without the population
consenting and so much of what the imf and world bank lent to the world over the last 70 50 60 years
has been odious like to dictators to corrupt government officials and so much of what those
governments now there's not as much direct borrowing from the imf or even from china it's
still really important it's half of the debt 60 percent of the debt of the global south is still
like borrowing but 40 percent is bonds but that's just the government selling out their people for
you know for for you know selling out the future of their people so between bonds and debt you have
just it's just this enormous amount of odious debt and i think that has to unwind one way or another
and it's not going to be pretty it's going to be very difficult i think that unwind will coincide
with your simplification but i think ultimately we will have debt government debt governments will
always be able to borrow we're going to have community debt we're going to have municipal
debt we're going to have corporate debt but it will have i think a much less exaggerated role in the
world and i think more will be done with value for value local community peer-to-peer transactions
and i think that the ingenuity that gets unlocked by the whole world being on the same currency
standard is incalculable i mean today like the wage disparities that happen and the exploitation
that happens because of the different currencies is is unfathomable and if we were all on the same
currency wow i just think it would make such a massive difference i'll give you one small
practical example if you want to send money to nigeria today the government imposes a fake rate
of 450 naira per dollar naira is the currency they use there that if you send to western union your
recipient only gets 450 per dollar but the street rate is 750 meaning the government steals 300 naira
per dollar for every dollar that goes you send bitcoin your recipient gets the actual full 750
so imagine if all of a sudden we had an equal world where we were all using one currency
i mean i think that's that's the vision and it's it's going to have a cost a big cost
and one of those costs is going to be energy the question is what kind of energy does it use
and that's an open question i think that like things like otak are so fascinating to me you know
if i'm a u.s government treasury official uh becoming aware of the things that you've said
here i would be yeah quite scared how can the government shut down bitcoin or its usage the
way that fdr did with gold and how do government central bank digital currencies fit into this
conversation yeah well remember when i said that bitcoin has two thousand and sixteen blocks um and
then and then there's an adjustment in its difficulty that's 6102 backwards and satoshi's
birth meaning executive order 6102 which fdr passed to outlaw gold and satoshi chose april fifth as
their birthday april fifth is the day that fdr passed 6102 so i think i think there's a lot of
evidence that shows that satoshi was trying to create something that couldn't be taken from the
from the people um so far so good i mean i i think it's very unlikely that there's some sort of network
attack on bitcoin what we're seeing which is much more likely which we've seen for years is attacks
on bitcoin users so you're going to see governments make it illegal governments tax it do all these
things i think that's much more likely but at the same time you have game theory like this is a
rival risk world you're going to have some of these small nations and i've been very critical i'm
like one of the main one of the few prominent bitcoin voices that's very critical of bukele
and al salvador but i'm not critical of his bitcoin long critical of his authoritarianism
and his prison industry stuff like i think that how did that work out by the way when al salvador
linked their currency to bitcoin it was like twice as high as it is today well okay so first
of all i think it's exaggerated the role bitcoin has played like basically the government has said
it's bought some bitcoin it that they use dollars down there that's one of the reasons he did it
is because he's not sacrificing anything he doesn't control the monetary policy the fed does
and he doesn't get bailouts so i think it was a good idea for them to to push bitcoin as
something that people can use but ultimately it's had a pretty limited effect in the country like
it's it's not something that's really taken over but the broader question is is we've had
some 80 and 90 drops in in bitcoin three or four times at least and if that continues in
the future and we have countries that are linking poor financially poor citizens of the world
i can't have such a swing in their property uh what do you think about that yeah i find it
very unlikely that government like one possibility is that we could go to a kind of a breton wood
system with bitcoin eventually like i mean you're already starting to see countries start to go
back to gold right this is clear like you read the ft every day there's more countries trading
gold buying gold selling debt moving away from fiat going back to gold okay so i think it's
possible you could see governments start using bitcoin as like a savings instrument like for
for reserves but i think we're pretty far away from like governments and big banks and stuff like
that and people using bitcoin as like currency i i think that that's pretty far away and i think
that that probably just doesn't happen until bitcoin is less volatile which i think will
take a long time so i think these things kind of naturally kind of fit together like we're not
you're right i'm not going to use bitcoin as my daily currency if it's fluctuating like that
so it would have it would have to it have to chill out it has to get bigger like look think about
this way at its peak bitcoin was like a trillion dollars right at its peak when it was like 69
thousand or whatever so gold is 10 trillion so the gold market moves but it's not like bitcoin
like a one percent change in gold's like a big deal like bitcoin just moved like three percent
today so but but if bitcoin was 10 times bigger it's going to be a lot less volatile and the
bigger and bigger and bigger it gets the less volatile it gets so this is just i think to
me kind of straightforward if it if it does succeed it ends up getting less volatile more
people use it it becomes more acceptable but there's a you started with zero and if you're
going to go from zero to world reserve currency it's not going to be a straight line like it's
going to be a roller coaster but uh i don't know we'll see i think the geopolitical outcome of bitcoin
is totally like who knows what matters to me as a human rights activist is that it's an incredibly
important tool for for activism and i think for environmentalists and for people concerned with
energy all eyes have to be on the dynamics of the energy consumption like what how is it what
is it consuming what is the trajectory um and if you're if you want to actually get involved
and make a difference how can you help um because this thing's not stopping there's no political
reason why the only way the the way to kill bitcoin would be to issue sound money that's not
going to be devalued ever again and that and and that's not going to be censored that would kill
bitcoin or or or or take down the internet yeah but even that like is not a way to like if the
internet goes down like globally for 24 hours like the bitcoin just doesn't move anywhere
doesn't kill bitcoin like you'd have to like we'd have to live in a world with literally without
internet which i just see seems very impractical but but but if you may but if governments were
responsible then you wouldn't need bitcoin and it would die people wouldn't feed it energy uh but
until that day people will feed it energy so so the question is governments are never going to be
responsible i don't think exactly so so so why like the prospective environmentalists like
daniel batten is that they're proactive they've seen what bitcoin does they understand the value
proposition they know it's gonna grow so they're saying okay how can we seed investments so that
people start to realize that they can make a lot of money mining bitcoin off of landfills and off of
methane and off of renewables instead of fossils like i think that's a rational way forward if you
care about this that's just something i think i care about so let me ask you one more bitcoin
question and then i'm gonna get into closing questions and congratulations alex this will be
the longest podcast i've ever done um it's been a lot of fun i realized by the way i'm just to say
i'm so appreciative of your open mind uh and your willingness to talk uh it's really fun and i really
really respect that um so thank you dude i'm i'm trying to figure it out everyone has a piece of
the story and uh i'm learning i i i started this podcast to share knowledge with the systems ecology
network i had but in in doing this i've learned a ton from people like you and others i i saved
this piece we have to mention this okay just i don't know if your listeners know what otek is
but it's like a way to harness energy from the different thermal layers in the ocean and it
really hasn't made sense because like how are you going to get the energy from a barge out in the
ocean to the land where people need it so it's kind of just been like this idea there's been some
it's it's not a new idea i mean it's been around for a long time but now think with bitcoin mining
so there's there's this guy named Nate Harman he's got a project out in hawaii where otek is is
basically if you where where has there been exploitation in the tropic seas that's where
otek makes sense that's where it works doesn't work with cold water so like it's so perfect
as a serendipity thing that like you could have these otek farms which are just these
boats or barges with like a liquid in a u shape and it just moves the liquid and it powers right
you could have this all over the global south creating electricity and and it could be bootstrap
by bitcoin mining like bitcoin miners would be the first customers of all these otek farms
then eventually they would elect they would connect it to the land and power everything else
i think the role of bitcoin as a bootstrapper for new experimental renewable energies is
is really important and really interesting and there's nothing else that can approximate that
so anyway i just wanted to leave that kind of hopeful message out there before we go to the
well building building on the hopeful message just so that i can visualize what you're visualizing
pick a date 15 20 years from now yeah um and how does bitcoin change or improve
what i view and i think you view as a post growth world that will we're gonna have a warmer temperature
there probably will be uh i mean probably the middle of the distribution there will be more
humans they will probably be materially poorer on average than today due to because we'll be on the
downslope of the carbon pulse there will be international migrations and you know political
upheaval and all kinds of things you know what's the paint a picture of what that looks like that
future that where bitcoin is much more prominent than it is today so i think bitcoin is the life
boat not the iceberg i don't think it's a magic panacea i think it's it's a practical tool that
people can use uh voluntarily no one can force bitcoin on you in fact they're going to try to
force you away from it um if it if it works for you you can use it and if you're a business
person or an entrepreneur an engineer or just somebody needs to send money home from your job
like you can use it it's it's a tool it's a practical tool that listeners should learn how
to use and should learn should not should educate themselves about i think it's not going to save
us from what i really believe will happen this sort of simplification type thing um i don't know
how much of it is related to financial crisis versus an energy crisis i mean obviously they're
