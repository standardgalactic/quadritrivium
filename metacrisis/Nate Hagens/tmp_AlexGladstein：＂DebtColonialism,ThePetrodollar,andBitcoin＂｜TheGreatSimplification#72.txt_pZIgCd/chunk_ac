an astonishing amount i mean you basically had a late 1920s kind of bubble in in sovereign debt
sales to uh to the global south so you had like little banks in the midwest of the united states
lending to angola stuff like that it was like completely crazy so there was a huge bubble
if you're a farmer or a small business person in angola and you have an idea and you need funding
for it just to use your example you would eventually get a million dollar loan from some bank in
illinois and you would be in your own country with your customers paying the angola currency
but you would have to pay your debt back your interest and eventually your principal
in us dollars i mean i wish it was that uh balanced what was actually happening is that
the farmers in iowa were depositing their money um and building up a banking system
in the midwest that was then making loans to a government a corrupt government in angola
which was not sharing any money with angolan farmers which was buying weapons uh stocking
up the police force paying interest off debt to the imf very very little of this money actually
made it to the people unfortunately but it was a massive bubble um incredible incredible amounts
of money 200 300 growth from the 78 to like 81 82 and then what happens um the the the age of
cheap credit ends right so you have all of this dollar denominated debt in all these countries
that can't print dollars so that they need dollars to get oil and and and often food commodities
things like that that they also need dollars to pay back their debt right now now we get back to
the the rising interest rates so vulgar now uh raises rates now they were high they were six seven
eight percent or whatever they were nine percent ten percent he raises them almost to 20 percent
so all of a sudden the cost of capital globally skyrockets it becomes extremely difficult for
all these countries to pay their debt that's back it becomes extremely difficult to afford everything
there's massive price inflation in the global south um and what happens can i ask a quick question
yeah yeah so if if in preceding those days if you borrowed money in us dollars the angle in
government presumably it was a 10-year loan or something that had a fixed rate so why would uh
rates going from seven to 20 affect the previous borrowings that no it is not like a us 30 year
fixed rate no no no no these rates are adjustable um and they would get renegotiated through something
called the paris club which folks should look up but basically just to be very brief we can
get into details later but world bank loans are very long 10 20 30 years and they often get read
adjusted through the paris club um the imf loans were supposed to be short term and they were
supposed to be fixed but again what what happens is that um you have a two-year imf loan for whatever
amount of money and your mabutu in zaire let's say horrible human rights abuse are you getting
bailed out by the imf for for unfortunate reasons um then you run out of money and the imf says well
are you gonna pay us and you're mabutu and you say no and what ends up happening is that they
they say fine we'll give you another loan and what's happening here is that and and and what's
and what happens in the 80s when mexico becomes the first country to to trigger to declare bankruptcy
and basically start the third world debt crisis when the united states in the west bailed out mexico
we weren't bailing them out for the because of empathy for mexican people or we weren't bailing
mabutu out because of empathy for zaireans we're bailing these these countries out to save our
own banks so what happened is our western banks got so over leveraged on debt to these nations
that if those countries collapsed we'd have a 1930s financial crisis so that's why in the 80s
and then again in the 90s and 94 with the peso crisis 98 with the 97 98 with the asian financial
crisis um the the european crisis 2010 11 12 every time another part of the world is about to collapse
we can't have that because that would mean that our banks have to write assets down they don't
want to do that they would rather extend more debt that's always been the solution so that's
why there's been an exponential rise in uh global south debt since the early 70s so i and anyway
go ahead alex yeah but i didn't know this uh my girlfriend and i are watching uh for the first
time actually the sopranos right now and boy it sure sounds like there's a lot of parallels
in the story that you're telling yeah no so so basically but volker's not like he's not mean
i don't think he doesn't want these people to suffer it's just not as part of his he's not
thinking about it i mean does he does powell know about the fact that shrillanka is collapsing in part
because of u.s financial policy i mean i don't know does powell or yellen or ben anking know about
the the carbon footprint of quantitative easing no that's that's a byproduct it's not in their
mandate right so the the point being that these interest rate hikes really harm a lot of people
abroad because not only do they create massive price inflation like just give you an example
the ft does a good job covering what's happening in egypt right now classic case could read reads
like the 1980s like the average egyptian is paying more and more money for brett astronomically more
than they were a couple years ago meanwhile the government's getting bailed out by the billions
by the imf now what's the government going to spend that money on the military so it can
keep itself in power this has just been the case forever and what ended up happening in the 80s
and what i fear is happening now in a lot of the world in the developing world is that you move
money out of the equation the number of hours you have to work to get a thousand grams of protein
or rice it's actually increasing so we would think that with technological deflation and with the
innovation of humans and all these advances in sterilization refrigeration health care all these
things you would have thought that in like the 70s and 80s between 1970 and 1990 that people all
around the world would have had to work less for the same amount of meat or rice now that's
certainly true in the west uh and the the increases in efficiency were crazy subsidized in large part
because of fossil fuels but in these other parts of the world where fossils were more scarce and
where there wasn't as much access to that sort of thing and they were getting squeezed by imf structural
adjustment policies squeezed by the rising cost of capital by the u.s government the amount of
hours you had to work to get a thousand grams of rice in peru for example or beef in some cases doubled
over a 15 to 20 a period of time so this is what i mean when i say wage deflation is this also what
you mean by um when you use the term monetary colonialism that's a very specific brand of
this what i'm describing is the general relationship between western powers and we'll call it the
developing world or the third world of the global south whatever you want to use but basically you
have the west and you have the developing world and the relationship for hundreds of years has
been somewhat similar first it was naked imperialism and then now it's more of a financial repression
story there are unique and specific instances of what i would refer to as monetary colonialism
that are that are good examples of this and and the most obvious case is found in west africa
and central africa so for example the french used to have straight up imperialism over a massive
amount of the global south including most a huge chunk of africa right so in the 50s and 60s they
were forced to decolonize they didn't want to they fought an unbelievably horrific war in algeria
because they really wanted that that gas there they ultimately had to leave but they really
didn't want to give up claims over these uh 15 countries in west and central africa from senegal
to togo to mali uh central africa and republic um for different a couple different reasons
one was cultural and linguistical they wanted to keep spreading the french language and culture
and and one was resource-based like they wanted the the uranium that was in the sahara desert
in these countries uh france gets lauded i think properly for having a really great nuclear program
but what most people don't know is for decades all of that uranium was essentially stolen from
their monetary colonial subjects in the sahara in places like chat and mali um so an an enormous
amount of like french um culture and prosperity and standards of life were subsidized by repressing
these people in 15 countries in africa and it was through the currency so basically it's called
this on the street people called the sifa it's the colonial french frank that's what it's still called
today um there's a really good book about this called africa's last colonial currency um yeah
i think your readers will find it really interesting um and i also have a chapter in my book check
your financial privilege on it but essentially the sifa is controlled by france it used to be
tied to the frank and then now it's sort of tied to the euro but between 44 when it was invented
in nine in the late 90s it was devalued 99.9 against the frank so basically the the french
squeezed all this economic life out of these countries and if you look they are not only
are all 15 authoritarian states so no democratic development um also they're like seven or eight
of them are the poorest countries in the world we're talking like guinea besa uh niger etc so
chad so these countries were stripped of their prosperity in an industry by france intentionally
and it's it's a shocking thing it's totally shocking like people
and the country and the country itself like when like the country for a long time these
countries had to had to keep a hundred percent of their reserves like their national earnings in
forex in paris and when they wanted to have some france would charge them so france got access
to all this capital they also had a market to sell expensive stuff too so you go down to like
Dakar all the cars are french because french just sold stuff to these countries and then there's
this thing where like if you are in ivory coast and you want to build a bridge or something you
have to first go to french um big you know uh contractors and and and offer the job to them
at a higher the market rate and only if they refuse can you go to the americans or chinese
similarly if you're selling coffee you have to go to the french first sell below market rate
and only if they refuse can you sell someone else so it's basically this is today or in the
past this is today now certain things have changed very slightly but the colonial currency continues
to exist today and all these countries are still in it because french prop france props up dictators
throughout the region um to to protect the system so it's pretty intense but basically what i'm saying
here is that um this is an this is an this is a an extreme example of the broader thing i'm
describing which is that western countries through the currency exploit um peripheral nations
and and and they subsidize their way of life this way so i should probably alex just shut
up and let you tell us what's important and i'd not ask you any questions because i have like
a hundred questions and you have a hell of a lot to say but i am going to interrupt here and say
two things uh one thing and then one question so until this conversation the way i think about
inflation and deflation is we have the deflationary impulse from new innovation and technology and
mass producing uh high definition television sets and because we get better at at those processes
that's paired with energy depletion where oil and copper and and materials are getting
less concentrated and they're more costly to extract and that ripples into our price system
but now realizing it that's kind of a western perspective because there's a third dynamic
that influences our our prices and our ability to afford things and that is this global financial
well uh colonial uh um monetary colonialism is what you said because those inflationary
deflationary pulses that i impulses that i just described in angola or chad or somewhere else
aren't as relevant as where the where their currency comes from and what they need to pay for
things well then you're totally right but i just add two things that you're hinting at like it's
also about get us getting cheap labor abroad like i mean if we had to make everything that we use in
the united states with our wages like our stuff would be way more expensive so obviously we've
outsourced a ton of that to china and elsewhere um and that's really important is that to slavery
in your book in your mind i mean i i think that the system is is corrupt and
unethical i mean it's evil in many ways i mean it's uh but it's it's not like you can point to
one person it's it's a it's an outcome of of the way the history is unfolded so it's really crazy
in my language it's uh it's an emergent property of past decisions that have resulted in this energy
i'm a total i'm a classic liberal i love freedom i love capitalism um but it's it's we don't have a
counterfactual here like we have our world where this is an outcome of our system now you can argue
that what we're doing you know no true scotsman thing you can say well this isn't capitalism and
i would say that's actually right because everything's totally centrally planned you have the petrodollar
you have us trade policy that prevents nations from trading equally with each other everything's
controlled so there's a little bit of that but but it's hard to separate our way of life from
exploiting other nations is what what i'm saying and just to give you a stat that that i think is
important again the point here is that these systems we've developed over time the fiat currency system
the world bank the imf the international financial system uh followed the age of of colonialism
and imperialism and and tried in many ways to replicate it and again the point was the resource
flow so here's a crazy stat that your audience probably doesn't know and i didn't know until
last year in 1982 the flow funds permanently switched from previously the global north sending
resources and investment to the global south to coming the other way around so since 1982 there's
been a growing drain of resources we're talking everything investment grants remittances commerce
all that stuff black market white market all of it um since 82 it's been flowing our way so global
south countries have been subsidizing us since 82 permanently and it started as a trickle and now
it's trillions of dollars a year so in many ways we've perfected this art of like exploiting the
other and this is the this is the stat so in 2015 the drain was 10.1 billion tons of raw materials
and 182 million person years of labor so that's 50 percent of all goods and 28 percent of all
labor used to that year by high income countries so all you need to do is think about it this way
pretend you didn't have half the you know pretend half our goods weren't like subsidized and pretend
28 percent of our labor wasn't subsidized what would happen to prices in new york and in philadelphia
like they'd be a lot higher so i'm just visualizing this as a giant siphon from the global south to
yes and it's all made possible with debt so basically the the whole system was the whole
idea was replace the the the warship and the gun and the bayonet with debt so debt became the weapon
and look like anyone listening from the global south that does not learning here probably much
like they know this they've lived this they've seen this they've seen wage deflation they've seen
stuff get worse i mean we talk about in america how wages have been stagnant since the 70s for
the lower middle class which is true i mean it's stagnant i mean in some of these countries you saw
20 to 30 decrease in gdp so one fact that i learned that was shocking when we talk about the human
toll of all this and you know forget the environmental toll for a second just on the human toll um
when a country like mexico which is a classic country that's had a lot of dealings with lending
with imf etc when when their gdp contracts by like two percent their mortality rate deteriorates by
one percent so think about when your g you know so like if you have a hundred million people
and your gdp goes down two percent you're you're you're losing a million people prematurely right
so think about um the 70s and 80s during what culminated in the third world debt crisis you had
countries that lost 10 20 30 percent of their gdp i mean so these these policies killed tens
of millions of people but they'll never be in accounting they'll never be any justice i mean
no one will ever go to prison in fact larry summers who was the head of the world bank's
economic unit in the early 90s he like went to the white house and now he's on twitter telling us
what to do like none of these people will ever suffer any consequences for anything they ever
did and that's just something that we have to accept do you think people like that are aware of
the things that you're saying or were they focused on helping what their mandate was and these were
like spandrels or externalities there's a pretty famous in summer in the high levels yes they're
culpable and they're guilty because there's there's even a memo that summers wrote in the early 90s
that leaked uh where he basically was suggesting that we dump all of our toxic waste in africa
like that guy totally knows i remember that quote i remember that quote yeah yeah he's but that was
that was an environmental guilty thing that wasn't this debt is a cycling yeah but they i i think
that 80 to 90 percent of the employees at these institutions who by the way are paid extremely
well i mean they love their jobs um they they i think they're doing good and it's like sort of
the banality of evil thing right like i don't i wouldn't expect like they just don't know they
just don't know i think you really have to zoom out to see this i mean the argument i'm trying to
make in my this what i've just discussed is laid out in my new book that came out yesterday actually
called hidden repression um how i didn't know that bank uh uh cell exploitation is development
and i i i i just hope that like all i'm asking is that people educate themselves on this and come
to their own conclusions you know let me ask you a personal question and i'm gonna ask you some
personal questions at the end of this interview too but at the beginning of this you told me
that your work at human rights foundation is helping global dissidents and uh and human rights
and living in fear is is a terrible thing some of the things you've dropped on this podcast
even so far are pretty threatening to the status quo i know there's a lot of environmental
dissidents in south america that that pay for their uh courage with their lives because people
don't want to hear that are you ever afraid of of what you're saying because it's so profoundly
