would be not only a continued but an accelerated biophysical debasement of our monetary representations
of reality and there had to be some alternatives to that I actually bought bitcoin at 70
dollars and I sold it at 100 thinking I was smart I bought it again at 700 and I sold it
at 300 because this thing sucks yeah and you know and the other other things over the years
but you came into your interest of bitcoin not because of the potential demise or devaluation
of the US dollar but because you wanted to be able to quickly and cheaply get funds to your global
freedom of dissidents on on the human rights issues so you talked about sending money to you
you in yeah I didn't buy I didn't own any bitcoin until 2017 like I had been exposed to it for like
six years and I was like this thing is I just wasn't sure you know so so but couldn't you mentioned
the Ukraine example yeah back in the Maidan revolution yes couldn't you use PayPal or
Western Union or things like that no because the these people had their bank accounts closed down
they had no way to receive money there was no so I mean so they didn't have a bank account but
they did have a phone or a computer yeah yeah Ukraine is very wired I mean and here's the
interesting thing countries that have been hit hardest by you you talk about how we're not
going to have austerity here correct like politicians will do stimulus right that's that's
written on the wall what what we'll do is we'll have austerity there over there where we can't
hear the screaming of all the people who are suffering that's going to happen that's happening
as we speak right now now those countries are the ones that are adopting bitcoin the most rapidly
if you look at the per capita usage of bitcoin and cryptocurrency it is highest in places like
Turkey Argentina Nigeria places where the local fiat system is collapsing and that should be just
very rational to any I mean that makes sense to most people what it what is the per capita
percentage number of people that use it in those countries versus the US do you know
okay so this was um 2022 a global report ownership of bitcoin and cryptocurrency
percent of internet users aged 16 to 64 who own bitcoin or some form of cryptocurrency
uh the worldwide average is at around 10 and the US is at 12 Thailand's at 20
Nigeria 19 Philippines 19 South Africa 19 Turkey 18 Argentina 18 Indonesia 15 Brazil 15 so I've
just named I've just named the six six of the biggest recipients of IMF eight ever okay Brazil
Indonesia Argentina Turkey Philippines Nigeria Thailand oh my god so just 15 and 20% does it
show all the countries in the world what are the bottom few I'm just like the least ownership do
you have that yeah I mean and again this is like one data point a lot more needs to be done but a
lot of very advanced countries like Japan Italy Poland Israel um and and China uh who knows there
I mean yeah who knows so all all I'm saying is that like you have two drivers for bitcoin
adoption one is like fiat collapse like your local currency is collapsing um and the other one is
political repression so like in China like we don't know the true bitcoin stats because right
it's impossible to know but what we do know is there's a ton of bitcoin adoption in China
well the other thing is yeah many of those countries that you mentioned there is no fiat
collapse because they don't have any fiat they have to use US dollars yeah exactly and
in general I think there's there's that's that's kind of what I just said is is a good thing for
you to think about like there's two reasons to want bitcoin digital gold digital cash it's either
that you want a better savings technology and your government bonds are just not doing the job and
you want something that over 10 years is going to really like hold your purchasing power uh which
is what gold has done gold has held its purchasing power since ancient Rome like the cost of a beer
in ancient Rome is the same amount of gold as it is today it's kind of crazy or the amount of
gold it cost to buy a bread in the time of Nebuchadnezzar is the same as amount as today in
Whole Foods like pretty much like it has preserved purchasing power because there's no such thing as
alchemy you can't just like make gold out of silver or whatever you got to dig it out of the ground
and it gets harder and harder to dig now bitcoin it's similar to that but it's also digital cash
it can be it has vulnerabilities but it can be quite private and it's unstoppable so it's like
cash it's like me paying you the government doesn't have to know about it they can't socially engineer
us it's just a payment like a bear instrument payment like we used to do but it's on the internet
so it does these two things really well and those things are going to be really in demand this this
decade if you just think about two words devaluation and deplatforming those are going to increase
exponentially over this decade all over the world what's what's deplatforming
what they did to wiki leaks kicking them off paypal or kicking them off patreon for not having
the right politics now first it'll start happening to extremists on the edges but then it starts to
come to the center and you're you'll see that okay you are the very first guest out of 70 that
i've had talk about bitcoin and you are a um a global expert on it would you be willing to
like talk to me like i am a junior high school student um just because i want to get some of
the foundational tenets uh before we get into some of the advanced questions which i i've been thinking
about um what real briefly maybe just give short one to two minute answers uh and and we can get
through a bunch of questions what was the foundational philosophy of creating bitcoin or
whoever created it they wanted digital cash they wanted an internet of money that's what
satoshi nakamoto wanted if you read the white paper they wanted an ability for two internet
users to transact without a third party in the middle there's a lot of reasons for that a reliance
on third parties has led to both again devaluation in our currency which is most obviously seen
in the global south but also now it's being seen in the west that was something that wasn't the case
when satoshi made bitcoin we had the global financial crisis sure but we didn't have high
inflation in the dollar but guess what there was high inflation like all across the world at that
time outside of like the core right and then at the same time they were worried about censorship
t flat t platforming so again devaluation to platforming they were worried about third parties
saying no and this has this is just growing like you know you have a lot of reasons to want to have
just a quick transaction with somebody else without some without having to ask permission
so bitcoin is what we call permissionless it might be that you were in the united states during
operation choke point under obama and your dad blew glass that people used to smoke pot in
and he got debanked i met a bitcoin developer who is that person she hurt she got into bitcoin
because her dad ran a small business and was debanked by operation choke point could be that
you're a sex worker it could be that you um are involved in guns you know that you're a gun trainer
god knows what it could be that you want an abortion and you live in mississippi or something
like that there's a lot of reasons why people want to have private digital transactions that
don't give away their identity and i think it's absolutely core for democracy a good example
is hong kong when the hong kong students and activists were protesting against the ccp takeover
in 2019 they they had to use the subway system like in any large urban area you have to use
subways right and they didn't want to use their octopus card which is like their metro card to
to get on the subway because it could be tracked and then they could be fired from their job or
suspended from their university if they saw somebody getting off at a protest so they would
line up with cash to buy one-time use cards huge lines there's photos of this all over
so i really think it's important for us to have digital cash if we want to defend our democracies
this is really really important um but in any event i think that bitcoin is very simply separation
of money in state it's a way for us to just peer-to-peer transact as individuals on the internet
and it's basically emalable money i mean that's that's that's the longest short of it and um
technically there's eight billion humans and it's if you do have a cell phone or a computer
you you are part of that monetary open society that could technically have bitcoin i mean it's
it's it's very similar to email protocols like the bitcoin protocol is a protocol like anything
any client can speak to it you can build any client that speaks to it so any bitcoin wallet
in the world i mean i have ones on my phone that are made in argentina israel all over
they all speak the same language just like email speaks the same language just like google
or yahoo uh or aol all could communicate with one another because it was open right so bitcoin is
open it's open money for everybody so i've sent bitcoin to to i can send bitcoin to the west bank
from my living room in california in three seconds like the fact that people don't understand that
this is a revolution it just blows me away how is that not interesting to you you know and does
anyone else in the money to the west bank you know does anyone else in the world other than you
and whoever received that in the west bank know that that happened uh if we follow the right steps
no they have no idea uh if we are lazy yes you can be seen um and in fact the us government has
arrested a lot of people who have been sloppy with bitcoin um who've used it for crime and it's
it's fair to say that in its early days it was used for a lot of what i would consider crime
i think that now accounts for a tiny percentage of its overall use but i i think to focus on that
is very similar to focus on the aspect of crime during the early encryption debate in the 1990s
so senator biden at the time and and president clinton wanted to ban encryption they wanted
clipper chips in american phones they wanted to have full access to all in uh digital communications
because they they were worried about uh uh terrorists and criminals and pedophiles now
guess what if they had their way we'd have no privacy united states of america i mean we'd have
like a police state um but they lost uh the courts ultimately sided against them we don't
have clipper chips and we have signal on our phones instead now guess what do all drug dealers and
criminals use signal of course but that's not a reason to take it away from us it's going to be the
same thing with bitcoin at the end of the day to what by 2030 most people will use bitcoin in some
way or another and it'll just sort of be like email like it's it's it's it's an advancement in this
area and our policing will have to adapt to it that's kind of my take on that and that element
of it i have more fundamental basic questions but on your prediction there by 2030 how confident
are you of that very i mean i just the existing currencies are failing like they're not doing
well and they're not sufficient for the world's population like there are billions of people
who are unbanked uh but many of them have access to a phone they like this idea that money today is
so gated like you have to have id you have to prove yourself you have to like show that you're
somebody to use money to me is totally unnatural like it should be a basic human right to transact
with one with somebody else in the world so this has led to the exclusion the financial
exclusion of so many people like what you need to know is that kyc and aml policies are financially
exclusionary they leave out the most vulnerable and disenfranchised people in the world
and that's not fair kyc is know your customer exactly okay so i have some some holes to poke
in what you just said but but let's again for the benefit of of my systems ecology audience
that is accounting and the decline of mammalian species and keep building in the ocean yes let's
start what what is blockchain let's just briefly start there so satoshi um created bitcoin as a
decentralized money system for the world and the only way to do it without corruption inside the
system was to decentralize the issuance of money uh the issuance is what always wrecked all these
other experiments with digital cash with e-money with e-cash there was always like an issuer who
could get arrested or who could print a bunch of money and and devalue your savings so the question
was how do you decentralize issuance and they did this through something called nakamoto consensus
which which is is related to what we call proof of work so this is a a computational competition
so this is why people buy bitcoin mining machines and they run them all around the world and they
compete what they're doing they're not printing bitcoin they're they're receiving it as a as a
reward for work so if you prove that you've done a certain amount of work in the bitcoin
system you get you get new bitcoins and these bitcoins started at 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes
this was in 2009 in january 2009 when satoshi started the system and every four years that
amount of bitcoin that comes into the system gets cut in half we call it a halving so for four years
there was 50 coming in every 10 minutes then 25 and 12 and a half an hour at 675 that's going to go
all the way to zero in the year like 21 30 so ultimately there's a limited amount of bitcoin
that will ever exist that's the most important property of bitcoin is that if there's 21 million
of them that no one will be able to like print more that's very unique among all digital currencies
in fact bitcoin is the only digital currency that's not virtual meaning it has a tie to the
real world meaning because you have to expend electricity to to to to to move it along it has
a tie to the physical world in in in all these other currencies don't that's that's what i was
so interested in your work like you're showing how the currency system got detached from the real
world decades ago i think this offers a compelling different model where the reserve the base money
that we use could actually be tied to real world resources and i think that's going to be very
healthy for us but anyway like all this is to say that satoshi didn't use the word blockchain
they used the word called time chain so blockchain was invented later to describe
the fact that like the information that's stored in bitcoin is done on different computers it's
not done in one place it's like in the cloud on like thousands of distributed computers
and then people went on to make a lot of other blockchain tokens and cryptocurrencies and stuff
like that and so how long is the blockchain now uh it's like 300 gigabytes and everybody who runs
a full bitcoin node has every single transaction that dates back to january 2009 and it's stored
in the ones when you sent bitcoin to people in ukraine exactly yeah all of them all all of them
are there um all mean but we'll say like all bitcoin transactions are there now there are
new technologies that allow you to use bitcoin without proof of work called that that basically
it's layered money this is important to actually note just like society went from using gold as
money to paper notes to credit cards like we layered money right we sacrificed um certainty
for convenience like we layered money bitcoin will also layer so there's like a thing called
the lightning network which is a way for you and i to transact instantly and very privately with
bitcoin without any proof of work so without any uh mining but it's still using bitcoin
but it's not a hundred bitcoin it's not a token it's not some other crypto it's called it's bitcoin
but there's ways to use bitcoin where we're like not on the chain so it's not accurate to say that
all of the transactions are in the chain um but basically you have a canonical record of all
bitcoin activity yes going back to the beginning so let's just say that this does scale and your
predictions are correct yeah then perhaps once the trust and the network effect um of this really
expand globally maybe a higher percentage of the transactions would be in this layered way
oh totally or something new in the actual blockchain yeah it's not just lightning is what
i'd prefer because it's still sovereign like you you can use lightning in a way where you control
it where you can be around bank that's the motto of bitcoin but what's likely gonna happen is what's
happening now is custodial like basically people buy bitcoin on coinbase or whatever
and they think they have bitcoin they don't they have a paper claim to bitcoin they have a claim
on bitcoin and this is what we found out with ftx is that you had like i don't know people had they
thought they had eight billion dollars on ftx or whatever worth of bitcoin and there was zero so
this is why it's so important in bitcoin to to control your own funds to self custody um we do
not want to be rugged so it's very important if you own bitcoin to to to learn how to own it yourself
this is super super important um because if it's not your not your keys not your coins that's what
we say so uh briefly um you described that this is uh a physical cost using electricity what is
the the difference between proof of stake and proof of work and why is this important well
briefly in proof of stake the people who own the most of the thing get to determine the state of
the ledger and the rules of the system so it's kind of like a centralizing effect it's like a
it ends in some sort of oligarchy that's like the end of that road uh bitcoin and it's blend
it's special brand of proof of work is is much more decentralized um the the fact that you have
a lot of hash rate uh does not allow you to control bitcoin and it doesn't allow you to take
my bitcoin or change the rules and there's a really good book on this if you're interested in the
politics of it called the block size war by jonathan beer basically back when bitcoin was
more vulnerable in 2017 people who controlled 81 of all the mining in the world tried to change
bitcoin and they failed because the owning a lot of hash rate does not allow you to control bitcoin
but owning a lot owning 81 of all of the ethereum or all of the whatever coin that's on proof of
stake does allow you to control that coin so it's it's very fundamental it's very very fundamental
and very important that we have one coin that cannot be manipulated by the rich by the billionaires
that's key that's key so a common pushback um on bitcoin is that it's a heavy energy use item
to to create a currency in effect so um how much energy does it take to mine bitcoin maybe you
could along the way describe what is mining and what is your uh well what is the case for
