against the cultural narrative or the the western privilege i think that no um because i work with
all these dissidents who literally like some of them have been killed right so i think i i take
for i don't take anything for granted i but i take my advantage of my opportunities will put it that
way like i'm happy to do this and i just hope people can learn i mean i i'm trying to walk this
line between again i i'm a huge believer in western civilization at its at its core values
and the american revolution and what it stood for at the time in terms of being anti-imperial um i'm
a hundred percent on board with the values what i'm not on board with is is what's happened since
right so i think that we need to improve the problem is that a lot of people who say stuff
that i've said on the show so far will then all of a sudden go and be like pro ccp or pro puden
or pro dictator or pro chavez that's wrong dictatorship is the enemy dictatorship is
what we're fighting against uh we need to like work out the kinks in our liberal democracies
and improve them not go simp for some dictator so i've been really like embarrassed by the
number of people on the left who see some of the stuff i'm seeing but then they go ahead and say
well america's evil let's let's go support putin this is this is a horrific thing and you see a lot
of like uh people on the left and on the far right there's the the horseshoe theory right
they're like ah ukraine's fake like uh bits of nato war whatever like all this crazy stuff you see
it's crazy so i'm trying to walk a line between knowing that like the free society is what we want
and that individual rights are really important and that we want to protect individual freedom
like this is so key and at the same time try and understand the costs of our system like what has
our system imposed on others and i'm just trying to help people think about that and ultimately i
think it recalls for monetary reform which probably pushes us to the next part of the conversation
yes let's go there so how did you when did you become interested in bitcoin as a as a part of
the suite of responses to the challenges that you just laid out yeah and pre-bit just before we get
to bitcoin last thing if you're listening so far i just would ask you is it fair that four percent
of the world's population can impose rules on the rest of the world is it fair that a small group
of unelected old white men for the most part in virginia get to decide the cost of capital for
everybody i think the system is profoundly unfair i've benefited from it my entire life i'm a i have
this financial privilege um but i'm asking you just to think about what it's like for other people
both at the retail level of like can you send money to your friends like this is just non-trivial
for some people like try to send a western union or a bank wire to mozambique or to south korea even
it's like impossible and it's expensive and it takes a lot of time and sometimes it doesn't even
make it um that they have to deal with a lot so all i'm asking is just just put yourself in their
shoes and that's what brought me to bitcoin so before you you continue is there a way to have
modern complexity globalization six-continent supply chains with 100 to 200 countries each
having their own cost of capital i mean that's highly impractical it had to go this way yeah i
mean i think what you probably would have seen had the petrodollar not happened is just more of a
multipolar world like i think the u.s is always going to be really dominant no matter what currency
paradigm we have um but it reached so there might have been five or six currencies and yeah
or three i mean or even two but like i mean and look one outcome of the petrodollar system was
defeating the soviet union the cold war which was good so i mean there's that i mean i think we
should be balanced about this but how did that briefly how did that well we got to print money
we got to we got to click a button to buy oil and they had to dig it out of the ground how's that
like that's that's pretty much it i mean that that was one of the big you and then think about
all the trickle down effects from that so so just just to let's i mean i have this in my
earth they talked that i gave last night it'll be online next week is we talk about um the american
way of life or the you know and and that is a lot of it is because of our um accident of geology
where we this country is a bunch of ancient oceans and we have natural gas and coal and we have
90 plus energy independence but a big part of it is the hegemony that we get from the us dollar
and the seniority and the benefits that you've been describing so and i would say pre pre pre
shale revolution or pre our ability to use technology to make things cheaper we'll just say
right there was a moment there like late 90s people were freaking out about the euro
i mean my i make an assertion i know it's provocative but i think one of the major
reasons we invaded iraq was to protect the petro dollar i don't think it was to bring democracy
to iraq i don't think it was to fight terrorism i don't think it was to take away i totally knew
to and i don't think it was for oil because we had all we we don't we didn't get any oil from over
there but what was threatening was stom selling tens of billions of dollars of oil to germany
and france in euros that was a problem get this there's a newsweek article by howard fernandes
get this there's a newsweek article by howard fineman from june oh three you go look at it
and it just notes at the end oh a couple weeks later the iraqis are back to selling the oil for
dollars like it's like yeah that was fixed so i'm not saying it's the only reason we went in there
but it's certainly at the top for me and if you david graber has a great piece of debt in his book
debt uh rest in peace he has an awesome section on this about the petro dollar and about the iraq
it's really good and about vietnam people should read it it's excellent how do you as uh the united
states sorry just just just to finish that so um there was a moment there were like uh things were
getting remember how expensive oil got like it was it was dicey right there um so we we were we were
freaking out like about a lot of things and then technology sort of bought us another decade and
would also bought us another decade was china coming into the wto and us being able to sell
treasuries a trillion dollars of treasuries to china and as the luke roman is great on this
macro economist and so is lin alton both of them are excellent to follow they really point out how
yeah so basically in 08 between 08 during basically during and after the great financial crisis
that was the peak of dollar hegemony never since then these countries have been selling off our
debt and buying gold so we're kind of we're kind of going back to this uh world where countries
probably are going to start settling in gold more and more and less and less in american claims
and this was obviously expedited by russia's invasion of uh ukraine and the the sort of uh
g7 decision to freeze western financial assets that were held by the russians so all these other
dictators are looking at that and saying uh no thanks no thanks we're going to hold something
that you guys can't remotely confiscate right but we've managed to keep the system alive but
i think that it it can't last forever no monetary empire lasts forever and it's not
going to be china sorry like sorry ray dalio like if you look at every reserve currency
okay it was always based at its core and freedom and property rights and rule of law whether it
was the dutch or the british uh or the americans like the at least at home there was like a court
system where there was rule of law the chinese don't have this no one's going to trust the
chinese government to issue currency they have a closed capital account they don't want the
trippin dilemma that's not going to happen so it's going to be i think the dollar the trippin
dilemma is a situation a country gets into when it becomes the reserve currency whereby normally
when you are uh when your currency gets really strong um your wages you know and things get
very expensive your your currency gets gets strong your and your exports become uncompetitive
so people stop buying them and and your currency starts to get weaker this is like a
natural balance in the order of things but with the trippin dilemma the the difference is that
the reserve currency everybody else needs it so the dilemma is that the issuer of the reserve
currency goes deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper into debt um while its currency remains
pretty strong instead of weakening like normally if you're like if you had the United States had and
right but but but if you're like malawi you're gonna go bankrupt and have hyperinflation
like but if you're in the United States we have this massive demand for dollars so the the dilemma
is that our if you look at any like you know uh account reading of the United States since the
70s it's insane it's like this right it's like we have this insane deficit of 30 trillion dollars
that keeps growing by one to one one and a half trillion every year again this is the only debt
empire in history so there's no precedent for this we've never seen this before so
I'm about nine questions behind but this is all good I'm already concluded that you're
gonna have to come back for around two but let me just ask you this there's around 40% of the
watchers of this podcast are from the United States yeah and quite a few from from Europe
um
how can someone not feel a little bit of shame from hearing the story
that you've unpacked here in the prior hour I think it's it's a fair uh I mean when I went
through the all this research I've been doing the last few years on these topics I go through
shock surprise disappointment shame and then and then and then and then we'll get to this
but the inspiration part like they could that could be better it could we could change things not
for the past but for the future I I would recommend next time you're in New York or Rome or Berlin
or London and you're at a particularly beautiful place looking at all this incredible civilization
that we've built just consider that yes a lot of it is because of freedom and of of our values yes
of of property rights and free speech and constitutional democracy and all that absolutely
and those are worth fighting for it's also because we stole resources and labor from from poor nations
for a long time um and that's something we don't think about and and it's it's just the truth and uh
I know people don't want to look at the truth or deal with the truth but the truth is both um and
that that upsets everybody because there's a lot of Marxists who say no it's not because of freedom
screw freedom it's only because of exploitation and then there's a lot of like sort of pro cat like
neoliberal people who are like ah not really exploitation it's all because of how great our
markets are and all this stuff like the the truth is that it's both and I know that doesn't it's not
like a it's not a clean picture for people you know and it's somewhat a lot predicated on the 100
billion barrel oil 100% coal oil natural gas that are are underpinning yeah and this and again
let's move to bitcoin but like the last thing I'll say is just that we've had such an incredible
opportunity to take advantage of fossils and a lot of other countries haven't and and that
almost entirely has dictated their development in many ways like what how could they access those
fossils and what could they what could they do with them a lot of countries like Nigeria
they have a bunch of oil but they can't do what they want with it like they have to sell it and
then for dollars to get money to pay back debt and to buy food so you have this whole system
where Africa as a continent imports 85% of its food which is insane because it should be feeding
the world you know so here's a really naive question and then yes please let's get to
your interest in in bitcoin yeah um does the average person in Nigeria or Mozambique or Angola
understand the the premises that you've laid out here are they are they angry at the United States
in the west because we have the global reserve currency or are they just discontent because
they can't afford things that they would like and and there's other issues well just like I was ignorant
about my country until recently I would assume most people are pretty ignorant about this stuff
because it doesn't impact their daily lives that being said people that I've met I can only speak
for who I've met my personal experiences on my travels um and in my work they're very aware
that when the IMF comes uh for austerity things get worse I mean this is super obvious to anyone
who's lived through any of this stuff and so the IMF is uh is the the the Soprano's equivalent of
Polly Walnut I mean honestly it's like the grim reaper like the the the um the and you know we
structural adjustment which is this policy that these countries have to have to do when they take
when they get when they borrow money from the IMF or or more recently from the World Bank
you know they have to raise taxes reduce subsidies for food and energy they have to shrink their
economy they have to you know devalue the currency I mean this is never asked of the west like the
United States and the and Germany and they've never had to structurally adjust like in fact
because we're democracies like we refuse and that's why the IMF and World Bank like working
with dictators that's what drew me to research this thing in the first place I was like why the
hell are we giving we bailing out Suharto and Marcos and Mobutu these criminals these war crimes
what's going on why are we supporting them so the implication is that in order to label ourselves
as democracies we have to be international authoritarians well I think the the the the friction
I've uncovered I think in my research is that and it's just kind of it should be I would be
obvious to an alien I think an alien coming and looking at the thing uh would be that our system
uh has powerful nations exploit the weak I mean it's pretty simple and and and that is
exacerbated by the money so look I I spent uh 10 years working with activists from these countries
all around the world from these authoritarian nations and I saw the problem they had with money
not necessarily on the global macro front but on the like I couldn't set up a bank uh
you know this dictator shut off my bank account my currency sucks like I can't receive a wire from
you when you want to give me a grant like just basic logistical stuff is so hard for so many people
and then they kept telling me about they're using bitcoin and I'm like what like the first
time was WikiLeaks Julien Assange spoke at the Oslo Freedom Forum in 2010 I met him in person and a
year later six months later Satoshi Nakamoto the creator of bitcoin had their last public post
where whoever they were he she they they said let's not let's let's hope that WikiLeaks doesn't use
bitcoin we're not ready the software project was too vulnerable this was in December 2010
six months after Assange spoke at my event and I met him six months later Satoshi disappears
Assange posts the a bitcoin address to the WikiLeaks account the rest is history the US
government came in and shut off any way to pay or donate to WikiLeaks through Visa or PayPal or
whatever so so you had to use bitcoin now bitcoin at the time was like worth a dollar like it wasn't
worth anything no one trusted it but guess what it worked for this purpose and we saw that and
that was interesting fast forward to years 2013 um two things happened a bunch of Ukrainians who
were gathering to be what would later be made on square wrote to us and said could you help us do a
fundraiser we our bank accounts got cut off can you send us some bitcoin and Gary Kasparov who's
our chairman we worked on this together there's still this reddit post from that from 2013 you
can see this so we helped get them some bitcoin into our surprise it worked I mean again bitcoin
wasn't worth much but like it it allowed money to go beyond the control of the state which was
important for our work the other thing that happened that year is this woman named Roya Mahbub
who's a good friend of mine started using bitcoin in her work in Afghanistan to pay the
women who worked for her company the software company she was a pioneer had a female only
software company she couldn't pay the girls in cash because the male relatives would take it they
couldn't open bank accounts but they had phones so she paid them in bitcoin and it worked and it
gave them freedom um so those two things weighed heavily on my mind but I'm like a skeptic like
if I do a personality test I'm a 99 percent skeptic so like I was like okay okay fine this
bitcoin thing but I kept kind of ignoring it we started accepting bitcoin donations in 2014 at
href so we started getting some bitcoin I started to get it a little more but it wasn't really until
2017 late 2016 early 2017 that I like was like oh my god we have to actually have a program here
where we link bitcoin folks with activists so we can help them just just like we helped activists
learn how about encryption so in 2010 no activists used any sort of really personal encryption on
their phones outside of western experts I mean it was really not done fast forward 10 years everybody
used a signal so you had a 10 year time where everything changed I think that's going to be the
case from like let's say 2018 to 2028 I think over that decade every activist is going to use bitcoin
whether they like it or not it's kind of like it's not a philosophical thing it's like email
like do I care about the political beliefs of the people who created email no I'm using it because
it's obviously better than sending something in the mail that's bitcoin to me like I don't care
about who created it I'm using it because it allows me to transmit value from A to B with no
questions asked to anyone in the world in an instant for a cheap for very cheaply and for very fast I
mean that's that's why I would use it right so let me level set a bit here yeah I know enough
about bitcoin to be dangerous I am in the space of energy depletion peak oil yes fiat currency
end of growth climate change environmental issues biodiversity systems ecology and I would say the
vast majority of people in that space are either ignorant about bitcoin or antagonistic about bitcoin
because how much it requires energy to mine and that energy 100 contributes to climate change but
so my interest in bitcoin came about because I could see two or three steps ahead that at every
can kicking moment in the global west that the US and other central banks would
not choose austerity that we would print more money to offset our problems and therefore there
