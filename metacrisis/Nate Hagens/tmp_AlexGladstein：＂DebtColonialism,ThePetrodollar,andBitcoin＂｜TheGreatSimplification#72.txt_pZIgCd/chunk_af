justifying this energy usage sure so there was this big hubbub with green piece is very antagonistic
towards yeah towards bitcoin that i read recently but go ahead yeah it's a great this is a great
conversation i think it's important um bitcoin is processed issued stabilized by mining mining
is the act of expending electricity feeding it to the bitcoin network um this started with
laptops and home computers at the beginning and as more people join the system bitcoin has
this very special thing called the difficulty algorithm so every 2016 blocks which is about
two weeks 2016 times 10 minutes um the the the difficulty resets so if there's been like a
lot more people joining the network it goes up so that it is so that the amount of time it takes to
mine those blocks stays at 10 minutes so the network stabilizes that way like for example
when china when the ccp banned bitcoin mining two years ago and like the network lost 70% of its
electricity it didn't die what happened is a few days later it adjusted way down and everybody was
at the same level of difficulty the math problem became easier way easier yeah exactly so the more
people mining the harder the math problem um it's and it's basically very simply it's like
it's just computers that are specialized these days called asics to to to to guess numbers it's
just guessing and you're trying to get uh like a certain number it's called that you're looking
for something called the nonce um and it's like a very very very very very tiny number
and you're just trying to find it and you have these computers just going going going and every 10
minutes or so somebody finds it and then that person helps secure the a bunch of transactions to
the chain and then we move on and we build from there it's like it's kind of like a quite hot and
amber and they get compensated for that uh energy yeah they get they paid in two ways they get paid
with the block subsidy which right now is is 6.75 bitcoin and and will decrease over time to zero
it's kind of like a bootstrapping mechanism ultimately there won't be a subsidy and then
they also get paid fees so when i send you some bitcoin i attach a small fee so over time the fee
market will be what drives bitcoin uh mining the the fee the fee market rather than the mining market
well the the what miners will be getting in return for expending electricity will be fees
ultimately rather than the reward for solving them right now it's like almost it's like 90
there's a website you can check out uh called clark moody's dashboard it gives you all the
data but right now it's like 95 percent uh subsidy five percent fees over the next 50 years that'll
change to the other way around okay that's part of my question dude i have so many questions
yeah so 50 years from now let's just say at some point it switches so that it's five percent
subsidy or reward or amounts and 95 fees at that point does the whole network use less electricity
than than today i mean these things are extremely hard to predict i'm not going to pretend to make
predictions but over time i think you have two important factors um one is that uh there will be
an increased demand for bitcoin generally so there'll be more and more people mining
okay so there will be like on one hand more energy except except 50 years from now there's
going to be 20 and a half million of the 21 million coins already minted so there's there's
going to be minting fewer and fewer coins right yeah but the miners won't be worried about that
they're you're going to be trying to make the the money off the transaction fees that are people and
institutions and governments spending i mean there's there's um what i'm saying is that the the the
amount of new bitcoin being issued becomes less relevant in the future and eventually goes to zero
like uh or or the project fails like for bitcoin to succeed fees have to drive bitcoin miners
from a pure economic perspective like they have to make enough money off just the fees alone
50 years from now or else the project doesn't work so so it has to be used as a store of value
and a store of commerce in the future for it to work 100 and i think what's most likely is that
on-chain bitcoin transactions like that take 10 20 30 minutes will become very expensive in
relative terms and they'll be kind of like settlement like kind of like what fedwire does
or what central banks do or you know like maybe for very very very big things you may do an on-chain
transaction but for like retail any if you're someone and you want to use bitcoin to buy coffee
you're like send a remittance like you're not going to be using on-chain you're going to either
be using custodial bitcoin through a service or you're going to use something like lightning so
in any event like you won't be paying that fee okay so i have my own response to this question
one of the few that i have an opinion on in this topic but how how do you justify
yes the large energy use of mining for bitcoin
because because it's a double expenditure of energy right you spend energy when you create
the currency and then when you buy something with it that's another claim on energy and resources
in the world yes in a sense yes i i think that the most important thing is to acknowledge that
bitcoin is valuable to a lot of disenfranchised people around the world that's like the thing
i've uncovered in my work so yep once we established that and and i know that people
be skeptical about that but you just got to go talk to people like talk to people in legos talk to
people and i'm not skeptical you've convinced me no but a lot of i just fair to be skeptical
people should go out and do their homework but do do honest homework on this and you will learn that
that bitcoin is important for tens of millions of people around the world and and if you and if
your work is is successful you hope that tens of millions turns into hundreds of millions or or
billions yeah i mean from the human point of view and again we're about to get to the environment
like it would be fair if there was one currency standard for the world that no one could manipulate
like that would be equal rules for everybody this is not some sort of redistribution a scheme
you're not going to be able to um you know take from people remotely but it ensures
equality of monetary opportunity it means that like jeff bezos no longer can call up the fed
and get like a bailout like it's the same rules for everybody it doesn't mean that there's not
going to be rich and poor or huge inequalities or any of that stuff but it does mean that it's
going to address something very key in that we've had this thing called the cantillon effect
where the people who create the money uh get to give it to their friends first and they benefit
the most and then it the effects trickle down so as far as the energy stuff once you understand
that it's valuable then well then we have to start thinking in context so for example
and we'll do two things number one is like what kind of energy is bitcoin using and then how much
so i don't i like to think of it in raw energy as well as carbon footprint right these are two
kind of key key ways to look at it so raw energy yes bitcoin uses the amount of electricity of like
a small to mid-sized country and it fluctuates it could be poland it could be argentina the
cambridge electricity uh cambridge bitcoin mining website has has this data right you can see the raw
amount of electricity expended what i think is important to realize there are two things context
so the world's big countries use a lot more energy than the world's small countries so for
example like um i think norway uses more electricity it's four million people than the bottom 40
countries in the world combined so first of all we have this vast energy inequality that i've seen
you talk about so that's one thing to understand when we say like uh well argentina well what if
i were to tell you that um you know air conditioners in the united states use like way more electricity
than argentina right so when it comes to carbon footprint which is what i'm particularly interested
in um bitcoin has a smaller carbon footprint than the cruise ship industry for example and um
i think about that a lot because like cruise ships are great i understand they give people
jobs but ultimately it's a luxury thing for people if no one's going to die if we don't have
cruise ships um bitcoin's not a luxury for a lot of people it's going to end up becoming like a
lifeline for for many many people so i think it's all about the value proposition like do you think
it's important for us to spend our very scarce energy on i say yes based on what i've seen so
you're saying that it requires energy and that's a good thing because if it didn't require energy
or a biophysical cost it could be corrupted and the whole logic for why it works wouldn't wouldn't
hold correct it needs to consume a real world scarce asset um and i don't mean scarce in terms of
non renewable i just mean like not infinite not easily producible um the second part of what
go ahead yeah go ahead no no no go ahead no no the second half of this that i find really interesting
is that there's a guy named daniel batten he's a he's a kiwi an environmentalist from new zealand
who's done a lot of work on this he's got incredible data and charts so by his metrics um so bitcoin
is already like more than half renewed powered by nuclear plus renewables and it's increasing it
at six percent a year in this direction but by by what he's seeing now why does this make sense
this makes sense for for now because in our current climate like we have entered we have
deflation in renewables like they're they're getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper
i know a lot of that's because of government subsidies but it is what it is like it they're
getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper for now i know that you have like opinions on
that but um i do bitcoin miners are only going to use the cheapest possible energy their margin of
profits really tiny so like they cannot compete with like a residential consumer of energy they
cannot pay ten cents a kilowatt hour they can only pay like three four five six you're already
starting to get like it's too expensive so that's why you see bitcoin miners in cyberia in experimenting
with otak off the coast of hawaii that's why you see them um in you know that's why what this is a
great thing uh to learn about why was all the bitcoin mining in china because the chinese
government overbuilt hydro in the south central part of the country and you just had massive dam
spinning and it wasn't the energy wasn't going anywhere it was being curtailed so people were
like oh we'll take that so they were taking all of this and then when the rainy season ended they
had to go up to this dirty coal up in where shenzhen is and use that until they got kicked out by the
ccp two years ago but the reason why all the miners were attracted to china in the first place was
because of this massive excess hydro energy that nobody was using so generally speaking bitcoin
miners use energy that nobody else wants or that would be wasted otherwise so this is one of the
other things for now increasingly so we don't see uh we have enough we have no evidence that
this won't continue to be the case well no i it's i can foresee i can easily foresee a time
10 20 years from now where coal is the cheapest energy uh because we we've then bitcoin miners
would use coal maybe i should be very honest about that right right so so here's the point i wanted to
make um i think there's a superficial critique from especially the climate movement that oh my
god you're you're burning uh energy to create this currency how unsustainable is that well think
about the energy implications of our of our us dollar of the petro dollar we create it used to be
95 percent now around 80 percent of our money is created when a commercial bank makes a loan
and there is no tether at all to anything scarce or any resource now it's down to about 80 percent
the other 20 percent is created when the government has a deficit and they don't have enough money to
pay for it and they create money uh they spend it into existence also there is no like when a dollar
is created there is the tiny tiny tiny energy connotation of the linen that it's printed on
but that's minuscule the major impact is we have created trillions of dollars instantly in claims
on copper oil forest dolphin habitat every war that the us has fought abroad since 67 has been
paid on the national credit card so literally spending into existence uh for example like
americans are on the hook to pay one trillion dollar we've already paid a trillion dollars on
interest alone for the afghan iraq wars we're gonna pay another trillion by 2030 so all of the 911
post-911 wars are credit card wars so exactly you're right all of these things we're doing out there
with these massive like oil like oil power ships and all this stuff is all possible because of the
currency system 100 percent and so that is a egregious use of energy that the critiques by
greenpeace and others of bitcoin don't take into account like this is our real monetary system
is a huge burden on energy like i mentioned before that what is the carbon footprint of
quantitative easing we have these artificially low interest rates and printing all this stimulus
the us military alone i mean the us military is the largest consumer of fossils so in the world so
like by the way i really respect the fact that you um you use the semantic term of fossils
as opposed to fossil fuels well i mean name them fossil fuels that that adds power to us
using them as fuels but go on yeah the the point being that um we the bitcoin is an experiment i
mean i i think it's going to succeed it could fail for a variety of reasons but it's small
relatively today okay but what we've seen is that it for macroeconomic reasons it uses primarily
energy that's wasted or stranded and this tends to be increasingly renewable for now for now um
and i think that's really interesting because the u.s it's a lot cleaner it's a lot greener than the
u.s energy grid like by far um so i it's funny that like the new york times loves evs even though
the the human costs of as you pointed out of electric cars are egregious in terms of where
you get the the rare earths and stuff are um and then and then you know but then they attack
bitcoin mining machines i mean a bitcoin miner is an electric car it's just a user of energy it
has a bitcoin miner is just as is only going to be as green as what energy is used to power it
and guess what bitcoin miners use a greener grid a greener you know portfolio than evs do so it's
like i think people just miss that point it's very important like bitcoin mining itself has no
emissions it's the energy that's used to power it so we have to look at what exactly is powering it
and what's really amazing what i'll just say that's that's that i think is important is that never
before have humans been able to take advantage of stranded energy for economic purposes in the same
way like we tend to settle on rivers like along places where we can like power and electrify
so you have all this stranded geothermal energy on the western coast of the north america uh
south america in the rift valley you have potentially otek in the oceans none of this made any sense
to to harness because it was always far away from where people lived now with a starlink
and bitcoin miners you can just take advantage of that you can also very importantly make a lot
of money mining bitcoin off of uh methane emissions um from both gas fields and landfills
we're just starting to uncover what that's going to mean but like basically bitcoin could run for
the next 50 years off of landfills alone off of just the the emissions of landfills alone
so what you're saying is we're not technologically there yet like over the next 10 years you're
going to see companies and entrepreneurs start to figure out how to mine bitcoin off landfills
and off of methane emissions and in jungles and in in the middle of the ocean like this is this
none of this has happened yet it's all starting to emerge
is does it assume all that advanced technology that might turn waste into a potentially stable
currency uh alternative in the future does that require higher and higher bitcoin prices
to manifest yeah i mean i i look i think that overall yes if bitcoin
does not increase in value to a certain extent it's gonna be hard to economically make things work
um i i think that bitcoin will become really valuable for the two reasons i laid out earlier
because of deep platforming and devaluation i think people are gonna want an open neutral
currency i think that that's going to like people are gonna really want that in the future um and
people already really wanted across the global south now here's the thing so let me give you
a micro example that helps color my thinking on this friend of mine uh his name's eric hersman
he's a he's out in kenya he's born in sudan he's a entrepreneur there he started a company called
gridless um and what they do is they they do originally had nothing to do with bitcoin it was
micro hydro energy grid stuff so they go to a village that has a stream running through it um
they bring in a micro hydro they drop it in they run a little tube they put a fish guard on it the
water comes back zero environmental impact and now all of a sudden the town has cheap energy now
typically you know who's gonna make the investment on that and how are you gonna make money on that
is the big question so they've figured out that bitcoin mining is is is how you make the money
so you come in right away you mine bitcoin and you start making money and the town gets electricity
which doesn't have and it gets it way cheaper than it otherwise could and the company that comes
in the investment doesn't have to be bill gates like they're not altruistic they're making money
also so what you're going to start seeing in east africa with the gridless and other companies
are huge tracts of people who've never had electricity before coming online as a result
of bitcoin mining because no other there's no other thing in the world that that can harness
that energy the same way it is a very unique type of energy consumer um and the other thing that's
really cool about bitcoin is because i'm interested in energy grids it's the best demand response
technology we've ever seen because of the way that it can turn off precisely perfectly anytime
it's not like a steel factory where if you turn off for too long the steel will set you have just
like it's that these bitcoin miners can turn off on a dime like this so what i think is gonna end up
happening is a lot of these grids are gonna have overbuilt renewables doing bitcoin mining
and then that can just shift into whatever the the grid operators need it you're seeing this in
