very tied together but i do think we're in a bubble and that bubble will unwind and i think that
the majority of the world's population already knows what that feels like and we in the west
don't like Sri lankans know what that feels like because they're experiencing it right now
it means you wait three hours for gas at petrol stations it means that your currency goes to zero
it means that you don't have any food it means that people starve now we don't we have not experienced
that in the west in a long time obviously except in ukraine i guess if you want to say that's a
western country because we've sheltered ourselves from that i think that could happen here but that
doesn't mean bitcoin won't be a valuable tool for everybody again i think it's a lifeboat it's
a tool you should learn how to use it it'll be really useful i think it's going to be valuable
because things could get difficult in this next 20 30 40 years i think and what it will do is it
will preserve value over time and will allow you to do what you want to do i i'm i know that there's
a lot of like right-wing crazy stuff about central bank digital currencies around there these days
but a lot of it's true like the governments do want to control your energy and food consumption
and and they want to prevent you from buying certain things and they're going to do that
through digital cbdcs and bitcoin is the alternative i mean is the plan b so i think like again it's
not a panacea it's not some magic wand thing it's a tool it can be used for good it can be used for
bad but it will transform the world so i think people should really educate themselves about it
yeah the cbdcs that would be another conversation topic because i do think we're
headed that way and i think you're right it's because they want to control the money supply
and then they could go negative interest rates and it wouldn't have the crazy impact on our current
financial system okay this was awesome you have uh you're a follower of this podcast so you know
what's coming next a few closing personal questions sure you are a great simplification
fluent and you've thought about this and have been clearly working in this sector as a career
choice do you have any personal advice to the listeners not financial per se but at this global
time of of metacrisis yeah i think as we move through this it's so important to be empathetic
understanding with people who've already gone through a great simplification because they can
teach us so much so i would try to learn more about the third world debt crisis like talk to
people you know from the global south like learn about what that how did they get by like they
didn't go anywhere they're still there like that's the thing about the simplification i think it'll
happen it doesn't end to humanity it's just it's a massive setback and it's going to be a tragedy
and it's going to be really difficult but we're going to keep going so uh just like in peru in
the 1980s they had a great simplification it became twice as hard to earn the same amount of calories
and guess what they're survived and a lot of they they thrive they figured out a way to thrive so
let's talk to our fellow human beings who've already gone through the great simplification
and let's learn from them that would be like the biggest piece of advice i could give you and
let's stop living in our in our bubble our post 71 western bubble you're the first person that has
said that and i i couldn't agree more um and that is what i think is going to happen too it's going
to be a tragedy and it's going to be chaotic and we're going to get through it and that's this
conversation is how do we best get through that towards some saner uh more desirable and i can
tell you someone 1980 in peru would have loved to have 24 seven access from a phone to an asset
that could not be seized or confiscated by their government that would have been really useful
and that's the thing uh whether it was political oppression like my ancestors fleeing the holocaust
or whatever like or countless syrian or eritrean refugees i've met like afghans like like people
have not had an opportunity to bring their property and wealth with them or to or to preserve it in a
time of distress until now and the number of people i've met who've literally brought their life with
them through bitcoin whether it's on a flash drive or by memorizing the seed phrase is pretty
astonishing and it's just it's pretty cool like it it is a way out so at least i think i think it
can help i i i think it can help at worst it becomes uh at worst it it's a tool that's helpful um
you know so we'll see wearing my systems ecology hat i have to think about this more but it does
almost seem like bitcoin could be one of the another cans to kick in service of the maximum
power principle and it will be good for those humans that adopt it but may not be good for the
ultimate ecological overshoot but i'm gonna i'm gonna withhold my opinion on that i mean that's
very possible yeah um so what about young young people i heard uh a crying child in the background
how would you change your advice to young humans listening to this i think that young humans are
going to get a lot of good advice i think that the unique one i can give is i think that young
people should learn about money i think we can put bitcoin aside for a second like when i was
growing up i had i went to a good public school in the united states uh we didn't learn about money
we didn't learn about personal money we didn't learn about credit cards we didn't learn about the
way banking system works we didn't learn about the dollar abroad we didn't learn about any of that
stuff and you know what it's just as important as all the other subjects you learn in school and
it's not taught so i guess as families as communities we need to teach our children about what is money
what is credit like and i know there's different theories and people argue but great let's get
our kids involved in those debates do you remember what i said uh at my lecture at stanford when i
was talking about money i said a lot of things when i was 14 yeah my dad had the conversation
with me that was kind of awkward about where babies came from uh which i which i already knew
but he never had the talk with me about where money comes from yes yes yes which none of us
really know um so look you want to have your look some some people are they think they believe in
commodity money and some people believe in in credit money and and it's fine just teach your
kids what you know i mean it's important for them to learn and then they'll like pick their own holes
and they'll find their own way but if you're 16 17 and you've actually thought about this
i think it'll really help you get ahead it'll help you plan your life it'll help you be more
responsible um especially when you can learn a little bit about interest rates and about borrowing
i think that that's that's really important yeah anyway what do you care most about in the world
alex well i'm biased i'm an rights activist i care about freedom because i think it's so
central because without freedom it's difficult for us to improve as humans it's difficult for us
to stop annihilating the environment i mean the stuff i've seen in my research and the people i've
talked to based on authoritarianism in the global south has led to an exploitation i mean has led to
just the enormous pillaging of natural resources i mean forget emissions for a second i mean the
environmental crimes that happened not only during the imperialism but just in in the 60s and 70s
and 80s alone in the amazon in west papa and all these places is totally unspeakable and it happened
because there's no rule of law in those places i mean these multilateral lending institutions
they like suharto as a client because they're not going to have to deal with street protests or
supreme court they could just deal with the dictator and that's it so i i think freedom is so
important because without freedom we can't protect our planet like we have a program at the human
rights foundation called defending the defenders where we support environmentalists from from inside
dictatorships now most of them are in prison or you've never heard of them if you're an environmentalist
environmentalist in egypt or in iran or in china you're either dead in prison or in exile you can't
be an environmentalist in these places so i think it's so so important that we address freedom first
and foremost or at least in the conversation coming to the united states i mean we we we could see it
i'm telling you i mean i mean look at india i know and again greenpeace you know that's for
another conversation but you know greenpeace in india was de-platformed from their bank a few years
ago it's going to happen to all environmentalists at some point or another like you will wake up in
your money will be no longer working you will find out very quickly as a non-profit organizer
that if your money doesn't work it's very difficult to do your activism so that's why i want to get
all these these podcasts uh on on record quickly yeah i'm mostly kidding um so if you could wave
a magic wand what is one thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures or or should
i guess well i mean i guess it's pretty obvious from the context of our conversation but it would
be awesome if all countries were liberal democracies uh i understand that may be impossible and maybe
even my work points to the fact that liberal democracy can only exist if if there's countries
to exploit i don't know i don't know we don't have a counterfactual but i will say that i do
believe in democratic peace theory more or less i don't think that democracies like to fight each
other for a variety of reasons mainly because the people are holding the government accountable
and i think that if all nations were somewhat more democratic or you know liberal democratic
there'd be a lot less violence a lot less exploitation and we would address planetary
challenges much better so that's the wand i would wave is to turn all the authoritarians
into democrats but i understand that that requires a total transformation of our own systems
and and some of our psychologies perhaps yes yeah so awesome dude so good to take a deep dive with
you um i've recently chosen to do this format where i interview a guest for the first time and and
give them a a a mic to explain their passion and their expertise and their worldview but if i had
you back again what is something a sub a subset of of this conversation what is one topic that
you're super passionate about that we could take a full deep dive just in that one thing
yeah i'll give you three three quick examples that i that i love sorry i mean we'll just do it i mean
one would be just going kind of more deep into the the imf world bank thing it's just such an
incredible story crazy story of how these institutions came to be and what they do and
how they basically get away with what they do um the second thing would be the french colonial
currency i would love to come on with someone a friend of mine from togo for example to help
explain it to your audience it's a shocking thing it's a shocking thing that this thing still exists
the third thing is the israeli palestine uh currency thing i did a really deep dive into this and
what most palestinians have told me they don't even know is that when uh there were nobel prizes
given out for the aslo accords something that happened at the same time was called the paris um
paris accord uh paris agreement paris protocol sorry paris protocol and the paris protocol was
an agreement that arifat signed giving up all monetary rights for palestinians so they don't
have their own currency they can't have their own currency they can't have their own central bank
they don't control any of the labor laws with regard to people going in and out with west bank
into israel um that was something that that they gave up to get political independence um
now we find out later that that's not a good trade-off like you you need economic and monetary
independence to be free as a nation this is absolutely clear so today palestinians use the
currency of their occupier can you imagine like how psychologically damaging that is so i've met
a whole bunch of palestinians in gaza i spoke to a guy in gaza over telegram who's who's he's
really into bitcoin it's the only way he can get money from his family it's crazy so there's a whole
bunch of bitcoin stuff happening in palestine i think that would make for a really interesting
episode and i can bring on a friend from from palestine so those would be my three suggestions
yeah awesome lots going on in the world that i'm unaware of uh it's it's a big story and a big
challenge that we face thank you for all your work on human rights thank you for your time today
and uh to be continued my friend yes thank you so much man really appreciate the conversation
