today i'm joined by the chief strategy officer of the human rights foundation alex gladstein
this conversation is jam packed we just scratched the surface of these highly relevant topics
and it was still the longest podcast i've ever done we covered topics from freedom of information
debt as a tool to uphold despotic leaders the origin of the petrodollar monetary colonialism
and eventually bitcoin alex also serves as the vice president of the first strategy of the oslo
freedom forum and has connected hundreds of global dissidents in civil society groups with
business leaders technologists philanthropist journalists and artists with the objective
of promoting free and open societies i learned quite a lot on this podcast on things that i
kind of thought i knew especially from the perspective of the global south geopolitics
and the monetary and not resource prosperity of the west i expect alex to be back on this
program we have a lot to talk about i hope you can listen to this it's long listen to it in pieces
it's jam packed please welcome alex gladstein
alex gladstein good to see you great to see you excited i've seen you i've seen you before
but i didn't know who you were at the time briefly i was happy to come down for one of your lectures
at stanford i i live in the area and um i was excited to see someone whose work inspired me
and made me think so thanks for the work you do well uh thank you for the work you do which i've
learned a little bit about and that's uh gonna be what we discussed today um i think we have a
lot to cover this uh may not be a balaji tim ferris eight hour podcast but it's it might be a long
one i hope to cover human rights which is your main expertise monetary privilege which is a new
concept to me even though now that i've read and thought about it it makes total sense and ultimately
bitcoin um and how that relates to those other two uh topics so maybe we just start with your
background what is it that you do alex and and how did you arrive at this place
yeah so for 15 years since 2007 i've worked for the human rights foundation which is a
nonprofit based in new york founded by former political prisoners and people whose families
were imprisoned for their ideas uh from around the world the organization was founded with a mandate
to focus on authoritarian regimes so by our standards that's about 4.3 billion people in
today's world in 95 countries who don't have the same kind of checks on government power that we
might have in the united states or japan or germany so that's half the countries in the world and
half the population plus or minus 53 of the world's population lives in a place that doesn't have
you know free speech property rights uh the ability to have free and fair elections etc
yeah so i the point being that i did a lot of things through my career i started as
essentially a student um with an internship my first summer job was to help get outside
information to the cuban underground library movement before they had internet in kuba uh
so i helped my latin american colleagues who were able to freely travel there bring all kinds of like
outside movies and and information in and people would go in their homes and share them it was
extremely kind of soviet uh soviet vibes but it made a big difference actually before the regime
finally uh crumb you know sort of crumbled and and acknowledged that they'd have to bring in
internet so that was my first experience in the with the job this is a real real naive question
and i may be interrupting you because i don't know a lot about this and i should but in those
authoritarian countries do they have access to like youtube videos well this was back in 2007
when the cuban people didn't have internet like the only way you could get internet really was
by going to like a western embassy and it was like tightly monitored expensive these days
most people have internet access in some way shape or form or or they can go somewhere with
internet access um but like the point being that through my career i did a lot of work with people
who had a lot of problems accessing information due to their government i spent a lot of time on
our north korea program which helps refugees who've escaped from north korea send information back in
that country is still probably the most closed off society in the world and people have been using
information technology to bridge that gap for 20 years now first with dvds then with usb sticks now
with uh smartphones and sd cards and even some sort of satellite type internet and i think with
the rise of starlink you're looking at a decade here where you know eventually the the internet
kind of saturates almost everybody on the planet well given uh and i want to let you get back to
answering my question on on what you're doing and what the human rights foundation is but how
how central is information to people's lives i mean you take it for granted that we can access
the collective information of the history of our species on google here in the united states but
in these authoritarian countries etc how important is it to access information for people in their
everyday lives well i i think for all the work that we do whether we are in business and energy
and environment and working for labor rights uh just building communities access to information
is essential but not only is it essential to prevent uh disaster and social uh basically
deterioration i'm marcia sen wrote about this how how lack of information can cause famine right
that's something he he won awards for uh for his work on this and i think it's it's quite true he
was looking at famines basically in india and in china and at the end of the day it's it's um
much more difficult to have a famine or to have a collapse in food supply in an open society
where people can share information and aren't living in fear there's the famous sort of
town square test like can you go to your town square and just criticize the government without
fear right so that's the difference between a fear society and a free society so this this was
kind of the environment that i um let's say grew up in working in this environment meeting
dissidents from around the world who didn't have the same privileges i did uh information
and technology was a really important part of that but so we're just basic basic basic concepts
basic civil liberty stuff free again free speech property rights uh freedom to believe
in what you want to believe in freedom to associate um and freedom from torture and and
from arbitrary detainment so so these kind of really basic civil liberties are things that
everybody strives for uh i've found that out by meeting people in every possible society culture
that this is not like a west it is not a western thing to not want to be tortured or to not want
to like speak your mind like these are these universal constructs um i i think there's nuance
to that but but at the root it's it's entirely true and and i spent my career looking at how
technology impacts that can help that or can hinder that when you were much younger like
high school or early college were you aspiring to be a a business major or a systems biologist or
something or did you have an experience as a young man that that made the things you're talking about
now uh very important and passionate to you yeah i was really interested in math and physics i
went to school for engineering actually but the uh big events in my life that shaped me where i was
kind of like the 9-11 generation so i i lived nearby new york city 9-11 happened when i was
10th grade um had a big impact on me the iraq war had a huge impact on me i was a junior senior in
high school watching that whole debate unfold and then going to college in the 04 to 08 period of time
during the early years of the iraq war when the protests were really alive during the surge all
of that um that really colored my view and and made me move into looking at international relations
and away from engineering and i just thought it was very important and i got fortunate enough to
get an internship at the human rights foundation in 2007 so i had a job going into the great financial
crisis which was which was really nice um and i stayed there uh i had opportunities to pursue
scholarship but i i decided to stay and i think that was a great decision i totally respect
scholarship but i obviously it's a very inward looking thing for for many years at the beginning
of your career at least and i feel like i've had an opportunity to like just learn from so many
people through the work we do you know beyond programs at href that are direct support for
people under authoritarian regimes we do a lot of gatherings so we have this thing called the
oslo freedom forum this is the 15th anniversary of it actually this year in june norway and it brings
together activists and dissidents and puts them on stage and has all the influential people in
the audience so we tried to sort of flip the davos model in davos it's like the powerful people are
on stage and the activists are prevented from accessing and they're protesting outside in the
freezing weather that's normally how it goes so we were like let's actually flip that let's put
the dissidents and troublemakers on the stage and let's let's have the billionaires and the
philanthropists and the influencers sit in the audience and listen so that's kind of the goal
we've had and and it's similar to the human rights foundation it's always had this focus on on
dictatorship um and on how can we just help people expand their own freedom i mean the main thing that
i learned as a as a in the iraq war generation is that freedom cannot be imposed it should not
be imposed it has to come from within and that's all these folks that we work for asking for i mean
i i have a really really good friend his name is vladimir karamurza he's a really famous russian
activist he just received a sentence this week of 25 years in prison he was outside of russia he went
back into russia to protest against putin's war and now he's going to be in prison for decades and
you know he'll be another soul senetsan i really do think so the guy's so eloquent powerful and brave
and what he always would say is that he said russians will bring democracy to russia stay out
of it uh but the least you can do is stop treating putin like like a legitimate world leader that
that's what his advice was to us like stop having dinners with him at the white house and and and
stop treating him and his cronies you know like anybody else so he was he was sort of calling
for us to just stop helping but i think the activist community i've met has taught taught me
very um deeply that again this freedom democracy stuff it can't be imposed it's got to be grassroots
and i've just seen evidence of that over and over and over again and and that's another
thing that's driven my interest in technology and open source code especially is that communities
form around this stuff everywhere in the darkest places in the world and we can help without being
kind of whatever imperialistic about it like we can just contribute to what they're doing
and help them on their own terms and that's kind of the philosophy that i think ahrefs had and that
i've had i have so many questions so you started at uh as an intern and now in 2023 you are the
chief strategy officer for human rights foundation at a time when in the global poly crisis with
energy depletion with climate change with a big geopolitical war with uh dollar hegemony at risk
with all these other things human rights are about to be a major issue in in coming years and decades
so how do you even strategize as the chief of strategy for such an organization with such a
large potential um quiver of of arrows of of needs yeah so we have my day job and then we
have my personal interest so what's important to understand about the day job and the human
rights foundation is that human rights is an industry and it has a certain amount of funding
and nearly all that funding comes from the west it comes from europe and united states mainly the
us so the grants that are given out globally for human rights work come from a small group of people
who are pretty homogeneous and um they understandably empathetic like i understand this that they
like to invest in their own backyard which makes sense if you're american you want to see an
improvement of human rights in the united states if you're in france you want to see an improvement
of human rights in france i have no issue with this but the outcome of this is that something like
90 of all the money spent on human rights work in the world gets spent in the west um so you have
kind of this like self-enforcing kind of feedback loop happening where if you are like a chinese
dissident or a group working in china there's no money for you you have no money i mean maybe you
get five ten thousand dollars here or there but you're scraping by and i mean if you're in a lesser
known dictatorship forget about it laos uh um you know you're living in madagascar you're living
in togo i mean there's there's just so little funding or resources for your struggle um so that's
why we do what we do is we find that people who live in authoritarian regimes have just have less
resources it's not necessarily a moral statement about uh democracies being better i've seen democratic
governments do the worst things i mean the invasion of iraq's a great example it's more
about the architecture like as an american i can start an organization i can i can donate to the
eff i can sue the u.s government i can't we can hold our leaders accountable relatively speaking
there's 80 000 non-profits in the united states we can leak stuff we can change the course of history
now that of course that gets tested look at wiki leaks but the point is it's possible
you live in saudi arabia no like you it's starting starting and a human rights group is illegal
some cases you can quite literally get your head cut off so i think this is the key distinction
that i try to walk is understanding a how fortunate i am but b how much more we can improve
as democracies and i the money piece really woke up my senses to the ladder like how how
exploitative we've actually been globally and how much we are responsible for a lot of these
dictators i didn't quite understand that until i learned about the global monetary system
so uh let's let's move on to that um you wrote a book uh called check your financial privilege
from last year in your book you begin by stating that anyone born into a country with a reserve
currency like the euro the yen the pound or the dollar has a financial privilege relative to 90
percent of the world population born into weaker systems can can you expand on that and and carry
on with what you were just saying we often hear about check your privilege right it's in a variety
of contexts i think that people need to check their financial privilege that's the point of the book
i would i realized as i checked my own privilege as i learned about it is that very few people on
earth have the benefits we have is let's just as speaking as i guess two americans here um
about a billion people live in a liberal democracy that has property rights and a reserve currency
meaning that their governments can essentially print money to buy things abroad like oil or
industrial materials etc um and that allows them to have cushy kind of social programs
this is this is one aspect obviously what we'll get i'm sure at some point into how this ties into
fossils and access to fossils as well but but the point is that only about a billion people
live in societies where the their government has a currency that's strong enough where
they can literally just print it and buy stuff now the u.s is the is the uh obviously key example
of this the biggest example we live in the world's first debt empire um never before has there been
a world empire that's been a a debtor empire every other empire before the u.s was a creditor empire
it it owned stuff it had a lot of assets the united states biggest export is is debt um and it's
just unique we've never seen this before and it definitely coincides with the transition of the
global monetary system from being based being tied on to gold something that's in the physical world
something that's scarce to not being tied in gold anymore to being tied to what we call fiat
money which is issued by decree so you can kind of see this map out and this is what i spend a
lot of time looking at but the point being that in this day and age there are a handful of nations
that can that can sort of print these claims and buy things like oil and then everybody else can't
so you have the other whatever six seven billion people and we're talking pre 2022 here pre the
putin invasion of ukraine which which we'll get to which has changed a lot of things i think and
set a lot of things in motion but when you had breton woods and like breton woods too kind of
these systems we were very fortunate and this allowed our countries to to basically subsidize
a lot of things in our societies and our think about the financial technology that we have like
it's just so easy for most americans and europeans to send money to each other to spend money abroad
to use dollars in africa or latin america people are happy to take them to access capital markets
to invest in stocks to you know hedge with all kinds of things you know the vast majority of
the world's population has no access to that their local fiat currency sucks that their best
bet at a savings technology is usually sheet metal or cattle i'm talking for the majority of the
world's population they can't teleport money to anybody on earth on demand and they live a very
different life and and i think that i just didn't really quite grasp that until i took a look at it
more closely so there's really two two layers here of of financial privilege one is the the
salaries and gdp per capita and income that is the product of living in the global west
on the backs of energy surplus there's the actual wealth and income inequality issue
but the second is in parallel living in a country that has its own reserve currency which makes
access and commerce and money moving and all those things like seamless and easy and and we
take it for granted yeah and again the us and the eu until recently had done a pretty good job
on inflation for a long time and and you know people you can't really remember i mean you have
to go back to the 70s to obviously write that you're i'm sure your listeners commiserate i mean
it's unprecedented what we're seeing now two years ago tons of people were telling me
inflation is impossible inflation is impossible in western society like this is literally what i
think the economic orthodoxy thought and i guess what they weren't humble enough like they didn't
understand that it could happen here too and i think it has happened here too and i think our
