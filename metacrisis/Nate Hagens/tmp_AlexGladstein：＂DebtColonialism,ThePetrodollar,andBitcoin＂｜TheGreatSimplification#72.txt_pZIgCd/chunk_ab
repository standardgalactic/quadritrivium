financial privileges is temporary it comes in waves and by looking at what happened in the 70s
i think i think we can learn a lot you know one thing that i thought was fascinating taking a page
from leftist scholars and marxist scholars is that there's a lot of things you can say about
just briefly going back to great depression and why the western world had this huge economic crisis
and obviously there's a debate between the the kensians and the austrians about well is it because
we left the gold standard or did we we not leave it soon enough etc etc right there's a third argument
though advanced by uh the authors of this book called capital and imperialism which is a terrific
book i don't necessarily agree with the conclusions but it's it's a really really interesting read
on history and they quite simply argue that a lot of the crisis that the western world faced at the
end of the 20s and 30s was because the british empire was collapsing and you had the like center
of the western financial system lose access to cheap labor and goods that it had been accustomed
to having for hundreds of plus years this just makes so much sense to me so that's like step one
step two is when the access to fossils themselves decolon you had decolonialization there right
so you had oil access which was traditionally managed by western powers at least for several
decades when oil first became a thing western companies seven sisters all that and then you had
like the opac nations actually take control you had the power shift um and guess what that led to
massive inflation in the west right so when we couldn't exploit the oil the energy uh for cheaper
than the market value um no any longer we we lost the ability to subsidize our nations and to
subsidize our currencies so i think this starts to map you start to see this happen every time we
pull like the west pulls back from power over the rest of the world we have economic crises
and this is so obvious in the 70s to me like literally like you you know right as opac start
to come into its own they decide to raise the price of oil the us goes into an inflationary
spiral makes an s to go off the gold standard it set everything else in motion so i've been
fascinated by looking at this and also by looking at the reverse what the us does impacts everybody
else so we hear a lot about the fed mandate right um the fed has a mandate low employment to keep you
know to keep inflation and check these things what people don't realize is what's not in the fed's
mandate is the livelihood of everybody else in the world so both in the early 80s and and last year
when the fed raised interest rates really fast um politically right for to to quell a domestic
issue at home in both cases we had inflation out of control right so the fed says okay we're
going to jack interest rates really fast this absolutely crushes the global south absolutely
crushes so in the 80s you had the third world debt crisis which caused the suffering of tens
of millions of people an uncountable number of deaths from starvation lack of nutrition etc
child mental nutrition and now you're seeing it again in the last 18 months you're seeing both
economic and political collapse all across the global south currencies collapsing the imf having
to come in and bail out countries the government's being toppled so i think what i've been really
interested in is is looking at both how economic stability and our comfort and our quality of life
our way of life in the west it relies on like resources elsewhere and then also looking at
how our decisions about how to retain stability and comfort and reduce inflation for for for
the average person um hurts other people so it's this really interesting back and forth
that i've been trying to trace out so there's a parallel to uh climate change and the environmental
movement is we don't include the prices of externalities and the price of our things so
we privatize the gains and the the losses are held by the commons and the environment right
it's the same thing in the us is where we're taking the gains from having the global reserve
currency the seniorage from the us dollar being the reserve currency and the benefits of spending
more than we have so we get all this stuff delivered to the united states but not the
responsibility of the financial impact of our monetary decisions on the rest of the world
right well i mean people say it very simply we export inflation right and i the authors of
capital imperialism said something really clear and distinct to me which which makes a lot of sense
old school imperialism or colonialism had had kind of a one main goal and that was to reduce
economic instability and inflation inside our societies by causing wage deflation in the periphery
and by taking cheap goods and labor from that those places and inputting them into our societies
so with super cheap goods and labor and by pressing down on the wages elsewhere
we could raise up the quality of life and make it uh less likely that that there would be mass
protest and overthrow of governments in the west and and that was has been sustained since the age
of colonialism through the international monetary system is is that a byproduct of our decisions
or is that a tacit goal of the decisions it's a really good question i you know it could be one
of these path dependency things it it i highly doubt that like again somebody was in a room and they
like mapped all this out um but it is an outcome of the system and something we don't speak about
and it hardly matters to the victims you know that's kind of the point like yeah if you're a
victim of a structural adjustment policy in the 1980s somewhere in latin america does it
does it matter to you whether the west uh intentionally did it or whether it was a
byproduct of their way of life i don't think it matters right so can you uh explain the mechanics
of why a sharp sudden increase in interest rates by the federal reserve in the united states
who's focusing on domestic inflation domestic issues causes a financial crisis abroad is this
because foreign countries have to use the dollar and they denominate their debt and dollars and so
all of a sudden what they what they owe suddenly spikes in amount yeah so i'll try to just briefly
outline two phenomena which which which lead to this and then i'll explain why the rates
the rise in rates hurts people um basically you have breton woods right you have world war two
you have the us and the allies getting together in new hampshire in a hotel to figure out what
the international monetary system is going to look like um they wanted an international system
canes wanted the bank core this was going to be an internationally managed currency with like
kind of percentage based participation from all the world nations sounds very kumbaya and obviously
you know it didn't happen because the u.s had the most gold because we didn't get wrecked in world
war one um and in the 20s we had a inflow of gold from all these other countries so because we had
the most gold and gold was the ultimate monetary good we got to make the rules so we said no no
bank core everybody's going to use the dollar redeemable at $35 per per ounce of gold meaning
other central banks would collect dollar claims and then they could redeem them for gold at $35
per ounce of gold now bear in mind the u.s government had already made it illegal to hold
gold inside the united states this is what fdr did in the early 30s in order to fund the new deal
was to confiscate the gold from all of america that's how he paid for it um it's something that
i think a lot of people have a political affinity for on the left because they like fdr but if this
happened today in any dictatorship we'd be like screaming about it i mean he he literally took
away like good money from people and replaced it with paper uh it's a kind of an outrage and
it's amazing it doesn't get more discussion these days was was that widespread or just sporadic
around i mean i'm sure there would be gold hidden somewhere that they no one knew about right was
it a really widespread around the nation that happened i mean executive order 6102 you can go
look it up it it um it mainly did not involve like yeah jack booted thugs at people's houses
because all the gold was usually kept at banks and centralized institutions so the government was
able to confiscate the gold the treasury was able to confiscate the gold of the fed by the way so
they took all the feds gold and they replaced it with claims and then they also rounded up all the
gold in regional banks companies etc americans couldn't own own gold again until the 70s until
i think 75 um it was illegal to own gold it was illegal to own gold absolutely look it up executive
order 6102 so first thing the american government did was take away the ability for the for the people
to escape inflation um this is called financial repression so this is what how they funded all
their programs from the 30s to the 70s was in many ways having the uh basically inflation rate
above the the you know the interest rate so if you're like owning us debt you're negative
you're not making money you're losing money um this is this is called financial oppression this is
what's happening right now when you have whatever when you have seven percent uh cpi and the fed
funds rate set like five percent or whatever you get my drift right you're losing some money there
so this was like par for the course for 40 years and and the american government first they took
away the ability for the american people uh to to hedge against that and then in 1971 they took away
the ability of the world to hedge against that so between 44 and 71 you had breton woods one which
was all these other central banks uh used dollars on the premise that they could redeem them for gold
now what happened in the 60s is that after jfk was assassinated you had a huge increase in american
fiscal spending on both the vietnam war and the great society stuff so you had guns and butter so
by the late 60s all these other governments were like america can't they can't like they can't actually
back this up and and the gold was dwindling it was crazy how much the gold our gold reserves
actually reduced uh to the point where in the summer of 71 the french sent a battleship to
new york city to redeem their gold to go to gall did this and and his and his his administrations
and and his successors they did this they sent a battleship to new york city and this this trip
and the british also tried to claim several billion dollars of gold and this triggered nixon to
meet with his advisors that august and go on television and deliver what's known as the
niction shock and and basically tell the world hey sorry all those claims that we said we would
redeem for gold we're not going to do that anymore so we rug pulled the whole world and all of a
sudden all these governments around the world had given their gold to us or to someone else
and they had gotten these little pieces of paper and then those papers will no longer back by
dollars and what happened was between 71 and 75 the dollar devalued against the german mark by 50
percent so the dollar started to to go into freefall basically we had huge inflation in the
united states and like i said before this was really exacerbated by our our losing control over
energy production i think these are extremely tied together so when did the petrodollar um
was born yeah so basically nixon and kissinger uh created the petrodollar not washington and
adams like this is uh our founders were extremely skeptical of the centralized monetary systems um
but these guys uh were total um opportunists right um they care less about the external costs
nixon famously was was saying there's there's a in the watergate leaks there's something where he
says uh i don't give a shit about the lira he was they were asking about italy and he was like i
don't care about them so these guys had no empathy for for our even our allies at the time and um
what what they realized is in order to fund vietnam and the great society stuff without getting
massive protests in the street they needed to find a way for someone to start buying american debt
like in large quantities so they hired a guy named williams william simon off wall street he
worked at salomon brothers he sold bonds this was his job to sell debt so they hired william simon
to be treasurer that's what i did i sold bonds at salomon brothers but go on great so you go back
in time it might have been you so they hired him off wall street to run the government's bond sales
program okay so simon goes so what what do you do when you're like oh man we got to sell our debt
you find someone who's got the most money in the world and who had the most money in the world in
1973 saudi arabia i mean the amount of money of capital the capital account in opac because of the
rise of the price of oil and dollar terms from whatever it was two to twelve dollars it was so
astronomical the saudis and opac they didn't know what to do with all this money they couldn't possibly
invest it internally so we sent despite the war despite us being you know back and forth and on
different sides with regard to israel we sent simon out there he went to jeddah then the crown
prince came to dc that later in 74 and then nixon went to saudi arabia and and met the king and all
this this is all in the history books none of this is speculation this is all in that you go back
you look at new york times articles and what what we came to an agreement was was called the petrodollar
pact and there's four elements to the petrodollar pact number one the saudis would price oil in
dollars and and enforce the rest of opac pricing oil in dollars meaning like before that point what
before that point what was it priced sure i mean it was it was you before that point like
you you could obviously dollars were dominant because it it we had the largest economy and
dollars are flowing around everywhere it was dollar diplomacy right but like it wasn't um
like you could do a deal with opac to use your fiat currency to buy oil like this was possible
now keep going when yeah sure so so when when this was starting to when this was enforced
it just has so many network effects uh like basically it really crowds out everything else
and it really makes the dollar it increases demand for the dollar obviously if you have to find dollars
to pay like if malawi needs oil they they can no longer print their own currency or use the currency
of a local african nation they have to get dollars well how does malawi get dollars they can't print
them they have to export stuff to the united states or to an ally um which means that we can control
their society we can tell them what we want and we can change their internal structure and we can
force them to make stuff we want this is how all of us agricultural policy has gone actually it's
gone hand in hand with energy policy so these countries now have to earn dollars instead of
serving their own needs and becoming sovereign and productive they have to pay debt back in dollars
now just as an aside at the same time the petrodollar is coming to an existence the imf and world bank
are are really surging into the scene in the global south and all this debt that's flowing in
in the 70s uh is dollar denominated so keep that in mind for later like so you're getting this massive
amount of dollar denominated debt going into the global south a lot of it is from these earnings
so to stay on the petrodollar uh number one is that the saudis and opec uh mandate that
you can only pay us in dollars to buy oil and number two is what's called petrodollar recycling
we're going to recycle the dollar profits back into us debt and that was done um in some ways
through the euro dollar system which i'll explain in a second but basically you had these two elements
on the Saudi side on the american side what we agreed to do was sell them weapons at a lower
than market rate and protect them so that was the petrodollar pact and that's colored all of our
relationship with Saudi Arabia ever since including up till today where it seems to be unraveling but
like i know i can get into that but you see you have not only our relationship with Saudi Arabia
but our the entire global economic system it's colored that for the last totally yeah yeah
what i what i'll just point out is that i'm not i think the petrodollar is really important
especially in the 70s i mean the dollar was collapsing um and you look at like pre petrodollar
the british pound still accounted for like a sizable amount of petroleum trade after it
basically went to zero so it's definitely a transitionary moment and i think that um yeah go
ahead well i was just going to say you know what else happened in 1970 71
us non uh shale oil peaked um growth in global oil production at uh hit its all-time production
growth it was growing at seven or eight percent a year there 1971 was the all-time peak of that
growth rate yeah um 1971 was in the genuine progress indicator which is a measure of GDP
that subtracts out the bats that's when that peaked and Richard Nixon also did something
positive here was 1970 was the first earth day but sorry to interrupt you keep going Alex no no
it's fine and we're gonna stay on this so we just described the petrodollar system now that's
that's a political system that is not a free market outcome that was a political negotiation
and Greenspan who was in the Ford administration kind of as this thing was ha as this thing was
being fleshed out through the 70s he's on record saying that it was uh a you know not a market
decision however at the same time you have the euro dollar system which is worth describing briefly so
back in the 50s the soviet allies in europe they they didn't want to have their savings
in rubles for obvious reasons uh that's a weak currency um they wanted dollars uh so
they basically were able to create dollar contracts at banks outside the purview of
u.s government these are called euro dollars they're just dollars that are outside the u.s
banking system so these started to spread and they were created entirely without permission or
authority of the u.s government this is a free market phenomenon um globally free market is what
i mean um and by the 60s 70s uh that they start to increase in size there's more and more and more
euro dollars so you have to know that there's there's two things happening here one is a free
market interest in having the dollar okay but the other one is a political design that they're both
important it's impossible to say which one's more important but like let's just consider
they're both key for for what we're about to get to so what ends up happening is the saudi's
opec they have this incredible amount of money they invested back into the u.s banking system
the u.s banking system and the euro dollar system they have in europe they have all these dollars
okay so they do dollar denominated debt to the global south this is in the late 70s
