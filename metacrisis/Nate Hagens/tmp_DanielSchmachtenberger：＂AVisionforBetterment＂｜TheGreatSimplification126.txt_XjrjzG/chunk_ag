them and then other members of that same gang come offer them security services for sale.
And so they are protecting them from themselves for a fee. So they are basically manufacturing
the demand and then offering the supply. The amount, if you look at
how much of our modern market and market government system meets the criteria of creating a problem
that's a result of some part of market or technology that some other part of market
and technology will come to solve that will then simultaneously create new problems. The
whole thing being a racket is actually a very important insight. But with that definition
of a racket what he says here is war is a racket. It always has been. It is possibly the oldest,
easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one international in
scope. That's not true anymore. He wrote this in like 1881. Oh no, 19 something.
It's the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses are in lives.
Racket is best described I believe as something that is not what it seems to the majority of
the people. Only a small inside group knows what it's really about. It's conducted for the benefit
of the very few at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people always make huge fortunes.
I mean again another microcosm of our situation. But now I'm seeing war in light of this conversation
as a progress narrative erasing parts of history and writing a narrative for the masses that
feels good. It sounds about right but is really divorced from what could be possible
given our history. Now people will say that I'm romanticizing indigenous life and don't I know
that there was infanticide and blah blah blah. I'm not romanticizing it. I'm saying that the
Hobbesian story is the villainization of it and that's definitely self-interested propaganda
that justifies evil and that there was obviously a humongous range of the way tribal people lived
over 200,000 years in different environments with different groups of people. Oh this was the
unsubstantiated thing I was going to say earlier. Now it comes back. So we were saying that there
was this kind of symmetry of power that happens through natural selection where the increase in
power happens through this evenly distributed mutation with co-selection. But that when we
start developing technologies that increase our let's say coordinated predative capability faster
than the rest of the environment it can also be increasing its resilience to it, then we can
over hunt an environment and rather than have our population shrink either start farming the
environment or move on to the next population move on to the next environment and start over hunting
it. So there is some indication though it does seem like the the jury's still a little bit out on
some of this that the extinction of a lot of the megafauna and the earlier hominids was the result
of sapiens success at this strategy meaning it was uh extinctionary including to the other kinds
of humans we could be inhabiting the world with early on. So the hypothesis I have is that the
early indigenous wisdom traditions were learning from some of those mistakes and there are certainly
indigenous stories that indicate this that when some of them have stories that when they saw the
destruction that they were able to cause with their stone tools they realized that they had
to bind them with wisdom and that the kind of wisdom traditions emerge to take more careful
responsibility and that there may have been something like one phase of a unrenewability
and then lessen that led to a more kind of sustainable phase. So that's the thing I'm
saying is I can't substantiate across the board but sounds probably at least part of the truth.
You increasingly talk about indigenous cultures, indigenous wisdom and you bring up examples
that I've never heard of. How do you learn all this?
There are obviously some books in paper studying this and there are increasingly
indigenous people who are becoming scholars who are also but who speak their native languages and
are translating it but I've also just pursued making friends with people of that type particularly
the ones who have studied their own histories and kind of understand modern anthropology,
evolutionary theory, sociology and can kind of explain the parallax on those ideas and this
is an area I actually really want to invest a lot more time and attention because the thing
that we call civilization has been around for a very short period of time. The thing we call
industrial civilization in even a shorter period of time, the thing we call civilization is fair
to call the domestication, the beginning of human domestication where the other thing was more
sapiens in the evolutionary environment. We call it wild now, it was not but they wouldn't have
called it wild and the domestication of humans at scale and the domestication of livestock went
together and this is actually really fascinating right which is the and we've talked about this
before that the emergence of the plow and kind of ox drawn or you know donkey or horse drawn plow
creating grain and surplus you could call the beginning of the Anthropocene where if I'm hunting
and gathering I don't want to change the ecosystem I want to partake in the abundance of the ecosystem
right like maybe within the trees a little bit but even if I am digging with a digging stick
like an early horticulture I can't do vast spaces so I don't need to clear cut land to
allocate it to agriculture. Once I get and grains aren't useful in small amounts
but once I can have an ox draw the plow and I can do these vast kind of row crops now I can get
enough grains and I can store them better than I could store other stuff that I can get this kind
of vast surplus so we can see why the the ox drawn plow was a massive advancement in the ability for
surplus which meant that you could grow a much larger population. It meant that you could
sin that surplus along war routes so that you could support much larger wars. It meant that you
could with that large population have more specialization and division of labor so you could advance
the total tech stack you know it means all of those things but with the emergence of the plow
was also the end of animism because in the hunter-gatherer life sometimes the animal kills me
sometimes I kill the animal just like in the predator-prey kind of relationships I can pray to
the spirit of the buffalo I can apologize for needing to take its body I can say when my body
dies and goes into the earth and becomes the grass that its ancestors will eat that we are part of
this great cycle of life and we breathe our spirit into each other but I can't domesticate that
buffalo into an ox and yoke it and beat it all day long and still talk about the great spirit of
the buffalo and so then we move to man's dominion over kind of models religions that the animals
god put us here to rule over they're all here for us dominion etc and the domestication of the
animals where their well-being didn't matter they were here for us also corresponds to the
beginning of slavery. So that's all those things you just mentioned are a story that the winners
are telling? Totally and it's why the indigenous narratives of the early civilization are very
different and it's that the agricultural revolution was not an awesome thing but
if the population that does that thing will become a larger population with more specialization
division of labor and then it will win in war against the cultures who don't so one of the
insights is that when a new technology emerges there's two insights here that are important
first is technology is not values neutral we've talked about this it actually changes human values
because in using it like if I go walking around in a forest with a camera what I perceive changes
because of holding the camera I'm looking at different things if I go walking around with a
gun my perception of the forest changes if I go walking around with an axe my perception of the
forest changes the affordance of that tool attenuates my attention to the things that that tool can do
something with and so the process of even engaging with the tool attenuates attention
right changes the nature of attention and then it also makes a different behavioral pattern beating
an ox all day long is very different than hunting it's it so I'm going to have agrarian methods
rather than hunter-gatherer methods I'm going to be dreaming and thinking and feeling in those
types of ways I'm going to be conditioning my nervous system based on the movement patterns
that my body is going through in those ways I'm going to have radically less complex total movement
patterns than I had in the other environment which leads to less complex and dynamic thought and
phenomenological patterns and on and on so and then of course I can't believe that the animal
is animistic and as soon as I do the dominion model then and they were here for us then the women
are here for the men and the lower classes are here for the upper classes and the slaves are here
for the slave owners and the and the what was a forest that we had the clear cut to turn it into
agland is all fine and so that model starts to develop so the first thing is the technology
is not values neutral it will code our attention and change our behaviors and as a result change
our psyches and societies and heaps of ways so the externalities of tech are not only physical
they're psychosocial the next thing is that if that thing confers advantage game-theoretic
advantage it becomes obligate because the people who don't use it will just simply lose in power
competitions even if what wins at power sucks for all kinds of metrics of what is beautiful and good
and so the technology is both mind altering value altering attention altering culture altering
behavior altering and obligate and this is why the Sabbath was about controlling the use of
technology and controlling productivity this is why wisdom around when a new technology came out do
we build this or not and if so how do we use it how do we change those patterns to be considered
is necessary and if you do not have that then everyone becomes the result of dominant culture
dominant technology because it has to the whoever is best at running the system of technological
power and that was cavalrymen at the time of Genghis Khan and it was industrial tech at the
time of Rockefeller and it was computer tech at the time of Gates and it was the people who it is
now at the time of AI and etc whoever is best at the power associated with the tech stack will
also then determine the narratives and they will be narratives that support that power stack as good
So I know you and your organization are working on some pretty important projects yet you spent
the time these last few months to write this paper on immature versus authentic progress
presumably because you think it's critical that people understand this and think about it and
presumably because you see some sort of a maybe thin but narrow but a path forward
where we can head towards a more authentic progress for our fellow humans alive on the
planet today and in the future can you outline that or are there still foundational pieces?
Yeah so
there are many famous authors who have contributed to the progress narrative and of why
antibiotics and vaccines got rid of pandemics and plagues you know etc and why
Haber-Bosch and the Green Revolution led to being able to feed so many more people and why
you know on and on all the good things and why it's getting why the world's getting better and better
and there's not no truth to this
but it is definitely cherry-picked it is definitely what is better for those who were not
genocided or extincted or killed in war or are still in the positions of poverty that the same
system that is offering those things to some is creating for others right it's definitely cherry
picked in terms of who it's looking at progress for and it's definitely cherry picked in terms of what
value metrics it's considering and which value metrics it's not considering
it's definitely also framed that the types of value that were destroyed are not even
mentioned or talked about the types of value that are not really real value they're basically
like racket type value are overemphasized a lot of the comparisons are decontextualized
there will be things like in 1815 the average American only you know had a dollar fifty a day
and now inflation and just did they have 10 times that or you know whatever it is
you're like yeah but they grew their food in a way that didn't take dollars and they
made their own house and like the idea that dollars were mediating their life was gibberish
that's not true so you're decontextualizing the fact of dollar as how their life was mediated
which it is now to then is not true right so there's a place where that is we wrote another
paper called how to mislead with facts and it's cherry picked the facts decontextualize the facts
and then kind of lake off frame the facts and you can make specious conclusions from true facts
right so that's that story and so I'm not saying that there are no truths in it but like
okay if the if you take the best examples that there have been like the the progress stories
darlings you know hoverbosch is obviously one of them which is the creation of synthetic nitrogen
and then you know beyond that synthetic fertilizer which is now you know NPK
which did make a lot of unarable soil arable and did allow us to be able to grow a lot more
total crop through you know industrial agriculture and that did play a major role in the population
going from half a billion to 8 billion in 200 years which is a 16x in population and as you
state the in the industrialized world the resource consumption per capita was not just the food but
all of the energy for the entire system the energy the tractors are using in the lights whatever
and that's something like hundred x during that same time
and that hundred xing per capita and 16 xing the capita in a very very short period of time from
what was already kind of a steady state post agrarian revolution right which was had brought
the numbers to way higher than they were in the kind of hunter gather time
is all using resources from the earth faster than they can regenerate and turning them into
trash and pollution faster than they can be processed even calling it resources right this
is when you're talking about language the idea that a whale is a natural resource as opposed to
a sentient being with its own life is not that different than the idea that a person as a slave
is a natural resource rather than a sentient being the idea that a 3000 year old redwood tree is a
natural resource because I can make timber out of it and we you know in business we talk about
human resources which is not beings that are whose moms had hopes for them and who are going and
who have children and who are going to have deathbed reflections they are resources that
we want to employ in a way where we get more out of them than we put into them
fuck right like it is such a it's such a psychopathological worldview and the instrument
instrumentalizing of everything in that kind of way so nature is not natural resources nature
is nature nature is all the beings that were here for all this time before we were here
and that our life doesn't exist without I am because we are right so you look at the Haber
Bosch and you say okay was that exclusively good that thing where that population grew and the
resource consumption grew but there's a curve that looks at human population and species extinction
and shows how closely those are correlated and the dead zones in the ocean are the result of the
agricultural affluent from the Haber Bosch right and like where it's a three-quarter water planet
we have 500 dead zones that are the result of that mechanism and a lot of the health issues that
people have are because we're not putting everything that came out of the soil back into the soil
we're taking everything out and putting three minerals back in right a very tiny subset so you
get micronutrient efficiency so you look at that darling and you're like this was not exclusively
comprehensively good so we're just fixing the prices uh on environmental externalities energy
and other non-renewable inputs get us much of the way towards uh real progress
kind of sort of
because all those negative things that you just said none of those are in our price system at all
right indulge me quickly on the this one other example I wanted to give of a darling of the
progress story which is like the one that is so easy to sympathize with of who wants to do
dentistry in the time before novocaine like fuck that that seems dreadful torturous
okay now I can't say that I know for sure how dentistry in the time before novocaine
but in the indigenous world specifically so this is important a lot of the dreadful world
before the progress narrative was the already civilization system right people living in
cities during the dark ages and whatever where we saw the great plagues do you have huge plagues
that are zoonotic when you don't have animal husbandry where you have you know close proximity
with all of the rats and the cats and the all of those types of things with the grain stores and
the animals that are there inside of large population density urban centers no right yeah
it's a very different situation and so so many of those problems like a high population density
city high population per capita shitty hygiene and animal husbandry you know in the environment
yes that's a pandemic breeder and but the answer could have been to change the city design right
not just let's you know vaccines and you know antibiotics etc I actually think we might under
a tribute how much just plumbing and hygiene went to the benefits that occurred there but
so if you look at the so much of what we think about of how barbarous dentistry and medicine
whatever were was also again in the post the the post Caesar Genghis Khan
uh you know etc era the post civilization era you go back to indigenous world and
western prices work and I know there are questions on replication and whatever on
western prices work but western prices work when you know he's involved in founding the
