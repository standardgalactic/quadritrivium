american dental association he was looking at the last hunter gather tribes around can turn of
last century that had not adopted grain into their diet not gotten into agriculture because
it's not grain and hunter gather and he found that they had no cavities and they didn't have a
problem was with wisdom teeth and they didn't have major occlusion issues they had these amazing
teeth right this was a huge thing that he documented and he's like we didn't just evolve
wrong or we have wisdom teeth issues we're eating a diet that demineralizes our bones so that we
don't actually have the bone density to be able to get that last part so we have wisdom teeth that's
also the occlusion issues and it's also the cavities these people didn't have toothpaste
or toothbrush but they also didn't have cavities then watched when western diet was introduced
specifically heavy grain diet and they all started getting cavities and having occlusion
issues so again from the racket perspective do i like novocaine if i have to get my mouth
drilled on yes is it entirely possible that a huge amount of the dental issues were already the
result of having solved problems in shitty ways that caused externalities to our orthodonture and
to our dentistry itself or then now you need that thing and the right answer would have been a
comprehensively different tech stack right that didn't have most of human diet come from something
that we didn't evolve to eat do we even as a culture as a species have the ability to measure
and govern such complexity like obviously once western price and other people like him figured
that out was there a vector to change what was happening or was it the the racket in the one
person in 10 that had the dark triad traits just swamped everything else the direction of more
new technology keeps increasing novel complicating effects that are very hard to monitor but like
let's say we're let's say we're talking about humans in a state of nature right vast majority of
human civilization do we understand how the whole world works no do we understand everything about
hydrology and how all the convection patterns work and how all the funguses and bacteria and
kingdoms and everything work no of course not but does it work yes and did it take billions of years
of radically complex evolution doing distributed information processing to make that whole thing
work and it's still doing all that yes okay so things that I do that are going to change that
whole system in a way that doesn't have any evolutionary precedence I should kind of go
slow on I should kind of like really think through and do some tests and really look at all of the
effects now if so can let's talk about the complexity for a minute
let's say we discuss the movement from what we call currently conventional which is kind of this
weird industrial agriculture method where you turn natural ecosystems into basically desertified
soil that you spray NPK on you put highly hybridized row crops in that are designed for
combines and then you cover them in pesticides herbicides and fungicides that are designed
to kill the most robust creatures and then humans are both getting trace mineral deficiency
super weird genetics of the plants dead microbiome of the soil that modulates the genetics of it
and covered in pesticides and herbicides so then we have all these diseases so you see
disease on the rise but then the answer is pharmaceuticals and they're regulated by the
same industry food and drug and the NIH puts money into drug studies and stuff but not into
dietary studies which is why the food pyramid is created by the American Dairy Council and
American Grain Council and you know so so you look there's a racket right of course it's a
fucking racket and whether it was designed or emerged through shared system incentives is actually
mostly irrelevant to the point of course it's some of both and but if you say okay
how does soil work in a natural system everything that comes out of it goes back into it there's
a loop closure right so the tree when it dies decomposes into the soil the leaves when they
fall decompose into the soil the animals that are eating the things their poop goes into the
soil and their bodies go into the soil everything that comes out goes back in and it's actually
all made of the same atoms right the same distribution of atoms basically like six
elements that make up most everything in the distribution of trace elements if I take stuff
out of the soil that involves all of the living compounds and the complex chemistry the humic
and fulvic acids and the and the amino acids being produced and the etc and all the trace minerals
and I put back in three minerals that are enough to make something that looks like a plant
but has totally lower amounts of macronutrients and different phytochemicals and etc like it's kind
of can I predict exactly every single biochemical change no can I tell that's probably gonna have
problems yes that's pretty easy to tell do I want to not spray things designed to be poisonous to
cockroaches that could make it through nuclear war and designed to be poisonous to exoskeleton
creatures do I want to not spray poisons like that on the food that we eat yeah that like that
seems pretty reasonable and do we do we not want to grow food in a way that is killing the top
soil that we depend upon but this should be regenerating it so you start to look at what are
the principles all the stuff that comes out has to go back in there's going to be a balance of
things that fix nitrogen in the soil and use nitrogen the principle set to do it well is
amazingly simple and what is that this is I'm this what I'm giving an example like in this
case of agriculture like how do you do agriculture properly put it put back in the soil all the
things that come out of it make sure that the things that are in the soil have a distribution
of the different types of things that are kind of like you find in a natural system natural system
has legumes fixing nitrogen and non legumes pulling it out and then it has plants that naturally
repel excessive amounts of insects of the insects of those come to there you can see those patterns
in nature so can we build off of that you know the kind of permaculture approach that just maps
some of what nature is doing and can we tell that if the trace minerals that are in the plants are
in the animals that eat the plants that we evolved with go back into the soil and back into the plants
that we're eating I can't predict exactly what percentage that will lower ms over what time period
relative to all the other multi factors but can I versus rheumatoid arthritis versus autism but
can I guess that as we get the trace minerals back in as we get the quality of the soil up as
we get the pesticides out following the way the curves of the diseases and the curves of those
things happen together that in general the health of the soil the health of the plants health of
the ecosystem and the health of the people are all going to go up together yes and I don't need to try
to optimize every I don't need to understand every bit of how the soil my microbiology does
everything it does I have to just pay attention to what it needed to do that evolutionarily
and continue to support that I but this is that thing again we have to appreciate the thing that
is already here with its evolutionary complexity and seek to maintain it and make sure that what
I'm adding to it is not debasing that which it depends upon so in your paper you outlined
three strategies to move towards authentic progress uh and I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you uh to to list
those in a second but first I want to read a quote from your paper okay progress worth believing in
progress that is really about increasing betterment increasing the goodness in the world must still be
able to be considered good once it is taken account of all perspective and externalities
so for such here's my question for such a metric to occur doesn't there first need
to be a culture wide change in our values otherwise why would such a thing come about
there's another paper that we wrote on perverse asymmetries and the perverse asymmetries are
kind of this like entropic gradient which is if I cut the tree down or I kill a whale or whatever
I didn't kill all whales I didn't cut down all trees there are still forests I can access
I can still breathe the air so I'm not experiencing that I'm causing the problem at scale
and in fact I'm not causing the problem at scale I'm causing some tiny little
paper cut towards it and everybody else is doing that but the advantage of the tree to
my family as timber and selling it on the market is profound and obvious so there is this asymmetry
between how significant the upside is to me versus how what a tiny part I am of the downside
but then the system dynamics of everybody doing that absolutely ensures the downside and ensures
it to be something that will end up affecting everyone so there's a lot of perverse asymmetries
like that like those who pay more attention to the risks of a technology up front won't win the
technological race and first mover advantage is those who pretend that it isn't there or cover it
up and make narratives about how positive it is and scale it rapidly ultimately we have to overcome
all of those perverse asymmetries because we are powerful enough that we are not small relative
to the ecosystem anymore you know or small relative to our own survival our own species capacity
and so this is a with that much growth of like no other species could
destroy the ecosystems that they depend upon so they did not have to ensure that they didn't
end because we can we have to ensure that we don't right and this is the whole that the same
recursive abstraction that leads to the ability for technological progress and war strategy
and business strategy that that same recursive abstraction can lead to the vow of the bodhisattva
and the recognition the conscious recognition when men are not the web of life we are merely a
strand in it whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves and extending our compassion to all
sentient beings in the universe we can expand our capacity for wisdom as much as we expanded
for intelligence we can expand the scope of our considerations of what a good goal is as much as
we expand our goal achieving what i'm saying is we must now you're asking is there a cultural
thing that has to happen yes obviously our culture as we already said is being in shaped by our
tools and by our social systems so our our superstructure our culture our value systems
our social structures our economies and governance systems and institutions and our infrastructure
our tool set are all co-influencing each other all three of them are co-influencing each other
so obviously we can't as you as you saw when you're in india you change your environment and
something that no amount of moralizing yourself to do whatever work was automatic in a different
environment and so can we achieve cultural change by just moralizing people that they
should culturally change while they're still in the environment that is predisposing the culture
that is here no that's not going to work that well at the same time where is the intervention
point is some people who already recognize that that's not a culture they value enough they recognize
the fail of it they meditate on meaningful enough that they actually stop willing to be complicit
with it and not just to remove themselves which is a step which some people do but to say how do
i dedicate my life energy to changing those dynamics which should then entail a study of
change efforts that were well motivated and failed and or made worse problems so as to not
repeat that to try to understand why that happens to understand what change that would change all
that could actually would require and what it would be like now of course to really change
culture at scale we have to change the technology and what it predisposes right we have to change
the social systems as long as you have an economic system where putting the externalities are
externalized and cost then i can't empathize and take want to take responsibility for all the
harm that i'm causing if i'm competing against someone who's not internalizing those costs like
economically you can't you're economically incentivizing sociopathy through the cost
externality so of course that has to change and of course is that changes that makes possible
a different value set in the same way that like the algorithm on facebook could up regulate for
different things it could up regulate for exposing people to different worldviews and
different ideas and paying attention to only up regulating the ideas that drive common unity
rather than division so those are places where culture is affected by technology and social
system but how does it start it has to start with a culture first recognition of the i am because
we are the version of progress that is good for i that is not for we is actually not real progress
i remove myself from that thing i won't participate in the lie of it and i will
dedicate myself to wanting to understand what is what actually be good for the whole and make
sure my life energy is in service to that and then progressively that i am participating in
things that have more agency to be able to affect them so it starts with a change of values and
consciousness with some people and that expands upwards and ultimately i think you're inferring
that we need a modern day equivalent of a Sabbath superimposed on to the super organism
structure that is leading us into a terminal phase i want to speak to imposed people with a
libertarian bent will be naturally concerned by some of what is being said and i want to speak to
them okay that was my word i could have used emerge or something but go on but we did talk
about restraint and then we talked about if someone wants to do the thing that is more
like a cancer cell or more like cause tribal warfare they're not going to be the ones to
restrain themselves from doing it other people will have to that is something like law right that
is something like imposition and so then we are right to consider how those systems have went in
the past and because using force to curtail someone's liberty has its own problems even
if what they're wanting to do with their liberty has problems and that's already in in the zeitgeist
right now a lot of people are worried that climate change is such a thing that will cause people to
eat bugs and not own anything and all kinds of authoritarian rules yeah and i think if the
people who were talking about the eating bugs or the solution and not owning anything were
themselves not major capital owners who were not applying those things to themselves people might
feel a little better about it but like the dude that is a hunter gatherer and he eats a lot of
crickets and grubs and if he says like bugs are good like nobody's freaked out about that they're
freaked out about it's a situation of radical wealth inequality and class warfare and the
class warfare telling more stories of justifying radical inequality as the you know as the solution
while they have the largest carbon footprints themselves so like understandable right so the
thing that i want to say is the you you introduced me to her Vanessa on reality who you had on the
show who i had a conversation with and just thought she was amazing and really respect
was in her book she said that her the chief of her tribe the his definition of colonialism she
probably said that on your show but i'll bring it up is that colonialism was not about taking
other people's land fundamentally or about abuse of land or abuse of people or anything that those
were epiphenomenon that the core of it was believing there are separable things
hmm and you can say even deeper than that is being conditioned to perceive the world as a
bunch of separable things which is what bone said was the underlying cause of all the problems
which is what christian marty said was the cause of all the problems which is what einstein said
so if i believe there's a bunch of separable things and i'm separate from other things
and i can optimize some things at the expense of other things and then i can actually rationalize
that everything is trade-offs and that's how it is and etc and you know then
reify social Darwinism and nonsense like that so the root one could say that the root of the issues
is if people want things that inevitably cause harm to others
that's the root of the problems either because they know it causes harm and they want it anyway
so it's some kind of you know rivalry or sociopathy or something like that or because
they don't know it causes harm and it's from you know ignorance and externality they just want
that they want they're not thinking about what all the cause and effect would be because if you
then say great let's let the let's let people pursue what they want and what they pursue getting
causes harm and then also creates propagating patterns where to protect themselves against
the harm the other people have to do similar competitive things and blah blah blah and you
have a world defined by arms races but if the other answer is don't let the people pursue
what they want use some kind of enlightened law that says that's bad and prevented by force the
oppression is inherently also bad and the asymmetry of force tends to lead to an increasing corruption
of the power stack and so neither of those are good so as long as humans believe
that they are separate from everything else as long as they perceive the world separately you
were mentioning language earlier and I think similarly Vanessa was telling you that English has
like 70% of the words are nouns and most indigenous languages a very small percentage of the words
are nouns you look at whitehead as one of the kind of great philosophers of 20th century and
the reason he came to process philosophies like there's no things like the things that we think
of as things are processes of interaction of other things right a tree is not a static noun it's
the doing trillions of metabolic functions every second it's interacting biophysically with the
sun and the air it's interacting biochemically it's interacting biologically doing gene transfer
with the fungus on its roots and the soil microbes like the tree is in a live process it's a verb
it's a lots of verbs and the idea that it's a noun just makes us think very poorly makes us very
bad thinkers and the fact that we're thinking in nouns all the time and built into our language is
making us bad thinkers at scale that we don't even realize because we don't know what it's like to
