we have to work with or a fixed input it so they have a different scarcity dynamic it's really
only limited by the energy and atoms needed for the computational substrate but then also limited
by human time the attention seconds thing of how much software is useful if it requires either an
interface the the software is either going to move atoms around so you have to couple it to atoms
it's going to move bits around in ways that take energy the software is but it's it's going to
require energy so it's coupled to that well and or it's coupled to you know entertainment or some
kind of human engagement directly so it's coupled to finite amounts of attention so you don't get
an infinite scaling on the value of bits that is decoupled from human attention atoms and energy
well there's also a qualitative aspect to the bits too based on what culture cares about
one thing i would say on the atoms energy bits so the first thing is of course
atoms aren't that useful unless we can rearrange them and move them around and that takes energy
and energy is not useful if we aren't moving atoms or bits around with it or moving it through
things made of atoms right so we care about it to have a motor that moves an atom around or
something like that and bits are going to be coding for the thing that we're going to
you know the the digital pattern that we're actually going to build in the physical world
or something that is related to and at minimum running on a computational substrate energy and
atoms so there are coupling coefficients between them where you don't get to just increase bits
indefinitely independent of atoms and energy you can increase them to some extent and those
where you'll get increases in efficiency but then that's why the jevons paradox still matters
is what happens with those increases in efficiency so those increases in efficiency have to not
jevons paradox which means we need a binding dynamic because the pure market dynamic will
just turn that into a maximum power principle and forever growth those increases in efficiency
have to also turn into less total utilization to deal with actual limits of growth and you're
not going to get that sort of pure incentive system you need that sort of binding system
that'll get into what we talk about later of how do you make governance in the presence of
international multipolar traps and the fact that markets typically capture the regulatory system
rather than the other way around so how do energy while jewels bits and atoms
well the first thing i want to say is there's something like a jevons paradox on all of them
and jevons paradox was obviously name that looking at energy but it's because energy is a
relevant input to any kind of industrial process any kind of you know market process so an energy
gets cheaper more total market space opens up well compute has become useful to pretty much
every market right so when compute becomes cheaper we use more total compute that's a
that's another kind of jevons paradox on computation and we don't say great now we'll
compute with less energy we say great now there's more total shit that we can apply computation to
but it would also be true to say anything that is industrial input that is useful not in one
industry but widely when it becomes cheaper will increase total market so if if we can extract steel
more cheaply and steel is key to our ability to build vertically in you know pop high population
spaces as that gets cheaper we will build more shit grow populations more and grow net markets
more so what i would say is there is this generalized jevons paradox that when anything
that is relevant for the market as a whole gets cheaper the market as a whole grows
and so you have that kind of boomerang on efficiency not just on energy but kind of
at large and that's an important part of understanding maximum power principle
i agree with that though i think the opposite is about to start happening that we've gotten a
clue with ukraine and russia and europe's dependence on russian hydrocarbons that as energy gets more
expensive everything in society is going to get more expensive including solar panels and wind
turbines you know the last three months etc so as we've been focusing on the powers of what
technology can provide for us during that era that narrative was supported by pretty much
every year we grew our access to fossil energy and most of the time it was very cheap but there's
a multiplier effect that we add thousands to ten thousands of units of fossil energy to replace
tasks that the ox or my great great great great grandfather did in the fields and so that because
of that our industrial processes our bits and atoms are incredibly sensitive to price increases
in energy at 200 a barrel energy oil it's still effectively magic for what it can do for us but
many of the energy intensive processes in the world would become unprofitable at that point the
entire market depends upon pricing you talk about pricing the cost of energy the cost of extraction
rather than what it would actually take for us to make that substrate and and the total
externality cost this is also another kind of corollary of the kind of market dynamics and
maximum power principles is not just the cost of energy but the cost of steel the cost of anything
is going to be the cost of extraction and then some margin right so it's going to cost us something
and this is kind of that return on investment topic it's going to cost us something to get
out of the earth but we didn't make it there and there's going to be you know a lot of
costs that is externalized not to our balance sheet in terms of we just destroyed rivers and
extincted some species and ruined some indigenous people's lives and you know whatever but
and we just can't make we just can't make hydrocarbons at scale like that that have that
organic chemistry complexity and so but if anyone just extracts it because there isn't a law we
call it being industrious to extract we there's a law saying stealing from the balance sheet of
nature because nature doesn't have a balance sheet is anything other than being industrious then I
just have to have enough margin to sell it and I don't want too much margin because somebody
else will do it and come with a lower margin so the market will end up setting the price right
so the market incentivizes extraction and externalization and so what that means is a
sustainable market because you can't keep extracting and externalizing and using unremovable resources
forever a sustainable market almost everything would not that we currently have would not be
viable like almost nothing would be profitable and the profitability dynamics if we weren't
externalizing all of the costs and burning through unremovable things unremovably would
be completely fucking different and this is the thing you're underscoring it's like what would
that actually look like if we made sure that we actually had we were using energy in ways that we
could continue to use energy and we were using atoms in ways that we could continue to use atoms
what would that system look like and it looks fundamentally different I think this is what's
so fundamental in your work is saying hey we have to really rethink what does it mean to have a system
that you're not continuously subsidizing as we're about to lose our ability to keep subsidizing this
thing I totally agree um a slight clarification we actually can make low carbon hydrocarbon fuel
with technology we can over build solar panels and wind turbines near bodies of water via hydrolysis
we can create methane which is basically natural gas but the all-in cost of that is
ten dollars a gallon oil equivalent which would be we could have a viable society around that
but not this society not not this amount of goods and services and complexity
and we can talk about that at our next conversation the plan is to continue to grow
to reach some sustainable technology level there is no plan to have a smaller society because
our system won't select for that plan and that's part of the the impossible to hard
distinction that we made is I think we have a 19 terawatt society right now which is 190 billion
light bulbs turned on 24 seven that is the metabolism of the human enterprise
what is more sustainable what is using our remaining uh lower quality higher cost hydrocarbons
hopefully not any coal at all and in combination with our best renewable tech
NAI or whatever our work suggests it's closer to 10 terawatts maybe it's five maybe it's 12 I don't
think anyone really knows but it's not 30 and I don't think it's 25 either and it's not 19
because these fossil armies that we've woken in the last two centuries we can't continue to add
their labor to our workforce they're going to be retiring and waking more also they poop and
they breathe and the externalities from that are mucking up future generations of ours and other
species house a home where we live anyways I'm digressing just to say that we have the technology
to create energy it's just the quality of it and the scalability of it is not what we have today
thank you Daniel seriously doing these in real time with you helps me understand my own story
better and I think we're working towards something important so thank you to be continued my friend
