matriarchy to the formalization of economic to class systems all as possible second third order
outputs not in the physical world but in the cultural world of a piece of tech
now we can go through similarly the way the printing press ended up giving rise to the
Protestant revolution and democracy and because without the printing press you can't have everybody
have a newspaper and have books so only a nobility has access and we can go on and on look at how
each piece of tech if you use it in codes game theoretic power where those who use it will get
ahead and those who don't will end up not making it through history so it's obligate it codes behavior
as a result it codes values in minds as a result of doing that in scale it codes cultures so it's
not just that we have to have values from something like religion or whatever to make us use tech well
it's the tech is directly creating our values also so we have to design tech that in mind not
just how does this tech externalize costs in the physical world meaning you know the mining
byproduct and toxic tailings that come out of this mining technology and whatever but how it
externalizes things into the human psychological cultural world we're calling this kind of
axiological design how do you embed the axiology the ethics into the tech design now we'll get into
that's an example of how infrastructure drives superstructure and also social structure and
Nate talks a lot about how the social structure the economic growth the embedded economic growth
obligation forces us to keep using more tech and energy and keeps forcing more and more
fucked up social superstructures that justify doing that that are increasingly kind of nihilistic
and etc so getting into how these interrelate is fascinating and it's probably beyond the
scope of this because I want to get back to the nature of the super organism but you do have
to recognize the feedback loops between all these in the super organism so I just when
we were mentioning people not caring about the complex life enough I'm actually wanting to
give that example of ways that that actually resulted from the inexorabilities of the tech stack
itself first of all that was beautiful and the first part of that where you were talking about
the ox I actually got emotional I'd never heard that before and embedded in what you were just
describing is the core innards of the super organism and I asked you the wrong question
before I asked you if energy is values agnostic and what I should have asked you is surplus
values agnostic because when we started that transition in agriculture it was to maximize
surplus of energy right it was calories largely stored calories it was energy I see agriculture
as being the first not the first I see agriculture as being the second major spike in our ability
to extract energy from the environment I see fire being the first major spike then agriculture then
oil and then digital technologies that increase our ability to do all of that faster and of course
there's a million sub refinement so it is surplus and it's energy like they're both fair and just to
look ahead and I don't know that I've said this on a podcast or in my life before but fire
agriculture oil and fossil hydrocarbons and info and tech those were the cans that we
kept kicking to expand our our reach I don't think physically we have any more cans to kick
and the next can is in our minds it's in how we get our evolutionary neurotransmitter cocktails
of meaning and love and excitement and motivation and peace by using less resources
that's the only can left to kick I think look at the Jevons paradox way back to agriculture then
we're going to move it forward to the Jevons paradox on oil and kind of fossil energy makes
perfect sense which is when you get a increase in efficiency in the ability to make more oil or
energy generation you're going to use more energy because it opened up new market sectors
but you can see that that was also true for agriculture right and basically the generation
of human calories as you grow the population if you get an increase in efficiency where you can
get a lot more calories per acre or you can convert more acres to cropland that increase
in efficiency means you get more surplus which means you grow your population faster and that
thing keeps happening so there was a Jevons paradox way back then right and and a super
organism dynamic way back then too because if you didn't do that if you didn't clear the land
uh someone else would have an out competed you so all of a sudden there was this imperative that
hadn't existed before so now do you want to go ahead and define the maximum power principle
and then we can tie those three concepts together the maximum power principle is sometimes referred
to as the fourth law of thermodynamics and it is defined as organisms and ecosystems self-organized
so as to access an energy gradient so um there's something also related called Kleber's law which
shows that the metabolism or the energy burning of an animal or an insect or a whale or anything in
nature is related to their size their body size to the two-thirds power so the maximum power
principle shows that organisms in nature self-organized to get more access to energy
but it's power right it's not just access to this pool of energy it's energy per unit time
which is defined as power now in nature other species only access energy that they use endosomatically
in their body humans use two thousand calories a day in our body but in america we use two hundred
thousand calories a day exosomatically outside of our body so we have a hundred to one exosomatic
magic wand that we're waving around on average um so maximum power principle just means there's a
tether between uh animal behavior and access to energy yeah let me um say it a different way that
is a corollary of that which gets to the obligate nature which we were just starting to speak to
when i was saying before if you don't use the plow then your civilization is not going to
make it through and define the world system relative to anybody else using it um if you don't
exploit the energy source that doesn't mean nobody's going to exploit the energy source somebody's
going to exploit the energy source whoever exploits the energy source which includes the way that
changes their culture and their means uh to be able to justify doing the thing that's the culture
that's going to end up using that energy game theoretically and getting ahead which also means
the means that correspond with that are the ones that get selected for right so we we did briefly
mention in the first conversation um alfred latke wrote a paper a hundred years ago that um
um access to energy was a core driver of evolutionary success and that those animals
that had access to energy had options that those that who did not didn't have access to so access
to energy was a core driver in our evolutionary past and you're right an energy resource would
not long remain untapped in the wild right it maps an evolutionary theory to um niche filling
the concept of niche filling if there is any evolutionary niche that has some energy in it
some critters going to evolve to be able to access that energy um now the thing with humans and as
you point out the exosomatic capacity of humans is there's a lot there's a lot of environments
that with our tech we can identify have energy in them that animals could not get the energy out of
and um they couldn't do a lot to turn uranium or into energy and we can right um they couldn't get a
whole lot of the energy out of fossil fuels and we can they couldn't uh deplete all of the top
soil to turn it into grains you know back to the earlier one they also couldn't control fire to be
able to burn shit and cook things that were unedible into you know edible things and or drive steam or
whatever it was so in evolution there is this kind of niche filling but with our tool making we're
able to do that on crack like on the totally different version of that and but the maximum
power principle okay there's a chunk I want to do can you give me like it's a the minimum
chunk size will take a bit to construct these things you you have as large a chunk as unity my
friend so the jevons paradox says uh you get more efficiency and rather than just use less stuff
you use that increased efficiency to do more stuff that is now gives there's more things that
ever return possibilities than you had before if you don't because you're like oh we can just
live sufficiently now somebody else will and in general that's the concept of a multipolar trap or
a kind of can you give an example of the efficiency that you just said just something in our regular
lives yeah I mean I'll the example we gave of the plow is a perfect example a plow will allow one
man using a plow to produce I don't know if it's 10 or 100 times more calories than a guy who's
just hunting right because his ability over the course of a year to plant crops you know grain
crops that have and increasingly hybridize them the grain calorie per acre per year relative to
hunting or horticulture is just fucking incomparable so that is an increase in efficiency so we could
just say oh great now we just don't need to work as many hours and use less land and be able to
feed ourselves and do more art and spirituality except we don't we're like great let's work all of
the hours and grow our population or you know build bigger surpluses to be able to create
systems of trade and exchange to be able to do increased division of labor and more total
specialization and complexity of our society so that it can be another one of work because we have
better weapons so there's two things that are happening there one is all the 10 to 100 times
extra surplus then has ripple effects in the economy that then there's more surplus to do
more things and the other thing is the the other guy who's still the hunter has a choice to make
am i still gonna hunt and get this low caloric output or am i too gonna switch to this new
technology the plow so our people he might think only took uh what we absolutely needed to live
in harmony and so we wouldn't kill the pregnant buffalo and we wouldn't kill the babies and we
wouldn't kill when the buffalo were too um low and they had had a hard season we actually decided
to leave buffalo alone even though they were great and only hunt deer and because of this
long-term understanding of how to be part of the cycle of life but uh and when we took buffalo we
took just kind of what we needed now if i don't kill the buffalo and these other guys have moved
in who are just gonna kill all the fucking buffalo they can right and they don't fact practice that
thing if i don't kill it it doesn't mean that it stays alive anymore if i don't kill it it just
means that they do and that they will grow their population and not only will they grow their
population they'll now do division of labor make better weapons and then they'll come kill all of
our people so me not killing it doesn't protect it anymore i have the ability to kill it but not
the ability to protect it therefore i actually should race i know you're talking about buffalo
and plows everything but you're talking about our modern fucked up culture as well
and how we are living in the superorganism and we can't help but be part of the superorganism
even though we understand and don't like it uh it's a compulsion so this is you know
you know i've talked about this i'll go ahead and um formalize the concept because i want to bring
the maximum power principle jevons paradox the superorganism the inexorability
all together to understand what this forcing function has been to understand how we make it
not inexorable how do we get out of it because the guy who doesn't want to kill the buffalo
recognize if i just kind of finish that sentence so it's probably obvious to everybody if i don't
kill the buffalo the buffalo doesn't still live the buffalo is going to get killed and fucked anyways
these other guys that are going to kill our people with their increased capacity so not only
am i going to leave the buffalo i have to hunt to kill it faster than the other guy to be able to
grow our population in defense and whatever because now in the face of um you know in group
outward warfare of whatever kind i kind of have to do that so now there's a race to the bottom
because if anybody does the fucked up thing for the whole but that provides a lot of game
theoretic advantage for them in the near term and they're going to use that game theoretic
advantage in game theoretic ways then everybody has to race to do that thing faster or they lose
in the midterm they don't get to the long term sustainable thing that they're trying to do we
call this a multipolar trap as the generalized case of it of which there are a few examples and
they're the most intractable issues for society and i would argue this is one of the deeper frames
to understand what humanity has to solve the multipolar trap one example is a tragedy of the
commons and we were just giving an example of a tragedy of the commons it's also if i don't
cut the tree down the tree doesn't say somebody else cuts the tree down the force is all going to
get destroyed anyways but they're going to use that timber and the increased economic capacity to
then also advance in a way that will fuck our people whether it's direct warfare or economic
warfare or whatever so now we're in a race to cut the trees down the fastest or their externalizing
costs to the environment in the form of pollution or dumping or mining tailings or whatever it is
if i don't do it it doesn't not happen they're going to do it anyways and then they're going to use
that adaptive advantage too so this is a thing where the inexorability of it happening anyways
means that we have to race to not be to have anything we care about be fucked by other people
doing it and of course everybody thinks that if i don't they will and so if you don't have the
ability to make a system wide agreement and enforce it then you get those kinds of race to
the bottom so a tragedy of the commons is one example we can bind these on small scales where
you can create some agreement process and some enforcement process but we need to have transparency
of who violated the thing and then enforcement we can actually enact and everybody agree on very
large scales it's really hard which is why climate change is still a thing and which is why we have
not got conservation of the oceans the atmosphere or any kind of thing well is because if we tax
carbon and china doesn't and that messes up our GDP growth relative to theirs and there's a great
power competition for who controls the 21st century then by us taxing carbon we're still
not preventing climate change we're just agreeing to seed power of the world to a different power
system that may be for a lot of reasons we might not think it's a good idea so unless everybody
can nobody can that kind of thing so a tragedy of the commons is one example a arms race is another
if they build nukes we have to build nukes because otherwise whoever doesn't have the nukes loses
and nobody wants to give up the nukes because whoever gives up their last nuke first just is
going to get fucked everybody's kind of clear on that and i'm not going to give up my last nuke
because i'm pretty sure that if they say they're giving up their last nuke they're lying how do
i know that in some deep secret underground military bunker they don't have a nuke and so
we're just not going to be proliferating now it gets worse when you start to get
very fast areas of new tech i don't want i don't really want to live in a world of AI weapons but
i have to build AI weapons and i'm basically representing any advanced nation states thinking
right now right we have to build the AI weapons because they are so if china is going to build
AI weapons and the weapons are just obviously going to have supremacy then the u.s and russia
and india and everybody has to race to do them well why don't we just make an agreement that
nobody does because we can't ensure that people are keeping the agreements because what are they
doing in some deep underground military base as a result we need to not neither make the agreement
and we defect on it knowing they're defecting while pretending that we aren't defecting spying on
them and trying to lie to their spies and that's kind of the thing happens or we just don't even
bother making the fucking agreement and then we're in a all out race to build the most fucked up
stuff that increases everybody's likelihood of dying from AI weapons now add this to buy our weapons
and on and on and on so the arms race and the tragedy of the commons are two there's a third
one which is in the market the kind of first mover advantage race to first mover on a market or
race to scale on a market that then externalizes everything other than the possible wind potential
so there is a perverse game theory on paying attention to opportunity versus paying attention
to risk uh if i am going to develop some new technology like let's say some advanced genetic
engineering technology like crisper of course there are some positive applications like maybe
i can try to do immuno oncology and crisper gene oncogenes out and whatever but of course as i'm
developing the capacity to do that cheaply anybody can use it for any purpose like
bio weapons or make more cancer right and so one of the tricky things that happens in the world
today is somebody develops a technology in major corporation or say in academia right they have
an ethical review board if it's an academia to ensure they're doing some ethical purpose and
there's oversight and there's all like that but then they're developing the techniques and then
they publish it and they're publishing something that unlike nukes is not hard to build physically
right i don't have to have cyclotrons and uranium enrichment it's just now like pretty simple
technologically to make the ai thing or the or the synth bio thing or whatever so i have an ethical
purpose to develop the thing but the knowledge by which i just developed and that i published and
that i used the huge mit funds or those standard funds or the whatever it is now anybody without
those funds and ethical review boards has access to build that same thing for other purposes and
even if i'm going to go to market applications i say no no my market application is good i'm using
it to do this thing well there's externalities that it might cause directly plus other people
using that tech for fucked up purposes but if i think about that if i think about the rest and
say oh you know what before we move forward on this i'm really going to do a complex risk
assessment of all the second and third order effects of what this might do directly plus
what putting the information out might enable others to do and then we're not if it's bad we're
