as deeply as he could was that game theoretically not just money but agency game theoretically
motivated it all pretty much seems like a genuine curiosity sacred even kind of impulse now did
his scientific insights give the basis for how to make the nuclear bomb totally it was at his
intention though was the development of the bomb motivated by game theory totally and it couldn't
have done that without him doing that thing so then the game theory ends up exploiting the
non-game theory things one could argue that Jesus didn't make a lot of Christians Constantine made
a lot of Christians and I take this argument for the spirit of it rather than the literality because
I don't know the historicity of it I don't know if anybody knows the historicity of any of this
well enough but kind of standard narrative between Jesus and the third century there were just not
that many Christians and small amount of Christians you know getting thrown to lions and Roman
Empire and like that then we get a huge number of Christians when the Roman Empire goes from
throwing Christians to lions being the Holy Roman Empire and the Crusades and spreading
Christianity and so the Council of Nicaea the creation of the Bible the idea of spreading
it by force or crusades that wasn't Jesus right and so it's not who made the concept it's who
identified a utility of it and motive it was motivated to make it spread that was a hyper agent
and so so I would say Jesus and Einstein were both motivated by non-hyper hyper agency oriented
things and then Constantine and Eisenhower or Eisenhower and in that case you know
Hitler whatever we're motivated to see how do we extract that and convert it to game theory
so we need wider boundary hyper agents but the system doesn't reward that and most wider
boundary hyper agents have very little power and optionality hyper agent is
um is getting returns on agency right they're they're I want to be there people
that care about a lot of things but yeah I see when I was a kid and my mom was taking me to do
activists stuff we were going to Greenpeace protests and PETA and Cal Perg and all these
kinds of things and I really cared and but I saw that everybody there really really cared they were
willing to self-sacrifice for other sentient beings they had never met whether it was an animal
in a factory farm or a whale that would get hurt or uh whatever and I remember seeing that and
then thinking about the industries they were up against and the tools of capital advantage
and political advantage and technological and intellectual advantage that those industries
had relative to the tools of effectiveness these people were using was handcuffing themselves to
things and you know picket signs and like that it was just so clear they were going to keep losing
and um the way I saw it at first was that that represented the kind of head to heart divide at
the level of humanity and that those things can't actually be divided and then I realized one more
step I started thinking of it as like um head to heart will you know um something like that that
those three one there's of course lots of types of intelligence lots of types of
capacity we need to think about them all together um but if you just take those three as a beginning
kind of model um and you kind of say okay solar plexus will agency heart kind of values uh and mine
kind of strategic technological insight and I started to see that any two out of the three
together and the world dies because if you it's not just single ones die if you end up having
a lot of agency and a lot of heart a wide kind of heart right which is or a oriented to care about
a lot of things inclusively well the activists had that right the activists had high agency they
were willing to work their asses off wrist themselves get on zambonis handcuff themselves
things so a lot of agency a lot of heart very poor strategic thinking about how to actually
so they had agency but they didn't have the strategy to do hyperagency and so they would
continue to lose if you had kind of wide inclusive values and you were smart but you didn't have a
huge amount of agency I saw so many like caring liberal intellectuals who had some thought about
the problems in the world they really cared and they felt crushed and like they couldn't do anything
if you didn't have wide values you had narrow values but you had very high agency and you had
high strategic thinking and your strategic thinking was in service of your agency and your values were
only optimizing for yourself or your corporation or your nation state and you were willing to
externalize harm elsewhere you became a awesome hyperagent that ruled the world while externalizing
lots of harm and creating multipolar traps with other hyperagents to do so so how to get all three
of those together right which would be the the will and strategic capacity but with the wide
inclusive values I'm not trained to optimize for a narrow set of metrics but very wide inclusive
everything I would say that is a minimum necessary requirement for people that can help turn the
ship around now that doesn't end the multipolar trap that whatever values I care about that don't
optimize my agency still seem like they gain theoretically lose if I care about them to
the people that only do the agency returns and so one of the things that we have to get into
is how to make that not lose and that's one of the criteria of turning the super organism thing
around I think there are answers to that and it's probably in our next podcast well I was going to
say I mean you and I know some of these hyperagents and is one of the possibilities to change the
values in this group to be wider or wider values as you were saying is that possible I mean the
question of do you try to increase the understanding of interconnectedness and the embodied values
and commitments of the hyperagents do you try to increase the agency of the people who already have
wider and deeper values you know any of those are possible paths they're all hard human development
is a is not a quick thing and more fundamentally we want to ask the question like when we're
mentioning the way plows affected values at scale is not just what do we try to do with
individual people but how would we make changes to society that would be developing people
differently at scale now of course you have this bootload question of like well who's going to do
that who is going to do that there was in this current system that isn't doing that to try to make
systems that you know incentivize different things long term I think we're approaching a bend versus
break moment and we discussed that in the first conversation where our financial claims on our
physical reality are diverging and that gap is getting wider and it's unsustainable so when
we have our third conversation I would like to horizontally look at triage
transition and long-term solutions for the human enterprise and then vertically globally
nationally in communities and as individuals you have off the record and tangential to this
conversation given me some excellent personal advice on how to cope and thrive during this time
I don't know if we want to fit that in the next macro podcast but you're you're very good at that
stuff so that's where I want to head to on the what to do because learning about the spur
organism actually does something paradoxical when you understand it it actually makes you
at least feel like you have less agency people that understand the the momentum of all this
it's kind of a shitty thing to discover because it feels like oh we can't just pass a climate
law and everything is fixed or oh we just can't have you know a law that is more equality and
that doesn't fix things that the problem is much more systemic and deeper than that it is certainly
often the case that as people understand that the individual problems are not so easily solvable
on their own they're part of a deeper set of interconnected things and there's this kind of
really tricky gang theory of multiple or traps and incentives on opportunity and not risk and
that even if you try to regulate a thing that the regulatory apparatus moves slower than the thing
trying to regulate and so it continues to wiggle out of the regulations and as people start to
understand all that it can make them feel less agency and a little bit overwhelmed and shitty and
so as you mentioned talking about how to emotionally psychologically hold that's valuable but it
doesn't have to make them feel less agency it can make them feel more agency and that's actually
what I hope happens so that's the effect it has for me and I'll explain why inside of me because
I think it can for a lot of people if they hold it this way I think there's a lot of people who
care but the problems seem intractable there's a certain kind of nihilism they have because
climate change seems like such a huge deal and and almost impossible to solve and then
so does species extinction and so does nuclear risk and so does and it seems like there's a
million problems and then they learn about a new one and a new one and even if they started to feel
like they got hope around some chunk of them there's more and and there's a certain sense of like
impossibility in trying to deal with it all at that level that when you start to get oh there
are underlying system dynamics that all these are expressions of it can start to feel more
tractable those problems are hard but now that we're able to actually articulate that all the
other problems are expressions of a set of system dynamics now we at least know where to focus now
possibly we've defined the problem well enough to be able to solve it and in understanding a problem
better more solutions start to emerge if I don't understand the problem well enough I probably
can't solve it at all as I'm understanding it better I might say wow that's a hard problem
but at least possible so I think we move from impossible to hard when we start to understand
it better and hard is better than impossible and what I want is that it actually kind of cures
denialism people have running of maybe this is fucking impossible and creates a inspiration
and upregulation with regard to the heart of like hard but possibly fucking tractable this should
get all my life energy the fact that I don't know the answer instantly nobody fucking knows
Einstein didn't know the answer to the questions he was asking and no inventor knew the answer of
how to make the invention they were thinking of there is some faith that the thing that you
don't know exists that makes you do hard discovery work and stay with it one of the other problems
you talk about kind of the dopaminergic nature of the superorganism is it the delayed gratification
to work on a problem for a long time that you don't know how to solve instantly is fucking critical
and so one of the attributes of the people in addition to these three things you know together
the kind of agency heart mind is part of the agency is the capacity to say I don't know the answer
but that doesn't mean I'm demotivated the fact that I can even start throughout my head around the
problem more means that there is a possible path to answer and I'm motivated to continue to explore
that space until I have it and then implement the best answers I have and then when they fail
find out why they failed and not feel it take it as a failure but learning so that psychology I would
say is critical to being part of solution thank you that is helpful and it makes sense to me
one of my biggest challenges is all along I'm an expert on describing the constraints
of our situation less so than expert on the solutions because they're not impossible
but they're hard as you said but I spend most of my time debunking people that say no we can
decouple energy from a GDP and no renewables will be able to power a 19 terawatt society we just need
to have the political will or whatever I spend most of my time on that instead of in the solution
space because as you say we have to understand the systemic nature of the problem in order to work on
the real solutions one of the reasons you have the podcast is to help more people understand
the design criteria and the reason you're motivated to do that is not because you just like attention
being on a podcast but because more people understanding the criteria leads to more
people's creativity working on solutions and so there is an implicit faith in your strategy
we need a lot more people collective intelligence if it has the right input can do something right
obviously that's why I'm talking with you here is the same kind of faith the we're actually
working on a project right now on what are the kind of very hard questions that are underneath
most of the problems that we think are a better orienting framework than things like sustainable
development goals and the multi how do you solve multipolar traps is an example of one of those
questions and being able to make that very widely understood not to bum everyone out but to say let's
get the decentralized collective intelligence of the world having the best frameworks for understanding
the most fundamental problems as the center of the innovative focus of the creativity of the world
right if we have people understand those constraints widely of course some people say I don't know the
fuck to do with that but a lot of people will be like oh this is an engineering problem let's start
to work on it and some of the problems like how do you solve multipolar traps don't have a single
solution they'll have lots of partial solutions well in order to get enforcement you have to be
able to see so there's going to be transparency tax so how do we create force transparency in
some places and how do we create incentives on transparency and how do we and other things will
have to do with enforcement others will have to do with incentive others will have to do a better
regulatory process and then of course whenever you figure out a thing it'll be gamed because
there will be still be an incentive to game it so it's and that's why it's not here is the answer
forever it's why it's an orienting question how do we continue to pay attention to things like
perverse incentives and externalities and multipolar traps and do a better job ongoingly and procedurally
up regulating our responses to these things that are fundamental to all the other problems
um and if and if people like you are not articulating the design criteria well then
other people be coming up with solutions really well intendedly that we're just missing some
of the design criteria and this is one of the problems is as we were mentioning we define
the problems with narrow definitions of what success means that still externalize lots of
harm or miss some of the constraints getting the constraint set better might make it harder
but actually it makes it possible whereas before it was impossible because all the things were
bound to fail because they didn't understand what the success required so rather than go from easy
to hard the easy was for sure going to fail so it wasn't easy it was impossible we're actually
going from impossible to hard which is a movement in the right direction
okay so you wanted to unpack a little bit more about Adams bits jewels and and maybe dollars
and and human behavior so yeah just to kind of underscore the energy blindness that you talk about
I think the first time I heard the term Adams and bits together in terms of describing the economy
was from Peter Thiel and of course makes sense that from someone who made money in Silicon Valley
in the domain of bits recognizing that there is still stuff to do in the domain of Adams which is
what Peter's very favorable of which is why he likes Elon and you know people who build
physical technologies for the people coming out of Silicon Valley where everything was about digital
tech and obviously digital tech kind of subsumed so much of the world in particular the financial
world's attention because of the capacity for the scaling dynamics right the the network dynamics
that met CAF law that gives you kind of natural monopolies and the speed at which you can get
three billion users into a platform which is so unheard of for anything else like that and the
speed at which you can get to a billion dollar valuation or anything else because of the bits
give you exponential returns right the I can make a piece of software once and then sell an
indefinite number period a number of times and that obviously started with computation software
then when I get a beyond just software and that would be like the Microsoft story into something
that is a network so it's software but then it's applied to mediating human interaction where the
value occurs across the interaction so the number of people that goes up the value squares
is something like a second power to that which would be true for digital currencies amazon
facebook all those types of things now you're dealing with something like you know an exponential
curve with another exponential or at least polynomial curve on top of it and so the of
course from a financial point of view money into software equals more money out relative to most
other things and so you know that sucked up a lot of world's attention but then you know people
recognize there's still stuff to do in the domain of atoms that matters but even calling it atoms and
bits of course these guys are very sophisticated I've heard Peter teal refer to it that way or
biology of course they know that the energy sector is one of the biggest sectors they get
pitched at species all the time on new energy tech they know Saudi Aramco as you know maybe the
biggest or one of the biggest valuation companies in the world and yet just even in the framing it's
not explicit in the framing and the first time I heard the three together atoms energy and bits
as the key parts of materials economy is from forest landry and that obviously doesn't still
include all the human aspects but from a materials economy point of view kind of reducing it to the
things that have fundamentally different physics it's a good structure the atoms we don't really
get more of right the amount of copper we have on the planet is what it is outside of mining
asteroids are not going to get more and even then it's still within a larger space of earth
plus the asteroid belt or whatever that we're looking at and we also don't get rid of them
so we have a finite amount and then we turn them into pollution if we don't go close loop on them
and so we have we have to go close loop on the atomic accounting of things right energy we're
getting more of all the time but we have a kind of fixed bandwidth of how much comes in and we
have to work within that bandwidth how many joules are coming into the planet from the sun
per day and like that bits there is not the same fundamental limit of either a fixed amount that
