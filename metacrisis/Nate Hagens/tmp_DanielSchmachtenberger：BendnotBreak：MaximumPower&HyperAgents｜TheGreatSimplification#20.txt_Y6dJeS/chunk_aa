This week's podcast is a second installment of a conversation with my friend Daniel Schmockdenberger.
We intended this series to be a three-part series on bend versus break, but we got a
little sidetracked with both interesting and I hope relevant and helpful tangents on
energy, maximum power, animist religion and the importance and relevance of hyperagents
or those human individuals who have outsized influence on our cultural direction.
Daniel and I come to this with wildly different backgrounds and we've kind of found each other
on the internet and are learning from each other and exploring and trying to figure out the path
ahead and basically share our revelations and our thought process publicly because I think we need
a lot more people engaged in these questions in this space at this time. I hope you enjoy
this conversation. I certainly did. Here is part two with Daniel Schmockdenberger.
Okay, this is podcast number two with you of a three-part series at least and what I'd like to
do today is kind of merge our meta worldviews on how energy, materials, technology, money, human
behavior all aggregate into an explanatory systemic overview of the human condition,
the human predicament as it pertains to all the risks that we're facing. You and I have been kind
of playing verbal mental ping pong on this stuff for a couple years and we have a huge overlap in
how we see this stuff and I'd like to kind of hone that overlap to converge on maybe a unified thing
that we both agree on today. I will go back to the podcast missionary position of me interviewing
you this time as opposed to last time you interviewed me but maybe if it makes sense to
you I'll just give like a one-minute overview of what we covered on the first podcast on Ben versus
Break which was called Energy Blind and the reason we did that as opposed to starting here
is a lot of people are still naive about the relationship between the energy and the human
experience. We talked about how important energy is in nature, how energy in biological systems is
the currency of life the same as human systems. We are massively supported by a hundred billion
barrel of oil equivalents of fossil sunlight added to our systems every year. There's a big
energy quality difference between so-called renewable energy which is robust and viable but
can it empower a 19 terawatt system in our current way is a big question. We talked about
Jeven's paradox which is the rebound effect that new efficiency and technology help you
save energy on a micro scale but on a macro scale it ends up buying more stuff and having more
surplus and we end up using more energy in aggregate and we talked a little bit about
the tenuousness of oil supplies and depletion and things like that.
So I hope everyone can go back and listen to that as a precursor to this. So good afternoon to you
where would you like to start this conversation my friend? Just that it's been a few months
since we did that last one and I'm really excited that we are finally getting to this. You and I
had had a conversation offline where we explored some of the topics in more depth and I think
they're really interesting and useful frames so I'm excited for us to kind of get to dialogue
through some of those things that we had discussed and then get to expand the topics.
When you and I spoke last time I had got the good fortune of having you explain
your models to me. I read the super organism paper and watched some talks but I never actually
read your book and for this time not because I didn't think it'd be great just because of
scheduling. I did get to read the book and I just want to make sure that all of your readers that
have not should go read his book because it's excellent. It's so well structured. It you know
Nate has spent his career studying what is the world predicament and basically took the
most important frames from the nature of how humans understand stuff and how we kind of get
understanding wrong to human motivation to evolutionary perspective to energy and infrastructure
and like that and just kind of put it in these chunks very well chunked but like summaries of
stuff that each would be a book and so it's like whatever 100 books summarized in a nice sequence
so I just wanted to acknowledge like fucking brilliant book those so well done I was so happy
reading it last night and you know what I think you and I both kind of came to independently
was the awareness that there are many different potential catastrophic risks meaning different
escalation pathways to the end of this world systems viability that even though they look
really different whether we're talking about resource shortages that lead to war that lead
to kind of large-scale war or breakdowns of supply chains or planetary boundaries directly
in ecological tipping points that there are some things that all of those have in common and if
you try to treat the Amazon hydrological pump here and the dead zone here and the soil depletion
here and the species extinction here and the nuclear escalation here and the ai risk here and
the bio risk arms race here as separate issues you're going to fail because they're actually
all unsolvable without solving the underlying kind of generative dynamics that give rise to them
and each year we keep getting more of them as there's more new tacky and the new tacky increases
the kind of destructive capacity both unintentionally through externalities and intentionally through
conflict theory war and so we keep getting more total catastrophic risks higher probabilities on
them more interconnections and cascades between them so it's impossible to keep managing the
front of that so it's like fuck what what is underlying those which ends up looking like
diagnosing what about civilization is kind of self-terminating it's a little bit like the
difference between the kind of traditional alpathic medical approach and the anti-aging work
right the traditional medical work is like okay well maybe we can keep you from dying from heart
disease but we have most by a year because your cancer and your Alzheimer's and your diabetes are
immediately following because you're aging and you're aging poorly for a bunch of underlying
systemic reasons that the homeodynamics of your body aren't working that well so whichever system
gives out first doesn't make that much difference so if you want to do more than by a year you have
to look at can we aid you better comprehensively which will affect all the systems so what are
the underlying dynamics so the kind of anti-aging work is thinking at a much more fundamental way
about pathology in general and pathogenesis in general rather than specific applications
and it's very much like we're doing that for this world system and I just to close that you
you did it in a particular way that I really appreciated that was very overlapping but a
little different than the metaphors I used and I think this way we got along and I think
getting to show the mappings between those is insightful so that's what I'm hoping we do today
yeah excellent thank you for your kind words on the book as far as aging you know we're part of a
system and that's what I've tried to do that's what you're trying to do is explain how the system
functions together as far as anti-aging if everyone lived to be 150 a wider boundary perspective on
that as we would have some more massive ecological problems as well so it depends where you draw the
boundaries on this stuff okay so yes I have described the system as we self-organize as
families small businesses corporations nation states to optimize surplus but it's not really
surplus it's financial representations of surplus and that's tether to energy tether to carbon
and that this system is out of control as a super organism a super organism it's not really a physical
entity it's just the behavioral dynamic of eight billion of us roughly just pursuing these cultural
objectives and it's no longer in anyone's control there's no politician or billionaire that is
actually steering it so that that's kind of the dynamic that I've come up with is that
we have outsourced the planning of our system to the financial market and that momentum
worldwide of making decisions to keep that optimized suppresses any other paths of wisdom
or constraint that might be totally viable and make sense there's just no fertile soil for those
to to germinate and so I would like to get your unpacking using your language and your work on
that dynamic and how you see that I mean you already summarized so much stuff in your book and
if I was to summarize that and like the few concepts that give if someone had to hold a very
minimum set that I would that I might offer would be that the financial system has an embedded
growth obligation it has to keep growing or this particular system breaks and it has to keep growing
at a percentage of the previous year so you have a compounding interesting which means you have an
exponential curve so there is an exponential embedded growth obligation on finance but finance
is bound to the real world and you can't exponentially grow the extraction in the real
world specifically you can't keep mining stuff unrenewably and turning it into pollution and
trash and you can't keep having the energy that it takes to move all those atoms or the bits around
indefinitely so and that specifically this the combination of the jevons paradox
and the coupling of money and energy is of which you know as of I'll say the garret relation but
Nate will say what's wrong with the garret relation I'm only saying it vaguely is the idea that
there's a coupling between global GDP and energy that is an important coupling to understand
and roughly that coupling is anything that makes money is probably moving atoms around in physical
space or moving bits around but that requires energy to do so kind of across all industries
some will boom some will bust but they're all going to take energy so there's some rough correlation
between total money and total energy use it's pretty clear what you mean when you say moving
atoms around that would be materials but what do you mean when you're moving bits around just to
be clear computation still takes energy and so even when we're talking about
capital associated with digital goods and services it's still energy dependent it obviously
takes energy moving atoms around to make the computational substrate you got to do a lot
of mining and you got to do a lot of fabrication to make the computer chips and the servers and
the satellites and whatever and then the computational systems require energy so
the movement to digital doesn't get us off the need for energy right well so what you're saying
is the cloud is not virtual and approximately 18 percent of our electricity today goes towards the
servers and the gadgets and the wiring and and everything like the cloud is definitely not
virtual cloud has a physical substrate layer that it depends upon that has real physics and
energy dynamics associated so we can of course get into the way that maybe digital goods have a
slightly better efficiency in terms of how much energy they take per dollar than the physical
goods but then this is why the jevons paradox is so fundamental is ultimately the dollars are
seeking returns anywhere and they'll seek the highest returns possible but they'll seek any
returns to there'll be a power law distribution on returns so i can get a thousand next return of
course i'll get it but if i can get a three percent return i'll you know of large amounts of capital
we'll do that so when you get increases in efficiency you just get a cheaper industrial
input you know a cheaper market input which means that a lot of things that weren't profitable now
become profitable so the surface area of profitability expands and this jevons paradox just like
everybody who's focused on environmental issues needs to kind of take this very seriously which is
you increase efficiency of say here energy production now you have cheaper energy energy is
one of the key by inputs to every industry cheaper input means a whole bunch of non-profitable areas
become profitable in the market expands and so that efficiency doesn't buy you the thing that you
wanted to have so the embedded growth obligation still holds and so you're like okay so because
of that we still get this coupling between dollars and energy dollars are on an exponential growth
curve up that means energy has to be on an exponential growth curve up you can't do exponential
extraction of energy forever and we're already on a diminishing return on hydrocarbons meaning
hydrocarbons into hydrocarbons out the energy return on energy investments in diminishing return
and yet it has to keep up with a very verticalizing part of the exponential curve on finances
there's a problem there right like and you can only quantitative ease and subsidize that thing
for so long there's like a fundamental problem there and so of course the answer is just renewables
well great we'll meet all of that energy need with renewables except right now the energy return on
energy of investment of the renewables means you got to use way more oil to get the non-oil
producing stuff and the curve still just don't work and the current way we're looking at it so
there's just some very deep reckoning and the relationship between the embedded growth obligation
and finance and the physical limits of the real world atomically and energetically and the relationship
between those is a heap of complexity from there but that simple summary kind of gives you the
exponential growth of the metabolism of the super organism as Nate has argued it which I think is
fucking insightful and then we want to kind of take that as the base input with whatever Nate's
about to say and then play from there I agree with everything you just said one thing I would like
to put up oh well that's why then naturally so one thing that we didn't get to in the first
conversation that you indirectly referenced here and I want to unpack it a little bit
is how money comes into existence and how that relates to GDP growth and future expectations
so money does not come into existence the way that's taught in economic textbooks we do not
make a loan from existing capital 95 percent of our money comes into existence from commercial
banks making a loan and when they make the loan they create the money so if you're a bank and you
have 10 million dollars on your books and assets and liabilities and you Daniel come in and have
this great nootropics business idea and they say you're a great guy we're in good standing with
the Federal Reserve we're going to give you a million dollars for your business at that moment
your account went up by a million dollars the IOU asset on the bank account went up by a million
dollars you can spend that million on anything you want presumably a business
in the bank is equal now they have 11 million in assets and 11 million in liabilities but the same
amount of coal oil copper water amazon forests existed on the planet that did 10 minutes earlier
we created more financial claims just based on the recent productivity of you and our country
and our world as the reference there was no biophysical reference at all the other thing that's
important to know is when that million dollars was created the interest was not so there that's the
underlying embedded growth obligation is we create money with no tether to natural resources
but when you have to pay that million dollars back to the bank over every year you're going to have
to pay five percent interest as well so you need to grow to do that now debt doesn't have to be a
bad thing if you take a loan from a bank if the productivity of your results are higher than
the debt but what ends up happening now as a world not as individuals we're doubling our debt every
eight to nine years as a world and we're only doubling our GDP which is the income stream
required to pay back that debt every 25 years or so and that's before energy declines and you know
peak oil it's like you were saying declining marginal returns to hydrocarbons so this is a
real problem so money isn't created out of thin air that's going too far because there is productive
capacity and and capital and industry and technology and knowledge but there is no
recognition that all the financial claims in the world be they stocks or bonds or pensions or
retirement fund when they are cashed in they have to be cashed in on something that will require
energy and materials to to convert and and that is just a fundamental disconnect in macroeconomics
the bank of england wrote a great little paper modern money creation that debunks how it's written
in the economic textbooks so I just wanted to add that that bit in there the other thing I wanted
to say is all governments and institutions at least ostensibly in the world expect two and a
half to three percent growth into the future that is like the standard expectation out 50 years
so given the tether of energy and GDP which is around 0.99 to 1 globally and given the tether
of materials to GDP which is pretty much one for one you refer to that as atoms so the link between
atoms and GDP growth is pretty much one for one we've we've grown our material footprint 2.8
percent a year since the year 1900 so given that if we grow at three percent a year in order to
maintain and service the financial claims that we're adding all the time we will double the
amount of energy and materials used on the world in the next 25 to 30 years and we'll double it
again after that that is a serious problem that more people need to think about because I don't
think the next doubling is going to happen and so how do we respond as a culture to that so that
was my pin in your in your summer yes you know the the thing that we're saying right now is hopefully
adding a little bit of clarity to a really basic intuitions like the most basic hippie
shit that gets said in the kind of renewable degrowth world if you can't run a exponential
economy on a finite planet forever it's like everybody's kind of heard that it if you paid
any attention environmentalism because a financial economy and a materials economy can't be totally
decoupled right like and of course people get excited about no no you can decouple them because the
digital universe doesn't have to require the materials economy or services don't have to
require the materials economy and we can do more thinking stuff well kind of but as we were already
mentioning you know about the cloud and it's like that the digital economy the services economy
still require materials economy and the growth of them still requires growth there and even if you
get some increases in efficiencies which is awesome you get those increases in efficiencies those
