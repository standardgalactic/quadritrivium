This week's podcast is a second installment of a conversation with my friend Daniel Schmockdenberger.
We intended this series to be a three-part series on bend versus break, but we got a
little sidetracked with both interesting and I hope relevant and helpful tangents on
energy, maximum power, animist religion and the importance and relevance of hyperagents
or those human individuals who have outsized influence on our cultural direction.
Daniel and I come to this with wildly different backgrounds and we've kind of found each other
on the internet and are learning from each other and exploring and trying to figure out the path
ahead and basically share our revelations and our thought process publicly because I think we need
a lot more people engaged in these questions in this space at this time. I hope you enjoy
this conversation. I certainly did. Here is part two with Daniel Schmockdenberger.
Okay, this is podcast number two with you of a three-part series at least and what I'd like to
do today is kind of merge our meta worldviews on how energy, materials, technology, money, human
behavior all aggregate into an explanatory systemic overview of the human condition,
the human predicament as it pertains to all the risks that we're facing. You and I have been kind
of playing verbal mental ping pong on this stuff for a couple years and we have a huge overlap in
how we see this stuff and I'd like to kind of hone that overlap to converge on maybe a unified thing
that we both agree on today. I will go back to the podcast missionary position of me interviewing
you this time as opposed to last time you interviewed me but maybe if it makes sense to
you I'll just give like a one-minute overview of what we covered on the first podcast on Ben versus
Break which was called Energy Blind and the reason we did that as opposed to starting here
is a lot of people are still naive about the relationship between the energy and the human
experience. We talked about how important energy is in nature, how energy in biological systems is
the currency of life the same as human systems. We are massively supported by a hundred billion
barrel of oil equivalents of fossil sunlight added to our systems every year. There's a big
energy quality difference between so-called renewable energy which is robust and viable but
can it empower a 19 terawatt system in our current way is a big question. We talked about
Jeven's paradox which is the rebound effect that new efficiency and technology help you
save energy on a micro scale but on a macro scale it ends up buying more stuff and having more
surplus and we end up using more energy in aggregate and we talked a little bit about
the tenuousness of oil supplies and depletion and things like that.
So I hope everyone can go back and listen to that as a precursor to this. So good afternoon to you
where would you like to start this conversation my friend? Just that it's been a few months
since we did that last one and I'm really excited that we are finally getting to this. You and I
had had a conversation offline where we explored some of the topics in more depth and I think
they're really interesting and useful frames so I'm excited for us to kind of get to dialogue
through some of those things that we had discussed and then get to expand the topics.
When you and I spoke last time I had got the good fortune of having you explain
your models to me. I read the super organism paper and watched some talks but I never actually
read your book and for this time not because I didn't think it'd be great just because of
scheduling. I did get to read the book and I just want to make sure that all of your readers that
have not should go read his book because it's excellent. It's so well structured. It you know
Nate has spent his career studying what is the world predicament and basically took the
most important frames from the nature of how humans understand stuff and how we kind of get
understanding wrong to human motivation to evolutionary perspective to energy and infrastructure
and like that and just kind of put it in these chunks very well chunked but like summaries of
stuff that each would be a book and so it's like whatever 100 books summarized in a nice sequence
so I just wanted to acknowledge like fucking brilliant book those so well done I was so happy
reading it last night and you know what I think you and I both kind of came to independently
was the awareness that there are many different potential catastrophic risks meaning different
escalation pathways to the end of this world systems viability that even though they look
really different whether we're talking about resource shortages that lead to war that lead
to kind of large-scale war or breakdowns of supply chains or planetary boundaries directly
in ecological tipping points that there are some things that all of those have in common and if
you try to treat the Amazon hydrological pump here and the dead zone here and the soil depletion
here and the species extinction here and the nuclear escalation here and the ai risk here and
the bio risk arms race here as separate issues you're going to fail because they're actually
all unsolvable without solving the underlying kind of generative dynamics that give rise to them
and each year we keep getting more of them as there's more new tacky and the new tacky increases
the kind of destructive capacity both unintentionally through externalities and intentionally through
conflict theory war and so we keep getting more total catastrophic risks higher probabilities on
them more interconnections and cascades between them so it's impossible to keep managing the
front of that so it's like fuck what what is underlying those which ends up looking like
diagnosing what about civilization is kind of self-terminating it's a little bit like the
difference between the kind of traditional alpathic medical approach and the anti-aging work
right the traditional medical work is like okay well maybe we can keep you from dying from heart
disease but we have most by a year because your cancer and your Alzheimer's and your diabetes are
immediately following because you're aging and you're aging poorly for a bunch of underlying
systemic reasons that the homeodynamics of your body aren't working that well so whichever system
gives out first doesn't make that much difference so if you want to do more than by a year you have
to look at can we aid you better comprehensively which will affect all the systems so what are
the underlying dynamics so the kind of anti-aging work is thinking at a much more fundamental way
about pathology in general and pathogenesis in general rather than specific applications
and it's very much like we're doing that for this world system and I just to close that you
you did it in a particular way that I really appreciated that was very overlapping but a
little different than the metaphors I used and I think this way we got along and I think
getting to show the mappings between those is insightful so that's what I'm hoping we do today
yeah excellent thank you for your kind words on the book as far as aging you know we're part of a
system and that's what I've tried to do that's what you're trying to do is explain how the system
functions together as far as anti-aging if everyone lived to be 150 a wider boundary perspective on
that as we would have some more massive ecological problems as well so it depends where you draw the
boundaries on this stuff okay so yes I have described the system as we self-organize as
families small businesses corporations nation states to optimize surplus but it's not really
surplus it's financial representations of surplus and that's tether to energy tether to carbon
and that this system is out of control as a super organism a super organism it's not really a physical
entity it's just the behavioral dynamic of eight billion of us roughly just pursuing these cultural
objectives and it's no longer in anyone's control there's no politician or billionaire that is
actually steering it so that that's kind of the dynamic that I've come up with is that
we have outsourced the planning of our system to the financial market and that momentum
worldwide of making decisions to keep that optimized suppresses any other paths of wisdom
or constraint that might be totally viable and make sense there's just no fertile soil for those
to to germinate and so I would like to get your unpacking using your language and your work on
that dynamic and how you see that I mean you already summarized so much stuff in your book and
if I was to summarize that and like the few concepts that give if someone had to hold a very
minimum set that I would that I might offer would be that the financial system has an embedded
growth obligation it has to keep growing or this particular system breaks and it has to keep growing
at a percentage of the previous year so you have a compounding interesting which means you have an
exponential curve so there is an exponential embedded growth obligation on finance but finance
is bound to the real world and you can't exponentially grow the extraction in the real
world specifically you can't keep mining stuff unrenewably and turning it into pollution and
trash and you can't keep having the energy that it takes to move all those atoms or the bits around
indefinitely so and that specifically this the combination of the jevons paradox
and the coupling of money and energy is of which you know as of I'll say the garret relation but
Nate will say what's wrong with the garret relation I'm only saying it vaguely is the idea that
there's a coupling between global GDP and energy that is an important coupling to understand
and roughly that coupling is anything that makes money is probably moving atoms around in physical
space or moving bits around but that requires energy to do so kind of across all industries
some will boom some will bust but they're all going to take energy so there's some rough correlation
between total money and total energy use it's pretty clear what you mean when you say moving
atoms around that would be materials but what do you mean when you're moving bits around just to
be clear computation still takes energy and so even when we're talking about
capital associated with digital goods and services it's still energy dependent it obviously
takes energy moving atoms around to make the computational substrate you got to do a lot
of mining and you got to do a lot of fabrication to make the computer chips and the servers and
the satellites and whatever and then the computational systems require energy so
the movement to digital doesn't get us off the need for energy right well so what you're saying
is the cloud is not virtual and approximately 18 percent of our electricity today goes towards the
servers and the gadgets and the wiring and and everything like the cloud is definitely not
virtual cloud has a physical substrate layer that it depends upon that has real physics and
energy dynamics associated so we can of course get into the way that maybe digital goods have a
slightly better efficiency in terms of how much energy they take per dollar than the physical
goods but then this is why the jevons paradox is so fundamental is ultimately the dollars are
seeking returns anywhere and they'll seek the highest returns possible but they'll seek any
returns to there'll be a power law distribution on returns so i can get a thousand next return of
course i'll get it but if i can get a three percent return i'll you know of large amounts of capital
we'll do that so when you get increases in efficiency you just get a cheaper industrial
input you know a cheaper market input which means that a lot of things that weren't profitable now
become profitable so the surface area of profitability expands and this jevons paradox just like
everybody who's focused on environmental issues needs to kind of take this very seriously which is
you increase efficiency of say here energy production now you have cheaper energy energy is
one of the key by inputs to every industry cheaper input means a whole bunch of non-profitable areas
become profitable in the market expands and so that efficiency doesn't buy you the thing that you
wanted to have so the embedded growth obligation still holds and so you're like okay so because
of that we still get this coupling between dollars and energy dollars are on an exponential growth
curve up that means energy has to be on an exponential growth curve up you can't do exponential
extraction of energy forever and we're already on a diminishing return on hydrocarbons meaning
hydrocarbons into hydrocarbons out the energy return on energy investments in diminishing return
and yet it has to keep up with a very verticalizing part of the exponential curve on finances
there's a problem there right like and you can only quantitative ease and subsidize that thing
for so long there's like a fundamental problem there and so of course the answer is just renewables
well great we'll meet all of that energy need with renewables except right now the energy return on
energy of investment of the renewables means you got to use way more oil to get the non-oil
producing stuff and the curve still just don't work and the current way we're looking at it so
there's just some very deep reckoning and the relationship between the embedded growth obligation
and finance and the physical limits of the real world atomically and energetically and the relationship
between those is a heap of complexity from there but that simple summary kind of gives you the
exponential growth of the metabolism of the super organism as Nate has argued it which I think is
fucking insightful and then we want to kind of take that as the base input with whatever Nate's
about to say and then play from there I agree with everything you just said one thing I would like
to put up oh well that's why then naturally so one thing that we didn't get to in the first
conversation that you indirectly referenced here and I want to unpack it a little bit
is how money comes into existence and how that relates to GDP growth and future expectations
so money does not come into existence the way that's taught in economic textbooks we do not
make a loan from existing capital 95 percent of our money comes into existence from commercial
banks making a loan and when they make the loan they create the money so if you're a bank and you
have 10 million dollars on your books and assets and liabilities and you Daniel come in and have
this great nootropics business idea and they say you're a great guy we're in good standing with
the Federal Reserve we're going to give you a million dollars for your business at that moment
your account went up by a million dollars the IOU asset on the bank account went up by a million
dollars you can spend that million on anything you want presumably a business
in the bank is equal now they have 11 million in assets and 11 million in liabilities but the same
amount of coal oil copper water amazon forests existed on the planet that did 10 minutes earlier
we created more financial claims just based on the recent productivity of you and our country
and our world as the reference there was no biophysical reference at all the other thing that's
important to know is when that million dollars was created the interest was not so there that's the
underlying embedded growth obligation is we create money with no tether to natural resources
but when you have to pay that million dollars back to the bank over every year you're going to have
to pay five percent interest as well so you need to grow to do that now debt doesn't have to be a
bad thing if you take a loan from a bank if the productivity of your results are higher than
the debt but what ends up happening now as a world not as individuals we're doubling our debt every
eight to nine years as a world and we're only doubling our GDP which is the income stream
required to pay back that debt every 25 years or so and that's before energy declines and you know
peak oil it's like you were saying declining marginal returns to hydrocarbons so this is a
real problem so money isn't created out of thin air that's going too far because there is productive
capacity and and capital and industry and technology and knowledge but there is no
recognition that all the financial claims in the world be they stocks or bonds or pensions or
retirement fund when they are cashed in they have to be cashed in on something that will require
energy and materials to to convert and and that is just a fundamental disconnect in macroeconomics
the bank of england wrote a great little paper modern money creation that debunks how it's written
in the economic textbooks so I just wanted to add that that bit in there the other thing I wanted
to say is all governments and institutions at least ostensibly in the world expect two and a
half to three percent growth into the future that is like the standard expectation out 50 years
so given the tether of energy and GDP which is around 0.99 to 1 globally and given the tether
of materials to GDP which is pretty much one for one you refer to that as atoms so the link between
atoms and GDP growth is pretty much one for one we've we've grown our material footprint 2.8
percent a year since the year 1900 so given that if we grow at three percent a year in order to
maintain and service the financial claims that we're adding all the time we will double the
amount of energy and materials used on the world in the next 25 to 30 years and we'll double it
again after that that is a serious problem that more people need to think about because I don't
think the next doubling is going to happen and so how do we respond as a culture to that so that
was my pin in your in your summer yes you know the the thing that we're saying right now is hopefully
adding a little bit of clarity to a really basic intuitions like the most basic hippie
shit that gets said in the kind of renewable degrowth world if you can't run a exponential
economy on a finite planet forever it's like everybody's kind of heard that it if you paid
any attention environmentalism because a financial economy and a materials economy can't be totally
decoupled right like and of course people get excited about no no you can decouple them because the
digital universe doesn't have to require the materials economy or services don't have to
require the materials economy and we can do more thinking stuff well kind of but as we were already
mentioning you know about the cloud and it's like that the digital economy the services economy
still require materials economy and the growth of them still requires growth there and even if you
get some increases in efficiencies which is awesome you get those increases in efficiencies those
increases in efficiency also grow the total material economy in a pure market system because
the market system is going to take returns wherever it can get them yes with a caveat globally because
there are countries that are decoupling materially not not absolutely decoupling but they're
relatively coupling like our country we are producing uh less or more GDP while using
not less energy but less than one for one and we've been we've been doing that for a while
but if you but you look at the average american consumes 57 barrel of oil equivalents of coal
oil and natural gas of three main fossil fuels per year but we consume another 17 barrel of oil
equivalents in stuff we buy from china and Bangladesh etc because we've outsourced our
means of production uh overseas so globally what you just said is correct but there are countries
who can material decouple but i do not believe that the whole world can material decouple
just restate what you said in another way individual country metrics on things that
involve global supply chains are just always gibberish um they're basically always some
kind of greenwashing gibberish and i think we got into this uh last time but in case we didn't
i'll recap quickly um it's very easy to export your shitty thing somewhere else um and then you
know import like i i can import stuff from a country that has slave labor i don't have slave labor i
can have a very good genie coefficient in my country but i'm my country depends upon stuff that
depends upon slave labor so what does my genie coefficient really mean it just means that
the really fucked up genie coefficient i externalized somewhere else and so um to me that's just
called cooking it means your genie coefficient has narrow boundaries yeah so whether it's my genie
coefficient or my um jewels two dollars ratio if i'm externalizing the shitty metric somewhere
else but it's still on a closed biosphere and what we're talking about is limits of the biosphere
all we're doing is cooking the books right like this is just basically bad accounting
and and cooking the planet um india just announced today their their coal uh consumption is up 29
percent i'm not laughing at cooking the planet i'm laughing at the pun that just naturally emerged
there um but yes well it's it's um it's it's horribly tragic um crying is probably more
appropriate than laughing but in order to maintain the the increased air conditioning
because of the the massive heat in india and pakistan they have to burn more coal
so that is a positive feedback uh that is just it's profound yeah um you know i i first came
across this there's a there's indian man who explained the situation to me in a particular way
that um i hadn't thought about quite like this before he's said look climate change is not going
to hit the world uh evenly to begin with it's going to hit certain areas much worse the places
that have air conditioners and um good aquifers with you know running water and those types of
things are obviously going to do better um the places where you have high population multiplied
by high population density um and that are already in hot areas the you know extreme weather events
are going to hit a lot worse so he's like india is really going to get screwed well before europe
and the us are but it's because europe and the us have air conditioners that they built with
and his number was something like 50 trillion dollars of extraction during british rule of
resources us i mean current equivalents from india and to be able to build that which was both the
use of all the um hydrocarbons that got us to this climate change position plus also what protects
them from it but what also keeps them from having the resources to be able to deal with it themselves
and then say pull yourself up by your bootstraps to another country and that put him into a kind of like
ecoterrorist point of view of like what choice other than taking the west out do we have is this
not a genocide of negligence and it's like fuck that's not a invalid perspective right uh
genocide of negligence is a is a is a thing we can actually look at and a lot of people when
they think about climate change think about like systemic venusification of the planet
but well before you get to systemic venusification which might never happen depending upon the model
getting the 50 celsius heat waves over the next few years in places like india and bangladesh and
pakistan that have high populations with high population densities with low groundwater with
low food resources uh that can lead to crop failures like the new gay resource wars those
resource wars can scale to global wars there's a war over resource in northern india turned into a
cleaving on you know hindu muslim lines is that becoming india pakistan war there's a lot of places
where things like this come so this is again a global issue you can't take it as a local issue
even if you were sociopathic and only cared about your country these things escalate to global issues
very quickly and the timeline on stuff like that totally totally this year could be next year could
be we can't guarantee because it's a complex system where you can't forecast well but it's
it doesn't take venusification timelines for those things to occur
no and the only thing i would add there is even wider boundaries is the genocide of the oceans
and the complex self-aware life in the oceans where 93 percent of the heat generated so far
has been absorbed by the oceans because they can absorb it but but they're there too is a limit
so i think personally climate change is the largest risk for our species and civilization
by two orders of magnitude having said that i don't think it's in the top 10 in the next 10 years
of the the various risks that we face so just to you know come out of the closet on that i care
the most about future ecosystems other species long after i won't be on this planet but i think we
have like in your language the governance and regulation and and the the the inner beating
heart of the superorganism that is where we have to work and come up with solutions
because there's lots of other things the the financial recalibration the nuclear war risks
a lot of the other things you talk about crisper and ai and polarization and all that
just to continue on your tangent for a moment and then we get back you're mentioning caring about
the complex life in the oceans and obviously the the rest of the non-human life that we have been
genociding or displacing this is why our mutual friend aza raskin who co-founded the center for
humane technology has taken a good chunk of his time off that to do the earth species project and
i just kind of want to mention it because whether it succeeds in its goal really soon or not just
even thinking about it is very interesting and cool they're using ai's most cutting edge i mean
google's ai cutting edge translation software to translate between languages to try to translate
animal languages with the idea that if we could actually listen to the whales and what they had
to say in the dolphins and understand the depth of their sentience it might be a wake-up call
and uh yeah i think that's a cool project that if they succeed in translating other
species languages and figuring out how bonobos or starlings or whales talk to each other
my biggest worry there is that humans en masse will just shrug and say no big deal where you know
my my core belief here is we need a new sacred standard religion and economic growth for everyone
have kind of been our our goals our aspirations and at the end of the day
my belief is the sacredness of the natural world that we inhabit and share with 10 million other
species that is what really matters at the end of the day but now we're getting way off tangent
actually this is about to tie us right back into where we're going through another tangent
but i see the loop back so indulge me okay um your concern is that even recognizing the much
greater consciousness sentience of other species that we can't currently talk to wouldn't change
because values are the change in values isn't going to change behavior in an economic system
that is incenting behavior in a direction that follows this embedded growth obligation to convert
the entire natural world into currency so obviously values can influence our behavior economics can
influence our behavior the other key thing is that technology directly influences our behavior
and there's a coupling between these we've talked about the way um Marvin Harris models these three
in terms of uh civilizations being made of infrastructure social structure and superstructure
the social structure is kind of the social agreement field the law of governance in particular
and the institutions that mediate how do we do our social agreements the infrastructure is the
tech stack that that rides on the modes of production agriculture energy waste management
all that kind of stuff and the superstructure is the what is the definition of the good life
what are our ethics what is the basis of the jurisprudence of law and so that can be religion
nationalism all those types of things and so um different social theorists will argue which of
these is most fundamental we i would argue that these three are co-informing we can show call
little loops where each one can inform the others um a lot of what we're you know obviously the
goal that aza has is can we make a play in superstructure can we make a play in the understanding
and human values that would have a somehow bind our economic incentive on our use of technology
and economics and the technology are related because obviously you can't
venusify the planet with stone age tech right you can't blow the planet up with stone age tech
it's um all of our catastrophic risks are mediated by tech because otherwise we're not
powerful enough to do shit at that scale and but obviously our tech and the incentive structure
to grow it use it in particular ways and the laws on binding those ways the relationship of all that
kind of goes together but just to give an example because so many people there's a paper
we're writing a consensus project that'll be published probably by the time this comes out on
why tech is not values neutral um a lot of people have this weird kind of conception that technology
is just values neutral i can use a hammer to build a house for the homeless or i can use it as a
weapon but there's no value embedded value system embedded in the hammer it's just the value system
the person that chooses to use it and that would be the same with everything in our industrial
supply chain and um they either have that view or some people have the view that tech is fundamentally
values positive that's kind of the general um Hobbesian pinker and you know gatesy and kind of
view of the dialectic of progress that tech only gets selected for and the market only up regulates
it if it's solving some real problem that people want and they're willing to pay for so of course
it is inherently liberating humans from problems that allows them to expand and so it's fundamentally
net positive um then there are the lewis mumford's and everyone who have critiqued why that's not
true and many people then can go in a ludic direction of like no tech actually messes up
religions and societies and ecosystems and so tech is fundamentally net negative to our value
systems i would say we're arguing this paper all three of those are naive tech is values affective
it affects it in a complex set of positive and negative ways and very much in the same way that
tech will produce some positive thing in the physical world but also externalize some negative
things it doesn't have one affected as a complex set of effects and we need to factor the positive
and negative externalities in addition to the thing it was supposed to do and factor that into
design that's also true in the psychological space i want to get into where i was going with that but
did you want to say something neat i did i want to i want to add something and then ask you a
question um you're saying that from a tech standpoint i would say that we would not be
able to venus venusify the planet without fossil hydrocarbons because my friend steve keen says that
um that's what i would call industrial tech body well a body without energy is a corpse and
technology without energy is a sculpture and so our cities without energy are a museum de facto so
my question to you is is energy values neutral no and we'll get to that but let me come back
to the tech thing there obviously without in internal combustion engines oil is not worth
all that much um obviously without uh in electricity in an electrical grid we don't
fucking need all that so basically the energy is driving tech tech is also without oil drilling
which is tech you don't get the oil without oil refining which is tech yeah there's a there's a
positive feedback and there in in my earth they talk i refer to it as the economic trinity that
information energy and materials are bound and they yes all three to go forward we're gonna go
into that but let me finish this loop because it's where there's it connects back to the binding of
these and why a good example of why tech's not values neutral and your other friends other
than humans on the planet um so tech allows us to exploit energy in different ways like our ability
to drill and refine oil and then use it to run tech that requires energy and obviously energy
gives us the ability to develop new techs and you get this positive feedback in that and so oil was
this massive increase in our ability to use energy before that the last massive increase you might
argue was agriculture and the ability to uh make a huge amount more caloric surplus per acre with
grains and with that particular one obviously baskets were a part of it and a number of things
but the plow was a huge part of it because the plow moving from kind of the digging stick and um to
ox drawn plow the caloric surplus skyrocketed and with it obviously population did and then
oil was the next big one and it was way bigger right um but uh when we look at the plow this is
a classic example of kind of the way tech is not values neutral and related to values on animals
you following the plow many kind of historians have argued that following the plow animism died
everywhere and animism was near universal before that most all the kind of in wait I didn't know that
what most all of the development of the plow for oxes animist religions fell out of
I first came across this in sex ecology and spirit by Wilbur and I've heard a number of
there's obviously the historians have deep detailed arguments on it but I'll give the kind of general
just an argument is that the you can be a hunter and kill a buffalo while still being animistic
you can pray to the spirit of a buffalo you can take no more buffalo than you need and use it all
well you can cry when you um kill it and then say you know I'm eating you we're going to get
buried when we die and become grass that your great grandchildren will eat and we're part of
this great cycle of life so I can let an animal have a free and sovereign life and be a predator
and be part of that and still kind of be animistic but I can't yoke a buffalo I can't breed it into
an ox yoke it cut its testicles off bind its horns and beat it all day long and be animistic
and still respect the spirit of the buffalo um I have to say it's a dumb fucking ox it's here for
us man's dominion over and change the memetics to do it and um so the key insight here is that the
plow using the plow the plow existing actually wait I want to construct this very specifically
the first part is that tech that is highly advantageous to use is obligate you don't get to
not use it and make it through history and so somebody else will use the plow they'll grow
their population because of the massive caloric increase they'll make it through the famines if
we don't then our tribe will get killed by them and or die in the famine so even if I don't want
to I have to and if I don't I don't make it through history so very adaptive tech is obligate
that's principle one principle two is that it codes a pattern of human behavior now rather than
being a hunter or gatherer I'm beating up ox all day right um and I'm uh branding it and binding
its nose and whatever else I have to do because it codes a pattern of human behavior it codes a
pattern of values and human psyche and then to do that in scale means it codes a culture and so
animism was universal in South America North America Africa Europe whatever is pretty universal
and animism died following the the ox driven plow almost everywhere because you can't be animistic
and be an animal all day long and so kind of some version of men's dominion over type ideologies
emerged following it and so to get that that piece of tech changed the value systems from
all life is sentient we're not the web of life we're merely a strand in it whatever we do to the
web we do to ourselves to man's dominion over it's all here for us you know that kind of thing
that was the result of a value system embedded in the technology itself inexorably embedded not
based on how people used it but embedded in it and then some historians go on to argue that
not only did the plow do that regarding animism it also went from where previous to the plow
societies and david graver's new book adds a lot of nuance i'm at i'm doing like a hundred
thousand foot view but that whether women were gathering and then we're hunting or women were
doing horticulture and then we're hunting women could still provide half the food stuffs men had
to do the plow because women would miscarry men's upper body strength mattered so now men provided
the meat stuff and the vegetative stuff women moved in the house as a result you also moved
from a distribution of male and female gods to mostly male gods so the thing that is called
patriarchy often is often attributed as a rising as a byproduct of the plow also in the movement
from all the food that gives life being male derived rather than female because again of the
physicality involved in the nature of the plow then of course that gives you surplus and before
that you didn't have surplus so you have these you didn't have private property ownership you
have these different kinds of sharing systems now with much more surplus you could grow the
population a lot faster now you got larger than done by a number kind of empires now you got
radical wealth inequality and class systems so we're like are there arguments about why that
ended up requiring more formal institutionalization of marriage on larger scale because now I own
stuff that I could pass on to my kids when I died so I wanted more paternity certainty so everything
from like institutionalization of marriage to views towards animals to to patriarchy versus
matriarchy to the formalization of economic to class systems all as possible second third order
outputs not in the physical world but in the cultural world of a piece of tech
now we can go through similarly the way the printing press ended up giving rise to the
Protestant revolution and democracy and because without the printing press you can't have everybody
have a newspaper and have books so only a nobility has access and we can go on and on look at how
each piece of tech if you use it in codes game theoretic power where those who use it will get
ahead and those who don't will end up not making it through history so it's obligate it codes behavior
as a result it codes values in minds as a result of doing that in scale it codes cultures so it's
not just that we have to have values from something like religion or whatever to make us use tech well
it's the tech is directly creating our values also so we have to design tech that in mind not
just how does this tech externalize costs in the physical world meaning you know the mining
byproduct and toxic tailings that come out of this mining technology and whatever but how it
externalizes things into the human psychological cultural world we're calling this kind of
axiological design how do you embed the axiology the ethics into the tech design now we'll get into
that's an example of how infrastructure drives superstructure and also social structure and
Nate talks a lot about how the social structure the economic growth the embedded economic growth
obligation forces us to keep using more tech and energy and keeps forcing more and more
fucked up social superstructures that justify doing that that are increasingly kind of nihilistic
and etc so getting into how these interrelate is fascinating and it's probably beyond the
scope of this because I want to get back to the nature of the super organism but you do have
to recognize the feedback loops between all these in the super organism so I just when
we were mentioning people not caring about the complex life enough I'm actually wanting to
give that example of ways that that actually resulted from the inexorabilities of the tech stack
itself first of all that was beautiful and the first part of that where you were talking about
the ox I actually got emotional I'd never heard that before and embedded in what you were just
describing is the core innards of the super organism and I asked you the wrong question
before I asked you if energy is values agnostic and what I should have asked you is surplus
values agnostic because when we started that transition in agriculture it was to maximize
surplus of energy right it was calories largely stored calories it was energy I see agriculture
as being the first not the first I see agriculture as being the second major spike in our ability
to extract energy from the environment I see fire being the first major spike then agriculture then
oil and then digital technologies that increase our ability to do all of that faster and of course
there's a million sub refinement so it is surplus and it's energy like they're both fair and just to
look ahead and I don't know that I've said this on a podcast or in my life before but fire
agriculture oil and fossil hydrocarbons and info and tech those were the cans that we
kept kicking to expand our our reach I don't think physically we have any more cans to kick
and the next can is in our minds it's in how we get our evolutionary neurotransmitter cocktails
of meaning and love and excitement and motivation and peace by using less resources
that's the only can left to kick I think look at the Jevons paradox way back to agriculture then
we're going to move it forward to the Jevons paradox on oil and kind of fossil energy makes
perfect sense which is when you get a increase in efficiency in the ability to make more oil or
energy generation you're going to use more energy because it opened up new market sectors
but you can see that that was also true for agriculture right and basically the generation
of human calories as you grow the population if you get an increase in efficiency where you can
get a lot more calories per acre or you can convert more acres to cropland that increase
in efficiency means you get more surplus which means you grow your population faster and that
thing keeps happening so there was a Jevons paradox way back then right and and a super
organism dynamic way back then too because if you didn't do that if you didn't clear the land
uh someone else would have an out competed you so all of a sudden there was this imperative that
hadn't existed before so now do you want to go ahead and define the maximum power principle
and then we can tie those three concepts together the maximum power principle is sometimes referred
to as the fourth law of thermodynamics and it is defined as organisms and ecosystems self-organized
so as to access an energy gradient so um there's something also related called Kleber's law which
shows that the metabolism or the energy burning of an animal or an insect or a whale or anything in
nature is related to their size their body size to the two-thirds power so the maximum power
principle shows that organisms in nature self-organized to get more access to energy
but it's power right it's not just access to this pool of energy it's energy per unit time
which is defined as power now in nature other species only access energy that they use endosomatically
in their body humans use two thousand calories a day in our body but in america we use two hundred
thousand calories a day exosomatically outside of our body so we have a hundred to one exosomatic
magic wand that we're waving around on average um so maximum power principle just means there's a
tether between uh animal behavior and access to energy yeah let me um say it a different way that
is a corollary of that which gets to the obligate nature which we were just starting to speak to
when i was saying before if you don't use the plow then your civilization is not going to
make it through and define the world system relative to anybody else using it um if you don't
exploit the energy source that doesn't mean nobody's going to exploit the energy source somebody's
going to exploit the energy source whoever exploits the energy source which includes the way that
changes their culture and their means uh to be able to justify doing the thing that's the culture
that's going to end up using that energy game theoretically and getting ahead which also means
the means that correspond with that are the ones that get selected for right so we we did briefly
mention in the first conversation um alfred latke wrote a paper a hundred years ago that um
um access to energy was a core driver of evolutionary success and that those animals
that had access to energy had options that those that who did not didn't have access to so access
to energy was a core driver in our evolutionary past and you're right an energy resource would
not long remain untapped in the wild right it maps an evolutionary theory to um niche filling
the concept of niche filling if there is any evolutionary niche that has some energy in it
some critters going to evolve to be able to access that energy um now the thing with humans and as
you point out the exosomatic capacity of humans is there's a lot there's a lot of environments
that with our tech we can identify have energy in them that animals could not get the energy out of
and um they couldn't do a lot to turn uranium or into energy and we can right um they couldn't get a
whole lot of the energy out of fossil fuels and we can they couldn't uh deplete all of the top
soil to turn it into grains you know back to the earlier one they also couldn't control fire to be
able to burn shit and cook things that were unedible into you know edible things and or drive steam or
whatever it was so in evolution there is this kind of niche filling but with our tool making we're
able to do that on crack like on the totally different version of that and but the maximum
power principle okay there's a chunk I want to do can you give me like it's a the minimum
chunk size will take a bit to construct these things you you have as large a chunk as unity my
friend so the jevons paradox says uh you get more efficiency and rather than just use less stuff
you use that increased efficiency to do more stuff that is now gives there's more things that
ever return possibilities than you had before if you don't because you're like oh we can just
live sufficiently now somebody else will and in general that's the concept of a multipolar trap or
a kind of can you give an example of the efficiency that you just said just something in our regular
lives yeah I mean I'll the example we gave of the plow is a perfect example a plow will allow one
man using a plow to produce I don't know if it's 10 or 100 times more calories than a guy who's
just hunting right because his ability over the course of a year to plant crops you know grain
crops that have and increasingly hybridize them the grain calorie per acre per year relative to
hunting or horticulture is just fucking incomparable so that is an increase in efficiency so we could
just say oh great now we just don't need to work as many hours and use less land and be able to
feed ourselves and do more art and spirituality except we don't we're like great let's work all of
the hours and grow our population or you know build bigger surpluses to be able to create
systems of trade and exchange to be able to do increased division of labor and more total
specialization and complexity of our society so that it can be another one of work because we have
better weapons so there's two things that are happening there one is all the 10 to 100 times
extra surplus then has ripple effects in the economy that then there's more surplus to do
more things and the other thing is the the other guy who's still the hunter has a choice to make
am i still gonna hunt and get this low caloric output or am i too gonna switch to this new
technology the plow so our people he might think only took uh what we absolutely needed to live
in harmony and so we wouldn't kill the pregnant buffalo and we wouldn't kill the babies and we
wouldn't kill when the buffalo were too um low and they had had a hard season we actually decided
to leave buffalo alone even though they were great and only hunt deer and because of this
long-term understanding of how to be part of the cycle of life but uh and when we took buffalo we
took just kind of what we needed now if i don't kill the buffalo and these other guys have moved
in who are just gonna kill all the fucking buffalo they can right and they don't fact practice that
thing if i don't kill it it doesn't mean that it stays alive anymore if i don't kill it it just
means that they do and that they will grow their population and not only will they grow their
population they'll now do division of labor make better weapons and then they'll come kill all of
our people so me not killing it doesn't protect it anymore i have the ability to kill it but not
the ability to protect it therefore i actually should race i know you're talking about buffalo
and plows everything but you're talking about our modern fucked up culture as well
and how we are living in the superorganism and we can't help but be part of the superorganism
even though we understand and don't like it uh it's a compulsion so this is you know
you know i've talked about this i'll go ahead and um formalize the concept because i want to bring
the maximum power principle jevons paradox the superorganism the inexorability
all together to understand what this forcing function has been to understand how we make it
not inexorable how do we get out of it because the guy who doesn't want to kill the buffalo
recognize if i just kind of finish that sentence so it's probably obvious to everybody if i don't
kill the buffalo the buffalo doesn't still live the buffalo is going to get killed and fucked anyways
these other guys that are going to kill our people with their increased capacity so not only
am i going to leave the buffalo i have to hunt to kill it faster than the other guy to be able to
grow our population in defense and whatever because now in the face of um you know in group
outward warfare of whatever kind i kind of have to do that so now there's a race to the bottom
because if anybody does the fucked up thing for the whole but that provides a lot of game
theoretic advantage for them in the near term and they're going to use that game theoretic
advantage in game theoretic ways then everybody has to race to do that thing faster or they lose
in the midterm they don't get to the long term sustainable thing that they're trying to do we
call this a multipolar trap as the generalized case of it of which there are a few examples and
they're the most intractable issues for society and i would argue this is one of the deeper frames
to understand what humanity has to solve the multipolar trap one example is a tragedy of the
commons and we were just giving an example of a tragedy of the commons it's also if i don't
cut the tree down the tree doesn't say somebody else cuts the tree down the force is all going to
get destroyed anyways but they're going to use that timber and the increased economic capacity to
then also advance in a way that will fuck our people whether it's direct warfare or economic
warfare or whatever so now we're in a race to cut the trees down the fastest or their externalizing
costs to the environment in the form of pollution or dumping or mining tailings or whatever it is
if i don't do it it doesn't not happen they're going to do it anyways and then they're going to use
that adaptive advantage too so this is a thing where the inexorability of it happening anyways
means that we have to race to not be to have anything we care about be fucked by other people
doing it and of course everybody thinks that if i don't they will and so if you don't have the
ability to make a system wide agreement and enforce it then you get those kinds of race to
the bottom so a tragedy of the commons is one example we can bind these on small scales where
you can create some agreement process and some enforcement process but we need to have transparency
of who violated the thing and then enforcement we can actually enact and everybody agree on very
large scales it's really hard which is why climate change is still a thing and which is why we have
not got conservation of the oceans the atmosphere or any kind of thing well is because if we tax
carbon and china doesn't and that messes up our GDP growth relative to theirs and there's a great
power competition for who controls the 21st century then by us taxing carbon we're still
not preventing climate change we're just agreeing to seed power of the world to a different power
system that may be for a lot of reasons we might not think it's a good idea so unless everybody
can nobody can that kind of thing so a tragedy of the commons is one example a arms race is another
if they build nukes we have to build nukes because otherwise whoever doesn't have the nukes loses
and nobody wants to give up the nukes because whoever gives up their last nuke first just is
going to get fucked everybody's kind of clear on that and i'm not going to give up my last nuke
because i'm pretty sure that if they say they're giving up their last nuke they're lying how do
i know that in some deep secret underground military bunker they don't have a nuke and so
we're just not going to be proliferating now it gets worse when you start to get
very fast areas of new tech i don't want i don't really want to live in a world of AI weapons but
i have to build AI weapons and i'm basically representing any advanced nation states thinking
right now right we have to build the AI weapons because they are so if china is going to build
AI weapons and the weapons are just obviously going to have supremacy then the u.s and russia
and india and everybody has to race to do them well why don't we just make an agreement that
nobody does because we can't ensure that people are keeping the agreements because what are they
doing in some deep underground military base as a result we need to not neither make the agreement
and we defect on it knowing they're defecting while pretending that we aren't defecting spying on
them and trying to lie to their spies and that's kind of the thing happens or we just don't even
bother making the fucking agreement and then we're in a all out race to build the most fucked up
stuff that increases everybody's likelihood of dying from AI weapons now add this to buy our weapons
and on and on and on so the arms race and the tragedy of the commons are two there's a third
one which is in the market the kind of first mover advantage race to first mover on a market or
race to scale on a market that then externalizes everything other than the possible wind potential
so there is a perverse game theory on paying attention to opportunity versus paying attention
to risk uh if i am going to develop some new technology like let's say some advanced genetic
engineering technology like crisper of course there are some positive applications like maybe
i can try to do immuno oncology and crisper gene oncogenes out and whatever but of course as i'm
developing the capacity to do that cheaply anybody can use it for any purpose like
bio weapons or make more cancer right and so one of the tricky things that happens in the world
today is somebody develops a technology in major corporation or say in academia right they have
an ethical review board if it's an academia to ensure they're doing some ethical purpose and
there's oversight and there's all like that but then they're developing the techniques and then
they publish it and they're publishing something that unlike nukes is not hard to build physically
right i don't have to have cyclotrons and uranium enrichment it's just now like pretty simple
technologically to make the ai thing or the or the synth bio thing or whatever so i have an ethical
purpose to develop the thing but the knowledge by which i just developed and that i published and
that i used the huge mit funds or those standard funds or the whatever it is now anybody without
those funds and ethical review boards has access to build that same thing for other purposes and
even if i'm going to go to market applications i say no no my market application is good i'm using
it to do this thing well there's externalities that it might cause directly plus other people
using that tech for fucked up purposes but if i think about that if i think about the rest and
say oh you know what before we move forward on this i'm really going to do a complex risk
assessment of all the second and third order effects of what this might do directly plus
what putting the information out might enable others to do and then we're not if it's bad we're
not going to do it and if it's bad but we find a way to mitigate it then we'll do the mitigate
version so let's say i do that somebody else in the market doesn't do that they're just like
fuck it there's an opportunity i'm just going to sell the story that this opportunity is awesome
there's no downside risk we did risk mitigation but it was a total bullshit kind of version
they win the first mover advantage they get all the dollars they have socialized
the risk to the world they have privatized the gains themselves and as a result the game theory
and sense being focused on the opportunity and not the risk whoever focuses on the risk just
loses and has no power so all of these the market race which ends up being a race to the bottom
externality why is the arms race the tragedy of the commons are examples of multi-polar trap
where anybody doing the thing that is fucked up for the whole in the long term but provides game
theoretic advantage to them in the near term ends up causing races in the wrong direction humanity
has to solve for that thing categorically there are ways i believe of solving for a categorically
and we can talk about what some of those are and there are examples of where we've done it on local
scales we just haven't solved for it categorically now this is directly related to the dynamics of
the super organism with it you talk about it it's directly related to the obligate nature of the
plow right it's directly related to the maximum power principle so i just wanted to construct
a multi-polar trap we'll come back to that but you want to say something yeah well so what you're
saying is the hunter versus the guy with the plow and the obligate nature and the jevons paradox
rebound effect from the surplus generated by the plow i've been writing about how that applies
to our economic system and uh money and energy and uh co2 absorption by the biosphere in the oceans
but you're adding another layer to it which is saying the same dynamic applies to technology
especially exponentially soon to be ai-informed technology and spins off all these other
mini super organism volcanoes with x-risk attached to them because we're optimizing for opportunity
not risk we define up there there's a reason why it is intrinsically easier too and this is worth
noting there's a reason why it's intrinsically cognitively easier let alone game theoretically
easier pragmatically easier i'm going to build tech to solve a problem i'm going to have already
defined that problem in a pretty specific way and i'll have one or a small number of metrics that
are the success the the success metric of the opportunity right the problem solve or the
opportunity so the plow is going to increase the calories uh of surplus that i can generate per
person per year right like that's the metric of success that's pretty straightforward and i can
measure the plow versus the digging stick i can measure one plow versus another later i can measure
a tractor versus a plow and what i'm trying to optimize for is how much total caloric surplus
can be created per person or per acre or whatever it is right so the opportunity is measured in
or the upside is measured in one or a small number of known metrics the risk is going to happen
and it's a first order effect i'm directly causing that the tech is built to do a first
order effect on one or a small number of known metrics the tech is going to have second and
third and fourth order effects on a very large number of as of yet unknown metrics was where
the harm is going to occur so to do the risk reduction to prevent the externalities i've
got to think about not just what the result of using the plow to get calories out but using
that every season on topsoil erosion and what topsoil erosion then we'll do as a next order effect on
um the rivers because the roots aren't there anymore and what that'll do on the fisheries
and what it does to human minds and what that will be so now the externalities might be a million
metrics with nth order effects so it is easier it's intrinsically easier to optimize for opportunity
than it is to prevent against the risks well we well we don't have the surplus to do the research
even to optimize for all those risks there's so many people right now that are concerned about
global insect population the estimate is we're losing one to two percent of insect biomass
per year how the hell do we test that we can test little 10 acre plots here we don't have the
resources because that's not in our economics it's not that we don't have the resources it's
the multipolar trap doesn't orient those resources that way well that that's my question is how can
um all of the tech that is currently being built is in order to amass digital representations of
surplus and then this ties back to maximum power principle and evolution and ecology is that energy
is going to be used and and in nature so where is this uh opportunity here that we are just
naturally drawing down earth's energy battery 10 million times faster than it was sequestered
because we found it how could we not optimize for energy surplus which is our biological
tendency okay is that where you're going with with the what to do in the governance i have to
get back to why we use all these ex somatic calories and other animals don't to get into
the nature of the biological tendency of humans it is distinct but i want to define the maximum
power principle regarding markets um in a pure market system obviously we don't have pure market
systems there's regulation but let me just kind of try to define the idea of in as close to pure
market um type thing as we can think about uh so outside of regulation and enforcement
uh return on investment of capital will be in any area that provides return of investment
will be exploited there is a search function and an exploit function in the market will search
anywhere that capital can turn into more capital it will preference the higher returns but there
will still be um some appetite for returns of any kind and so if i get uh positive returns
i'm they're going to be exploited and so uh and we can say that in terms of capital but
we can say it in terms of energy too and to find the maximum power principle is wherever
there are positive energy return on energy investment so even if we start getting down to
that it takes most of a barrel of oil to get a new barrel of oil so long as it's i still get net
oil out of the process we're going to keep doing that thing if it is simply based on incentives
right because because of oil is so special yes but we wouldn't do the same for like corn ethanol
from an energy perspective obviously uh it takes some energy to get new energy so long
as i'm getting more energy out than the energy i'm putting in it makes sense to do it i'll always
seek the maximum energy return on energy investment but as the maximum decreases i'll continue to do
anything that gives me some energy return energy investment and that's also true with fiscal return
on fiscal investment and from a game theory point of view any player any agent in a game
theoretic situation is going to try to maximize their returns on agency i'm going to try to implement
my capacity to act to get more capacity to act so that's your optionality in a way and it's actually
very interesting one of the other papers we're writing right now a consensus project is on a
theory of hyperagents and the idea that of throughout history it's pretty obvious that
gangas cons and alexander the greats are different than most people right like they're
they're something in their motivational structure their psyche their capacities it's
pretty different than most people and they have a outsized influence on what happens to the world
and eight percent of men alive today have gangas cons work on the number is it's a very
interesting yeah something in that neighborhood where we try to look at the patterns of what's
happening in the world from a sociological perspective from patterns of kind of human
psyche and behavior in general uh we would kind of argue that there is a tiny percentage of people
at the top of the power law distribution who have a outsized effect on the world
and specifically then they create the topologies that everybody else operates in they create the
incentive deterrent landscapes and cultures and stuff that then ends up making everybody
else's values a lot what they are and these people are outside of the bell curves on most
of the psychological things that we assess sociologically as humans they are better at game
theory better at war generally more sociopathic highly more competitive you know those types of
things and one good way to think of it is that they are good at maximizing returns on agency
and so the hyper agent is someone who will implement agency to grow more agency
and a good hyper agent is someone who figures out how to do that at maximum scale
but are those people are is it is it exactly the same people that are the richest people in the
planet are not necessarily a major unit of agency it's not the only one so Kissinger had
way more global influence than he had personal money there was massive pools of money that he had
indirect influence over so how much money do i personally own versus how much do i have an assets
under management versus how much do i have an assets under indirect influence versus you know like
so um obviously like how much does how much money does Xi Jinping have personally versus
stewarding the GDP of China it's not how much he has personally it's how much it's how much total
agency he has influence over and there are different strategies for how to do that so those
people are optimizing they're optimizing agency and optionality and the money that they amass is
kind of an externality of that money is a unit of agency and optionality it's not the only unit
but it's a particularly interesting and important one and it's why like obviously before we had a
financial system with a global reserve fiat currency type thing the system emerged towards
towards better and better optionality right the financial system emerged towards that so
when we were just talking about agriculture the unit of currency might largely be just grains
right and being able to exchange grain for shoes or whatever it is or then we might start
getting into seashells or at a certain point gold coins or something that is some kind of represent
representation to mediate it a little bit easier and then the movement from some kind of mediated
barter with local currencies to being able to change the gold to paper units that are easier
to then be able to get rid of the gold to then be able to have a global reserve currency to you
know what that gives is increased and if you look at the current system with a global reserve
currency with kind of the OPEC backing petrodollar backing whatever you have this system of
relatively high stability with maximum optionality and it's usually hard to get both of those things
that are very stable like the value of real estate or whatever it's very low optionality
takes me a long time to sell it and the things that can move very fast oftentimes if I didn't
have a global financial system made to do this wouldn't have the same kind of stability so the
system was kind of engineered to maximize total market movement right and so if you think about
I think you and I talked about last time the military concept of the OODA observe
what's going on orient to that to make sense of what to do decide and then act and that the fastest
and most accurate OODA lubans of winning in game theoretic scenarios some kind of in a situation
where the world is changing rapidly long-term planning is not as good as very fast ability
to adapt and figure out what to do and so if I have a bunch of land and then all of a sudden the
world changes where I need energy or steel or computation or a military my ability to convert
that land to those things takes a while I got to sell that asset and find a way to sell it and
so if I have a lot of currency my currency gives me maximum speed right maximum optionality to get
gives you more options and so the thing that everybody wants the most is the thing that has
absolutely no intrinsic value but the maximum optionality for every source of value and yeah
of course there's this perverse thing that it says we will destroy sources of real value
to get the optionality value because I want to have more options than the next and there's
a multipolar trap right because if I don't maximize my returns on agency because I value
things so I'm going to put money into protecting the forest and not turning the forest into lumber
and then into capital if I don't maximize my returns on agency and someone else does they're
going to end up either beating me in war or influencing the world more than me so there's
a multipolar trap between hyperagents to maximize returns on agency and there's a rationalization
that even if it's because I think I'm the most ethical hyperagent I would be the best ruler
whatever it is I'm still obligated to get the maximum power to be able to do that and what is
considered a obligate game so how many hyperagents are there on the planet today roughly
who want to do maximum returns on agency there's plenty of people who are very power oriented they
just aren't equally good at it so there's plenty of people who are trying to climb the corporate
ladder and they're in middle management and they are hyperagents in their motivational complex it's
just how good at it they are it's not that much there's individual thugs who have nobody working
under them who are trying to maximize their agency so they might be a hyperagent motivationally
but their skill to do it is relatively low so if we're talking about a tier one hyperagent the
highest capacity ones they're not just motivated to do returns on agency they know how to do it at
scale which requires being able to understand how to navigate things like finance politics technology
culture human motivation you know how the things that can extend my agency in scaling dynamics and
depending upon how we define tier one there's not that many
so contrast that to the superorganism you have this small group of hyperagents that are maximizing
optionality tethered to digital representations dollars linked to energy and they're competing
with each other for more agency is that the driver of the superorganism or is the superorganism
driving them you're asking a bottom-up top-down causation question in a system that is recursive
and so there is a bottom-up dynamic which is individual people are motivated to do stuff
but then that creates larger systems and at this point now global systems that then
have their own embedded dynamics right like the embedded growth obligation on capital is not any
particular hyperagent it's then it's a global financial system that because of interest if
nothing else and there's a lot more on top of that but simply because of that structure
has to have an exponential growth curve and to stay bound to goods and services means you
have to have an exponential growth of materials economy blah blah blah but the that system creates
a top-down influence on all of the agents to do the bidding of that system and so you know you
produce the rather than people produce goods and services and then we figure out some way to index
and then make an amount of currency as you mentioned making up the money out of the not thin air but
the contract is basically saying let's put up put up the money to incent the growth of goods and
services to keep up with it so it doesn't debase itself but if you think about the money incentive
system okay so if i get money i get the optionality for anything i want that's pretty cool that means
that rather than have to figure out what somebody wants you just get to give them this unit of
choice making right and the money's just kind of like a unit of choice making for whatever the
fuck you want so now everybody wants the unit of choice making and the incentive of the decentralized
system is for everybody to figure out how to do the best job at converting their own life force
both labor and creativity into currency right that's the mode that's the kind of market motivation
and so it's my labor energy will give me a little bit not all that much my creativity
multiplied by that might give me a whole lot more and so there is a both search algorithm which is
all the humans in the world which was a smaller amount before but eight billion humans
incentivized to figure out new and better ways to make stuff that will correlate to capital
and then to exploit the fuck out of doing that and as soon as somebody figures out a new
a new thing that people hadn't figured out now there is a race for others to try to exploit
that space maximally once you get so somebody figures out early computation or whatever it is
now then everybody starts to race on that thing once that space gets flooded enough it creates
more incentive for search on new things when somebody figures it out and there's a race on
that thing I don't have a lot of money I would like more money but I'm not driven by it I'm
driven by discovery and friendship and conversations like this and doing meaningful things and so
I'm optimizing for a broader portfolio of results than the optionality for money having said that I
would dearly like more money in the bank for a rainy day in case I get sick or something happens
or I don't get funding you know etc but there is the capacity for humans to optimize things other
than the a single monetary representation of all our ancestral experience
the scientists philosophers artists spiritual teachers throughout history that we like the most
were mostly motivated like you said there's an intrinsic motivation that was not that much of
an extrinsic motivation like original theory of money partly was how do we mediate barter partly
was how do we incentivize people to do a bunch of shitty labor jobs that society needs that nobody's
intrinsic motivated to do so we need to extrinsically motivate them to do it because that is ultimately
more efficient and kinder than the state forcing them to do it the state could just take care of
everybody's needs and then force them to do it but we'll let the market force them instead of the
state and so that one of the core ideas of money was a system of extrinsic incentive because there's
a bunch of shit that needs to get done that nobody really wants to do but then of course
some people then take that extrinsic incentive and figure out how to just get very good at
getting lots of it not doing the labor stuff right so interestingly was Einstein money motivated
it does not seem so it seems like he was very intrinsically motivated to figure out the universe
as deeply as he could was that game theoretically not just money but agency game theoretically
motivated it all pretty much seems like a genuine curiosity sacred even kind of impulse now did
his scientific insights give the basis for how to make the nuclear bomb totally it was at his
intention though was the development of the bomb motivated by game theory totally and it couldn't
have done that without him doing that thing so then the game theory ends up exploiting the
non-game theory things one could argue that Jesus didn't make a lot of Christians Constantine made
a lot of Christians and I take this argument for the spirit of it rather than the literality because
I don't know the historicity of it I don't know if anybody knows the historicity of any of this
well enough but kind of standard narrative between Jesus and the third century there were just not
that many Christians and small amount of Christians you know getting thrown to lions and Roman
Empire and like that then we get a huge number of Christians when the Roman Empire goes from
throwing Christians to lions being the Holy Roman Empire and the Crusades and spreading
Christianity and so the Council of Nicaea the creation of the Bible the idea of spreading
it by force or crusades that wasn't Jesus right and so it's not who made the concept it's who
identified a utility of it and motive it was motivated to make it spread that was a hyper agent
and so so I would say Jesus and Einstein were both motivated by non-hyper hyper agency oriented
things and then Constantine and Eisenhower or Eisenhower and in that case you know
Hitler whatever we're motivated to see how do we extract that and convert it to game theory
so we need wider boundary hyper agents but the system doesn't reward that and most wider
boundary hyper agents have very little power and optionality hyper agent is
um is getting returns on agency right they're they're I want to be there people
that care about a lot of things but yeah I see when I was a kid and my mom was taking me to do
activists stuff we were going to Greenpeace protests and PETA and Cal Perg and all these
kinds of things and I really cared and but I saw that everybody there really really cared they were
willing to self-sacrifice for other sentient beings they had never met whether it was an animal
in a factory farm or a whale that would get hurt or uh whatever and I remember seeing that and
then thinking about the industries they were up against and the tools of capital advantage
and political advantage and technological and intellectual advantage that those industries
had relative to the tools of effectiveness these people were using was handcuffing themselves to
things and you know picket signs and like that it was just so clear they were going to keep losing
and um the way I saw it at first was that that represented the kind of head to heart divide at
the level of humanity and that those things can't actually be divided and then I realized one more
step I started thinking of it as like um head to heart will you know um something like that that
those three one there's of course lots of types of intelligence lots of types of
capacity we need to think about them all together um but if you just take those three as a beginning
kind of model um and you kind of say okay solar plexus will agency heart kind of values uh and mine
kind of strategic technological insight and I started to see that any two out of the three
together and the world dies because if you it's not just single ones die if you end up having
a lot of agency and a lot of heart a wide kind of heart right which is or a oriented to care about
a lot of things inclusively well the activists had that right the activists had high agency they
were willing to work their asses off wrist themselves get on zambonis handcuff themselves
things so a lot of agency a lot of heart very poor strategic thinking about how to actually
so they had agency but they didn't have the strategy to do hyperagency and so they would
continue to lose if you had kind of wide inclusive values and you were smart but you didn't have a
huge amount of agency I saw so many like caring liberal intellectuals who had some thought about
the problems in the world they really cared and they felt crushed and like they couldn't do anything
if you didn't have wide values you had narrow values but you had very high agency and you had
high strategic thinking and your strategic thinking was in service of your agency and your values were
only optimizing for yourself or your corporation or your nation state and you were willing to
externalize harm elsewhere you became a awesome hyperagent that ruled the world while externalizing
lots of harm and creating multipolar traps with other hyperagents to do so so how to get all three
of those together right which would be the the will and strategic capacity but with the wide
inclusive values I'm not trained to optimize for a narrow set of metrics but very wide inclusive
everything I would say that is a minimum necessary requirement for people that can help turn the
ship around now that doesn't end the multipolar trap that whatever values I care about that don't
optimize my agency still seem like they gain theoretically lose if I care about them to
the people that only do the agency returns and so one of the things that we have to get into
is how to make that not lose and that's one of the criteria of turning the super organism thing
around I think there are answers to that and it's probably in our next podcast well I was going to
say I mean you and I know some of these hyperagents and is one of the possibilities to change the
values in this group to be wider or wider values as you were saying is that possible I mean the
question of do you try to increase the understanding of interconnectedness and the embodied values
and commitments of the hyperagents do you try to increase the agency of the people who already have
wider and deeper values you know any of those are possible paths they're all hard human development
is a is not a quick thing and more fundamentally we want to ask the question like when we're
mentioning the way plows affected values at scale is not just what do we try to do with
individual people but how would we make changes to society that would be developing people
differently at scale now of course you have this bootload question of like well who's going to do
that who is going to do that there was in this current system that isn't doing that to try to make
systems that you know incentivize different things long term I think we're approaching a bend versus
break moment and we discussed that in the first conversation where our financial claims on our
physical reality are diverging and that gap is getting wider and it's unsustainable so when
we have our third conversation I would like to horizontally look at triage
transition and long-term solutions for the human enterprise and then vertically globally
nationally in communities and as individuals you have off the record and tangential to this
conversation given me some excellent personal advice on how to cope and thrive during this time
I don't know if we want to fit that in the next macro podcast but you're you're very good at that
stuff so that's where I want to head to on the what to do because learning about the spur
organism actually does something paradoxical when you understand it it actually makes you
at least feel like you have less agency people that understand the the momentum of all this
it's kind of a shitty thing to discover because it feels like oh we can't just pass a climate
law and everything is fixed or oh we just can't have you know a law that is more equality and
that doesn't fix things that the problem is much more systemic and deeper than that it is certainly
often the case that as people understand that the individual problems are not so easily solvable
on their own they're part of a deeper set of interconnected things and there's this kind of
really tricky gang theory of multiple or traps and incentives on opportunity and not risk and
that even if you try to regulate a thing that the regulatory apparatus moves slower than the thing
trying to regulate and so it continues to wiggle out of the regulations and as people start to
understand all that it can make them feel less agency and a little bit overwhelmed and shitty and
so as you mentioned talking about how to emotionally psychologically hold that's valuable but it
doesn't have to make them feel less agency it can make them feel more agency and that's actually
what I hope happens so that's the effect it has for me and I'll explain why inside of me because
I think it can for a lot of people if they hold it this way I think there's a lot of people who
care but the problems seem intractable there's a certain kind of nihilism they have because
climate change seems like such a huge deal and and almost impossible to solve and then
so does species extinction and so does nuclear risk and so does and it seems like there's a
million problems and then they learn about a new one and a new one and even if they started to feel
like they got hope around some chunk of them there's more and and there's a certain sense of like
impossibility in trying to deal with it all at that level that when you start to get oh there
are underlying system dynamics that all these are expressions of it can start to feel more
tractable those problems are hard but now that we're able to actually articulate that all the
other problems are expressions of a set of system dynamics now we at least know where to focus now
possibly we've defined the problem well enough to be able to solve it and in understanding a problem
better more solutions start to emerge if I don't understand the problem well enough I probably
can't solve it at all as I'm understanding it better I might say wow that's a hard problem
but at least possible so I think we move from impossible to hard when we start to understand
it better and hard is better than impossible and what I want is that it actually kind of cures
denialism people have running of maybe this is fucking impossible and creates a inspiration
and upregulation with regard to the heart of like hard but possibly fucking tractable this should
get all my life energy the fact that I don't know the answer instantly nobody fucking knows
Einstein didn't know the answer to the questions he was asking and no inventor knew the answer of
how to make the invention they were thinking of there is some faith that the thing that you
don't know exists that makes you do hard discovery work and stay with it one of the other problems
you talk about kind of the dopaminergic nature of the superorganism is it the delayed gratification
to work on a problem for a long time that you don't know how to solve instantly is fucking critical
and so one of the attributes of the people in addition to these three things you know together
the kind of agency heart mind is part of the agency is the capacity to say I don't know the answer
but that doesn't mean I'm demotivated the fact that I can even start throughout my head around the
problem more means that there is a possible path to answer and I'm motivated to continue to explore
that space until I have it and then implement the best answers I have and then when they fail
find out why they failed and not feel it take it as a failure but learning so that psychology I would
say is critical to being part of solution thank you that is helpful and it makes sense to me
one of my biggest challenges is all along I'm an expert on describing the constraints
of our situation less so than expert on the solutions because they're not impossible
but they're hard as you said but I spend most of my time debunking people that say no we can
decouple energy from a GDP and no renewables will be able to power a 19 terawatt society we just need
to have the political will or whatever I spend most of my time on that instead of in the solution
space because as you say we have to understand the systemic nature of the problem in order to work on
the real solutions one of the reasons you have the podcast is to help more people understand
the design criteria and the reason you're motivated to do that is not because you just like attention
being on a podcast but because more people understanding the criteria leads to more
people's creativity working on solutions and so there is an implicit faith in your strategy
we need a lot more people collective intelligence if it has the right input can do something right
obviously that's why I'm talking with you here is the same kind of faith the we're actually
working on a project right now on what are the kind of very hard questions that are underneath
most of the problems that we think are a better orienting framework than things like sustainable
development goals and the multi how do you solve multipolar traps is an example of one of those
questions and being able to make that very widely understood not to bum everyone out but to say let's
get the decentralized collective intelligence of the world having the best frameworks for understanding
the most fundamental problems as the center of the innovative focus of the creativity of the world
right if we have people understand those constraints widely of course some people say I don't know the
fuck to do with that but a lot of people will be like oh this is an engineering problem let's start
to work on it and some of the problems like how do you solve multipolar traps don't have a single
solution they'll have lots of partial solutions well in order to get enforcement you have to be
able to see so there's going to be transparency tax so how do we create force transparency in
some places and how do we create incentives on transparency and how do we and other things will
have to do with enforcement others will have to do with incentive others will have to do a better
regulatory process and then of course whenever you figure out a thing it'll be gamed because
there will be still be an incentive to game it so it's and that's why it's not here is the answer
forever it's why it's an orienting question how do we continue to pay attention to things like
perverse incentives and externalities and multipolar traps and do a better job ongoingly and procedurally
up regulating our responses to these things that are fundamental to all the other problems
um and if and if people like you are not articulating the design criteria well then
other people be coming up with solutions really well intendedly that we're just missing some
of the design criteria and this is one of the problems is as we were mentioning we define
the problems with narrow definitions of what success means that still externalize lots of
harm or miss some of the constraints getting the constraint set better might make it harder
but actually it makes it possible whereas before it was impossible because all the things were
bound to fail because they didn't understand what the success required so rather than go from easy
to hard the easy was for sure going to fail so it wasn't easy it was impossible we're actually
going from impossible to hard which is a movement in the right direction
okay so you wanted to unpack a little bit more about Adams bits jewels and and maybe dollars
and and human behavior so yeah just to kind of underscore the energy blindness that you talk about
I think the first time I heard the term Adams and bits together in terms of describing the economy
was from Peter Thiel and of course makes sense that from someone who made money in Silicon Valley
in the domain of bits recognizing that there is still stuff to do in the domain of Adams which is
what Peter's very favorable of which is why he likes Elon and you know people who build
physical technologies for the people coming out of Silicon Valley where everything was about digital
tech and obviously digital tech kind of subsumed so much of the world in particular the financial
world's attention because of the capacity for the scaling dynamics right the the network dynamics
that met CAF law that gives you kind of natural monopolies and the speed at which you can get
three billion users into a platform which is so unheard of for anything else like that and the
speed at which you can get to a billion dollar valuation or anything else because of the bits
give you exponential returns right the I can make a piece of software once and then sell an
indefinite number period a number of times and that obviously started with computation software
then when I get a beyond just software and that would be like the Microsoft story into something
that is a network so it's software but then it's applied to mediating human interaction where the
value occurs across the interaction so the number of people that goes up the value squares
is something like a second power to that which would be true for digital currencies amazon
facebook all those types of things now you're dealing with something like you know an exponential
curve with another exponential or at least polynomial curve on top of it and so the of
course from a financial point of view money into software equals more money out relative to most
other things and so you know that sucked up a lot of world's attention but then you know people
recognize there's still stuff to do in the domain of atoms that matters but even calling it atoms and
bits of course these guys are very sophisticated I've heard Peter teal refer to it that way or
biology of course they know that the energy sector is one of the biggest sectors they get
pitched at species all the time on new energy tech they know Saudi Aramco as you know maybe the
biggest or one of the biggest valuation companies in the world and yet just even in the framing it's
not explicit in the framing and the first time I heard the three together atoms energy and bits
as the key parts of materials economy is from forest landry and that obviously doesn't still
include all the human aspects but from a materials economy point of view kind of reducing it to the
things that have fundamentally different physics it's a good structure the atoms we don't really
get more of right the amount of copper we have on the planet is what it is outside of mining
asteroids are not going to get more and even then it's still within a larger space of earth
plus the asteroid belt or whatever that we're looking at and we also don't get rid of them
so we have a finite amount and then we turn them into pollution if we don't go close loop on them
and so we have we have to go close loop on the atomic accounting of things right energy we're
getting more of all the time but we have a kind of fixed bandwidth of how much comes in and we
have to work within that bandwidth how many joules are coming into the planet from the sun
per day and like that bits there is not the same fundamental limit of either a fixed amount that
we have to work with or a fixed input it so they have a different scarcity dynamic it's really
only limited by the energy and atoms needed for the computational substrate but then also limited
by human time the attention seconds thing of how much software is useful if it requires either an
interface the the software is either going to move atoms around so you have to couple it to atoms
it's going to move bits around in ways that take energy the software is but it's it's going to
require energy so it's coupled to that well and or it's coupled to you know entertainment or some
kind of human engagement directly so it's coupled to finite amounts of attention so you don't get
an infinite scaling on the value of bits that is decoupled from human attention atoms and energy
well there's also a qualitative aspect to the bits too based on what culture cares about
one thing i would say on the atoms energy bits so the first thing is of course
atoms aren't that useful unless we can rearrange them and move them around and that takes energy
and energy is not useful if we aren't moving atoms or bits around with it or moving it through
things made of atoms right so we care about it to have a motor that moves an atom around or
something like that and bits are going to be coding for the thing that we're going to
you know the the digital pattern that we're actually going to build in the physical world
or something that is related to and at minimum running on a computational substrate energy and
atoms so there are coupling coefficients between them where you don't get to just increase bits
indefinitely independent of atoms and energy you can increase them to some extent and those
where you'll get increases in efficiency but then that's why the jevons paradox still matters
is what happens with those increases in efficiency so those increases in efficiency have to not
jevons paradox which means we need a binding dynamic because the pure market dynamic will
just turn that into a maximum power principle and forever growth those increases in efficiency
have to also turn into less total utilization to deal with actual limits of growth and you're
not going to get that sort of pure incentive system you need that sort of binding system
that'll get into what we talk about later of how do you make governance in the presence of
international multipolar traps and the fact that markets typically capture the regulatory system
rather than the other way around so how do energy while jewels bits and atoms
well the first thing i want to say is there's something like a jevons paradox on all of them
and jevons paradox was obviously name that looking at energy but it's because energy is a
relevant input to any kind of industrial process any kind of you know market process so an energy
gets cheaper more total market space opens up well compute has become useful to pretty much
every market right so when compute becomes cheaper we use more total compute that's a
that's another kind of jevons paradox on computation and we don't say great now we'll
compute with less energy we say great now there's more total shit that we can apply computation to
but it would also be true to say anything that is industrial input that is useful not in one
industry but widely when it becomes cheaper will increase total market so if if we can extract steel
more cheaply and steel is key to our ability to build vertically in you know pop high population
spaces as that gets cheaper we will build more shit grow populations more and grow net markets
more so what i would say is there is this generalized jevons paradox that when anything
that is relevant for the market as a whole gets cheaper the market as a whole grows
and so you have that kind of boomerang on efficiency not just on energy but kind of
at large and that's an important part of understanding maximum power principle
i agree with that though i think the opposite is about to start happening that we've gotten a
clue with ukraine and russia and europe's dependence on russian hydrocarbons that as energy gets more
expensive everything in society is going to get more expensive including solar panels and wind
turbines you know the last three months etc so as we've been focusing on the powers of what
technology can provide for us during that era that narrative was supported by pretty much
every year we grew our access to fossil energy and most of the time it was very cheap but there's
a multiplier effect that we add thousands to ten thousands of units of fossil energy to replace
tasks that the ox or my great great great great grandfather did in the fields and so that because
of that our industrial processes our bits and atoms are incredibly sensitive to price increases
in energy at 200 a barrel energy oil it's still effectively magic for what it can do for us but
many of the energy intensive processes in the world would become unprofitable at that point the
entire market depends upon pricing you talk about pricing the cost of energy the cost of extraction
rather than what it would actually take for us to make that substrate and and the total
externality cost this is also another kind of corollary of the kind of market dynamics and
maximum power principles is not just the cost of energy but the cost of steel the cost of anything
is going to be the cost of extraction and then some margin right so it's going to cost us something
and this is kind of that return on investment topic it's going to cost us something to get
out of the earth but we didn't make it there and there's going to be you know a lot of
costs that is externalized not to our balance sheet in terms of we just destroyed rivers and
extincted some species and ruined some indigenous people's lives and you know whatever but
and we just can't make we just can't make hydrocarbons at scale like that that have that
organic chemistry complexity and so but if anyone just extracts it because there isn't a law we
call it being industrious to extract we there's a law saying stealing from the balance sheet of
nature because nature doesn't have a balance sheet is anything other than being industrious then I
just have to have enough margin to sell it and I don't want too much margin because somebody
else will do it and come with a lower margin so the market will end up setting the price right
so the market incentivizes extraction and externalization and so what that means is a
sustainable market because you can't keep extracting and externalizing and using unremovable resources
forever a sustainable market almost everything would not that we currently have would not be
viable like almost nothing would be profitable and the profitability dynamics if we weren't
externalizing all of the costs and burning through unremovable things unremovably would
be completely fucking different and this is the thing you're underscoring it's like what would
that actually look like if we made sure that we actually had we were using energy in ways that we
could continue to use energy and we were using atoms in ways that we could continue to use atoms
what would that system look like and it looks fundamentally different I think this is what's
so fundamental in your work is saying hey we have to really rethink what does it mean to have a system
that you're not continuously subsidizing as we're about to lose our ability to keep subsidizing this
thing I totally agree um a slight clarification we actually can make low carbon hydrocarbon fuel
with technology we can over build solar panels and wind turbines near bodies of water via hydrolysis
we can create methane which is basically natural gas but the all-in cost of that is
ten dollars a gallon oil equivalent which would be we could have a viable society around that
but not this society not not this amount of goods and services and complexity
and we can talk about that at our next conversation the plan is to continue to grow
to reach some sustainable technology level there is no plan to have a smaller society because
our system won't select for that plan and that's part of the the impossible to hard
distinction that we made is I think we have a 19 terawatt society right now which is 190 billion
light bulbs turned on 24 seven that is the metabolism of the human enterprise
what is more sustainable what is using our remaining uh lower quality higher cost hydrocarbons
hopefully not any coal at all and in combination with our best renewable tech
NAI or whatever our work suggests it's closer to 10 terawatts maybe it's five maybe it's 12 I don't
think anyone really knows but it's not 30 and I don't think it's 25 either and it's not 19
because these fossil armies that we've woken in the last two centuries we can't continue to add
their labor to our workforce they're going to be retiring and waking more also they poop and
they breathe and the externalities from that are mucking up future generations of ours and other
species house a home where we live anyways I'm digressing just to say that we have the technology
to create energy it's just the quality of it and the scalability of it is not what we have today
thank you Daniel seriously doing these in real time with you helps me understand my own story
better and I think we're working towards something important so thank you to be continued my friend
