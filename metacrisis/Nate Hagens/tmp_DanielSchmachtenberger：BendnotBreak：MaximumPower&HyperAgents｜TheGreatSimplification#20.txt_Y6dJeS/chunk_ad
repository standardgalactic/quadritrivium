not going to do it and if it's bad but we find a way to mitigate it then we'll do the mitigate
version so let's say i do that somebody else in the market doesn't do that they're just like
fuck it there's an opportunity i'm just going to sell the story that this opportunity is awesome
there's no downside risk we did risk mitigation but it was a total bullshit kind of version
they win the first mover advantage they get all the dollars they have socialized
the risk to the world they have privatized the gains themselves and as a result the game theory
and sense being focused on the opportunity and not the risk whoever focuses on the risk just
loses and has no power so all of these the market race which ends up being a race to the bottom
externality why is the arms race the tragedy of the commons are examples of multi-polar trap
where anybody doing the thing that is fucked up for the whole in the long term but provides game
theoretic advantage to them in the near term ends up causing races in the wrong direction humanity
has to solve for that thing categorically there are ways i believe of solving for a categorically
and we can talk about what some of those are and there are examples of where we've done it on local
scales we just haven't solved for it categorically now this is directly related to the dynamics of
the super organism with it you talk about it it's directly related to the obligate nature of the
plow right it's directly related to the maximum power principle so i just wanted to construct
a multi-polar trap we'll come back to that but you want to say something yeah well so what you're
saying is the hunter versus the guy with the plow and the obligate nature and the jevons paradox
rebound effect from the surplus generated by the plow i've been writing about how that applies
to our economic system and uh money and energy and uh co2 absorption by the biosphere in the oceans
but you're adding another layer to it which is saying the same dynamic applies to technology
especially exponentially soon to be ai-informed technology and spins off all these other
mini super organism volcanoes with x-risk attached to them because we're optimizing for opportunity
not risk we define up there there's a reason why it is intrinsically easier too and this is worth
noting there's a reason why it's intrinsically cognitively easier let alone game theoretically
easier pragmatically easier i'm going to build tech to solve a problem i'm going to have already
defined that problem in a pretty specific way and i'll have one or a small number of metrics that
are the success the the success metric of the opportunity right the problem solve or the
opportunity so the plow is going to increase the calories uh of surplus that i can generate per
person per year right like that's the metric of success that's pretty straightforward and i can
measure the plow versus the digging stick i can measure one plow versus another later i can measure
a tractor versus a plow and what i'm trying to optimize for is how much total caloric surplus
can be created per person or per acre or whatever it is right so the opportunity is measured in
or the upside is measured in one or a small number of known metrics the risk is going to happen
and it's a first order effect i'm directly causing that the tech is built to do a first
order effect on one or a small number of known metrics the tech is going to have second and
third and fourth order effects on a very large number of as of yet unknown metrics was where
the harm is going to occur so to do the risk reduction to prevent the externalities i've
got to think about not just what the result of using the plow to get calories out but using
that every season on topsoil erosion and what topsoil erosion then we'll do as a next order effect on
um the rivers because the roots aren't there anymore and what that'll do on the fisheries
and what it does to human minds and what that will be so now the externalities might be a million
metrics with nth order effects so it is easier it's intrinsically easier to optimize for opportunity
than it is to prevent against the risks well we well we don't have the surplus to do the research
even to optimize for all those risks there's so many people right now that are concerned about
global insect population the estimate is we're losing one to two percent of insect biomass
per year how the hell do we test that we can test little 10 acre plots here we don't have the
resources because that's not in our economics it's not that we don't have the resources it's
the multipolar trap doesn't orient those resources that way well that that's my question is how can
um all of the tech that is currently being built is in order to amass digital representations of
surplus and then this ties back to maximum power principle and evolution and ecology is that energy
is going to be used and and in nature so where is this uh opportunity here that we are just
naturally drawing down earth's energy battery 10 million times faster than it was sequestered
because we found it how could we not optimize for energy surplus which is our biological
tendency okay is that where you're going with with the what to do in the governance i have to
get back to why we use all these ex somatic calories and other animals don't to get into
the nature of the biological tendency of humans it is distinct but i want to define the maximum
power principle regarding markets um in a pure market system obviously we don't have pure market
systems there's regulation but let me just kind of try to define the idea of in as close to pure
market um type thing as we can think about uh so outside of regulation and enforcement
uh return on investment of capital will be in any area that provides return of investment
will be exploited there is a search function and an exploit function in the market will search
anywhere that capital can turn into more capital it will preference the higher returns but there
will still be um some appetite for returns of any kind and so if i get uh positive returns
i'm they're going to be exploited and so uh and we can say that in terms of capital but
we can say it in terms of energy too and to find the maximum power principle is wherever
there are positive energy return on energy investment so even if we start getting down to
that it takes most of a barrel of oil to get a new barrel of oil so long as it's i still get net
oil out of the process we're going to keep doing that thing if it is simply based on incentives
right because because of oil is so special yes but we wouldn't do the same for like corn ethanol
from an energy perspective obviously uh it takes some energy to get new energy so long
as i'm getting more energy out than the energy i'm putting in it makes sense to do it i'll always
seek the maximum energy return on energy investment but as the maximum decreases i'll continue to do
anything that gives me some energy return energy investment and that's also true with fiscal return
on fiscal investment and from a game theory point of view any player any agent in a game
theoretic situation is going to try to maximize their returns on agency i'm going to try to implement
my capacity to act to get more capacity to act so that's your optionality in a way and it's actually
very interesting one of the other papers we're writing right now a consensus project is on a
theory of hyperagents and the idea that of throughout history it's pretty obvious that
gangas cons and alexander the greats are different than most people right like they're
they're something in their motivational structure their psyche their capacities it's
pretty different than most people and they have a outsized influence on what happens to the world
and eight percent of men alive today have gangas cons work on the number is it's a very
interesting yeah something in that neighborhood where we try to look at the patterns of what's
happening in the world from a sociological perspective from patterns of kind of human
psyche and behavior in general uh we would kind of argue that there is a tiny percentage of people
at the top of the power law distribution who have a outsized effect on the world
and specifically then they create the topologies that everybody else operates in they create the
incentive deterrent landscapes and cultures and stuff that then ends up making everybody
else's values a lot what they are and these people are outside of the bell curves on most
of the psychological things that we assess sociologically as humans they are better at game
theory better at war generally more sociopathic highly more competitive you know those types of
things and one good way to think of it is that they are good at maximizing returns on agency
and so the hyper agent is someone who will implement agency to grow more agency
and a good hyper agent is someone who figures out how to do that at maximum scale
but are those people are is it is it exactly the same people that are the richest people in the
planet are not necessarily a major unit of agency it's not the only one so Kissinger had
way more global influence than he had personal money there was massive pools of money that he had
indirect influence over so how much money do i personally own versus how much do i have an assets
under management versus how much do i have an assets under indirect influence versus you know like
so um obviously like how much does how much money does Xi Jinping have personally versus
stewarding the GDP of China it's not how much he has personally it's how much it's how much total
agency he has influence over and there are different strategies for how to do that so those
people are optimizing they're optimizing agency and optionality and the money that they amass is
kind of an externality of that money is a unit of agency and optionality it's not the only unit
but it's a particularly interesting and important one and it's why like obviously before we had a
financial system with a global reserve fiat currency type thing the system emerged towards
towards better and better optionality right the financial system emerged towards that so
when we were just talking about agriculture the unit of currency might largely be just grains
right and being able to exchange grain for shoes or whatever it is or then we might start
getting into seashells or at a certain point gold coins or something that is some kind of represent
representation to mediate it a little bit easier and then the movement from some kind of mediated
barter with local currencies to being able to change the gold to paper units that are easier
to then be able to get rid of the gold to then be able to have a global reserve currency to you
know what that gives is increased and if you look at the current system with a global reserve
currency with kind of the OPEC backing petrodollar backing whatever you have this system of
relatively high stability with maximum optionality and it's usually hard to get both of those things
that are very stable like the value of real estate or whatever it's very low optionality
takes me a long time to sell it and the things that can move very fast oftentimes if I didn't
have a global financial system made to do this wouldn't have the same kind of stability so the
system was kind of engineered to maximize total market movement right and so if you think about
I think you and I talked about last time the military concept of the OODA observe
what's going on orient to that to make sense of what to do decide and then act and that the fastest
and most accurate OODA lubans of winning in game theoretic scenarios some kind of in a situation
where the world is changing rapidly long-term planning is not as good as very fast ability
to adapt and figure out what to do and so if I have a bunch of land and then all of a sudden the
world changes where I need energy or steel or computation or a military my ability to convert
that land to those things takes a while I got to sell that asset and find a way to sell it and
so if I have a lot of currency my currency gives me maximum speed right maximum optionality to get
gives you more options and so the thing that everybody wants the most is the thing that has
absolutely no intrinsic value but the maximum optionality for every source of value and yeah
of course there's this perverse thing that it says we will destroy sources of real value
to get the optionality value because I want to have more options than the next and there's
a multipolar trap right because if I don't maximize my returns on agency because I value
things so I'm going to put money into protecting the forest and not turning the forest into lumber
and then into capital if I don't maximize my returns on agency and someone else does they're
going to end up either beating me in war or influencing the world more than me so there's
a multipolar trap between hyperagents to maximize returns on agency and there's a rationalization
that even if it's because I think I'm the most ethical hyperagent I would be the best ruler
whatever it is I'm still obligated to get the maximum power to be able to do that and what is
considered a obligate game so how many hyperagents are there on the planet today roughly
who want to do maximum returns on agency there's plenty of people who are very power oriented they
just aren't equally good at it so there's plenty of people who are trying to climb the corporate
ladder and they're in middle management and they are hyperagents in their motivational complex it's
just how good at it they are it's not that much there's individual thugs who have nobody working
under them who are trying to maximize their agency so they might be a hyperagent motivationally
but their skill to do it is relatively low so if we're talking about a tier one hyperagent the
highest capacity ones they're not just motivated to do returns on agency they know how to do it at
scale which requires being able to understand how to navigate things like finance politics technology
culture human motivation you know how the things that can extend my agency in scaling dynamics and
depending upon how we define tier one there's not that many
so contrast that to the superorganism you have this small group of hyperagents that are maximizing
optionality tethered to digital representations dollars linked to energy and they're competing
with each other for more agency is that the driver of the superorganism or is the superorganism
driving them you're asking a bottom-up top-down causation question in a system that is recursive
and so there is a bottom-up dynamic which is individual people are motivated to do stuff
but then that creates larger systems and at this point now global systems that then
have their own embedded dynamics right like the embedded growth obligation on capital is not any
particular hyperagent it's then it's a global financial system that because of interest if
nothing else and there's a lot more on top of that but simply because of that structure
has to have an exponential growth curve and to stay bound to goods and services means you
have to have an exponential growth of materials economy blah blah blah but the that system creates
a top-down influence on all of the agents to do the bidding of that system and so you know you
produce the rather than people produce goods and services and then we figure out some way to index
and then make an amount of currency as you mentioned making up the money out of the not thin air but
the contract is basically saying let's put up put up the money to incent the growth of goods and
services to keep up with it so it doesn't debase itself but if you think about the money incentive
system okay so if i get money i get the optionality for anything i want that's pretty cool that means
that rather than have to figure out what somebody wants you just get to give them this unit of
choice making right and the money's just kind of like a unit of choice making for whatever the
fuck you want so now everybody wants the unit of choice making and the incentive of the decentralized
system is for everybody to figure out how to do the best job at converting their own life force
both labor and creativity into currency right that's the mode that's the kind of market motivation
and so it's my labor energy will give me a little bit not all that much my creativity
multiplied by that might give me a whole lot more and so there is a both search algorithm which is
all the humans in the world which was a smaller amount before but eight billion humans
incentivized to figure out new and better ways to make stuff that will correlate to capital
and then to exploit the fuck out of doing that and as soon as somebody figures out a new
a new thing that people hadn't figured out now there is a race for others to try to exploit
that space maximally once you get so somebody figures out early computation or whatever it is
now then everybody starts to race on that thing once that space gets flooded enough it creates
more incentive for search on new things when somebody figures it out and there's a race on
that thing I don't have a lot of money I would like more money but I'm not driven by it I'm
driven by discovery and friendship and conversations like this and doing meaningful things and so
I'm optimizing for a broader portfolio of results than the optionality for money having said that I
would dearly like more money in the bank for a rainy day in case I get sick or something happens
or I don't get funding you know etc but there is the capacity for humans to optimize things other
than the a single monetary representation of all our ancestral experience
the scientists philosophers artists spiritual teachers throughout history that we like the most
were mostly motivated like you said there's an intrinsic motivation that was not that much of
an extrinsic motivation like original theory of money partly was how do we mediate barter partly
was how do we incentivize people to do a bunch of shitty labor jobs that society needs that nobody's
intrinsic motivated to do so we need to extrinsically motivate them to do it because that is ultimately
more efficient and kinder than the state forcing them to do it the state could just take care of
everybody's needs and then force them to do it but we'll let the market force them instead of the
state and so that one of the core ideas of money was a system of extrinsic incentive because there's
a bunch of shit that needs to get done that nobody really wants to do but then of course
some people then take that extrinsic incentive and figure out how to just get very good at
getting lots of it not doing the labor stuff right so interestingly was Einstein money motivated
it does not seem so it seems like he was very intrinsically motivated to figure out the universe
