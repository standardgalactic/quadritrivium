increases in efficiency also grow the total material economy in a pure market system because
the market system is going to take returns wherever it can get them yes with a caveat globally because
there are countries that are decoupling materially not not absolutely decoupling but they're
relatively coupling like our country we are producing uh less or more GDP while using
not less energy but less than one for one and we've been we've been doing that for a while
but if you but you look at the average american consumes 57 barrel of oil equivalents of coal
oil and natural gas of three main fossil fuels per year but we consume another 17 barrel of oil
equivalents in stuff we buy from china and Bangladesh etc because we've outsourced our
means of production uh overseas so globally what you just said is correct but there are countries
who can material decouple but i do not believe that the whole world can material decouple
just restate what you said in another way individual country metrics on things that
involve global supply chains are just always gibberish um they're basically always some
kind of greenwashing gibberish and i think we got into this uh last time but in case we didn't
i'll recap quickly um it's very easy to export your shitty thing somewhere else um and then you
know import like i i can import stuff from a country that has slave labor i don't have slave labor i
can have a very good genie coefficient in my country but i'm my country depends upon stuff that
depends upon slave labor so what does my genie coefficient really mean it just means that
the really fucked up genie coefficient i externalized somewhere else and so um to me that's just
called cooking it means your genie coefficient has narrow boundaries yeah so whether it's my genie
coefficient or my um jewels two dollars ratio if i'm externalizing the shitty metric somewhere
else but it's still on a closed biosphere and what we're talking about is limits of the biosphere
all we're doing is cooking the books right like this is just basically bad accounting
and and cooking the planet um india just announced today their their coal uh consumption is up 29
percent i'm not laughing at cooking the planet i'm laughing at the pun that just naturally emerged
there um but yes well it's it's um it's it's horribly tragic um crying is probably more
appropriate than laughing but in order to maintain the the increased air conditioning
because of the the massive heat in india and pakistan they have to burn more coal
so that is a positive feedback uh that is just it's profound yeah um you know i i first came
across this there's a there's indian man who explained the situation to me in a particular way
that um i hadn't thought about quite like this before he's said look climate change is not going
to hit the world uh evenly to begin with it's going to hit certain areas much worse the places
that have air conditioners and um good aquifers with you know running water and those types of
things are obviously going to do better um the places where you have high population multiplied
by high population density um and that are already in hot areas the you know extreme weather events
are going to hit a lot worse so he's like india is really going to get screwed well before europe
and the us are but it's because europe and the us have air conditioners that they built with
and his number was something like 50 trillion dollars of extraction during british rule of
resources us i mean current equivalents from india and to be able to build that which was both the
use of all the um hydrocarbons that got us to this climate change position plus also what protects
them from it but what also keeps them from having the resources to be able to deal with it themselves
and then say pull yourself up by your bootstraps to another country and that put him into a kind of like
ecoterrorist point of view of like what choice other than taking the west out do we have is this
not a genocide of negligence and it's like fuck that's not a invalid perspective right uh
genocide of negligence is a is a is a thing we can actually look at and a lot of people when
they think about climate change think about like systemic venusification of the planet
but well before you get to systemic venusification which might never happen depending upon the model
getting the 50 celsius heat waves over the next few years in places like india and bangladesh and
pakistan that have high populations with high population densities with low groundwater with
low food resources uh that can lead to crop failures like the new gay resource wars those
resource wars can scale to global wars there's a war over resource in northern india turned into a
cleaving on you know hindu muslim lines is that becoming india pakistan war there's a lot of places
where things like this come so this is again a global issue you can't take it as a local issue
even if you were sociopathic and only cared about your country these things escalate to global issues
very quickly and the timeline on stuff like that totally totally this year could be next year could
be we can't guarantee because it's a complex system where you can't forecast well but it's
it doesn't take venusification timelines for those things to occur
no and the only thing i would add there is even wider boundaries is the genocide of the oceans
and the complex self-aware life in the oceans where 93 percent of the heat generated so far
has been absorbed by the oceans because they can absorb it but but they're there too is a limit
so i think personally climate change is the largest risk for our species and civilization
by two orders of magnitude having said that i don't think it's in the top 10 in the next 10 years
of the the various risks that we face so just to you know come out of the closet on that i care
the most about future ecosystems other species long after i won't be on this planet but i think we
have like in your language the governance and regulation and and the the the inner beating
heart of the superorganism that is where we have to work and come up with solutions
because there's lots of other things the the financial recalibration the nuclear war risks
a lot of the other things you talk about crisper and ai and polarization and all that
just to continue on your tangent for a moment and then we get back you're mentioning caring about
the complex life in the oceans and obviously the the rest of the non-human life that we have been
genociding or displacing this is why our mutual friend aza raskin who co-founded the center for
humane technology has taken a good chunk of his time off that to do the earth species project and
i just kind of want to mention it because whether it succeeds in its goal really soon or not just
even thinking about it is very interesting and cool they're using ai's most cutting edge i mean
google's ai cutting edge translation software to translate between languages to try to translate
animal languages with the idea that if we could actually listen to the whales and what they had
to say in the dolphins and understand the depth of their sentience it might be a wake-up call
and uh yeah i think that's a cool project that if they succeed in translating other
species languages and figuring out how bonobos or starlings or whales talk to each other
my biggest worry there is that humans en masse will just shrug and say no big deal where you know
my my core belief here is we need a new sacred standard religion and economic growth for everyone
have kind of been our our goals our aspirations and at the end of the day
my belief is the sacredness of the natural world that we inhabit and share with 10 million other
species that is what really matters at the end of the day but now we're getting way off tangent
actually this is about to tie us right back into where we're going through another tangent
but i see the loop back so indulge me okay um your concern is that even recognizing the much
greater consciousness sentience of other species that we can't currently talk to wouldn't change
because values are the change in values isn't going to change behavior in an economic system
that is incenting behavior in a direction that follows this embedded growth obligation to convert
the entire natural world into currency so obviously values can influence our behavior economics can
influence our behavior the other key thing is that technology directly influences our behavior
and there's a coupling between these we've talked about the way um Marvin Harris models these three
in terms of uh civilizations being made of infrastructure social structure and superstructure
the social structure is kind of the social agreement field the law of governance in particular
and the institutions that mediate how do we do our social agreements the infrastructure is the
tech stack that that rides on the modes of production agriculture energy waste management
all that kind of stuff and the superstructure is the what is the definition of the good life
what are our ethics what is the basis of the jurisprudence of law and so that can be religion
nationalism all those types of things and so um different social theorists will argue which of
these is most fundamental we i would argue that these three are co-informing we can show call
little loops where each one can inform the others um a lot of what we're you know obviously the
goal that aza has is can we make a play in superstructure can we make a play in the understanding
and human values that would have a somehow bind our economic incentive on our use of technology
and economics and the technology are related because obviously you can't
venusify the planet with stone age tech right you can't blow the planet up with stone age tech
it's um all of our catastrophic risks are mediated by tech because otherwise we're not
powerful enough to do shit at that scale and but obviously our tech and the incentive structure
to grow it use it in particular ways and the laws on binding those ways the relationship of all that
kind of goes together but just to give an example because so many people there's a paper
we're writing a consensus project that'll be published probably by the time this comes out on
why tech is not values neutral um a lot of people have this weird kind of conception that technology
is just values neutral i can use a hammer to build a house for the homeless or i can use it as a
weapon but there's no value embedded value system embedded in the hammer it's just the value system
the person that chooses to use it and that would be the same with everything in our industrial
supply chain and um they either have that view or some people have the view that tech is fundamentally
values positive that's kind of the general um Hobbesian pinker and you know gatesy and kind of
view of the dialectic of progress that tech only gets selected for and the market only up regulates
it if it's solving some real problem that people want and they're willing to pay for so of course
it is inherently liberating humans from problems that allows them to expand and so it's fundamentally
net positive um then there are the lewis mumford's and everyone who have critiqued why that's not
true and many people then can go in a ludic direction of like no tech actually messes up
religions and societies and ecosystems and so tech is fundamentally net negative to our value
systems i would say we're arguing this paper all three of those are naive tech is values affective
it affects it in a complex set of positive and negative ways and very much in the same way that
tech will produce some positive thing in the physical world but also externalize some negative
things it doesn't have one affected as a complex set of effects and we need to factor the positive
and negative externalities in addition to the thing it was supposed to do and factor that into
design that's also true in the psychological space i want to get into where i was going with that but
did you want to say something neat i did i want to i want to add something and then ask you a
question um you're saying that from a tech standpoint i would say that we would not be
able to venus venusify the planet without fossil hydrocarbons because my friend steve keen says that
um that's what i would call industrial tech body well a body without energy is a corpse and
technology without energy is a sculpture and so our cities without energy are a museum de facto so
my question to you is is energy values neutral no and we'll get to that but let me come back
to the tech thing there obviously without in internal combustion engines oil is not worth
all that much um obviously without uh in electricity in an electrical grid we don't
fucking need all that so basically the energy is driving tech tech is also without oil drilling
which is tech you don't get the oil without oil refining which is tech yeah there's a there's a
positive feedback and there in in my earth they talk i refer to it as the economic trinity that
information energy and materials are bound and they yes all three to go forward we're gonna go
into that but let me finish this loop because it's where there's it connects back to the binding of
these and why a good example of why tech's not values neutral and your other friends other
than humans on the planet um so tech allows us to exploit energy in different ways like our ability
to drill and refine oil and then use it to run tech that requires energy and obviously energy
gives us the ability to develop new techs and you get this positive feedback in that and so oil was
this massive increase in our ability to use energy before that the last massive increase you might
argue was agriculture and the ability to uh make a huge amount more caloric surplus per acre with
grains and with that particular one obviously baskets were a part of it and a number of things
but the plow was a huge part of it because the plow moving from kind of the digging stick and um to
ox drawn plow the caloric surplus skyrocketed and with it obviously population did and then
oil was the next big one and it was way bigger right um but uh when we look at the plow this is
a classic example of kind of the way tech is not values neutral and related to values on animals
you following the plow many kind of historians have argued that following the plow animism died
everywhere and animism was near universal before that most all the kind of in wait I didn't know that
what most all of the development of the plow for oxes animist religions fell out of
I first came across this in sex ecology and spirit by Wilbur and I've heard a number of
there's obviously the historians have deep detailed arguments on it but I'll give the kind of general
just an argument is that the you can be a hunter and kill a buffalo while still being animistic
you can pray to the spirit of a buffalo you can take no more buffalo than you need and use it all
well you can cry when you um kill it and then say you know I'm eating you we're going to get
buried when we die and become grass that your great grandchildren will eat and we're part of
this great cycle of life so I can let an animal have a free and sovereign life and be a predator
and be part of that and still kind of be animistic but I can't yoke a buffalo I can't breed it into
an ox yoke it cut its testicles off bind its horns and beat it all day long and be animistic
and still respect the spirit of the buffalo um I have to say it's a dumb fucking ox it's here for
us man's dominion over and change the memetics to do it and um so the key insight here is that the
plow using the plow the plow existing actually wait I want to construct this very specifically
the first part is that tech that is highly advantageous to use is obligate you don't get to
not use it and make it through history and so somebody else will use the plow they'll grow
their population because of the massive caloric increase they'll make it through the famines if
we don't then our tribe will get killed by them and or die in the famine so even if I don't want
to I have to and if I don't I don't make it through history so very adaptive tech is obligate
that's principle one principle two is that it codes a pattern of human behavior now rather than
being a hunter or gatherer I'm beating up ox all day right um and I'm uh branding it and binding
its nose and whatever else I have to do because it codes a pattern of human behavior it codes a
pattern of values and human psyche and then to do that in scale means it codes a culture and so
animism was universal in South America North America Africa Europe whatever is pretty universal
and animism died following the the ox driven plow almost everywhere because you can't be animistic
and be an animal all day long and so kind of some version of men's dominion over type ideologies
emerged following it and so to get that that piece of tech changed the value systems from
all life is sentient we're not the web of life we're merely a strand in it whatever we do to the
web we do to ourselves to man's dominion over it's all here for us you know that kind of thing
that was the result of a value system embedded in the technology itself inexorably embedded not
based on how people used it but embedded in it and then some historians go on to argue that
not only did the plow do that regarding animism it also went from where previous to the plow
societies and david graver's new book adds a lot of nuance i'm at i'm doing like a hundred
thousand foot view but that whether women were gathering and then we're hunting or women were
doing horticulture and then we're hunting women could still provide half the food stuffs men had
to do the plow because women would miscarry men's upper body strength mattered so now men provided
the meat stuff and the vegetative stuff women moved in the house as a result you also moved
from a distribution of male and female gods to mostly male gods so the thing that is called
patriarchy often is often attributed as a rising as a byproduct of the plow also in the movement
from all the food that gives life being male derived rather than female because again of the
physicality involved in the nature of the plow then of course that gives you surplus and before
that you didn't have surplus so you have these you didn't have private property ownership you
have these different kinds of sharing systems now with much more surplus you could grow the
population a lot faster now you got larger than done by a number kind of empires now you got
radical wealth inequality and class systems so we're like are there arguments about why that
ended up requiring more formal institutionalization of marriage on larger scale because now I own
stuff that I could pass on to my kids when I died so I wanted more paternity certainty so everything
from like institutionalization of marriage to views towards animals to to patriarchy versus
