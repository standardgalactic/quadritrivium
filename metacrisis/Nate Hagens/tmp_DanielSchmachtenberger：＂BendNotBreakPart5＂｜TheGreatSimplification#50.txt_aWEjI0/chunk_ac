Coral and oceans you're just wrong because when they die watch what happens to your life
Right, if you don't think you care about fluorinated surfactants passing planetary boundaries or
nuclear issues you're wrong like you do care about those
And so whatever you're focused on
You still don't want to harm shit that your life depends upon and that all the things that you care about depends upon
So you have to make sure that your choice-making architectures are not so narrow that you can't actually think
About what you're doing in context of everything else
You don't have to be trying to solve everything
But you do have to ensure that what you're doing here is considerate enough of the other areas that you're not causing
Externality there. That's a first general principle
And how do you do that?
Great, how does someone listening to this do that?
I want to come back to that
I want to say one thing first, but the how do we avoid externalities one of the best topics we can do for solution thinking
But what I wanted to say briefly first was just about you
Yes, of course, someone can do extended analysis and never act and as a result
Not be that effective and or even just hold delusions for a long time because they don't test them in the world and realize
Empirically it was wrong or whatever of course
I don't think that's your case at all. I like I want to just kind of acknowledge. I don't think you think it is
That there's so much importance in the climate change movement. There's so many brilliant scientists
associated with so many
climate research projects
And yet the overall narrative is very focused on mostly co2
a little bit methane and you know greenhouse gases as a whole and temperature rising as a result of this and
And the fact that that co2 is largely being produced by the burning of hydrocarbons
That is also completely attached to the growth of GDP that is also
Going to not be able to keep happening forever that portends a gazillion other fucking things
It's a critical part of that whole story your extended analysis being able to emphasize that and now
Being able to tie that into all the other areas in this podcast. I think is adding something
More valuable the world than if you had been on the front line doing climate change work your whole life
So I just want to thank you
I mean
I agree and the decide and act is I decided we need orders of magnitude more people thinking in systems
and caring with uh empathy and reason
And joining this conversation that was my decision and the podcast and my other work is that action
So thank you for clarifying that I kind of was
you know
self-deprecating that I do
observe and orient a lot
uh, and you know learning from you and tristan and
Learning from other people about geopolitics and nuclear risks. I mean, I'm I'm still observing and orienting the world that we live in it is
Fascinatingly complex and fraught with risk
Okay, getting back. Where were we?
Some degree the udda loop is not supposed to just live in an individual. It's supposed to live in networks of people that are coordinating
because
You should have a
soil scientist who is continuously
learning more about
how to
uh, effectively grow soil and what healthy soil is and you should have farmers that are taking that info and applying it in very practical ways
And they're not doing an equal amount of observing and orienting versus deciding and acting so
another principle that I would
share is
When you can't think about the whole problem set of the world and then think about you
As if you for any individual are going to be able to act in some way sufficient to the whole thing
You should care about the whole thing
but then you should care about
Lots of people's activity and service of that
And so how do you relate in network?
You know with everyone else and there will be some people who are much more like look
I can do shit tell me what to do. I can execute and there'll be people who are like
I am don't know how to politically execute. I don't have good interpersonal skills. I'm great researcher
In which case it's like this is what I mean about typologies. Great figure out where you
Where you actually can work your ass off all the time because you're
You're in live into by it. You enjoy it
So you can really excel and develop novel capacities and be in partnership with other people of different capabilities
But the default of the exponential tech the exponential energy use and the metabolism of our system
Has self-organized those typologies in the service of optimizing dollars or financial markers as our objective
So the typologies have all been structured in a way
That is not helpful to the future that we face. And so those typologies have to
Switch into maybe a different objective or parallel objective
Yeah, I mean we talked about this in number two. I think is that
Money equals optionality to do lots of things so
Money is a decentralized incentive system to incentivize people to figure out how to get better at making it and
which means novelty search and optimization do a better job of whatever you already figured out how to do
and
Obviously you can make money via production, but also extraction. You can make money via value adding but also externalization of cost and
So when we're talking about organizing towards these other purposes right towards a
Fundamentally different master. You might still have to figure out how to pay your bills
But it's not what is motivating you still you will need to be in coordination with other people who are similarly motivated to you
But have different capacities
Now can we come back to externalities how to avoid externalities?
okay, this
this is um
I think there's a couple topics that I want to mention before we get into the three by three
so
One is how to avoid
Externalities causing worse causing other problems in the process of trying to solve problem
The other is how to avoid feeling that the thing that you're doing is important enough the other enough passion over it that you don't
Under emphasize how important many other things are
um
In both of these speak to a kind of holisticness of consideration. So first on externality
I'm not going to give the examples of how
Trying to solve one problem causes others because we did that already in the conversation
So go listen to it, but it is almost everything
um
It's so easy to say we can bring electricity to these people by burning more coal or making a hydroelectric dam that will extinct all these
Species in this area um on the river or blah blah blah whatever it is
Now i'm not going to say there is no such thing as trade-offs. It is a childish view to pretend there are no trade-offs
What i'm saying is if you don't care about all the things if you haven't monitored all the things that are involved and care about them
All you will make unnecessarily bad trade-offs
And in the process you will also polarize the people that care about those things
So of course it is mature to realize there will be some trade-offs
But at least consciously look at and care about all of them and come up with the best synergistic
Satisfiers you can the thing that serves all the things that matter as best as possible
So on the topic of externalities, how do you
uh
How do you think through
Actually, I just wrote up a list of questions
That I think help people think through how to understand a problem space and how to understand a solution space
I'll send it to you as a document so you can include it in the show notes for this
But probably the externalities asks questions like if you're looking at a problem, whether it's
health care in my town or you know, too many hydrogenic deaths at my hospital or why there are so many
uh
So much soil erosion in this area or so much government corruption or whatever it is
um
In the assessment there are questions that are universally relevant like where in the system are their perverse incentives
Just see if we start to map where anyone has a financial incentive or a status incentive or a
Cover your ass incentive that is not aligned with doing the maximally good thing to the whole in honesty
Just by starting to notice that
And not in a partisan way right in the bipartisan all directions way you'll start to be like, oh
Well, of course this thing isn't going well because they're are these perverse incentives
um
Where is the biggest perverse incentive of all is
Profits as our cultural goal, which means I can buy this iphone
for 400 500 dollars, but if you included the external costs
It would be five thousand dollars and a lot more people wouldn't be able to afford it
so the fact that
the
externalization of cost to
The environment and poor people
Is what allows the market to exist and that if we actually had to do the accounting and pay all of the cost
So that we weren't stealing from anyone's balance sheet that the market wouldn't exist
and that um
Not a single would look radically different. I'm not sure it wouldn't exist but go on
It wouldn't exist as it does right like it not any area as they exist currently would be profitable
Everything would have to get restructured in some very deep ways
um
I think any anyone who's ever become a like artisan craft person and made
Stuff and then things about how cheap factory stuff is like god damn how like shut stuff should not be that cheap
Like it should we should have much less things that are much more expensive and much more oriented to reuse and durability
um
So yes, that is one of the very deep perverse incentives
But that means for any particular problem you're looking at look at within your area where there are fiscal perverse incentives
that particularly go against the problem you're trying to solve because those are that's where the opposition is going to come and
Then you can start to think through
Can we use law to bind this can we use collective value system and a
Cultural forcing function to bind this can we use a different profit motive and make them a healthier profit motive?
Where people are willing to pay for a more expensive thing because it's better, you know
So being able to say the humans that are doing the thing have some
Motivators can we look at the human motivators across the system and align them with the thing we're trying to do better?
That's just a question that it's very good for people to get good at thinking through
Another one is someone is thinking about a problem
And you think through what are all the problems upstream from this problem?
So they contribute to it. Let's say we're dealing with a
factory farm issue. Well people's value systems
And not caring about animals enough is one language and sanitizing and calling it
beef or pork rather than cows or animals
The invisibility is part of the problem putting it far away where nobody can see it
As opposed to having to actually interact with it. It's part of the problem
The financial incentives are part of the problem the and so if your solution
Whatever the solution is there's one thing but it doesn't address many of those things those things are still going to show up somehow
Right like the classic example I give of when the poachers couldn't poach the elephant, but they were still poor
You still had a macro economy that created poverty. They were in poverty
They were still a black market on animal products
They just moved to hunting other animals that were more endangered
If you don't want to protect the elephant and kill the rhino
Then or have the rhino get killed because those poachers have to move you have to deal with the poverty upstream
You have to deal with the mindset towards animals. You have to deal with the mindset of the people buying the product. So
um
That might not be something you can immediately execute on but you have to know that whatever solution
I'm doing right now is a partial solution. It's not a full solution
And if I don't work towards a full solution, I might just displace that problem
So if someone can do an analysis of here's a problem. What are all the things upstream from it?
And can I factor how to work on all of them? That's one
question
I have
More but you're about to say something on that one
Well, I was just going to say that since we started this series
One of the language changes that I've incorporated is I no longer talk about solutions
I talk about responses and there's a million responses rather than a discrete solution
So just minor clarification, but but keep going
Keep going although. I fear there may be episode six daniels three by three grid and episode five is the preface to daniels three by three grid
but keep going
Richard Haas that
Head over at cfr writes out the difference between problems and predicaments and solutions versus management
and that's a good framework that
problem, I know of his work. I've not read that
The problem is
Discretely frameable and admits a complete solution
Predicament doesn't admit a complete solution. It admits ongoing management because there will be conflicting forces or conflicting trade-offs or whatever
Um, so yeah, even just the reductive thinking about a solution as if it's a static thing
And then it's done in a situation that is very complex
Is itself not thinking adequately. So yes
Um, so you think about so here's a problem or your predicament the situation you're wanting to improve
You think about all the stuff upstream. You also want to think about all the things downstream if I
Whatever solution that I'm looking at doing will have effects other than just a few intended ones
This is the one of the key insights is that when we cause when we generate a solution
Whether it's a new piece of tech that will solve the problem or a new law or a new business or a new
movement
