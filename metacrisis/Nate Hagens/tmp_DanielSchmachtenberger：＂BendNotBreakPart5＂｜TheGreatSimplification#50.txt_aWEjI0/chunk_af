Anything that has to do with trying to win the minds and hearts of people right like how do we
um get people to really care about the climate change the
mask wearing the vaccine the whatever the thing is
um
typically we and
particularly
recently
egregiously we focus on
Who are intended audiences and how to be able to get?
Uh a political effect from that intended audience and we don't focus that much on how the people that will not agree with this respond
And there are many reasons for this in the u.s. Which has such an outsized media influence on much of the rest of the world
um
The nature of a bipartisan political situation and not having something like ranked choice voting
is
such that
Uh putting the other candidate down is actually and saying how bad they are and it'll be catastrophic if they get in is
Is actually a very empirically effective way to get people to vote or at least it has been
um
but of course
That other side then does the same thing if one side figured out a really effective communication strategy
The other side makes some innovations comes back. So one side gets in and they
Do whatever they do for four years the other side comes in and then undoes all that for four years
And most of the energy of the whole system just goes to inviting waste heat and no long-term continuity
so
what we're
We have to stop that shit that is so critical
So one thing for anyone who's developing solutions
That involve communication that involve any kind of public perception is to think about
Who's my intended audience awesome?
You know, what do I want them to understand and maybe do?
But who is not my intended audience and who's going to not like this message?
And what are they going to do? And am I radicalizing them? Am I polarizing them? Am I making them feel
Like what they care about is going to be attacked where they're more likely to become terrorists and you know, or more likely to whatever
That's an effect. That's an externality of my choice
I might have made a choice that seemed like
Coalescing these people to do this thing was good
But I actually just upregulated extremism or terrorism or total polarization in a critical audience and so
um one
Very simple, but this gets back to your example though that if you can get rich or elected from doing that
And you have made extremes of your enemies who cares as long as you win is the current logic
Yes, and so what I'm saying is if your politician is doing that and you actually care about the world more largely
They are the wrong
They have the wrong logic. That's not the thing to support
And if you are working to do
A non-profit thing or whatever and there's a media campaign involved. Don't do that thing. So of course
the world is where it is because
The things we're talking about are not widely practiced understood or implemented. There is a huge amount of
On either political side
correct and
um
But since you cannot actually kick the other half of the world off the planet and since they aren't just
Inert pieces of wood they do they are smart people with goals and values. They're political actors and
If if they if what you say anti resonates with them and they get up regulated to do a bunch of action
So it's true that when you villainize somebody else
You can coalesce a bunch of people against them and you can actually have moral people be willing to celebrate causing harm to others
That's very effective politically. It's it also happens to be evil
Um calling women witches allowed seemingly moral people to burn them to death right and calling somebody
terrorists or whatever
I don't think we've evolved that much from the burning witches era
I I wish people understood like the
The lynching was not long ago
right the lynching as like a
form of entertainment was not long ago the burning witches that
the
concentration camps of world war two the I mean there still should like that happening today. So how quickly
you know when you when you look at
the pictures of women wearing
Many skirts in 1968 and Iran and you know then the
The thing that happened in the Ayatollah and then the burkas when you look at how it well relatively advanced Liberia was and then the
Internal war and then child soldiers replacing what had been a economically prosperous area when you look at Syria recently
like
If you when you look at Ukraine you can have an area that seems peaceful and economically prosperous progressive and liberal
And it collapses and turns into war violence extremism
You know, etc. It goes from any skirts to burkas to whatever and so
Those are canaries in a coal mine of something that is possible for anywhere in the world people should in recognition of that
Not take for granted this the stability of where they are and not taking for granted or to protect it
That's the purpose of our work. I totally agree
keep going
so
you the making
They are anti-vaxxers is another word for witch
or terrorist
right
Or on the other side, they're sheeple or their
Lib tards or whatever it is like both sides have their terms to dehumanize
This might be politically expedient it is definitely moving us towards planetary extinction as a whole
Stop this if you are doing that thing, you are definitely not part of the long-term solution
You are orienting a short-term narrow thing at the expense of increasing enmity polarization, etc
So this is a place where the externality is psychosocial
So one thing I want to think about
Is who cares about this issue and then who cares about another issue that feels threatened by this that's in theory of trade-offs
What do they care about? How do I come up with a solution that could get more
Broad support and less enmity. It's just a more effective strategy also unless I don't care that the thing
I work real hard for gets undone in four years
But there are no groups of people that feel really good about being villainized and it will just sit
Comfortably and let the thing that villainize them continue to succeed
so
That's one example of a psychosocial externality, which is where you are
Trying to create fervency of belief in some population
Without really paying attention to what you're doing in that process through another part of the population
At year end 22
Daniel the externalities in our world are legion
both physical and psychosocial
and you know that philosophically and
Emotionally, I completely agree with what you're saying
But we are a tiny tiny tiny fraction of
The intellectual discourse on the web and the people that are listening to you right now
um, of course they agree with the sentiment of what you're advocating, but
The reality is this energy hungry super organism with the tragedy of the commons and exponential everything
That is what are the lever points to start to change
If you buy into what you're advocating, which I certainly do
You and I know that uh
The super organism, you know, there's
70 to 100 trillion dollars that trades hands every day that pretty much every one of those dollars has some externality associated with it
That's a that's a problem
and there's a exponential embedded growth obligation on it, which means exponential future externalities that are attached to the thing
and hitting the fragility
points of planetary boundaries like
What we're up against is a big thing and not only are people not educated to think and feel and care and
understand holistically
And like that
But they are continuously engaged in a media environment that will do everything that it can to capture them in a partisan political
outraged whatever kind of way
And they will actually use ai split testing to figure out what shit
Does that the most effectively in terms of what will show up in their news feed?
so the fact that we are
Dealing with some big issues here is obvious, right?
Like the the cards are kind of stacked in a in a rough direction
um
that now
What is the what is the thing we need the most of I think people that are oriented
I think everything we've been talking about today
People who are oriented with a very high touch like I actually care about sentient beings and want their life to be good
And I'm not just interested in talking about topics that have
power associated. I'm not interested in just virtue signalings
green something because
Make money in a fun that way. I'm like
It grounds in mirror neurons, right? It grounds and I know what suffering feels like I see it there
I want to solve it and I want to prevent it
People who are oriented that way who then also start learning how to be able to think at scale well
Which means that it has to implement large numbers of
people and technology and you know things in culture and the political economy and in tech, right?
and that
simultaneously think through these frameworks of how do I
Not jump to certainty in action too quickly but make sure I actually understand the problem landscape
The many things that are causing it the things that are downstream the people who care about something else
And how do I come up with not a solution but a series of solutions?
That actually addresses this and progressively gets more people on board
People that are capacitated this way is the rate limiting factor right now as far as I can see it
There are people who care but have very poor strategy the people who understand strategy well are mostly serving very narrow aims
so people who are kind of
Developed in these skill sets and this is why I'm excited to be talking about this with you here
This is why we're working on in a training modules and an academy to be able to do this like etc
So in the three by three grid
Culture political economy tech stack
triage meaning urgent near-term
transition and long-term
Education slash systems thinking is in all nine quadrants all nine boxes
yeah
So I'll say something else. I said there was one other thing and it relates to this that I was going to say up front
So one is how do you understand?
How to think about a solution in a way that will
Prevent unintended consequences, um, and that will be better said to to deal with in Manitzen
The other thing I said I wanted to talk about was that people can get
Uh
Fundamentalist about their particular solution
Because if you're working on something you should really care about it, but in really caring about it you can
Become overly narrowly focused. So when I was first starting to try to wrap my head around like
What is upstream from all of these various problems or what are the underlying causes that everything from
Nuclear war to environmental degradation to animal rights issues to class issues. What do these things have in common?
What do not a specific solution for one thing but a solution for civilization doing better look like?
I of course read the work of people and also had the fortune to talk to a lot of people that it's been their life thinking
about these things and work on them
and would ask their analysis and
I got so many answers that sounded like this
You know at
the end of the day
Whenever somebody uses a phrase like that at the end of the day or the key is you can usually expect a reductionist thing to come next
Um, not always but you like, you know, sometimes you want to pay attention to that at the end of the day
Uh
Really the thing we have to shift is the economy because perverse economic incentive is under the whole thing
There's no way that as long as you have a for-profit military industrial complex
Is the largest block of a global economy that you could ever have peace. There's a anti-incentive on it as long as
There's so much money to be made with mining, etc
Like we have to fix the nature of economic incentive and I'd be nodding. I'm like this makes perfect sense, right?
And then somebody else would be like
you know, the core of the thing that we have to address is
education because
You can have so much change occur in a generation if those children are growing up
Different as as different as it is learning Chinese is your first language versus learning English
We're so neuro plastic by the time we're adults. We're not that neuro plastic. We're kind of screwed if you get education, right?
We want adults who care about the animals and the oceans and
Can tend to all of these things and can think complexly if we really get education, right?
We'll be able to solve everything it's upstream from all that and like I'm nodding
I'm like, oh, yeah, this is it and then somebody else would be like no really the thing is it's about media because
We're continuously being bombarded and that was before social media then it was social media
We're being continuously bombarded and we are ready to go do a capital riot or a george floyd protester riot
Or or whatever it is based on the stuff that's coming in
If we could change the media environment of what people were in taking
It would change all of these things and someone else like none of the thing is really at the end of the day
