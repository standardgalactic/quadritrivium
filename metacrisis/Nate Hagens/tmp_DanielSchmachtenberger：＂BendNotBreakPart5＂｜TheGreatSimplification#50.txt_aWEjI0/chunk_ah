Grow your own self and your own capacity to be in service of the world and you can't be growing your
Service to the existing world maximally at the same time. This is the two masters thing and you've got to decide which master
You actually in service of
And then you want to be actually doing good work
You don't just want to be doing meditation and psychotherapy and study
Because one there's a lot that you only learn by doing stuff and you want your life to be
Meaningful now and increasing your capacity for greater meaningfulness over time
Um
And so as much as to the whole existential risk landscape
It might not make sense to go be at the animal shelter or go helping with this frontline work
If some of your life isn't doing that you're missing something
So the other thing I would say to young people is in addition to your own private study and your formal education
The thing that will help the most is find mentors that are doing work
That is most like the work you want to do and figure out what they need that you can become useful for
This was the thing I'm most grateful for in my own education was I had amazing mentors
And I just figured out
That they needed diapers changed or they needed construction or they needed whatever the hell it was and I just figured out
How to learn how to do the things they needed so I could be around
Because you learn so much like, you know, if you get to go work with Nate
and when he goes to dc and is talking with people about
financial strategies for the energy grid or things like that
You'll learn a lot about what actually happens in those rooms and how to think about it
Whatever that you just can't learn in college or online
so um
But if someone knows how to do the things that you're interested in they are too busy so figure out what you can offer
That they need
Because then you'll be gaining the capacity to become more of what you want to be
These are a few pieces of rice for younger people at offer
Yeah, the two bottlenecks there one you mentioned well
there
We're in the liminal space between in my opinion a
Growth on fumes world and a post growth world
There's a lot of people big de growth movement advocating for a smaller economy
I think de growth is what we should do
But post growth is what we're going to have to do and I just don't think there's a lot of
Mentor like people out there in the post growth space because
Our current master especially as things get more monetarily and civically stressful
Is we got to pay the bills so I know you're not trying to speak to everyone
um, and
I think it's excellent excellent advice, but there aren't a lot of people
Living and focusing on the projects that we're going to need in the next 10 or 20 years
As potential mentors out there there are some for sure
This is why the podcast is so cool as a format is it
It allows people that you might not be able to access as a mentor one-on-one for you to be able to get some
Meaningful chunk of what they have to share which is amazing
but
No, there are people who are
Like it may be that the capacities you want don't live in any one person, right? It may be that you really want to
protect the congo and that's going to require some
Amazing political strategy capability, but also some environmental knowledge and some cultural knowledge
So it may be that there are some
environmentalists that understand the
Biodiversity risks associated with the congo whatever well and you need to study with them for a while to know that
But there's also some just really effective political operators that are not working on that at all
But where you get to learn how to effectively get shit done
Um in political systems and you go study with them
figuring out
how to
Be in proximity of the people that have capabilities you're wanting to develop
Is the fastest way to develop those capabilities
Okay, getting to our three by three grid. I think some of the things you've been
Speaking to the last 30 minutes or so
Populate many of the boxes in this grid. Um, how how would you like to approach this?
So when I talk about triage transition and
and long-term
Adequate solutions sufficient solutions
Um
These are horizons of focus
Uh, there's lots of management theories to talk about something like this, but I'll tell you how I think about it
triage basically means
that there is some
problem and particularly some catastrophic risk
that
Has a non-nel likelihood
Over, you know in the near term. I'm mostly not focused on things like the sun blowing out someday. I'm focused on pretty, you know things
within a
within the years to decades time frame
um
and
there's some
problem like that
That it does not seem the world has an adequate set of solutions already in place for so more needs done
And probably needs done fairly quickly through whatever means necessary to avoid that
When I say whatever means necessary, I mean not necessarily
total systemic solutions, but more just like direct implementation. So if we are looking at
something like
the risks associated with the speed of growth of synthetic biology
and
and
You know a direction of lots of viral hunting and gain of function research in
leaky laboratories with publishing of those gene sequences
That's just super super super risky
So things should be done to stop that that involve mostly
Uh some scientific work that says okay, let's not do these things. The benefit is not worth the risk
and
Instead let's do these things for
zoonotic pandemic
You know spillover prevention and these things regarding
information sharing and lab security and whatever and then there's like
Legal work to do right like legal work to get a couple of the main countries to do and then maybe you know
The who to do something the g20 to do something that is adequate
That's a triage type thing. That's saying okay. Here's a risk
And we don't need to get everybody to buy into something. We basically need to
show that the
um
The risk opportunity space needs something different done. So there's some
Scientific work, but it's this is a convening of a not large number of people
And obviously, you know, this is a topic. We have both actively worked on a long with a number of other people
But it's this is just one that kind of makes sense
um, and then there's
legislation legislative work within existing
legislative apparatus to be able to get that stuff done
We could say a very similar thing of like
uh
Protecting the ensuring that the amazon doesn't
Uh get to the point of the hydrological pump breaking right a planetary boundary thing like that
um, okay, well
How would we think about how to do triage there effectively?
i'm just going to talk through
Some principles of how to think about it because whether you're working in equidore to begin with at the headwaters of the amazon or brazil
Because it's the largest total amount of the amazon or any of the other five
You know five countries touching it or nine countries that have some involvement in the watersheds
like you're going to do different things but
principles
the economic incentive whether it's from mining
oil extraction or
um agriculture
Is going to be an ongoing pressure because
those things that are going to not only keep being worth money many of them will keep being worth more money as
um population demands and etc needs that
and those forces can bribe governments and they can
put out commercials and
You know campaigns that affect the minds and hearts of people
and they can do campaign budgets and
Uh, they can pay lobbyists. So
If the ngos that are fighting it are just fundamentally less
Capacitated in all those ways. This is not going to work. So you've got to think about all right
Factoring the forces that want to harm the thing. We're wanting to protect it
What forces are large enough to protect it, right? Just even basic kind of strategic thinking
And how could we get the forces that are large enough to care?
And it might not be by appealing to them with some kind of moral or environmental thing. It might be some other things
So in this case, this is an example you and I've talked about
If the hydrological pump of the amazon breaks
It's
Meaning the water that transpires
From all the trees that then rains down and keeps it as a rainforest
But also pumps some of the ground water into the air that becomes rain in north america
That is somewhere between a third and a half of the rainfall in north america every year
If the hydrological pump breaks because you've got enough destruction that you stop getting enough rainfall
That you stop getting enough plant growth to keep pumping the thing, right?
You get this like the climate change albedo effect is a positive runaway thing that happens at a certain point
And whether we're five years from that or 15 years from that depends upon how fast things are being destroyed
And whose model you're looking at but it's not like
Forever there's a time scalar. So then you're like, all right, so
Half of the half the rainfall in north america goes away
That is absolutely a national security threat because it's a food security threat a water security threat
It threatens the you know food sovereignty and food security and
So the state department would care about that
Not because they necessarily care about the amazon on its own, but because they care about food security
Now
Is the state department bigger than amazon watch and rainforest watch and whatever NGOs are there that could
Do more to intervene obviously
Now this is presenting the issue
In a to someone else that has the capacity for a reason that they care about even if it is not
The reason that people caring about the rainforest care about it
And then who would they need to see?
That modeling they would probably want to see that noa and nasa agreed modeling wise
Yes, this much can't be harmed or you'll get that runaway effect to occur
So if
Some people wanting to work on the amazon were like, how do I get people at noa nasa to explain the hydrological pump thing
In a way that the state department adds it to its list of things to ensure that it ameliorates
This is just an example
Of triage strategic thinking. We're not trying to make capitalism as a whole better
We're not trying to make the governments of each of those countries better
We're simply trying to think strategically more effectively about how to do a thing, right?
That needs to be done time times a thousand things or 10,000 things
This is what I would call the triage category
And there are a lot of principles
So I just gave a principle of
Whatever are the forces arrayed against the thing
Make sure that you have competent forces
Similarly arrayed, but they don't have to care about it for the same reason
They have to care about it for a rationalized reason that speaks in the language they understand
So who can help translate that that's one principle
We could do a whole thing on how to do strategic thinking effectively
But triage is largely
That it's largely how do we get different players?
How do we get the economic incentives etc to be able to do the things that are needed?
And of course, we still have to think through
The externalities because there might be issues of having the state department to focus on the amazon
So we have to think through that
But that's what I would call the triage category and there is a lot in there
And of course, there's a lot of people already working on front-line approaches for the amazon
They're just not thinking about
What is the total threat landscape to the amazon?
What are the tipping points to not hit and what is a strategically adequate focus?
and so
That's one triage. We could we could give 100 other examples, but I think that is an example category
Do we want to go horizontal or vertical here?
Maybe you could stick with that example and look at transition and long term briefly
