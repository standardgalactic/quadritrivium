it's about
Government and law and how do we get that right because the economic incentive
Wouldn't be that same issue if we could govern it properly if we could force the internalization of the price of carbon and get
Carbon pricing properly and get costs of everything proper all that would be fixed
But we have to do that through law. So how do we fix governance and law and then somebody else would be like
You can't because law is written by lobbyists that get paid for by somebody and wherever the economic motive is is
What's going to pay for that? Which is why you you have to think about
Economics and law together so the key is political economy and how do you get that so and on and on people would say no
Really the key is actually parenting what we've really got to do is restore the family because before education
By the time that kid goes to school at five or six that so much of their identity and psyche and value system is already set
It happens early on
We have to actually change the entire culture to have parenting emphasize raising better kids from the beginning
And and what I came to learn is they were all right
Right somebody else would be everything you're saying is so anthropocentric
The key is the fucking environment because we're none of us or anything without the environment
Like you have to prioritize that everything else doesn't matter that much
And what is an economy like we can breathe without money. We can't breathe without air
And so be less anthropocentric and focus on the integrity of the environment because that's upstream from everything
And so what I what I learned was
The answer to all of the problems is all of the solutions
Um, there is not a series of chains. There's an ecology of series of change. It's so often someone says what is the solution?
It sounds like someone's saying like
What species is the forest?
Like I don't know what you're even asking like a forest has lots of species lots and lots and if it's an old growth forest
It's even more complexly interacting. So what is the solution? There's not a solution
There's lots of things that need to happen. So if anything I want
Patterns of how to think about it and I want frameworks for how to think about it
And I don't want people to attach to those frameworks because they'll be useful but also limiting
and to realize
the cultural aspects do involve education and media and parenting
and
Religion and lots of other things and the structure of cities
and you know in the political economy aspects and well lots of things and so and um
the
getting past the
Zealotus and reductionist focus and being able to get how do all these things come together
is
key to understanding properly
I love that I got the systems ecology equivalent of goosebumps as you were unpacking that
And that's exactly right and but that's a lot for
the
That's a lot of complexity for most people to hold in their mind because
They're they've worked their whole life on climate
And they think climate is the single
Problem and their identity is attached to it their job is attached to it. So to say it's all these things governance
and love and
Law and pricing and everything that you just mentioned
What how does someone shift from where they are now to that more holistic?
view of our of our system not only to think about it, but also to apply it to their work and their lives
I don't know if you want to answer that now, but I'm curious
If you are young and you're listening to this and you're thinking about how do I do the most useful thing with my life and
Do I go to college or not or do I go back to college or what kind of work do I do?
um
For most people here's something I would offer
Figure out if you are not already independently wealthy if you are awesome figure out how to
Keep your overhead as low as possible
And make the money that you need to live in the least number of hours possible
Doing something that isn't terrible
So you buy most of your time back to continue to train yourself on what is actually yours to do
This is what I did with my life and many of the people I know who
I really respect did something like this where
um
you know I
Rather than okay, I've got the basic bills paid. Let's make more money and get more shit
It's like no no the the more shit is way less interesting than actually the time
I want my time back so that I can keep understanding these things
So I can know how to have my life actually be meaningful and
So it's both the learning and the development of capacity
So if you are young still and you're in this interest
Figure out how to keep your overhead low figure out how to pay your bills in the least amount of hours doing something
That isn't terrible and really keep investing in developing
How you and now if there's already something that you feel very called to do
Then and it feels right then do it and keep investing in your development in the additional hours both, right?
If we're talking about someone who
Has kids in a mortgage and a job and whatever
um
If the job is not clearly
Making things better in a way that is aligned with your dharma be willing to change at all
Like
The shortness of your life and the urgency of the situation of the world
Is such that like be willing to do that
If you're mostly in the right direction, you just feel like you wish you could do even more then
Continue to do what you do while studying. Is there a way I could do this with even more?
Insightfulness as you start learning how to think through externalities and system dynamics better
It might take a year or two of study while you're doing this to start to come up with insights
But maybe in a few years you're actually revolutionizing the field that you're in
um
The other thing I would say is
People when you say like hey, it's a lot of complexity
The the world situations are complex reducing them to be too narrow is at the core of everything wrong
We can optimize some things harm other things we have to
And when we can act very powerfully because we can act through
Six continent supply chains and supercomputers and satellites and ai and um and steam engines and
I mean the oil engines and like all of the powerful tools from
The industrial revolution on
You just can't do that in an oversimplifying way
ongoingly
right like the
Where the model of what you're optimizing is not reality
Is where reality gets harmed you don't get to do cumulative and exponentially growing harm forever on a finite world
So we do have to actually wrestle with the reality of the world
Which means the complexity of it. It is what it is. We don't get a like it just is what it is, right?
and
Now not everybody has to to begin with because we go back to each of those partial narratives
It's just about media. It's just bad education. It's just bad economics. Well, let's say somebody
Is resting with all this and really thinking how do I make a better educational system? And maybe they have
Maybe they have a transitional version and a long-term version
Right the long-term version might be like a radically different system of education
That is based on a different system of community development
Where school is not just a centralized thing. It's how the parents and how the extended family and community are all
Supported to support the development of children. I mean, maybe that's some long-term future of education
And maybe it involves AI tutors and shit
Maybe the immediate transitional thing involves
Are there some curriculums and systemic thinking and whatever that we can start to add to existing?
Curricula and is there a way of getting that through that both requires me to think through the content the pedagogy and the political
Actuation needed to make it happen
Um
Not that many people
Have to be thinking effectively to get something to happen that will train a lot of people to where there's now a lot more people
In the same way that it didn't take that many people to make facebook to affect the minds of lots of people
So it wouldn't take that many people to make new media systems
That think strategically enough about how would we get met calf dynamics and how would we get the people on there? Whatever?
That could be oriented very differently
and the same with perverse incentive if
some people figured out how to
If some people figure out how to
Make laws that make particularly bad things for what's their current incentives illegal whether it's fishing or whatever or create better
regenerative economic systems or
Then everybody else who doesn't understand the whole complexity just has a slightly less perverse incentive system
Like a lot of the complexity is built into a better incentive system incentive legal system
So not everybody has to get everything to begin with
Some people being able to do that and build things that affect other people at scale
and affect the world at scale is how
The thing starts so I don't want anyone who is
Wrestling with like okay. I I want to understand this well to get overwhelmed and they think about
Uh
Their family members who aren't even interested or whatever and say if everybody has to understand this we're screwed no everybody does not
To begin and the path by which
People are encultrated in time
Can always start with some people building things that become on ramps for more people
So merging this with the logic of
What I expect to happen, which is a great simplification
Especially for young people what I hear you saying
Is advocating to simplify your own life
In the current economy, but at the same time expand your capacity to look at the world in systems
and
not only the
Immediate feedback we get from a decision or a product or a strategy or a program
but the second and third order
effects and start to think that and if we have
Scout team of conciliants jedi out there that then that will potentially scale orders of magnitude in its
Passing the systems baton to other humans over time
And in turn that will affect all nine boxes of the three by three grid that you proposed
Yes, totally and I want to just come back. I don't know how many of the people who watch your show are young or
later everyone has
Uh, it's a wide variety, but a lot of young people
So yeah, I want to speak to younger people again thinking about this
Your development is
Uh, personal and psychological as much as it is cognitive and skills really critical to understand that
If
you
Can't talk whether it's can't publicly speak or speak in front of someone who's intelligent because of insecurities
It'll mess up your ability to do stuff no matter how much you know
If you have to talk and you talk because you need to seem smart
Even when you should shut up and listen it's going to mess up your ability to do things
We all can observe in other people these quirks that maybe they don't see in themselves that totally make them less effective
Look for the latter but keep going
Look for these things in yourself and see how to
Work on them. So the the personal development is more study and more therapy
um
for whatever it's worth
I did every therapy method I could ever find and I still actually if I find a therapist
It does something I haven't done I engage in it because it's just it's
Investing in one's own understanding of themselves and their psyche is just like investing in their
Knowledge or investing in their health it matters the things we invest in is where grow
So I would love to see it's also part of how can I how can I become?
Undefended enough that I can actually feel the pain of the world in a high touch way and not be crippled
That also requires
Having worked through your own pain enough that you aren't crippled by it and regress back into childhood trauma states and things like that
We've had a couple off camera conversations on this
I've never had therapy in my whole life and I'm now interviewing
Coaches in the next couple weeks on this because I'm struggling with exactly what what you just described
So okay, did you more more comments on?
Yeah, yeah, so some the great simplification macro. So the micro version as you said is
Don't don't create an in a embedded growth obligation on your own earning
Which is what most people do
The as soon as you make more than you get a bigger house and buy more shit and have get more debt and need to make more
Stop the embedded growth obligation there because it really doesn't matter that much make enough money that you can eat healthy food and
you know
If you want to see a therapist or whatever you can do those things
But by the way, I will interject right there. There's a sociologist named juliet shore. She's a friend of mine
She did a book
Like 30 years ago where she studied how much money people made and at the end of the year asked them
How much would you like to make and they she followed a cohort over like 20 years?
And no matter how much you made in a certain year every single year people wanted to make more the following year and if you
Internalize that's what our culture is doing the words. You just said make even more profound
sense
Keep going
Yeah, the embedded growth obligation goes macro and micro right? Um
but if you want to
