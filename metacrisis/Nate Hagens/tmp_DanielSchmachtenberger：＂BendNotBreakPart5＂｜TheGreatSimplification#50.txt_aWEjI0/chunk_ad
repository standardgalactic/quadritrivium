Typically what we're doing is defining the problem in a narrow way
right the problem is
soil erosion in this area the problem is
Uh, the homelessness in this area whatever it is or the
The problem is cancer. So we need to do the immuno oncology. We define a problem some narrow way
And then we seek a solution that produces a first order meaning a direct effect to solve it, right
Typically, we're not looking for cancer solutions that decrease carcinogenesis. We're at large
We're looking for something that can cut a cancer out or burn a cancer out or poison a cancer out or
Tune an immune system to killing cancers. We're not looking
Highly upstream. So we're almost always looking for a direct effect
Right on whatever the problem is
So it's a first order effect
On a narrowly defined problem that we will think about so that we can measure if we're doing a good job in a small number of metrics
Right, we'll have how many cancer cells or how many inches of topsoil or how many parts per million of co2 or whatever it is
And or how much gdp per capita, but we're going to be measuring our success in a small number
Of fully explicated metrics from a first order effect. That's actually quite simple
epistemologically to wrap your head around
But that solution that I do will also produce second and third and nth order effects on a very large number of metrics
that we've never thought about
And some of those will not be positive
And some of them if this solution is going to overtake the problem
It has to be bigger or faster or have some more scale to it. Some of those externalities might actually be worse issues
Aren't you just really saying that our species is chosen to simplify our economy on the backs of
500 billion energy workers and we optimize dollars when we should
somehow mature to have a systems view of
Upstream and downstream effects and if we did try to measure those second and third and nth order effects
The risk and the complexity would be so much that we would just grind everything to a halt
No
That's not true that we would grind everything to a halt. Um, okay, though that will that though that will be the
justification for why to continue with the stupid thing
um, so
But am I saying something that is very much like men are not the web of life
We are stranded it would ever do to the web we do to ourselves think about seven generations into the future think more holistically
Yes, i'm saying something like that, but i'm going to try to actually make it more
Formalizable so that you can actually think about how to apply it
Not just feel it right, but it is it's saying something very commensurate to that when
When david bowman christian marty had their dialogues
In the 80s on what is the fundamental cause of all of the metacrisis the way they talked about
What's the fundamental cause of human conflict that leads to poor coordination and poor management?
And david bowman said it was fragmented consciousness
The underlying issue is being able to separate us versus them and benefit us at the expense of them
But they're just as smart and they up regulate stuff and so we just get arms races to make the the wars
larger and larger in their potential
or
Me versus you so we get
Class systems and everybody fucking each other even within the us right like we'll be an us when it comes to this nation versus that nation
But we'll be a me versus or an us when it comes to our company versus their company
But me versus you when it comes to ladder climbing within the company and office politics
Um or our species versus the other species in the earth or the right now benefit relative to the long-term harm
The ability to separate things that are in truth connected
To benefit one part while harming another part
But that ultimately those causal loops come back to harm everything the cause of all the problems is that it is a consciousness
That doesn't see how it all connects
If you see how it all connects and then you tend to all of it
only then
Only that is considerate enough to
manage the power of exponential tech
Go ahead
Naive question. So the fractured consciousness
Is that a human thing or do dogs and uh elephants have fractured consciousness?
No human thing. Yeah, um capability
to
Take this whole totality of experience
and then start naming everything
And making things separate right having a semantic interface being able to have a symbol that I can relate to
That relates to the represents the ground, but it's not the ground
This is what makes us so powerful is because we can up regulate one part relative to another part right our toolmaking is the ability to
Take my fist and say I want more of that make a hammer right a stone tool or take my ability to bite something and make a sharp knife or
Um, it's the ability to say I want more of this part and how do I increase it?
But increase it at the expense of what what is becoming less?
What where is the cost happening if our technology is not that much and there's not that many of us so what?
When our technology becomes profound and there's lots of us
Then it's a big so what then then us versus them can equal a war that kills everybody and the us versus nature equals planetary boundaries
It kills everybody so the same consciousness that was viable because there were not that many of us and our tech was not that big
But the poor stewardship of tech
the poor stewardship of our power meaning
Poor in terms of whatever we're externalizing the harm to
Um that same mindset
Does not get to steward exponential power
It self-terminates
So either
If we are to not self-terminate we must have the wisdom to be able to steward exponential power
And it is something like exponentially more wisdom than we have been operating with
And it's not impossible
But it is and this is where we said
Culture political economy tech
There is some radical cultural shifts that have to occur to
Instantiate a political economy that is the will of the people
But where the will of the people doesn't is not a will that wants to benefit some people at the expense of others
And some people in the moment at the expense of our future and people at the expense of nature
If the government that is going to bind the tech and the economics is not an instantiation of the will of the people
It'll be oppressive
And then it has to justify violence to oppress the people and then it'll become corrupt and whatever
So the government
Has to be an expression of the will of the people
But if it's a will of the people who want what harms each other that also doesn't work
So you have to basically do the culture work
To have people recognize that which they are fundamentally interconnected with
To then be able to have that
Expressed in a system of law that binds the economics that can bind guide and direct the tech
Which is where the physical power is
to be
viable
That conceptually makes sense should we move into the three by three grid then?
And how should we
Okay, almost
On externalities
It's important to say
So how do you think through externalities better to avoid them?
So we were saying think through the upstream stuff because if you don't solve some of the upstream
Causes of the problem. It's very likely they will be displaced somewhere else
Think about the downstream stuff of whatever you're going to do so that you aren't
Going to cause problems to something else that matters
Could you give an example of that upstream and downstream on the level of the individual and a product or something?
Sure
I'm wanting to bring food to people in an area where there's food insecurity
Is my strategy going to increase the power of warlords to be able to capture huge surpluses of food and increase that
type of
Political instability in the area. Is it going to create increased dependency on other countries that are going to actually
erode the
Culture of the people feeling like they have any agency
Is it going to use agricultural methods that actually kill more pollinators and more topsoil and cause more dead zones and oceans?
Those are
Not the core problem I was trying to solve I was trying to solve food insecurity, but I don't want to make warlords worse
I don't want to erode the will of the people thinking they have no agency and I don't want to ruin the environment
so I have to say
How do I think about this problem?
And the how do I think about the connected problems well enough because can I bring sustainable agriculture?
permaculture type things that don't hurt the soil actually make the soil better and grow it rather than not
That are inherently be centralizing rather than centralizing so they don't cause the warlord thing that increase the agency of the people
It just means we have to deepen the understanding of the problem space enough to notice which solutions
Will be
vital
You're really talking about
embedding systems
thinking systems ecology in a central role in our governance systems
And in our culture in the way that everyone thinks better
Yeah, but we have no incentive to be systems thinkers in our culture right now
Unless you're a hedge fund or a teacher
well
two things
Not all motivation is
Extrinsic incentive is an extrinsic motivator where someone else is getting you to do something
And where I'm doing it because of what I get out of it not because of my intrinsic motivation to the thing itself
so
If I am trying to run a civilization where there's a lot of labor to do and nobody really wants to do all the labor
And so we have to incent them to do the labor because otherwise we have to beat them to do the labor
You know like so we can in slavery by having wage slavery or something like that
But people aren't doing the things they want to do it. They're doing the things they want them on me for you know
some other purpose
Intrinsic motive is is also a thing right so people's value systems the culture work is I do certain things not because I'm going to get anything
Financially from it or necessarily even status from it, but because I just intrinsically care about the thing right so one is
We're talking I think most of the people listening are spending hours listening to this thing and they're not getting paid
to listen to this and some of them
might be
Taking this to their job as a consultant because they sound smarter and they get paid but probably mostly not probably they're investing time doing this because they
Just authentically care independent of incentive
And there's a culture wide
Starved for intrinsic motivation and purpose right now, but go on
I think the future is defined much less by extrinsic motivators and much more by intrinsic motivators
This doesn't mean there won't be any extrinsic ones
So of course we have to design our incentives and our deterrence better
We have to solve for perverse incentives and like that
But that that's not the whole of the story. It shouldn't even be most of the story, right?
And then there is also an incentive to care about these things which is
non extinction as a good incentive
like just even from a personal extrinsic point of view if I don't work to take
to
affect the world's trajectory and if I don't work to help other people to affect the world's trajectory
It might preclude anything that I care about
So I would say there is not an incentive in the formal monetary systemic sense for a lot of people
But that does not mean that there's not both intrinsic and extrinsic reasons if you pay attention
Okay
Okay, so we were saying upstream downstream things externalities we were saying
The solution is generally oriented to produce a first order effect
On a small number of defined variables
But we have to think through the second third fourth order effects on a large number of variables
So we don't know what are how do we do that? The first part is
I want people to endeavor to do it
Completely while knowing they never can
Your best externality analysis will still miss it that there's no way you could have thought of
But I want you to try to think of everything as best you can and then knowing that you didn't think of everything
I want you to have some kind of broad listening and watching after you do it to see what might be being affected
that you wouldn't have even expected
and
Did we expect when smartphones came out that
They would have the effect on dinner tables or human attention in relationships or
porn addiction or people's ability to study or we didn't expect those things so
We might have anticipated some so anticipate all the things you can
But also maybe even in the visual human focal length of focusing on 2d things that affix focal length so much of the time
and the effect of losing our navigation and orientation and what are the things that does
Neuro psychologically so what I would say is you have to do the best job
Of
Anticipating externalities you can while recognizing there will be ones you didn't anticipate
So you want some very broad diffuse listening to say after we started this thing
What's what new things started to occur that might have been connected?
Are you kind of talking about the precautionary principle?
totally um, but I'm talking about specifically how to think about applying it right and
so we're talking about a holistic principle and a precautionary principle, but we're trying to
Formalize it as like a way that people can think about applying this thing. So
