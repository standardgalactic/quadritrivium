This is an existential risk to this person living in this
refugee camp or in this ghetto or this dog or this whatever
and
It's abstract. It's on it can be almost an intellectual curiosity rather than an expression of actually embodied care
And it can even be worse than that. It can be like
A topic that seems like it has power associated
and
so
if
someone
Can walk by the people on the street and not notice that much and if they
Aren't actively bothered by the situation animals are in I don't trust those people to be thinking about catastrophic risk
Um
I only want like I only really want to trust people thinking about
Metasystemic stuff who actually ground it because otherwise you can you can say well long-termism in the future this many
Trillions of people might die if we don't such and such therefore
We should do these things now and these things now might cause lots of harm
But it's a good expected value calculus utilitarian calculus long-term and it's like or you know
We have to do this war
But here's the benefit and we'll try to minimize collateral damage
It's like minimize collateral damage means how many moms are watching broken babies and that are civilians and bomb buildings
It's like don't call it collateral damage. Don't sanitize it like
so
But the people who are high touch and who can't walk by
What does high touch mean? I haven't heard that meaning word before
Rather than high abstraction or thinking about the high tech that a high orientation to
The actual touch right like working with this animal like, you know, how much time you'll spend rehabilitating one dog
Or one animal that's covered in oil one seagull and you're like fuck
This is a lot of time right, but it's totally worth it when you're with that one and then you think about scale
and
If you don't move to scale, obviously you can't address the issues at scale
For for most people that's fine like doing the high touch thing is fine
If you feel like you can think systemically you can't lose the high touchness
otherwise
The abstraction can make
you
Disconnected enough to do evil in the name of moral things
and
That's a challenge, but here's the other challenge that this harkens back to our video number three
is
the more high touch
you are
Given world events the more likely you're going to be overwhelmed in in what's going on and not be able to do things at scale
Because it's too overwhelming
So you can be high abstraction and try to do things at scale, but then you're not connected in the way that you're just describing
yeah, so
If you really if your heart is open and you feel and you see what I'm in new york city right now
It's not where I live
And it's cold this time of year and it's a fucking terrible place to be homeless and cold and
If you let yourself feel that now it's just in istanbul and there were four million syrian refugees there
and there were
You know, they didn't speak the language and we don't speak the language necessarily of other places. We might have to flee
I saw a kid who I was talking to whose parents were both killed and the war
He wasn't asking for anything
He was just hiding because he said if he gets anything everybody well is violent towards him to take his stuff
and it was like
If you let yourself feel that it's easy to just feel completely broken right and
Um
And and or get completely pulled into I just need to be at this refugee camp working here
And not think about can I do something at scale?
this
spiritual psychological work
To feel the depth of those feelings and transmute it into more devotion and more agency and more strength to be able to serve
And keep that high touch and figure out how to do strategy effectively
Is the only way forward I know
Well
I hope you don't mind me sharing this publicly, but
In our private conversations. I have not criticized you but
Observed that that's one of the reasons you are not being more effective
Globally is because you can't say no to helping people
I know so many examples where someone is struggling with something and you're giving them time and advice
And there's just only a certain number of hours in the day
So your high touch
Is you know a little bit of a lodestone to really being effective, but let's let's just go forward with that
I think I understand your point
the thing there is
I struggle with it and there's so many places where
I don't say yes to helping someone that I really wish I could because it would be saying no to work on projects
that I really
Hope can change things at scale and believe can for a lot of people
But it's never easy for me to say no where I really could make a difference
And I don't want it to be easy for anybody like I struggle with it and I might make wrong choices
But I would like anyone to struggle with it
Right as opposed to just turn something off where then it's easy
I would not like people there's the dialectic of things to wrestle with I want someone to always be in the wrestling with
And it's interesting because someone can say like hey this thing is not as important
Because of scale
But the person who can harden themselves to the people around them
Will think wrongly and into it wrongly about how to make a good world at scale
I trust them less. I trust more
The person who feels the people around them enough that they have to do something they feel compelled to
And so this is where utilitarian ethics are not sufficient virtue ethics also are it's like the utilitarian ethics says
You know what is the expected value for the world of me doing this thing versus doing that thing
But of course I can't forecast all the fucking things and I can't forecast whether 10 days out
We're dealing with complex systems. I might be totally wrong
The virtue ethics says if you do the thing that has the most integrity in the moment
The next moment will unfold from a moment that had the most integrity in it
That also has limitations. You have to hold you have to hold them both together
We probably should be scaling the number of people that think that way rather than scaling the project that you or someone else is working on
This is why we're talking about this first on the show is and that's why I was happy that you brought up the animal shelter topic is because
How do you think about solutions? Well, you don't only think about it. You feel about it, right? You have to
Like when we talk about the meta crisis, we're saying you can't think about
Climate change and the economy and us china power dynamics separately. They affect each other
Obviously we see a war happen in eastern europe and we're going backwards on climate change in terms of fossil fuels and
So you have to think about all the world together
But the other corollary that is you have to use all the parts of yourself
Right, you have to use your intuition and your intellect
You have to use your passion and your kind of calm
dispassionateness
So how do I cultivate the all of the capacities of self in service of all the world?
Is how I relate to that
Head heart and spirit. I think you said on a prior episode
Okay, how else should we be thinking about this pre pre three by three grid? Do you have any other?
Yeah, before we get to the three by three
I think the three by three is very tangible and we will end with a couple things
I'd like to say are how not to think about solutions
Um, I think this can be very helpful to start. Um, first
I want to give an example that was actually really cool for me lately
Um
I just met some guys who are running an elite counterterrorism unit and
Uh, they had been special forces moved to domestic counterterrorism
and
Uh, a number of people's work Dave Snowden's work my work other people
They had been looking at and seeing how that could apply in these domains
And have come up with some very innovative strategies to be able to protect life more effectively
Well with less resources while also being less willing to cause
Harm to the other side in the process like they they really just increased their effectiveness
This is obviously a very empirical very tangible maximally high consequence type real situation
And the thing that they said and why we were talking
The thing they said that they had to train the guys out of the most who are already
Special forces counterterrorism, you know moved to counterterrorism guys was they had to move them out of
Uh thinking about solutions too quickly and into being able to assess the uniqueness of this problem
That is different than any problem. They've ever been in before because they too quickly want to
See which of the eight forms of drills they've done in the past
This is and yet as you're getting more innovative terrorism, it might not be any of the drills
It doesn't fit and so rather than look for which solution that I already know do I get a fit on this?
What they were training the guys to do is to be able to
Not think that their existing solution might be adequate so they could truly innovate so to start by saying
How do I assess the novelty of what's going on without letting my existing salience frameworks limit me?
And that that was the core of empirically what actually has been making them more effective
So a frequent periodic
Personal ooo of the oota loops in an individual's way of looking at the world
Observe orient often
Decide act when people say what's the solution?
They want to jump straight to decide and act without
understanding the observe orient well enough
And then oftentimes they have frameworks like the answer is and they know what the answer is
So then of course they have a hammer and they're looking for nails
But it means that their observation is actually dead end because they have existing solution frameworks
They're trying to apply so they're trying to look for which of my existing solution framework supplies or where can I apply this thing?
And as a result their observation to novelties didn't
So
It was very interesting to see an environment that high consequence and that empirical
Where they were testing the shit out of different training methods in you know, live training scenarios
Coming up with the thing that messed the most qualified tactical operators up
The most was them looking for solutions too quickly rather than being able to drop that and really actually assess the novelty of this situation
So I just want to offer that first
Um
Because I do find that the impulse to jump straight to solution is an uncomfort with uncertainty
That doesn't want to actually not know what to do and feel like this consequential stuff
But that makes it more likely you do the wrong thing
and it's more important to just
Be able to chill the fuck out enough that you can actually observe the real novel situation and come
Up with appropriate novel solutions
And so the comfort with certainty the comfort with uncertainty allows you to observe well, which allows you to strategize well
That's one prerequisite idea. I want to share
I like it
It can be taken too far. I've been
Chilling the fuck out and observing and orienting for 20 years on this before deciding and acting
Because that's kind of my job
But I I totally agree with you. I think they're and this ties into people's identity and their jobs as well
It's hard to have
A solution or a set a suite of responses that is counter to one's built identity or their paycheck
Yes, I want to actually speak to
Two things there
I talk about perverse incentives oftentimes, so
obviously if someone has a
Fiscal incentive to externalize the cost they will blah blah, but it's not just a perverse incentive in the traditional economic sense
it's
If my job is measured in certain metrics, even if it's not a perverse fiscal incentive for me, but I'm
Whatever, I'm some un department focused on world food program focused on
Feeding kids or a refugee program focused on
Whatever the metrics are bed nets
I can
Do something
That will feed the kids
Through an environmentally unsustainable strategy that erodes the soil faster and causes dead zones in the ocean faster
Because those are the metrics that I'm tasked with
And so they're I think of that as a
Institutional choice architecture that is perverse to the totality of what the world needs
So it's not just perverse incentive equals greed. It's also that we can divide the the world up into this is yours to focus on where
Well, but that's fucking wrong if what I'm tasked with is just these few metrics and I can harm other things that are still interconnected
Me just actually doing what the institution requires of me optimizing those metrics
Even if they're for a nonprofit good or government positive things
Seemingly positive things can still be a corrupt choice-making architecture
so one of the things you want to think about is
Is there a mandate that I have that is too narrow to think well
To strategize well is because when you were saying earlier some people care about narrow things
Well, it's very likely that things that you don't think you care about directly affect the shit you do care about
If you don't think that you care about
