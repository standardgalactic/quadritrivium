That it's very hard to concentrate that much power and not have it become corrupt and dystopic
So of course there have to be checks and balances on that power and transparencies and there are really hard issues in there
We can get into that
but
There is a need to be able to ensure
The not terrible risk of things that have exponentially bigger and faster
Impacts ahead of time. That's an example of a fundamental change in our existing system of
government
Obviously if we were going to rebuild a new
Open society civilizational architecture from scratch today
We would do it differently than the retrofits of how we did it starting in, you know, the early industrial era
So there are a lot of long-term shifts where we think about how do we implement
all of the information technology tools to factor all of the things and
I
I could get it actually we should do one where we talk about
The combinations of liquid democracy and qualified democracy and addressing arrows and possibilities here
I mean all the things I want the future of a governance stack could look like
But that's i'll pass on that for a minute and just come back to transition because that was the example I wanted to do
Uh, you said we should do one. What what do you mean one one podcast or one?
I mean it would be worth talking about at some point if that was if that was something people had questions on like what does
what what does a
governance system
That is adequate to the complexity of the issues actually look like
But let me go ahead and give an example of transition that is not yet adequate but a lot better than we currently have
People like
Larry Lessig who you know constitutional lawyers and focused on these issues have identified a handful of issues that they
Um see as being able to and I don't mean to misquote him. I spoke to them recently about this
And I think this is roughly right
he's focused on
that if we can get the primaries to not be partisan because one of the problems of the
uh
Primaries being partisan as you get this heavy focus on appeal to your in-group and don't pay any attention to
How the outgroup the other side is going to focus and you get much more extreme polarizing
things
Similarly, if you can get ranked choice voting rather than just the single vote
Then if you highly polarize the other side, you'll do much less well
Then if you appeal to your support base, but also appeal or don't disappear to the other side
So you'll decrease the incentive for polarization with ranked choice voting
If you can fix gerrymandering
which
Is a such a just obviously corrupt nonsense thing and it's such a straightforward thing to be able to fix
So districts start to make sense
And if you can fix campaign finance
then
the
the perversion of the system to focus on party over
uh country to
Continuously polarize which will make most of the energy turn into waste heat fighting each other and then four years do something and four years undo it
Like the current system with its existing logics would just be so much smarter if you did
A handful of things like that
Now obviously the only people who wouldn't want that are the people that benefit from the corruption of the system
Which might be things like the people who run the political parties and stuff
So there is some work to do but that is that's not triage, right? That's not going to solve a particular biosecurity risk
It's not going to solve a nuclear risk not going to solve an environmental
Boundary, but it's going to make something called the u.s federal government smarter and less stupid and less corrupt
So all the things that it does
Will be better, but it's going to do it in a way that works within its own existing system logics
So that's what I would call a transitional solution
Whereas how do we rebuild a digital democracy from scratch? There's a totally different kind of structure is a long-term solution
So that's an example of thinking about
the distinction between
triage which is not systemic
Transition which is systemic, but a change to existing systems and then the build of fundamentally new systems
I'm agreeing with everything you're saying, but it's totally different than what I expected this conversation would be about
I thought we would have discreet
Examples in the culture political economy
tech energy infrastructure stack and as you're talking it almost seems like
The things that I would put in these nine boxes. Well to me
It's all about triage now and it's almost like
preparing the economy for the financial energy
rubber band
snapback
My work on on that it almost
Like enables you to work on all these other things
Like I think that is going to change the landscape of all these other
Examples that you are giving and and that has a very specific
I'm focused on all of it, but I just recognize that
There's lots of these existential risks that may or may not happen
Certainly climate is happening and is going to happen regardless of what we do
our attempts now are to minimize it and to cope with it as
species and culture
but I I think we are years or a decade away from
a
Recalibration of the musical chairs of financial claims relative to the biophysical claims
So I thought we might talk about. Oh, well, how does AI fit into that or how does blockchain fit into that?
And my answer to that is they would help
Extend the metabolism for a while longer at best, but they're not
They're not solutions. They're they're short-term fixes. So what is the triage on how?
Effectively eight billion people are going to have to deal with a smaller pie for the first time in 150 years
Um, and that is a very large conversation
But I I do like the conceptual way in in which you're painting this
But I might have more discreet
Suggestions on on each of these boxes
No, let me say that a different way on the triage. I would on the transition in longer term
I think we're largely in agreement at least on the things you've said so far
Yeah, I mean, I think with transition or triage. I gave an example of biosecurity and an example of something like the hydrological pump of the amazon
We didn't get to triage examples on
Um, right. There's there's triage on every single issue
Yeah, no, I think we could do that. I think we could say let's pick
10 of the most pressing issues and give more examples there
So really what we did so far was just lay out a framework to think about these things
Not anything like completion of that and we couldn't complete it, but we could do quite a lot more
so maybe if there was a
Follow-up we should have a hundred people at a three-day meeting
talking about those all those boxes
And we will um, and if for this podcast is a follow-up, maybe it would be a combo of
uh
A handful of areas in which you're thinking about triage solutions and you share the things you're thinking about and we dialogue on them
With questions that the audience has that might be a really fun
Yeah, uh, actually
It was really presenting frameworks to think about what do how do you approach the metacrisis more than something like a laundry list of the things to do
I just feel this I
I emotionally feel the intensity
of this bend versus break moment and I've come to that because of my
awareness of the connection between energy and finance, but it sure seems that
geopolitically we also have a
Are approaching a bend versus break moment in many other ways. So
I'm getting uh urgent texts that I have to go and deal with animals because it's going to be very cold tonight
So how would you like to wrap this up my friend?
I think um
It makes plenty of sense for us to do a follow-up if there are questions and uh,
I'm sure there will be questions
and if there's more examples of solutions we'd like to get into
um, and very likely
ongoing conversations will keep being fine and valuable, but I do feel like there's a certain arc of completion that we got to
of
problem framing
Framing up how to be with that and then talking through how to think about
How to approach
How to work with it, which is not a solution. It's not a list of solutions
it's a it's a way of thinking about and relating to the approach and
Uh, I feel really good about that. We got to have this whole dialogue and I am very interested to hear the questions that people have
and uh, if we
Have follow-up soon, that'll be great
Thank you next week is Thanksgiving and uh, I'm grateful for a lot of things. I'm grateful that our paths crossed
and that we continue to
Be colleagues and share notes and ideas and connections
because
What else should we be doing with our time on this planet?
Is swinging for the fences on, um, the human predicament you call it the meta crisis
Uh, and we need orders of magnitude more people having these conversations in their communities and their networks around the world
Uh, so I I deeply value your your intellect and wisdom and your
Your generous spirit of of sharing your time with others on this. So
thank you so much
is
Uh, a thing that some people could do if they felt called if people have listened to all five of these and they felt it was meaningful and they decided
they wanted in their
community
Toast a watching series and then you know dial like create a support group of how do we help each other in our own?
Development in this that'd be a cool thing
And uh, what else should we do? We should go tend to the animals when it's cold outside
Yeah, um
I'm gonna I'm gonna do that
You know between the time that this is recorded and it's aired. Um, there will be
A podcast with thomas bjorkman who talks about inner development and having different perspectives
Is really really good and I do think
Somewhere out there we need to have this ability
To temporarily suppress your own identity to be part of a larger conversation take other perspectives
Think systemically the way that you talked about uh in this podcast
In a formal or semi-formal education system that you're experiencing this learning
With other humans who then form bonds
And there's this social network that that spills throughout the world
And I I don't know how to formalize that but our education system is sorely lacking right now for the future that we're facing
So if you're going to set up some sort of a academy or what whatever
Uh gaya speed to you on that my friend. Let me know if I can help
You you are already
Employed as a uh professor once it gets there. I just haven't told you yet
Okay, um
Thank you. This concludes our ben versus break series with the exception of a number six. We're gonna have uh ask daniel
and his colleague nate about
Uh a three by three grid questions. Um, or any questions pertaining to uh, what we just discussed
Thanks. Thanks daniel
