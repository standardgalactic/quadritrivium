We have arrived at episode five in the series with my friend and colleague Daniel Schmockenberger called Bend Not Break.
In this final episode of the series we do an overview of short term, intermediate term, long term and
Culture, Political Economy, Infrastructure, a 3x3 grid and how do we think about responding to the upcoming
metacrisis, to the upcoming great simplification?
At the end Daniel and I invite
viewers to put
questions in the comment section on YouTube for what we might do a follow-up episode on.
This was quite a journey. We
Wended our way through the fifth episode and I hope you enjoy it. Without any further ado, here is Daniel.
Greetings my friend.
Good to see you my friend. Happy to be back. You too. You look especially wise today.
Yeah, that happens when I don't trim the beard for a while. It's a nice effect. You had some wisdom
30 years ago or whenever that was you chose to move from Iowa to San Diego.
It's gonna be zero Fahrenheit here tomorrow night. It's freaking ridiculous man.
I don't know why I've chosen to live here because you can't exercise.
You're like, yeah, I'm gonna go for a snowshoe and you go outside and I know I'm gonna go watch a podcast.
So I am it's very cool. I might say this is the grass is always greener thing, but I miss it. I
Actually love snow. I love
particularly my body is happiest in the mountains and the snow and
the
Feeling of the cold air and the lungs and everything. Yeah, I love it. So I hope you enjoy it some in between the yeah
I do enjoy it some but my body is happiest in like 60 degree misty old-growth redwoods
Your round I would take it. All right, you're obviously there and investing in a long-term climate change resilience strategy. Oh
Yeah, well that would be a full episode on itself
the the the medium-term models show this Minnesota, Wisconsin area that I'm I live in not too bad, but
You know that that's a huge huge topic
So my friend we have arrived at
What I expect will be the conclusion of our series that we initially titled Bend versus break
based on the logic that
We have unpacked these last four episodes
Between humans how we use energy materials and monetary markers to create technology
and
There is an embedded exponential growth in our current system combining these things
That is heading us towards an inflection point
The inflection point is if we are able to continue to grow that has a bigger environmental impacts more material energy use
CO2 and other things if we're not able to continue to grow
There is a wily coyote
biophysical moment that we have to prepare for and
your work with
Consilience project and my work with the great simplification and the Institute for the Study of Energy in our future are
to
Change the initial conditions of these future moments
And kind of meet the future halfway
So that we bend the civilization trajectory instead of break and break would be bad
So I think we've
you know done a horizontal and vertical
treatment of the risks and the
the drivers and the generator functions of
humans for thousands of years arriving at this point at the end of the last episode
You preferred a three by three grid on how we could think about
Responses interventions mitigations what to do and it was superstructure social structure
infrastructure and
triage
transition and long-term and this podcast we're gonna we're gonna unpack that first of all if I say
Superstructure social structure infrastructure. We're gonna have the word structure and like 270 sentences
Is there a shorthand for those three that we could use?
Yeah, so those terms come originally as far as I know from Marvin Harris's work and
the
what's called cultural materialism and
But that draws from previous work of Marx and other people
Superstructure basically means culture means the
coordinating values the identity the
Aesthetics ethics axiology that a civilization is oriented towards so we'll just say culture. It's simplifying but we get it just
social structure basically means the
codified processes by which
Agreement across the population occurs. So this is both. This is a political economy
Basically go to the intersection of economics governance and the institutions that mediated
judicial system law
The scientific institutions that are needed, etc. So we'll just call that political economy and then infrastructure means the
totality of the physical technical stack
that the civilization uses to support itself and meet all of its physical needs that's
Energy transportation
Manufacturing materials waste management blah blah blah all those things
Food water. So we'll call that tech
So by tech here, we don't mean software or social media
We mean the totality of the human technology and sometimes we use the term infrastructure because it's common
but if we just say technology
Political economy and culture that roughly maps to this thing now
We already did this thing in episode two or four or whatever it was so people can have that reference and
Yeah, I'm very happy to have arrived at the
Point in the podcast that many people have been looking for where they're asking
So what are solutions?
And we will get to share some things that are hopefully inspiring while simultaneously
Probably disappointing people that we're not going to offer something that looks like one easily tractable simple thing that they can
Go do something about that solves everything
Something I wanted to say is just in recap
This episode will really be much more useful people have watched the previous four if you've got the time to watch this one
And you haven't watched the previous ones. I would encourage that number one
we largely unpack a
core of Nate's work regarding the relationship between energy the environment the materials economy and finance and
Really a fundamentally critical thing to understand what break will mean and what bin requires
Bin not break is obviously a term you have used for a long time and then we're kind of going back and forth on models here
number two and number four are unpacking
Additional frames for what we call the metacrisis and we had a little break with number three where unintentionally we ended up talking about
Psychologically, how do we hold being aware of the intersection of all the possible catastrophic risks and having any sense of human agency and
So there's like a psychological interlude number three and
So given that we have framed the problem set in a particular way
We'll be talking about solutions in light of that or if someone doesn't have that framing some of what we're talking about
We'll seem like it doesn't make that much sense. I'm just offering that as preface for everybody
Excellent and
Those will make available and I'd like to have Lizzie
The podcast curator maybe do a summary of all five of these in one place
So at the risk of delaying the punchline even further, I do have a couple other things to add
When we talk about this three by three grid culture political economy
tech stack and then
Short-term intermediate term long-term
It also is relevant
two other frames number one
What do people care about? There may be people listening who just want to protect themselves and their family to what's coming
There may be other people that deeply care about dolphins and cetaceans and other species
There may be people listening that work for governments or
institutions
And I think what someone cares about is relevant to
What we should do?
number one number two is there's the the scale of
World government national government local regional
Community neighborhood individual family and I think the what to do in your three by three grid
Will be different for those different scales. So I don't know how we want to treat that in this conversation
Yeah, I mean all there's a lot of things that need done, right? There's a lot of things that are not
in eminent catastrophic risk, but that are maintaining the
not the quality of life for existing life and also maintaining
Things that would become a catastrophic risk to at least that local area if they weren't attended we want
the nurses and the people that work at the animal shelter and the police officers and the firefighters and the educators to
Actually become increasingly passionate about what they do
Even though what they're doing isn't at the scale of how does it solve all of climate change or AI risk or nuclear risk?
The idea that people would in the face of those things become less passionate about the thing
they're doing would just start the cascade of everything getting worse faster and
so
if
What you have in the scope of agency that you can do something about is not the totality of the metacrisis
But it is something real your connection to something real and paying attention to and focusing on the part
You can do something about
Recognizing that the metacrisis is caused by the activity of all all people cumulatively
It also has to be addressed by the activity of lots of people
Yeah, that's very important. I want to make sure that we say and we mentioned this in number three that we want
These conversations to help contextualize where you are in the world help you think about how to do a more effective job
Even at a local scale or even in a narrow vertical
But ultimately to enhance your sense of the meaningfulness of everybody's actions rather than otherwise
The brief aside from what you just said
You mentioned people working at animal shelters every week my girlfriend and I buy five powerball tickets and we've agreed if we win
We're giving all the 10% of the money to
Animal shelters to protect dogs, especially
That are also going to go through the great simplification. You know, there's
100 million dogs, etc
in this country, so
That's something I think about a lot
But that's just a tiny tiny thing out of everything that we're going to discuss
So so let's get into it. So we we know the problem set roughly
And the problem set is huge and it goes beyond what we've discussed
We didn't talk much about climate or insect loss or some of these things
We know the problem set. We've got the framing short-term long-term
intermediate term and the and the different
lenses so
Before we get into that, how does one even begin to think about what to do like what would be the intellectual
Structure for how to think about this and what not to think about maybe
Um, there's a few things I want to share that
might seem like non sequiturs, but I think they're valuable frames
One is um
I remember a long time ago reading
books on leadership and psychology and business and
um
Then looking at the psychology of typology whether you're looking at Myers-Briggs or other systems of typology
And it was clear how
Someone had succeeded in a particular business with a particular typology and then said these are the principles of success
That would totally not apply to someone of a different type in maybe a different sector
So like Warren Buffett would not do a good job at Steve Jobs's job or vice versa
And so if Steve read Warren Buffett or Rockefeller's principles on how to be effective
They just he'd just be like I have to give up like I have no chance. I'm not an accountant mindset. I'm and so
what I'm going to share
The immediate application of that is we have tens of thousands of people listening to this that are going to have wildly different
temperaments and value systems and
at skill sets everything else
So pay attention to of all the things you hear anywhere the ones that feel
Like they make sense to you and actually empower you and pay more attention to those because
You know, I might share principles that have been useful to me
That might not be that useful to you. You have different dharma different passions different typology different mind
Things Nate finds useful. So take these as hopeful offerings
But ultimately if they don't feel empowering then leave them and find other things
Hopefully though we can share some things that can be adapted to any typology that are general principles
That's one thing I wanted to say preface
The next thing I wanted to say actually goes back to animal shelters
um
I I grew up
Spending a lot of time working and volunteering in animal shelters and then animal rescues whether there was animals that come from
circuses, you know various places um and
in
Homeless shelters and just you know, the I had parents that were into activism and and taking us to be socially engaged and
And so I grew up like just not being able to walk by a dog
That was in bad shape or a cat that was in bad shape or a person on the sidewalk
It was in bad shape and like feel like it was okay to walk by and
It was actually that work that got me into the macro systemic work
Because working in the shelter and seeing how many of the dogs are being put down while people are still buying new
bread puppies and like then
feeling the
Great success of working my ass off to get a couple dogs adopted
But then seeing the scale of it right and then seeing that's just dogs, right?
That's not cows in factory farms
I started thinking at scale but motivated by the high touch this dog, right this cow
There's a lot of people who think about existential risk like the ea community or rationalist community
They think about existential risk in a very abstract way not having actually touched
This is an existential risk to this person living in this
refugee camp or in this ghetto or this dog or this whatever
and
It's abstract. It's on it can be almost an intellectual curiosity rather than an expression of actually embodied care
And it can even be worse than that. It can be like
A topic that seems like it has power associated
and
so
if
someone
Can walk by the people on the street and not notice that much and if they
Aren't actively bothered by the situation animals are in I don't trust those people to be thinking about catastrophic risk
Um
I only want like I only really want to trust people thinking about
Metasystemic stuff who actually ground it because otherwise you can you can say well long-termism in the future this many
Trillions of people might die if we don't such and such therefore
We should do these things now and these things now might cause lots of harm
But it's a good expected value calculus utilitarian calculus long-term and it's like or you know
We have to do this war
But here's the benefit and we'll try to minimize collateral damage
It's like minimize collateral damage means how many moms are watching broken babies and that are civilians and bomb buildings
It's like don't call it collateral damage. Don't sanitize it like
so
But the people who are high touch and who can't walk by
What does high touch mean? I haven't heard that meaning word before
Rather than high abstraction or thinking about the high tech that a high orientation to
The actual touch right like working with this animal like, you know, how much time you'll spend rehabilitating one dog
Or one animal that's covered in oil one seagull and you're like fuck
This is a lot of time right, but it's totally worth it when you're with that one and then you think about scale
and
If you don't move to scale, obviously you can't address the issues at scale
For for most people that's fine like doing the high touch thing is fine
If you feel like you can think systemically you can't lose the high touchness
otherwise
The abstraction can make
you
Disconnected enough to do evil in the name of moral things
and
That's a challenge, but here's the other challenge that this harkens back to our video number three
is
the more high touch
you are
Given world events the more likely you're going to be overwhelmed in in what's going on and not be able to do things at scale
Because it's too overwhelming
So you can be high abstraction and try to do things at scale, but then you're not connected in the way that you're just describing
yeah, so
If you really if your heart is open and you feel and you see what I'm in new york city right now
It's not where I live
And it's cold this time of year and it's a fucking terrible place to be homeless and cold and
If you let yourself feel that now it's just in istanbul and there were four million syrian refugees there
and there were
You know, they didn't speak the language and we don't speak the language necessarily of other places. We might have to flee
I saw a kid who I was talking to whose parents were both killed and the war
He wasn't asking for anything
He was just hiding because he said if he gets anything everybody well is violent towards him to take his stuff
and it was like
If you let yourself feel that it's easy to just feel completely broken right and
Um
And and or get completely pulled into I just need to be at this refugee camp working here
And not think about can I do something at scale?
this
spiritual psychological work
To feel the depth of those feelings and transmute it into more devotion and more agency and more strength to be able to serve
And keep that high touch and figure out how to do strategy effectively
Is the only way forward I know
Well
I hope you don't mind me sharing this publicly, but
In our private conversations. I have not criticized you but
Observed that that's one of the reasons you are not being more effective
Globally is because you can't say no to helping people
I know so many examples where someone is struggling with something and you're giving them time and advice
And there's just only a certain number of hours in the day
So your high touch
Is you know a little bit of a lodestone to really being effective, but let's let's just go forward with that
I think I understand your point
the thing there is
I struggle with it and there's so many places where
I don't say yes to helping someone that I really wish I could because it would be saying no to work on projects
that I really
Hope can change things at scale and believe can for a lot of people
But it's never easy for me to say no where I really could make a difference
And I don't want it to be easy for anybody like I struggle with it and I might make wrong choices
But I would like anyone to struggle with it
Right as opposed to just turn something off where then it's easy
I would not like people there's the dialectic of things to wrestle with I want someone to always be in the wrestling with
And it's interesting because someone can say like hey this thing is not as important
Because of scale
But the person who can harden themselves to the people around them
Will think wrongly and into it wrongly about how to make a good world at scale
I trust them less. I trust more
The person who feels the people around them enough that they have to do something they feel compelled to
And so this is where utilitarian ethics are not sufficient virtue ethics also are it's like the utilitarian ethics says
You know what is the expected value for the world of me doing this thing versus doing that thing
But of course I can't forecast all the fucking things and I can't forecast whether 10 days out
We're dealing with complex systems. I might be totally wrong
The virtue ethics says if you do the thing that has the most integrity in the moment
The next moment will unfold from a moment that had the most integrity in it
That also has limitations. You have to hold you have to hold them both together
We probably should be scaling the number of people that think that way rather than scaling the project that you or someone else is working on
This is why we're talking about this first on the show is and that's why I was happy that you brought up the animal shelter topic is because
How do you think about solutions? Well, you don't only think about it. You feel about it, right? You have to
Like when we talk about the meta crisis, we're saying you can't think about
Climate change and the economy and us china power dynamics separately. They affect each other
Obviously we see a war happen in eastern europe and we're going backwards on climate change in terms of fossil fuels and
So you have to think about all the world together
But the other corollary that is you have to use all the parts of yourself
Right, you have to use your intuition and your intellect
You have to use your passion and your kind of calm
dispassionateness
So how do I cultivate the all of the capacities of self in service of all the world?
Is how I relate to that
Head heart and spirit. I think you said on a prior episode
Okay, how else should we be thinking about this pre pre three by three grid? Do you have any other?
Yeah, before we get to the three by three
I think the three by three is very tangible and we will end with a couple things
I'd like to say are how not to think about solutions
Um, I think this can be very helpful to start. Um, first
I want to give an example that was actually really cool for me lately
Um
I just met some guys who are running an elite counterterrorism unit and
Uh, they had been special forces moved to domestic counterterrorism
and
Uh, a number of people's work Dave Snowden's work my work other people
They had been looking at and seeing how that could apply in these domains
And have come up with some very innovative strategies to be able to protect life more effectively
Well with less resources while also being less willing to cause
Harm to the other side in the process like they they really just increased their effectiveness
This is obviously a very empirical very tangible maximally high consequence type real situation
And the thing that they said and why we were talking
The thing they said that they had to train the guys out of the most who are already
Special forces counterterrorism, you know moved to counterterrorism guys was they had to move them out of
Uh thinking about solutions too quickly and into being able to assess the uniqueness of this problem
That is different than any problem. They've ever been in before because they too quickly want to
See which of the eight forms of drills they've done in the past
This is and yet as you're getting more innovative terrorism, it might not be any of the drills
It doesn't fit and so rather than look for which solution that I already know do I get a fit on this?
What they were training the guys to do is to be able to
Not think that their existing solution might be adequate so they could truly innovate so to start by saying
How do I assess the novelty of what's going on without letting my existing salience frameworks limit me?
And that that was the core of empirically what actually has been making them more effective
So a frequent periodic
Personal ooo of the oota loops in an individual's way of looking at the world
Observe orient often
Decide act when people say what's the solution?
They want to jump straight to decide and act without
understanding the observe orient well enough
And then oftentimes they have frameworks like the answer is and they know what the answer is
So then of course they have a hammer and they're looking for nails
But it means that their observation is actually dead end because they have existing solution frameworks
They're trying to apply so they're trying to look for which of my existing solution framework supplies or where can I apply this thing?
And as a result their observation to novelties didn't
So
It was very interesting to see an environment that high consequence and that empirical
Where they were testing the shit out of different training methods in you know, live training scenarios
Coming up with the thing that messed the most qualified tactical operators up
The most was them looking for solutions too quickly rather than being able to drop that and really actually assess the novelty of this situation
So I just want to offer that first
Um
Because I do find that the impulse to jump straight to solution is an uncomfort with uncertainty
That doesn't want to actually not know what to do and feel like this consequential stuff
But that makes it more likely you do the wrong thing
and it's more important to just
Be able to chill the fuck out enough that you can actually observe the real novel situation and come
Up with appropriate novel solutions
And so the comfort with certainty the comfort with uncertainty allows you to observe well, which allows you to strategize well
That's one prerequisite idea. I want to share
I like it
It can be taken too far. I've been
Chilling the fuck out and observing and orienting for 20 years on this before deciding and acting
Because that's kind of my job
But I I totally agree with you. I think they're and this ties into people's identity and their jobs as well
It's hard to have
A solution or a set a suite of responses that is counter to one's built identity or their paycheck
Yes, I want to actually speak to
Two things there
I talk about perverse incentives oftentimes, so
obviously if someone has a
Fiscal incentive to externalize the cost they will blah blah, but it's not just a perverse incentive in the traditional economic sense
it's
If my job is measured in certain metrics, even if it's not a perverse fiscal incentive for me, but I'm
Whatever, I'm some un department focused on world food program focused on
Feeding kids or a refugee program focused on
Whatever the metrics are bed nets
I can
Do something
That will feed the kids
Through an environmentally unsustainable strategy that erodes the soil faster and causes dead zones in the ocean faster
Because those are the metrics that I'm tasked with
And so they're I think of that as a
Institutional choice architecture that is perverse to the totality of what the world needs
So it's not just perverse incentive equals greed. It's also that we can divide the the world up into this is yours to focus on where
Well, but that's fucking wrong if what I'm tasked with is just these few metrics and I can harm other things that are still interconnected
Me just actually doing what the institution requires of me optimizing those metrics
Even if they're for a nonprofit good or government positive things
Seemingly positive things can still be a corrupt choice-making architecture
so one of the things you want to think about is
Is there a mandate that I have that is too narrow to think well
To strategize well is because when you were saying earlier some people care about narrow things
Well, it's very likely that things that you don't think you care about directly affect the shit you do care about
If you don't think that you care about
Coral and oceans you're just wrong because when they die watch what happens to your life
Right, if you don't think you care about fluorinated surfactants passing planetary boundaries or
nuclear issues you're wrong like you do care about those
And so whatever you're focused on
You still don't want to harm shit that your life depends upon and that all the things that you care about depends upon
So you have to make sure that your choice-making architectures are not so narrow that you can't actually think
About what you're doing in context of everything else
You don't have to be trying to solve everything
But you do have to ensure that what you're doing here is considerate enough of the other areas that you're not causing
Externality there. That's a first general principle
And how do you do that?
Great, how does someone listening to this do that?
I want to come back to that
I want to say one thing first, but the how do we avoid externalities one of the best topics we can do for solution thinking
But what I wanted to say briefly first was just about you
Yes, of course, someone can do extended analysis and never act and as a result
Not be that effective and or even just hold delusions for a long time because they don't test them in the world and realize
Empirically it was wrong or whatever of course
I don't think that's your case at all. I like I want to just kind of acknowledge. I don't think you think it is
That there's so much importance in the climate change movement. There's so many brilliant scientists
associated with so many
climate research projects
And yet the overall narrative is very focused on mostly co2
a little bit methane and you know greenhouse gases as a whole and temperature rising as a result of this and
And the fact that that co2 is largely being produced by the burning of hydrocarbons
That is also completely attached to the growth of GDP that is also
Going to not be able to keep happening forever that portends a gazillion other fucking things
It's a critical part of that whole story your extended analysis being able to emphasize that and now
Being able to tie that into all the other areas in this podcast. I think is adding something
More valuable the world than if you had been on the front line doing climate change work your whole life
So I just want to thank you
I mean
I agree and the decide and act is I decided we need orders of magnitude more people thinking in systems
and caring with uh empathy and reason
And joining this conversation that was my decision and the podcast and my other work is that action
So thank you for clarifying that I kind of was
you know
self-deprecating that I do
observe and orient a lot
uh, and you know learning from you and tristan and
Learning from other people about geopolitics and nuclear risks. I mean, I'm I'm still observing and orienting the world that we live in it is
Fascinatingly complex and fraught with risk
Okay, getting back. Where were we?
Some degree the udda loop is not supposed to just live in an individual. It's supposed to live in networks of people that are coordinating
because
You should have a
soil scientist who is continuously
learning more about
how to
uh, effectively grow soil and what healthy soil is and you should have farmers that are taking that info and applying it in very practical ways
And they're not doing an equal amount of observing and orienting versus deciding and acting so
another principle that I would
share is
When you can't think about the whole problem set of the world and then think about you
As if you for any individual are going to be able to act in some way sufficient to the whole thing
You should care about the whole thing
but then you should care about
Lots of people's activity and service of that
And so how do you relate in network?
You know with everyone else and there will be some people who are much more like look
I can do shit tell me what to do. I can execute and there'll be people who are like
I am don't know how to politically execute. I don't have good interpersonal skills. I'm great researcher
In which case it's like this is what I mean about typologies. Great figure out where you
Where you actually can work your ass off all the time because you're
You're in live into by it. You enjoy it
So you can really excel and develop novel capacities and be in partnership with other people of different capabilities
But the default of the exponential tech the exponential energy use and the metabolism of our system
Has self-organized those typologies in the service of optimizing dollars or financial markers as our objective
So the typologies have all been structured in a way
That is not helpful to the future that we face. And so those typologies have to
Switch into maybe a different objective or parallel objective
Yeah, I mean we talked about this in number two. I think is that
Money equals optionality to do lots of things so
Money is a decentralized incentive system to incentivize people to figure out how to get better at making it and
which means novelty search and optimization do a better job of whatever you already figured out how to do
and
Obviously you can make money via production, but also extraction. You can make money via value adding but also externalization of cost and
So when we're talking about organizing towards these other purposes right towards a
Fundamentally different master. You might still have to figure out how to pay your bills
But it's not what is motivating you still you will need to be in coordination with other people who are similarly motivated to you
But have different capacities
Now can we come back to externalities how to avoid externalities?
okay, this
this is um
I think there's a couple topics that I want to mention before we get into the three by three
so
One is how to avoid
Externalities causing worse causing other problems in the process of trying to solve problem
The other is how to avoid feeling that the thing that you're doing is important enough the other enough passion over it that you don't
Under emphasize how important many other things are
um
In both of these speak to a kind of holisticness of consideration. So first on externality
I'm not going to give the examples of how
Trying to solve one problem causes others because we did that already in the conversation
So go listen to it, but it is almost everything
um
It's so easy to say we can bring electricity to these people by burning more coal or making a hydroelectric dam that will extinct all these
Species in this area um on the river or blah blah blah whatever it is
Now i'm not going to say there is no such thing as trade-offs. It is a childish view to pretend there are no trade-offs
What i'm saying is if you don't care about all the things if you haven't monitored all the things that are involved and care about them
All you will make unnecessarily bad trade-offs
And in the process you will also polarize the people that care about those things
So of course it is mature to realize there will be some trade-offs
But at least consciously look at and care about all of them and come up with the best synergistic
Satisfiers you can the thing that serves all the things that matter as best as possible
So on the topic of externalities, how do you
uh
How do you think through
Actually, I just wrote up a list of questions
That I think help people think through how to understand a problem space and how to understand a solution space
I'll send it to you as a document so you can include it in the show notes for this
But probably the externalities asks questions like if you're looking at a problem, whether it's
health care in my town or you know, too many hydrogenic deaths at my hospital or why there are so many
uh
So much soil erosion in this area or so much government corruption or whatever it is
um
In the assessment there are questions that are universally relevant like where in the system are their perverse incentives
Just see if we start to map where anyone has a financial incentive or a status incentive or a
Cover your ass incentive that is not aligned with doing the maximally good thing to the whole in honesty
Just by starting to notice that
And not in a partisan way right in the bipartisan all directions way you'll start to be like, oh
Well, of course this thing isn't going well because they're are these perverse incentives
um
Where is the biggest perverse incentive of all is
Profits as our cultural goal, which means I can buy this iphone
for 400 500 dollars, but if you included the external costs
It would be five thousand dollars and a lot more people wouldn't be able to afford it
so the fact that
the
externalization of cost to
The environment and poor people
Is what allows the market to exist and that if we actually had to do the accounting and pay all of the cost
So that we weren't stealing from anyone's balance sheet that the market wouldn't exist
and that um
Not a single would look radically different. I'm not sure it wouldn't exist but go on
It wouldn't exist as it does right like it not any area as they exist currently would be profitable
Everything would have to get restructured in some very deep ways
um
I think any anyone who's ever become a like artisan craft person and made
Stuff and then things about how cheap factory stuff is like god damn how like shut stuff should not be that cheap
Like it should we should have much less things that are much more expensive and much more oriented to reuse and durability
um
So yes, that is one of the very deep perverse incentives
But that means for any particular problem you're looking at look at within your area where there are fiscal perverse incentives
that particularly go against the problem you're trying to solve because those are that's where the opposition is going to come and
Then you can start to think through
Can we use law to bind this can we use collective value system and a
Cultural forcing function to bind this can we use a different profit motive and make them a healthier profit motive?
Where people are willing to pay for a more expensive thing because it's better, you know
So being able to say the humans that are doing the thing have some
Motivators can we look at the human motivators across the system and align them with the thing we're trying to do better?
That's just a question that it's very good for people to get good at thinking through
Another one is someone is thinking about a problem
And you think through what are all the problems upstream from this problem?
So they contribute to it. Let's say we're dealing with a
factory farm issue. Well people's value systems
And not caring about animals enough is one language and sanitizing and calling it
beef or pork rather than cows or animals
The invisibility is part of the problem putting it far away where nobody can see it
As opposed to having to actually interact with it. It's part of the problem
The financial incentives are part of the problem the and so if your solution
Whatever the solution is there's one thing but it doesn't address many of those things those things are still going to show up somehow
Right like the classic example I give of when the poachers couldn't poach the elephant, but they were still poor
You still had a macro economy that created poverty. They were in poverty
They were still a black market on animal products
They just moved to hunting other animals that were more endangered
If you don't want to protect the elephant and kill the rhino
Then or have the rhino get killed because those poachers have to move you have to deal with the poverty upstream
You have to deal with the mindset towards animals. You have to deal with the mindset of the people buying the product. So
um
That might not be something you can immediately execute on but you have to know that whatever solution
I'm doing right now is a partial solution. It's not a full solution
And if I don't work towards a full solution, I might just displace that problem
So if someone can do an analysis of here's a problem. What are all the things upstream from it?
And can I factor how to work on all of them? That's one
question
I have
More but you're about to say something on that one
Well, I was just going to say that since we started this series
One of the language changes that I've incorporated is I no longer talk about solutions
I talk about responses and there's a million responses rather than a discrete solution
So just minor clarification, but but keep going
Keep going although. I fear there may be episode six daniels three by three grid and episode five is the preface to daniels three by three grid
but keep going
Richard Haas that
Head over at cfr writes out the difference between problems and predicaments and solutions versus management
and that's a good framework that
problem, I know of his work. I've not read that
The problem is
Discretely frameable and admits a complete solution
Predicament doesn't admit a complete solution. It admits ongoing management because there will be conflicting forces or conflicting trade-offs or whatever
Um, so yeah, even just the reductive thinking about a solution as if it's a static thing
And then it's done in a situation that is very complex
Is itself not thinking adequately. So yes
Um, so you think about so here's a problem or your predicament the situation you're wanting to improve
You think about all the stuff upstream. You also want to think about all the things downstream if I
Whatever solution that I'm looking at doing will have effects other than just a few intended ones
This is the one of the key insights is that when we cause when we generate a solution
Whether it's a new piece of tech that will solve the problem or a new law or a new business or a new
movement
Typically what we're doing is defining the problem in a narrow way
right the problem is
soil erosion in this area the problem is
Uh, the homelessness in this area whatever it is or the
The problem is cancer. So we need to do the immuno oncology. We define a problem some narrow way
And then we seek a solution that produces a first order meaning a direct effect to solve it, right
Typically, we're not looking for cancer solutions that decrease carcinogenesis. We're at large
We're looking for something that can cut a cancer out or burn a cancer out or poison a cancer out or
Tune an immune system to killing cancers. We're not looking
Highly upstream. So we're almost always looking for a direct effect
Right on whatever the problem is
So it's a first order effect
On a narrowly defined problem that we will think about so that we can measure if we're doing a good job in a small number of metrics
Right, we'll have how many cancer cells or how many inches of topsoil or how many parts per million of co2 or whatever it is
And or how much gdp per capita, but we're going to be measuring our success in a small number
Of fully explicated metrics from a first order effect. That's actually quite simple
epistemologically to wrap your head around
But that solution that I do will also produce second and third and nth order effects on a very large number of metrics
that we've never thought about
And some of those will not be positive
And some of them if this solution is going to overtake the problem
It has to be bigger or faster or have some more scale to it. Some of those externalities might actually be worse issues
Aren't you just really saying that our species is chosen to simplify our economy on the backs of
500 billion energy workers and we optimize dollars when we should
somehow mature to have a systems view of
Upstream and downstream effects and if we did try to measure those second and third and nth order effects
The risk and the complexity would be so much that we would just grind everything to a halt
No
That's not true that we would grind everything to a halt. Um, okay, though that will that though that will be the
justification for why to continue with the stupid thing
um, so
But am I saying something that is very much like men are not the web of life
We are stranded it would ever do to the web we do to ourselves think about seven generations into the future think more holistically
Yes, i'm saying something like that, but i'm going to try to actually make it more
Formalizable so that you can actually think about how to apply it
Not just feel it right, but it is it's saying something very commensurate to that when
When david bowman christian marty had their dialogues
In the 80s on what is the fundamental cause of all of the metacrisis the way they talked about
What's the fundamental cause of human conflict that leads to poor coordination and poor management?
And david bowman said it was fragmented consciousness
The underlying issue is being able to separate us versus them and benefit us at the expense of them
But they're just as smart and they up regulate stuff and so we just get arms races to make the the wars
larger and larger in their potential
or
Me versus you so we get
Class systems and everybody fucking each other even within the us right like we'll be an us when it comes to this nation versus that nation
But we'll be a me versus or an us when it comes to our company versus their company
But me versus you when it comes to ladder climbing within the company and office politics
Um or our species versus the other species in the earth or the right now benefit relative to the long-term harm
The ability to separate things that are in truth connected
To benefit one part while harming another part
But that ultimately those causal loops come back to harm everything the cause of all the problems is that it is a consciousness
That doesn't see how it all connects
If you see how it all connects and then you tend to all of it
only then
Only that is considerate enough to
manage the power of exponential tech
Go ahead
Naive question. So the fractured consciousness
Is that a human thing or do dogs and uh elephants have fractured consciousness?
No human thing. Yeah, um capability
to
Take this whole totality of experience
and then start naming everything
And making things separate right having a semantic interface being able to have a symbol that I can relate to
That relates to the represents the ground, but it's not the ground
This is what makes us so powerful is because we can up regulate one part relative to another part right our toolmaking is the ability to
Take my fist and say I want more of that make a hammer right a stone tool or take my ability to bite something and make a sharp knife or
Um, it's the ability to say I want more of this part and how do I increase it?
But increase it at the expense of what what is becoming less?
What where is the cost happening if our technology is not that much and there's not that many of us so what?
When our technology becomes profound and there's lots of us
Then it's a big so what then then us versus them can equal a war that kills everybody and the us versus nature equals planetary boundaries
It kills everybody so the same consciousness that was viable because there were not that many of us and our tech was not that big
But the poor stewardship of tech
the poor stewardship of our power meaning
Poor in terms of whatever we're externalizing the harm to
Um that same mindset
Does not get to steward exponential power
It self-terminates
So either
If we are to not self-terminate we must have the wisdom to be able to steward exponential power
And it is something like exponentially more wisdom than we have been operating with
And it's not impossible
But it is and this is where we said
Culture political economy tech
There is some radical cultural shifts that have to occur to
Instantiate a political economy that is the will of the people
But where the will of the people doesn't is not a will that wants to benefit some people at the expense of others
And some people in the moment at the expense of our future and people at the expense of nature
If the government that is going to bind the tech and the economics is not an instantiation of the will of the people
It'll be oppressive
And then it has to justify violence to oppress the people and then it'll become corrupt and whatever
So the government
Has to be an expression of the will of the people
But if it's a will of the people who want what harms each other that also doesn't work
So you have to basically do the culture work
To have people recognize that which they are fundamentally interconnected with
To then be able to have that
Expressed in a system of law that binds the economics that can bind guide and direct the tech
Which is where the physical power is
to be
viable
That conceptually makes sense should we move into the three by three grid then?
And how should we
Okay, almost
On externalities
It's important to say
So how do you think through externalities better to avoid them?
So we were saying think through the upstream stuff because if you don't solve some of the upstream
Causes of the problem. It's very likely they will be displaced somewhere else
Think about the downstream stuff of whatever you're going to do so that you aren't
Going to cause problems to something else that matters
Could you give an example of that upstream and downstream on the level of the individual and a product or something?
Sure
I'm wanting to bring food to people in an area where there's food insecurity
Is my strategy going to increase the power of warlords to be able to capture huge surpluses of food and increase that
type of
Political instability in the area. Is it going to create increased dependency on other countries that are going to actually
erode the
Culture of the people feeling like they have any agency
Is it going to use agricultural methods that actually kill more pollinators and more topsoil and cause more dead zones and oceans?
Those are
Not the core problem I was trying to solve I was trying to solve food insecurity, but I don't want to make warlords worse
I don't want to erode the will of the people thinking they have no agency and I don't want to ruin the environment
so I have to say
How do I think about this problem?
And the how do I think about the connected problems well enough because can I bring sustainable agriculture?
permaculture type things that don't hurt the soil actually make the soil better and grow it rather than not
That are inherently be centralizing rather than centralizing so they don't cause the warlord thing that increase the agency of the people
It just means we have to deepen the understanding of the problem space enough to notice which solutions
Will be
vital
You're really talking about
embedding systems
thinking systems ecology in a central role in our governance systems
And in our culture in the way that everyone thinks better
Yeah, but we have no incentive to be systems thinkers in our culture right now
Unless you're a hedge fund or a teacher
well
two things
Not all motivation is
Extrinsic incentive is an extrinsic motivator where someone else is getting you to do something
And where I'm doing it because of what I get out of it not because of my intrinsic motivation to the thing itself
so
If I am trying to run a civilization where there's a lot of labor to do and nobody really wants to do all the labor
And so we have to incent them to do the labor because otherwise we have to beat them to do the labor
You know like so we can in slavery by having wage slavery or something like that
But people aren't doing the things they want to do it. They're doing the things they want them on me for you know
some other purpose
Intrinsic motive is is also a thing right so people's value systems the culture work is I do certain things not because I'm going to get anything
Financially from it or necessarily even status from it, but because I just intrinsically care about the thing right so one is
We're talking I think most of the people listening are spending hours listening to this thing and they're not getting paid
to listen to this and some of them
might be
Taking this to their job as a consultant because they sound smarter and they get paid but probably mostly not probably they're investing time doing this because they
Just authentically care independent of incentive
And there's a culture wide
Starved for intrinsic motivation and purpose right now, but go on
I think the future is defined much less by extrinsic motivators and much more by intrinsic motivators
This doesn't mean there won't be any extrinsic ones
So of course we have to design our incentives and our deterrence better
We have to solve for perverse incentives and like that
But that that's not the whole of the story. It shouldn't even be most of the story, right?
And then there is also an incentive to care about these things which is
non extinction as a good incentive
like just even from a personal extrinsic point of view if I don't work to take
to
affect the world's trajectory and if I don't work to help other people to affect the world's trajectory
It might preclude anything that I care about
So I would say there is not an incentive in the formal monetary systemic sense for a lot of people
But that does not mean that there's not both intrinsic and extrinsic reasons if you pay attention
Okay
Okay, so we were saying upstream downstream things externalities we were saying
The solution is generally oriented to produce a first order effect
On a small number of defined variables
But we have to think through the second third fourth order effects on a large number of variables
So we don't know what are how do we do that? The first part is
I want people to endeavor to do it
Completely while knowing they never can
Your best externality analysis will still miss it that there's no way you could have thought of
But I want you to try to think of everything as best you can and then knowing that you didn't think of everything
I want you to have some kind of broad listening and watching after you do it to see what might be being affected
that you wouldn't have even expected
and
Did we expect when smartphones came out that
They would have the effect on dinner tables or human attention in relationships or
porn addiction or people's ability to study or we didn't expect those things so
We might have anticipated some so anticipate all the things you can
But also maybe even in the visual human focal length of focusing on 2d things that affix focal length so much of the time
and the effect of losing our navigation and orientation and what are the things that does
Neuro psychologically so what I would say is you have to do the best job
Of
Anticipating externalities you can while recognizing there will be ones you didn't anticipate
So you want some very broad diffuse listening to say after we started this thing
What's what new things started to occur that might have been connected?
Are you kind of talking about the precautionary principle?
totally um, but I'm talking about specifically how to think about applying it right and
so we're talking about a holistic principle and a precautionary principle, but we're trying to
Formalize it as like a way that people can think about applying this thing. So
first
How do you think through the externalities on second third fourth order effects?
By talking to more people with different perspectives about the thing
That's the first really key part. This is where diversity of perspective and pluralism is really a real thing
If I'm thinking okay
I'm going to solve this issue. I'm going to protect this area of the amazon from being harmed by this combination
Of law regarding mining rights and regarding agriculture rights and etc
Okay, cool. Sounds good
Go talk to the indigenous people about the solution and they'll be like
No, no, no, there's some other groups that did things like that and here's what happens
The they just hire mercenaries that do this thing or it gets worse for this reason or whatever and you're like, oh fuck
I didn't know that
And go talk to the legal scholars
And they're like, oh, there's no way to implement this in law because of such and such and go talk to the economists who are like
Law is written by lobbyists and they have more money to keep writing law than you do. You're going to lose this one and go
You go talk to the environmental scientists and they'll be like actually you're protecting the wrong part of the forest
there's not even high biodiversity here relative to this area and
So
There's a lot of people who will know stuff that you don't know
And they will be able to see where some of the externalities will occur
Including people that are on the opposite political side of the thing, right? Whoever would fight against it
There's something that they care about that is really even if they're wrong about some stuff
They're not wrong about a hundred percent of everything
So finding out why do they not like it and say how can I factor that in so one?
I can not cause the problems for them
And as a result decrease their enmity and maybe get them as allies rather than fighting the thing, right?
You'll become both more successful and it'll be a better solution
So the way to think through externalities better is when you come up with a possible solution talk to lots of people about
What might be wrong with it? So red team it
But then don't give up say ask them. Okay. How would you make it better to still serve the thing?
I'm wanting to serve but to improve the thing that you're seeing
And so you use it as a proposition or design refinement process
And so that's the first part and then the second part is once you
Implement it try to implement it in experimental ways, right? You have some safe to fail probes. You don't implement the largest thing possible
Okay, I think we figured out that this
This version of ai or this genetically modified organism is safe. Let's just fucking take it everywhere
Maybe our safety experiments were not totally complete. Let's do contained experiments
So the first thing is think through it well, right?
Which you can't do on your own
The next part is run some experiments and try to do if you missed stuff that will show up in the experiment
Try to do it in a contained way
Right
And then as you implemented at scale there will still be stuff that you missed
So have a broad listening and ensure that when you find where something is being harmed and you need to change the strategy
Doesn't mean you stop it means you update it that you maintain the governance capacity to do so
That you haven't turned it over to where now that it's initiated the fiduciary responsibility to shareholders means you can never change
That thing or whatever mean ensure that the governance structure is such that when we learn new stuff the underlying thing can be changed
And when you say you uh, who do you mean by you in this case try to do anything
Right, we're talking to people here because on the chance that people here are going to try to
They're running a non-profit or they're running a
Institution or they're wanting to build a thing if you are wanting to
Do things these are things to keep in mind
And if you are supporting someone who has more agency than you in the organization or whatever, these are things you would help support them with
So I haven't heard you frame this holistic precautionary logic of the last few minutes
Did you just like have a sandwich yesterday and come up with this or?
No, I think this is like actually
This is the thing that I would arguably like to start with it
but
If someone doesn't have the metacrisis frame, they don't yet it's not obvious that the way we
Try to solve problems is the cause of the other problems and is a major part of the generator function of the metacrisis
And so once you've understood that then you can be like, okay
So part of how we solve it is by a much more holistic
Set of frames and how we go about doing things
Um
And now I don't think this is impossibly hard to teach or train. I think this should be
Being trained in k through 12 education at various levels of development
I think that people who are learning
anything from design science to
Becoming technologists to being lawyers or studying political economy should be thinking and being trained in these things and thinking through the specifics in their domains
Okay, now the next part is I want to identify two types of externalities
Physical externalities and psychosocial externalities
A physical externality is where we do something to benefit
We do something that has a physical effect to benefit something
But part of the supply chain of that thing happening
Causes some physical harm somewhere
right
So we want water repellent coats and water repellent umbrellas and everything like that and we want industrial surfactants. So we make
um
fluorinated
surfactants to be able to do that
But then they go into the water supply and they're forever chemicals and they never break down and they're carcinogens and endocrine disruptors and neurotoxins
so that's a
You know where we want an herbicide to make agriculture more effective, but it messes up the soil bacteria and
uh
human health and whatever those are classic examples of physical externalities
Obviously co2 and climate change is a physical externality. No one is intending to cause climate change. They just want
generate energy
So everybody knows physical externalities. They didn't used to
But rachel carlson and friends kind of got people thinking about that now. I think everybody is at least somewhat aware
But that the supply chains that make anything happen
Have lots of effects. That's physical externalities
There are also psychological
A point on that
Is the physical benefits we get in terms of profits or services
um
Art on equal footing with the negative externalities that rachel carlson warned about and and others because those things happen
In the future and we're a biological species. So emotionally they have
And culturally they have very little weight in our brains
So that's why this stuff has happened because our capitalist
Exponential system has back loaded some of those costs that are second third order effects from our decisions and our products
Right, I'd actually like to explain a few reasons why it happened
so one is a lot of the harms will occur in the future, but the benefits occur now and so there is a
uh
A perverse orientation to now
It's also that whoever does the thing that provides more advantage now probably wins
Having more power to influence the overall system and those who don't do the thing that will cause the future harm
Also, don't get the power and then don't influence the whole system. So there's a perverse incentive not just a psychological bias
There's also a game theoretic perverse incentive to do that thing
Um, it's also true that as we were mentioning earlier
Making a tech that produces a certain benefit is epistemologically easier
than preventing all of the harms from doing so because
Creating a first order effect on a small number of metrics is just epistemically easier
Than considering nth order effects on a very large number of undefined metrics
So there is also something epistemically about it
and then
The other thing is that many of the problems
Only occur through very large-scale cumulative action, but the individual action produces my benefit
If I cut this tree down, I get money from the lumber
But I have just as much air to breathe
It's everybody cutting it down that messes up the atmosphere
But me not cutting this tree down doesn't make any seeming difference to the atmosphere
But it does make a difference to my balance sheet
So each person
The risk-reward ratio orients them to do the thing
Because the collective because the harm is more collective and the benefit is more personal
You have to factor all of those asymmetries
And then one version of this that I want to point out for people is that
There's obviously many narratives that tech will make everything better AI will solve all of our problems and
Health care is going to become awesome with genetic engineering and immuno-oncology and all those things and
Nanotech is going to make environmentally friendly everything manufacturing
And capitalism makes things better
There's obviously many narratives like the environment is fucked and every positive thing was the result of
First was only positive for a few and the result of colonialism and etc. There's partial truth to both of these
And there's obviously risks associated with AI that some people are aware of and benefits or of any tech
But there is a perverse incentive that's worth paying attention to
That those who focus on the opportunity more than the risk will get ahead more than those that focus on avoiding the risk
More than their own advancement of the opportunity even even in our hunter-gatherer days. That was probably true
And well even more now because
The hunter if he did something too risky might have died now. I socialized the losses of the risk. I can declare bankruptcy
I'm not going to jail limited liability corporation is just going to take a bit of a loss whatever
So I get to privatize the gains and socialize the losses. We can do an oil spill
It's not going to hurt me as the executive, but I am going to make money when I exploit more oil
Yeah, and
So the ability to privatize gains socialized losses
um
the
ability to
Cause some new tech
facebook social media destroying
Democracy in the social contract in the epistemic commons and yet no accountability for that thing
But just a fucked on the profit
um
I can always say afterwards. Oh, there's no way we could have known
But nobody tried to do the external calculus that I'm mentioning and or to the degree that anyone did they said shut up
We don't want to hear that and the focus was that's going to be amazing. It's going to connect the world
It's going to whatever the narrative of you're being too negative. Let's focus on the opportunity
Whoever runs that narrative will get wealthier and be able to upregulate the narrative and show the success and then highlighting the thing
Well, you've just described while I'm why I'm poor and still teaching but go on
So there is this as we move forward toward the tech now where one the we can't keep
Externalizing costs to the commons because we're too close to planetary boundaries
And the world is too fragile and two the new tech is way too fucking powerful the speed at which
Everyone got smartphones compared to the speed at which everyone got railroad or the plow, right?
It was like thousands of years for the whole world to get the plow
You know 100 years for railroad less than 10 years on the phone
It's like the speed and scope of impact and then you start to think about genetically modified or you know synthetic biology and AI
We can't keep externalizing exponential. We can't keep externalizing harm with exponential tech
So we have to get much more fucking careful on the risk reward, right?
And get less reward seeking and willing to externalize risk as a whole society if we're going to make it
We actually have to get much more conscious of that
And the default in
47 years is one human is worth a quadrillion dollars. Everyone else is serfs and it's a dead planet
Um
Yeah, that's one of the futures that we're not that interested in
Um, okay, where are we I interrupted you a couple times. Are you on on track?
you had another part of the externalities that
I kicked you off your social externalities psychosocial there are physical externalities
And the physical externalities were clear on they produce a physical harm on the environment or human health, right?
the psychosocial externality
um, and
They're not always perfectly preventable sometimes that you have to manage them like I'm on a laptop right now
One of the externalities of the convenience of being able to carry this computer as opposed to a desktop
Is that it's going to mess my neck up and almost everybody today has neck issues because they look down too much
And we're not supposed to look down physiologically evolutionarily that much so at home set your monitor off and you get the proper
you know
C-curvature in the cervical vertebra
I might not be able to have the benefit of portability and not have that but I can at least say all right
Well, don't be lazy and stay on the laptop when I get home really do get a raise monitor or so
The physical externalities don't only look like effects on the environment
They also look like the ergonomic effects and the behavioral effects and lots and lots of things
Tiny tiny observation. I knew everything you just said
But the social mirror neuron cultural evolution while you were saying that I straightened up in my chair a little bit subconsciously
So thanks
Funny how that works. So the psychosocial externality is that
my
technology or my movement or my whatever might also affect have an effect on
people's
experience people's
emotions beliefs
Identities not just individually which has a psychological effect but collectively which has a sociological effect and I'll give a couple examples
one of the biggest examples is
Anything that has to do with trying to win the minds and hearts of people right like how do we
um get people to really care about the climate change the
mask wearing the vaccine the whatever the thing is
um
typically we and
particularly
recently
egregiously we focus on
Who are intended audiences and how to be able to get?
Uh a political effect from that intended audience and we don't focus that much on how the people that will not agree with this respond
And there are many reasons for this in the u.s. Which has such an outsized media influence on much of the rest of the world
um
The nature of a bipartisan political situation and not having something like ranked choice voting
is
such that
Uh putting the other candidate down is actually and saying how bad they are and it'll be catastrophic if they get in is
Is actually a very empirically effective way to get people to vote or at least it has been
um
but of course
That other side then does the same thing if one side figured out a really effective communication strategy
The other side makes some innovations comes back. So one side gets in and they
Do whatever they do for four years the other side comes in and then undoes all that for four years
And most of the energy of the whole system just goes to inviting waste heat and no long-term continuity
so
what we're
We have to stop that shit that is so critical
So one thing for anyone who's developing solutions
That involve communication that involve any kind of public perception is to think about
Who's my intended audience awesome?
You know, what do I want them to understand and maybe do?
But who is not my intended audience and who's going to not like this message?
And what are they going to do? And am I radicalizing them? Am I polarizing them? Am I making them feel
Like what they care about is going to be attacked where they're more likely to become terrorists and you know, or more likely to whatever
That's an effect. That's an externality of my choice
I might have made a choice that seemed like
Coalescing these people to do this thing was good
But I actually just upregulated extremism or terrorism or total polarization in a critical audience and so
um one
Very simple, but this gets back to your example though that if you can get rich or elected from doing that
And you have made extremes of your enemies who cares as long as you win is the current logic
Yes, and so what I'm saying is if your politician is doing that and you actually care about the world more largely
They are the wrong
They have the wrong logic. That's not the thing to support
And if you are working to do
A non-profit thing or whatever and there's a media campaign involved. Don't do that thing. So of course
the world is where it is because
The things we're talking about are not widely practiced understood or implemented. There is a huge amount of
On either political side
correct and
um
But since you cannot actually kick the other half of the world off the planet and since they aren't just
Inert pieces of wood they do they are smart people with goals and values. They're political actors and
If if they if what you say anti resonates with them and they get up regulated to do a bunch of action
So it's true that when you villainize somebody else
You can coalesce a bunch of people against them and you can actually have moral people be willing to celebrate causing harm to others
That's very effective politically. It's it also happens to be evil
Um calling women witches allowed seemingly moral people to burn them to death right and calling somebody
terrorists or whatever
I don't think we've evolved that much from the burning witches era
I I wish people understood like the
The lynching was not long ago
right the lynching as like a
form of entertainment was not long ago the burning witches that
the
concentration camps of world war two the I mean there still should like that happening today. So how quickly
you know when you when you look at
the pictures of women wearing
Many skirts in 1968 and Iran and you know then the
The thing that happened in the Ayatollah and then the burkas when you look at how it well relatively advanced Liberia was and then the
Internal war and then child soldiers replacing what had been a economically prosperous area when you look at Syria recently
like
If you when you look at Ukraine you can have an area that seems peaceful and economically prosperous progressive and liberal
And it collapses and turns into war violence extremism
You know, etc. It goes from any skirts to burkas to whatever and so
Those are canaries in a coal mine of something that is possible for anywhere in the world people should in recognition of that
Not take for granted this the stability of where they are and not taking for granted or to protect it
That's the purpose of our work. I totally agree
keep going
so
you the making
They are anti-vaxxers is another word for witch
or terrorist
right
Or on the other side, they're sheeple or their
Lib tards or whatever it is like both sides have their terms to dehumanize
This might be politically expedient it is definitely moving us towards planetary extinction as a whole
Stop this if you are doing that thing, you are definitely not part of the long-term solution
You are orienting a short-term narrow thing at the expense of increasing enmity polarization, etc
So this is a place where the externality is psychosocial
So one thing I want to think about
Is who cares about this issue and then who cares about another issue that feels threatened by this that's in theory of trade-offs
What do they care about? How do I come up with a solution that could get more
Broad support and less enmity. It's just a more effective strategy also unless I don't care that the thing
I work real hard for gets undone in four years
But there are no groups of people that feel really good about being villainized and it will just sit
Comfortably and let the thing that villainize them continue to succeed
so
That's one example of a psychosocial externality, which is where you are
Trying to create fervency of belief in some population
Without really paying attention to what you're doing in that process through another part of the population
At year end 22
Daniel the externalities in our world are legion
both physical and psychosocial
and you know that philosophically and
Emotionally, I completely agree with what you're saying
But we are a tiny tiny tiny fraction of
The intellectual discourse on the web and the people that are listening to you right now
um, of course they agree with the sentiment of what you're advocating, but
The reality is this energy hungry super organism with the tragedy of the commons and exponential everything
That is what are the lever points to start to change
If you buy into what you're advocating, which I certainly do
You and I know that uh
The super organism, you know, there's
70 to 100 trillion dollars that trades hands every day that pretty much every one of those dollars has some externality associated with it
That's a that's a problem
and there's a exponential embedded growth obligation on it, which means exponential future externalities that are attached to the thing
and hitting the fragility
points of planetary boundaries like
What we're up against is a big thing and not only are people not educated to think and feel and care and
understand holistically
And like that
But they are continuously engaged in a media environment that will do everything that it can to capture them in a partisan political
outraged whatever kind of way
And they will actually use ai split testing to figure out what shit
Does that the most effectively in terms of what will show up in their news feed?
so the fact that we are
Dealing with some big issues here is obvious, right?
Like the the cards are kind of stacked in a in a rough direction
um
that now
What is the what is the thing we need the most of I think people that are oriented
I think everything we've been talking about today
People who are oriented with a very high touch like I actually care about sentient beings and want their life to be good
And I'm not just interested in talking about topics that have
power associated. I'm not interested in just virtue signalings
green something because
Make money in a fun that way. I'm like
It grounds in mirror neurons, right? It grounds and I know what suffering feels like I see it there
I want to solve it and I want to prevent it
People who are oriented that way who then also start learning how to be able to think at scale well
Which means that it has to implement large numbers of
people and technology and you know things in culture and the political economy and in tech, right?
and that
simultaneously think through these frameworks of how do I
Not jump to certainty in action too quickly but make sure I actually understand the problem landscape
The many things that are causing it the things that are downstream the people who care about something else
And how do I come up with not a solution but a series of solutions?
That actually addresses this and progressively gets more people on board
People that are capacitated this way is the rate limiting factor right now as far as I can see it
There are people who care but have very poor strategy the people who understand strategy well are mostly serving very narrow aims
so people who are kind of
Developed in these skill sets and this is why I'm excited to be talking about this with you here
This is why we're working on in a training modules and an academy to be able to do this like etc
So in the three by three grid
Culture political economy tech stack
triage meaning urgent near-term
transition and long-term
Education slash systems thinking is in all nine quadrants all nine boxes
yeah
So I'll say something else. I said there was one other thing and it relates to this that I was going to say up front
So one is how do you understand?
How to think about a solution in a way that will
Prevent unintended consequences, um, and that will be better said to to deal with in Manitzen
The other thing I said I wanted to talk about was that people can get
Uh
Fundamentalist about their particular solution
Because if you're working on something you should really care about it, but in really caring about it you can
Become overly narrowly focused. So when I was first starting to try to wrap my head around like
What is upstream from all of these various problems or what are the underlying causes that everything from
Nuclear war to environmental degradation to animal rights issues to class issues. What do these things have in common?
What do not a specific solution for one thing but a solution for civilization doing better look like?
I of course read the work of people and also had the fortune to talk to a lot of people that it's been their life thinking
about these things and work on them
and would ask their analysis and
I got so many answers that sounded like this
You know at
the end of the day
Whenever somebody uses a phrase like that at the end of the day or the key is you can usually expect a reductionist thing to come next
Um, not always but you like, you know, sometimes you want to pay attention to that at the end of the day
Uh
Really the thing we have to shift is the economy because perverse economic incentive is under the whole thing
There's no way that as long as you have a for-profit military industrial complex
Is the largest block of a global economy that you could ever have peace. There's a anti-incentive on it as long as
There's so much money to be made with mining, etc
Like we have to fix the nature of economic incentive and I'd be nodding. I'm like this makes perfect sense, right?
And then somebody else would be like
you know, the core of the thing that we have to address is
education because
You can have so much change occur in a generation if those children are growing up
Different as as different as it is learning Chinese is your first language versus learning English
We're so neuro plastic by the time we're adults. We're not that neuro plastic. We're kind of screwed if you get education, right?
We want adults who care about the animals and the oceans and
Can tend to all of these things and can think complexly if we really get education, right?
We'll be able to solve everything it's upstream from all that and like I'm nodding
I'm like, oh, yeah, this is it and then somebody else would be like no really the thing is it's about media because
We're continuously being bombarded and that was before social media then it was social media
We're being continuously bombarded and we are ready to go do a capital riot or a george floyd protester riot
Or or whatever it is based on the stuff that's coming in
If we could change the media environment of what people were in taking
It would change all of these things and someone else like none of the thing is really at the end of the day
it's about
Government and law and how do we get that right because the economic incentive
Wouldn't be that same issue if we could govern it properly if we could force the internalization of the price of carbon and get
Carbon pricing properly and get costs of everything proper all that would be fixed
But we have to do that through law. So how do we fix governance and law and then somebody else would be like
You can't because law is written by lobbyists that get paid for by somebody and wherever the economic motive is is
What's going to pay for that? Which is why you you have to think about
Economics and law together so the key is political economy and how do you get that so and on and on people would say no
Really the key is actually parenting what we've really got to do is restore the family because before education
By the time that kid goes to school at five or six that so much of their identity and psyche and value system is already set
It happens early on
We have to actually change the entire culture to have parenting emphasize raising better kids from the beginning
And and what I came to learn is they were all right
Right somebody else would be everything you're saying is so anthropocentric
The key is the fucking environment because we're none of us or anything without the environment
Like you have to prioritize that everything else doesn't matter that much
And what is an economy like we can breathe without money. We can't breathe without air
And so be less anthropocentric and focus on the integrity of the environment because that's upstream from everything
And so what I what I learned was
The answer to all of the problems is all of the solutions
Um, there is not a series of chains. There's an ecology of series of change. It's so often someone says what is the solution?
It sounds like someone's saying like
What species is the forest?
Like I don't know what you're even asking like a forest has lots of species lots and lots and if it's an old growth forest
It's even more complexly interacting. So what is the solution? There's not a solution
There's lots of things that need to happen. So if anything I want
Patterns of how to think about it and I want frameworks for how to think about it
And I don't want people to attach to those frameworks because they'll be useful but also limiting
and to realize
the cultural aspects do involve education and media and parenting
and
Religion and lots of other things and the structure of cities
and you know in the political economy aspects and well lots of things and so and um
the
getting past the
Zealotus and reductionist focus and being able to get how do all these things come together
is
key to understanding properly
I love that I got the systems ecology equivalent of goosebumps as you were unpacking that
And that's exactly right and but that's a lot for
the
That's a lot of complexity for most people to hold in their mind because
They're they've worked their whole life on climate
And they think climate is the single
Problem and their identity is attached to it their job is attached to it. So to say it's all these things governance
and love and
Law and pricing and everything that you just mentioned
What how does someone shift from where they are now to that more holistic?
view of our of our system not only to think about it, but also to apply it to their work and their lives
I don't know if you want to answer that now, but I'm curious
If you are young and you're listening to this and you're thinking about how do I do the most useful thing with my life and
Do I go to college or not or do I go back to college or what kind of work do I do?
um
For most people here's something I would offer
Figure out if you are not already independently wealthy if you are awesome figure out how to
Keep your overhead as low as possible
And make the money that you need to live in the least number of hours possible
Doing something that isn't terrible
So you buy most of your time back to continue to train yourself on what is actually yours to do
This is what I did with my life and many of the people I know who
I really respect did something like this where
um
you know I
Rather than okay, I've got the basic bills paid. Let's make more money and get more shit
It's like no no the the more shit is way less interesting than actually the time
I want my time back so that I can keep understanding these things
So I can know how to have my life actually be meaningful and
So it's both the learning and the development of capacity
So if you are young still and you're in this interest
Figure out how to keep your overhead low figure out how to pay your bills in the least amount of hours doing something
That isn't terrible and really keep investing in developing
How you and now if there's already something that you feel very called to do
Then and it feels right then do it and keep investing in your development in the additional hours both, right?
If we're talking about someone who
Has kids in a mortgage and a job and whatever
um
If the job is not clearly
Making things better in a way that is aligned with your dharma be willing to change at all
Like
The shortness of your life and the urgency of the situation of the world
Is such that like be willing to do that
If you're mostly in the right direction, you just feel like you wish you could do even more then
Continue to do what you do while studying. Is there a way I could do this with even more?
Insightfulness as you start learning how to think through externalities and system dynamics better
It might take a year or two of study while you're doing this to start to come up with insights
But maybe in a few years you're actually revolutionizing the field that you're in
um
The other thing I would say is
People when you say like hey, it's a lot of complexity
The the world situations are complex reducing them to be too narrow is at the core of everything wrong
We can optimize some things harm other things we have to
And when we can act very powerfully because we can act through
Six continent supply chains and supercomputers and satellites and ai and um and steam engines and
I mean the oil engines and like all of the powerful tools from
The industrial revolution on
You just can't do that in an oversimplifying way
ongoingly
right like the
Where the model of what you're optimizing is not reality
Is where reality gets harmed you don't get to do cumulative and exponentially growing harm forever on a finite world
So we do have to actually wrestle with the reality of the world
Which means the complexity of it. It is what it is. We don't get a like it just is what it is, right?
and
Now not everybody has to to begin with because we go back to each of those partial narratives
It's just about media. It's just bad education. It's just bad economics. Well, let's say somebody
Is resting with all this and really thinking how do I make a better educational system? And maybe they have
Maybe they have a transitional version and a long-term version
Right the long-term version might be like a radically different system of education
That is based on a different system of community development
Where school is not just a centralized thing. It's how the parents and how the extended family and community are all
Supported to support the development of children. I mean, maybe that's some long-term future of education
And maybe it involves AI tutors and shit
Maybe the immediate transitional thing involves
Are there some curriculums and systemic thinking and whatever that we can start to add to existing?
Curricula and is there a way of getting that through that both requires me to think through the content the pedagogy and the political
Actuation needed to make it happen
Um
Not that many people
Have to be thinking effectively to get something to happen that will train a lot of people to where there's now a lot more people
In the same way that it didn't take that many people to make facebook to affect the minds of lots of people
So it wouldn't take that many people to make new media systems
That think strategically enough about how would we get met calf dynamics and how would we get the people on there? Whatever?
That could be oriented very differently
and the same with perverse incentive if
some people figured out how to
If some people figure out how to
Make laws that make particularly bad things for what's their current incentives illegal whether it's fishing or whatever or create better
regenerative economic systems or
Then everybody else who doesn't understand the whole complexity just has a slightly less perverse incentive system
Like a lot of the complexity is built into a better incentive system incentive legal system
So not everybody has to get everything to begin with
Some people being able to do that and build things that affect other people at scale
and affect the world at scale is how
The thing starts so I don't want anyone who is
Wrestling with like okay. I I want to understand this well to get overwhelmed and they think about
Uh
Their family members who aren't even interested or whatever and say if everybody has to understand this we're screwed no everybody does not
To begin and the path by which
People are encultrated in time
Can always start with some people building things that become on ramps for more people
So merging this with the logic of
What I expect to happen, which is a great simplification
Especially for young people what I hear you saying
Is advocating to simplify your own life
In the current economy, but at the same time expand your capacity to look at the world in systems
and
not only the
Immediate feedback we get from a decision or a product or a strategy or a program
but the second and third order
effects and start to think that and if we have
Scout team of conciliants jedi out there that then that will potentially scale orders of magnitude in its
Passing the systems baton to other humans over time
And in turn that will affect all nine boxes of the three by three grid that you proposed
Yes, totally and I want to just come back. I don't know how many of the people who watch your show are young or
later everyone has
Uh, it's a wide variety, but a lot of young people
So yeah, I want to speak to younger people again thinking about this
Your development is
Uh, personal and psychological as much as it is cognitive and skills really critical to understand that
If
you
Can't talk whether it's can't publicly speak or speak in front of someone who's intelligent because of insecurities
It'll mess up your ability to do stuff no matter how much you know
If you have to talk and you talk because you need to seem smart
Even when you should shut up and listen it's going to mess up your ability to do things
We all can observe in other people these quirks that maybe they don't see in themselves that totally make them less effective
Look for the latter but keep going
Look for these things in yourself and see how to
Work on them. So the the personal development is more study and more therapy
um
for whatever it's worth
I did every therapy method I could ever find and I still actually if I find a therapist
It does something I haven't done I engage in it because it's just it's
Investing in one's own understanding of themselves and their psyche is just like investing in their
Knowledge or investing in their health it matters the things we invest in is where grow
So I would love to see it's also part of how can I how can I become?
Undefended enough that I can actually feel the pain of the world in a high touch way and not be crippled
That also requires
Having worked through your own pain enough that you aren't crippled by it and regress back into childhood trauma states and things like that
We've had a couple off camera conversations on this
I've never had therapy in my whole life and I'm now interviewing
Coaches in the next couple weeks on this because I'm struggling with exactly what what you just described
So okay, did you more more comments on?
Yeah, yeah, so some the great simplification macro. So the micro version as you said is
Don't don't create an in a embedded growth obligation on your own earning
Which is what most people do
The as soon as you make more than you get a bigger house and buy more shit and have get more debt and need to make more
Stop the embedded growth obligation there because it really doesn't matter that much make enough money that you can eat healthy food and
you know
If you want to see a therapist or whatever you can do those things
But by the way, I will interject right there. There's a sociologist named juliet shore. She's a friend of mine
She did a book
Like 30 years ago where she studied how much money people made and at the end of the year asked them
How much would you like to make and they she followed a cohort over like 20 years?
And no matter how much you made in a certain year every single year people wanted to make more the following year and if you
Internalize that's what our culture is doing the words. You just said make even more profound
sense
Keep going
Yeah, the embedded growth obligation goes macro and micro right? Um
but if you want to
Grow your own self and your own capacity to be in service of the world and you can't be growing your
Service to the existing world maximally at the same time. This is the two masters thing and you've got to decide which master
You actually in service of
And then you want to be actually doing good work
You don't just want to be doing meditation and psychotherapy and study
Because one there's a lot that you only learn by doing stuff and you want your life to be
Meaningful now and increasing your capacity for greater meaningfulness over time
Um
And so as much as to the whole existential risk landscape
It might not make sense to go be at the animal shelter or go helping with this frontline work
If some of your life isn't doing that you're missing something
So the other thing I would say to young people is in addition to your own private study and your formal education
The thing that will help the most is find mentors that are doing work
That is most like the work you want to do and figure out what they need that you can become useful for
This was the thing I'm most grateful for in my own education was I had amazing mentors
And I just figured out
That they needed diapers changed or they needed construction or they needed whatever the hell it was and I just figured out
How to learn how to do the things they needed so I could be around
Because you learn so much like, you know, if you get to go work with Nate
and when he goes to dc and is talking with people about
financial strategies for the energy grid or things like that
You'll learn a lot about what actually happens in those rooms and how to think about it
Whatever that you just can't learn in college or online
so um
But if someone knows how to do the things that you're interested in they are too busy so figure out what you can offer
That they need
Because then you'll be gaining the capacity to become more of what you want to be
These are a few pieces of rice for younger people at offer
Yeah, the two bottlenecks there one you mentioned well
there
We're in the liminal space between in my opinion a
Growth on fumes world and a post growth world
There's a lot of people big de growth movement advocating for a smaller economy
I think de growth is what we should do
But post growth is what we're going to have to do and I just don't think there's a lot of
Mentor like people out there in the post growth space because
Our current master especially as things get more monetarily and civically stressful
Is we got to pay the bills so I know you're not trying to speak to everyone
um, and
I think it's excellent excellent advice, but there aren't a lot of people
Living and focusing on the projects that we're going to need in the next 10 or 20 years
As potential mentors out there there are some for sure
This is why the podcast is so cool as a format is it
It allows people that you might not be able to access as a mentor one-on-one for you to be able to get some
Meaningful chunk of what they have to share which is amazing
but
No, there are people who are
Like it may be that the capacities you want don't live in any one person, right? It may be that you really want to
protect the congo and that's going to require some
Amazing political strategy capability, but also some environmental knowledge and some cultural knowledge
So it may be that there are some
environmentalists that understand the
Biodiversity risks associated with the congo whatever well and you need to study with them for a while to know that
But there's also some just really effective political operators that are not working on that at all
But where you get to learn how to effectively get shit done
Um in political systems and you go study with them
figuring out
how to
Be in proximity of the people that have capabilities you're wanting to develop
Is the fastest way to develop those capabilities
Okay, getting to our three by three grid. I think some of the things you've been
Speaking to the last 30 minutes or so
Populate many of the boxes in this grid. Um, how how would you like to approach this?
So when I talk about triage transition and
and long-term
Adequate solutions sufficient solutions
Um
These are horizons of focus
Uh, there's lots of management theories to talk about something like this, but I'll tell you how I think about it
triage basically means
that there is some
problem and particularly some catastrophic risk
that
Has a non-nel likelihood
Over, you know in the near term. I'm mostly not focused on things like the sun blowing out someday. I'm focused on pretty, you know things
within a
within the years to decades time frame
um
and
there's some
problem like that
That it does not seem the world has an adequate set of solutions already in place for so more needs done
And probably needs done fairly quickly through whatever means necessary to avoid that
When I say whatever means necessary, I mean not necessarily
total systemic solutions, but more just like direct implementation. So if we are looking at
something like
the risks associated with the speed of growth of synthetic biology
and
and
You know a direction of lots of viral hunting and gain of function research in
leaky laboratories with publishing of those gene sequences
That's just super super super risky
So things should be done to stop that that involve mostly
Uh some scientific work that says okay, let's not do these things. The benefit is not worth the risk
and
Instead let's do these things for
zoonotic pandemic
You know spillover prevention and these things regarding
information sharing and lab security and whatever and then there's like
Legal work to do right like legal work to get a couple of the main countries to do and then maybe you know
The who to do something the g20 to do something that is adequate
That's a triage type thing. That's saying okay. Here's a risk
And we don't need to get everybody to buy into something. We basically need to
show that the
um
The risk opportunity space needs something different done. So there's some
Scientific work, but it's this is a convening of a not large number of people
And obviously, you know, this is a topic. We have both actively worked on a long with a number of other people
But it's this is just one that kind of makes sense
um, and then there's
legislation legislative work within existing
legislative apparatus to be able to get that stuff done
We could say a very similar thing of like
uh
Protecting the ensuring that the amazon doesn't
Uh get to the point of the hydrological pump breaking right a planetary boundary thing like that
um, okay, well
How would we think about how to do triage there effectively?
i'm just going to talk through
Some principles of how to think about it because whether you're working in equidore to begin with at the headwaters of the amazon or brazil
Because it's the largest total amount of the amazon or any of the other five
You know five countries touching it or nine countries that have some involvement in the watersheds
like you're going to do different things but
principles
the economic incentive whether it's from mining
oil extraction or
um agriculture
Is going to be an ongoing pressure because
those things that are going to not only keep being worth money many of them will keep being worth more money as
um population demands and etc needs that
and those forces can bribe governments and they can
put out commercials and
You know campaigns that affect the minds and hearts of people
and they can do campaign budgets and
Uh, they can pay lobbyists. So
If the ngos that are fighting it are just fundamentally less
Capacitated in all those ways. This is not going to work. So you've got to think about all right
Factoring the forces that want to harm the thing. We're wanting to protect it
What forces are large enough to protect it, right? Just even basic kind of strategic thinking
And how could we get the forces that are large enough to care?
And it might not be by appealing to them with some kind of moral or environmental thing. It might be some other things
So in this case, this is an example you and I've talked about
If the hydrological pump of the amazon breaks
It's
Meaning the water that transpires
From all the trees that then rains down and keeps it as a rainforest
But also pumps some of the ground water into the air that becomes rain in north america
That is somewhere between a third and a half of the rainfall in north america every year
If the hydrological pump breaks because you've got enough destruction that you stop getting enough rainfall
That you stop getting enough plant growth to keep pumping the thing, right?
You get this like the climate change albedo effect is a positive runaway thing that happens at a certain point
And whether we're five years from that or 15 years from that depends upon how fast things are being destroyed
And whose model you're looking at but it's not like
Forever there's a time scalar. So then you're like, all right, so
Half of the half the rainfall in north america goes away
That is absolutely a national security threat because it's a food security threat a water security threat
It threatens the you know food sovereignty and food security and
So the state department would care about that
Not because they necessarily care about the amazon on its own, but because they care about food security
Now
Is the state department bigger than amazon watch and rainforest watch and whatever NGOs are there that could
Do more to intervene obviously
Now this is presenting the issue
In a to someone else that has the capacity for a reason that they care about even if it is not
The reason that people caring about the rainforest care about it
And then who would they need to see?
That modeling they would probably want to see that noa and nasa agreed modeling wise
Yes, this much can't be harmed or you'll get that runaway effect to occur
So if
Some people wanting to work on the amazon were like, how do I get people at noa nasa to explain the hydrological pump thing
In a way that the state department adds it to its list of things to ensure that it ameliorates
This is just an example
Of triage strategic thinking. We're not trying to make capitalism as a whole better
We're not trying to make the governments of each of those countries better
We're simply trying to think strategically more effectively about how to do a thing, right?
That needs to be done time times a thousand things or 10,000 things
This is what I would call the triage category
And there are a lot of principles
So I just gave a principle of
Whatever are the forces arrayed against the thing
Make sure that you have competent forces
Similarly arrayed, but they don't have to care about it for the same reason
They have to care about it for a rationalized reason that speaks in the language they understand
So who can help translate that that's one principle
We could do a whole thing on how to do strategic thinking effectively
But triage is largely
That it's largely how do we get different players?
How do we get the economic incentives etc to be able to do the things that are needed?
And of course, we still have to think through
The externalities because there might be issues of having the state department to focus on the amazon
So we have to think through that
But that's what I would call the triage category and there is a lot in there
And of course, there's a lot of people already working on front-line approaches for the amazon
They're just not thinking about
What is the total threat landscape to the amazon?
What are the tipping points to not hit and what is a strategically adequate focus?
and so
That's one triage. We could we could give 100 other examples, but I think that is an example category
Do we want to go horizontal or vertical here?
Maybe you could stick with that example and look at transition and long term briefly
Or do you want to break the triage down between culture political economy and tech stack?
Yeah, yeah, so I'll give a transition example
so
having something like
a state department
Or and I'm giving one example. There's obviously groups other than the state department that would also care
But in the same way that I said
earlier about
Who are you politically polarizing against you and how could you get them on your side rather than not? How do you get?
Groups that don't currently care to care either that are larger or with a cumulative effect of how they care stacks functions enough, right? That's just
straightforward principle of kind of political thinking
Um, this is not changing the overall economic incentives in those countries or the mindsets of the people or anything
So it's not a systemic effect this way called triage. So transitional would be
working with
those in the institutions of those countries, right their
uh department of the interior or its equivalent their
Academy their academies and universities that are focused on these things their
Government security bodies their financial bodies. How could we make those smarter?
How could we make the logics of them better so they do a better job with these types of things?
so
An example there could be something like
Uh, I learned this kind of thinking from a guy named nelson del rio
prosperity of the commons really smart lawyer who
Did a lot of the work on making the public private partnership
and then
Legal structure and then saw how that got weaponized and made a different structure
But let's say
Let's say that we focused on Ecuador
Because it's the headwaters of the amazon. So even though it's not the most total square meters. It's the most critical square meters
uh, because you messed the headwaters up obviously the entire basin gets messed up and
We see that
And I might have some of my stats wrongs. I looked at this a couple years ago
But so I'm just using this as a random example, but
Ecuador owed a lot of money to
both the world bank and
Chinese bank and
Some of that debt is collateralized with resource access
And was not in the position to be able to pay that debt off well. So what happens, right? Does that threaten?
Uh resource acquisition near the head order of the amazon that could mess up the amazon basin
If you start thinking about
the relationship between the state department that might want to prevent the
Hydrological pump breaking for food security and the world bank obviously
Uh, the u.s and the world bank are very related institutions, right?
And so could the state department get the world bank to
Change its debt structure debt forgiveness or things like that. Yeah, totally could
Could the world bank work with the chinese bank to get it to do it as well based on if it was motivated enough
International financial agreements. Yeah, it probably could do that as well
If somebody could negotiate
How to set that whole thing up of the state department support with
The forgiveness of the debt, which is like 32 billion
dollars like a lot of debt and then that would mean a lot to the government of ecuador
And it might not be know how to do that on their own
Now the country needs an economic development plan that doesn't involve running its rainforest assets
So they probably need to an education process to do a lot more skilled labor
And they probably need tech
So let's say we somebody put together an economic development plan that involved bringing more tech
Jobs and tech capacity to the area and more education for more skilled labor
So that you could still have economic development without as much environmental exploitation
And let's say that to the degree there were some
resources that needed to
Be extracted or exploited we
Helped to make have that country develop its own national capability
To do its mining or extraction that employed people there as opposed to say a chinese contractor that was employing chinese people to do it or
And that because of that had much stricter environmental regulation did a better version of it and private and held more of the wealth for ecuador rather than
More of it going to a multinational
But they can't do that because they don't have that capacity on their own economically or whatever
But they could be supported to so again, I'm saying if there is some group that is really caring about the amazon
They want to do a transitional thing could someone say all right. Here's a
10 20 30 year economic development plan
That involves some of those resources being extracted in a viable way that doesn't ruin the
Environment and provide jobs or whatever but also provides a lot of economic development not in the resource extraction category
And get you both a lot less environmental harm per extraction and more of the money from that extraction
And
We will help set that up and open the capital markets help negotiate the capital markets being able to
Fund this thing and you'll bond back it so we can make sure that the capital markets can come into it
We'll also help negotiate the release of your debt
But here's the deal
We're going to offer this deal to you as a package that includes
Excluding the mining rights of all these other companies and the logging and the in the ranching and like that
So you either get this deal in whole or not, but you can't take this other thing that's happening in this
Why this is unique is because most people who focus on
For benefit capitalism
They're like, okay
Well, I can make money doing this good thing, but it doesn't bind other people from doing the bad thing
If I want to bind other people from doing the bad thing
I either have to create law that doesn't do it like
You know make it illegal or contract law where those who would say allow the person allow the other kind
You know multinational to come in
And do the thing are not going to because there's an exclusive contract
And so if I think about how to use
Markets more effectively. I don't just want to incentivize some positive thing
I also want to bind the negative thing from not happening, right? So
We all know that
Politically people bundle shit in ways that are really messed up. There's some clean water act that everybody's going to want
with some like
privatized prison or fucked up thing that's attached to it in the same thing
You're like, how why did those things get together? They don't belong together
But can that same tool be utilized for positive purposes where you
provide an actual healthy economic development plan and a
A
Protection plan for that country you factor which choice makers are going to have to make the choice
And what do they need in terms of public opinion and whatever to be able to do the thing
And put something together if it's a deal they will take that also
Is exclusive to the other thing now?
This is helping their entire institutional complex to be better structured, right?
Less perverse incentive in the whole thing long-term development of new economic areas
This would be an example of a transitional strategy where you're helping the overall set of institutions get healthier longer term
And again, I gave an example here, but we could we could give an example in
A coral reef or in the Congo or in, you know, whatever gazillion things where you're thinking about
Principles like that how what things would we want to bundle together to ensure that they all happen together?
Which ones would we want to force exclusion of who would have to make which choices?
What are the incentives that they need things like that?
And what about long-term
Long term is things like you don't have
Global capitalism
Uh in the global financial system in the same way anymore
You don't have you like long term is things like real cost valuation on everything
so that the
actual market cost of a thing included
The cost to make all of the raw ingredients renewably and the environmental cost long term in which case you just don't have perverse
incentive environmentally as a whole
Um long term means uh education system where everyone is educated in this type of way so that you actually have
culture where people are
Uh oriented about what is actual value fundamentally differently, right? So um
long term is food systems
and
Uh manufacturing systems and whatever that are closed loop that don't need to keep exploiting new virgin areas forever
And do these things happen sequentially triage transition long term or do you start all three of them now on parallel tracks?
Not only do they have to have all three start now they have to be in conversation and in turn form each other
because the what will long term viable be
If the people who are doing the transition aren't thinking about it. They might be transitioning more
Sideways than forward, right? Like they might be missing critical insights about what would long term sufficiency look like
And if the people who are thinking about long term solutions aren't paying attention to the details of the reality on the ground
They might not have enough
Detail to think about it, right? They're thinking about it too abstractly. So
Those are horizons of focus, but that doesn't mean sequential and they do need to be in dialogue
Okay, and then
vertically
How do we think about culture political economy and tech stack infrastructure on the bottom?
With respect to what you were just saying
When you think about triage, it's hard to separate them because you're looking at an eminent issue happening in which they're all kind of
Happening together, right? And so your triage
Might have to might have to affect cultural things because the mindsets of the populist matter
it might not like
Regulation of synthetic bio probably does not need everybody to agree. It probably needs a very small number of people to agree
so
How important culture is or not depends
Most people don't really have a say in do we go to nuclear war or not over a certain thing?
What is the point of nuclear escalation is so?
Um, and yet those who would do it still have to pay attention to political will to some degree
um
so
I would say
That you want to use frameworks like this to think about
Am I factoring what the cultural elements are what the political economy elements with the tech elements are?
but your triage solutions are gonna in
Are going to be focused on just
immediate efficacy
and
They'll all three be very connected
When you're thinking longer term transition I can think about culture in terms of like
There are versions of all the religions that are more compatible with each other and less compatible
right, there are there are versions that are more kind of
non-violent forgiveness oriented universalists and other ones that are more
fundamentalist religious or oriented being able to support
The more compatible versions of the religions flourishing more than the other ones
Is kind of a culture play long term that I don't have to think about
The political economy and the tech to think about that though. They are very very connected right if if I
think about
How do I support the proliferation of a particular version?
Well, if I can help it develop more tech and more financial capacities
It becomes a lot easier for that version to proliferate if it also has more economic power behind it, right?
So I think we did a good job of giving a couple examples of triage
On transition I'd like to give a different example
so like
transition
And then the difference between transition and long term
Let's say we're taking the united states government
federal government
long term
The underlying structure of representative democracy is just insufficient
The the u.s. Structure made in 1776 when the world was
radically more simple
Is there is no way to retrofit it adequately
specifically things like
Markets just get advanced new tech and only after
It has caused health or environmental problems long enough for
Long-term studies to be done and watch dog groups to lobby enough and fight against the vested interest lobbying
does regulation happen post facto
And so, you know 80 years
after
Led to gasoline was causing problems you finally out
outlawed or cigarettes or dbt
You don't get to keep having a post facto regulatory system with problems that cause
harm at
exponentially faster scale and more speed and live so
A new situation where when new tech emerges you actually have to go through this externality
process that we talked about to get regulatory
Okay for it to move forward
And of course i'm aware
That it's very hard to concentrate that much power and not have it become corrupt and dystopic
So of course there have to be checks and balances on that power and transparencies and there are really hard issues in there
We can get into that
but
There is a need to be able to ensure
The not terrible risk of things that have exponentially bigger and faster
Impacts ahead of time. That's an example of a fundamental change in our existing system of
government
Obviously if we were going to rebuild a new
Open society civilizational architecture from scratch today
We would do it differently than the retrofits of how we did it starting in, you know, the early industrial era
So there are a lot of long-term shifts where we think about how do we implement
all of the information technology tools to factor all of the things and
I
I could get it actually we should do one where we talk about
The combinations of liquid democracy and qualified democracy and addressing arrows and possibilities here
I mean all the things I want the future of a governance stack could look like
But that's i'll pass on that for a minute and just come back to transition because that was the example I wanted to do
Uh, you said we should do one. What what do you mean one one podcast or one?
I mean it would be worth talking about at some point if that was if that was something people had questions on like what does
what what does a
governance system
That is adequate to the complexity of the issues actually look like
But let me go ahead and give an example of transition that is not yet adequate but a lot better than we currently have
People like
Larry Lessig who you know constitutional lawyers and focused on these issues have identified a handful of issues that they
Um see as being able to and I don't mean to misquote him. I spoke to them recently about this
And I think this is roughly right
he's focused on
that if we can get the primaries to not be partisan because one of the problems of the
uh
Primaries being partisan as you get this heavy focus on appeal to your in-group and don't pay any attention to
How the outgroup the other side is going to focus and you get much more extreme polarizing
things
Similarly, if you can get ranked choice voting rather than just the single vote
Then if you highly polarize the other side, you'll do much less well
Then if you appeal to your support base, but also appeal or don't disappear to the other side
So you'll decrease the incentive for polarization with ranked choice voting
If you can fix gerrymandering
which
Is a such a just obviously corrupt nonsense thing and it's such a straightforward thing to be able to fix
So districts start to make sense
And if you can fix campaign finance
then
the
the perversion of the system to focus on party over
uh country to
Continuously polarize which will make most of the energy turn into waste heat fighting each other and then four years do something and four years undo it
Like the current system with its existing logics would just be so much smarter if you did
A handful of things like that
Now obviously the only people who wouldn't want that are the people that benefit from the corruption of the system
Which might be things like the people who run the political parties and stuff
So there is some work to do but that is that's not triage, right? That's not going to solve a particular biosecurity risk
It's not going to solve a nuclear risk not going to solve an environmental
Boundary, but it's going to make something called the u.s federal government smarter and less stupid and less corrupt
So all the things that it does
Will be better, but it's going to do it in a way that works within its own existing system logics
So that's what I would call a transitional solution
Whereas how do we rebuild a digital democracy from scratch? There's a totally different kind of structure is a long-term solution
So that's an example of thinking about
the distinction between
triage which is not systemic
Transition which is systemic, but a change to existing systems and then the build of fundamentally new systems
I'm agreeing with everything you're saying, but it's totally different than what I expected this conversation would be about
I thought we would have discreet
Examples in the culture political economy
tech energy infrastructure stack and as you're talking it almost seems like
The things that I would put in these nine boxes. Well to me
It's all about triage now and it's almost like
preparing the economy for the financial energy
rubber band
snapback
My work on on that it almost
Like enables you to work on all these other things
Like I think that is going to change the landscape of all these other
Examples that you are giving and and that has a very specific
I'm focused on all of it, but I just recognize that
There's lots of these existential risks that may or may not happen
Certainly climate is happening and is going to happen regardless of what we do
our attempts now are to minimize it and to cope with it as
species and culture
but I I think we are years or a decade away from
a
Recalibration of the musical chairs of financial claims relative to the biophysical claims
So I thought we might talk about. Oh, well, how does AI fit into that or how does blockchain fit into that?
And my answer to that is they would help
Extend the metabolism for a while longer at best, but they're not
They're not solutions. They're they're short-term fixes. So what is the triage on how?
Effectively eight billion people are going to have to deal with a smaller pie for the first time in 150 years
Um, and that is a very large conversation
But I I do like the conceptual way in in which you're painting this
But I might have more discreet
Suggestions on on each of these boxes
No, let me say that a different way on the triage. I would on the transition in longer term
I think we're largely in agreement at least on the things you've said so far
Yeah, I mean, I think with transition or triage. I gave an example of biosecurity and an example of something like the hydrological pump of the amazon
We didn't get to triage examples on
Um, right. There's there's triage on every single issue
Yeah, no, I think we could do that. I think we could say let's pick
10 of the most pressing issues and give more examples there
So really what we did so far was just lay out a framework to think about these things
Not anything like completion of that and we couldn't complete it, but we could do quite a lot more
so maybe if there was a
Follow-up we should have a hundred people at a three-day meeting
talking about those all those boxes
And we will um, and if for this podcast is a follow-up, maybe it would be a combo of
uh
A handful of areas in which you're thinking about triage solutions and you share the things you're thinking about and we dialogue on them
With questions that the audience has that might be a really fun
Yeah, uh, actually
It was really presenting frameworks to think about what do how do you approach the metacrisis more than something like a laundry list of the things to do
I just feel this I
I emotionally feel the intensity
of this bend versus break moment and I've come to that because of my
awareness of the connection between energy and finance, but it sure seems that
geopolitically we also have a
Are approaching a bend versus break moment in many other ways. So
I'm getting uh urgent texts that I have to go and deal with animals because it's going to be very cold tonight
So how would you like to wrap this up my friend?
I think um
It makes plenty of sense for us to do a follow-up if there are questions and uh,
I'm sure there will be questions
and if there's more examples of solutions we'd like to get into
um, and very likely
ongoing conversations will keep being fine and valuable, but I do feel like there's a certain arc of completion that we got to
of
problem framing
Framing up how to be with that and then talking through how to think about
How to approach
How to work with it, which is not a solution. It's not a list of solutions
it's a it's a way of thinking about and relating to the approach and
Uh, I feel really good about that. We got to have this whole dialogue and I am very interested to hear the questions that people have
and uh, if we
Have follow-up soon, that'll be great
Thank you next week is Thanksgiving and uh, I'm grateful for a lot of things. I'm grateful that our paths crossed
and that we continue to
Be colleagues and share notes and ideas and connections
because
What else should we be doing with our time on this planet?
Is swinging for the fences on, um, the human predicament you call it the meta crisis
Uh, and we need orders of magnitude more people having these conversations in their communities and their networks around the world
Uh, so I I deeply value your your intellect and wisdom and your
Your generous spirit of of sharing your time with others on this. So
thank you so much
is
Uh, a thing that some people could do if they felt called if people have listened to all five of these and they felt it was meaningful and they decided
they wanted in their
community
Toast a watching series and then you know dial like create a support group of how do we help each other in our own?
Development in this that'd be a cool thing
And uh, what else should we do? We should go tend to the animals when it's cold outside
Yeah, um
I'm gonna I'm gonna do that
You know between the time that this is recorded and it's aired. Um, there will be
A podcast with thomas bjorkman who talks about inner development and having different perspectives
Is really really good and I do think
Somewhere out there we need to have this ability
To temporarily suppress your own identity to be part of a larger conversation take other perspectives
Think systemically the way that you talked about uh in this podcast
In a formal or semi-formal education system that you're experiencing this learning
With other humans who then form bonds
And there's this social network that that spills throughout the world
And I I don't know how to formalize that but our education system is sorely lacking right now for the future that we're facing
So if you're going to set up some sort of a academy or what whatever
Uh gaya speed to you on that my friend. Let me know if I can help
You you are already
Employed as a uh professor once it gets there. I just haven't told you yet
Okay, um
Thank you. This concludes our ben versus break series with the exception of a number six. We're gonna have uh ask daniel
and his colleague nate about
Uh a three by three grid questions. Um, or any questions pertaining to uh, what we just discussed
Thanks. Thanks daniel
