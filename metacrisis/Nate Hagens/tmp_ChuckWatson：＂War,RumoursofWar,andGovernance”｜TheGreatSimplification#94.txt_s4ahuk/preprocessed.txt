There's always context, there's always history, there's always detail that matters, and if
you look at all the problems we face, whether it's economics or AI or geopolitics, a lot
of it boils down to the fact that our modern world is so complex, it has exceeded the ability
of our governments, it's exceeded the ability of our political structures to handle them.
Greetings. As many of you are aware, there is a growing situation in the Middle East
between Israel, Palestine, and beyond to Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, the broader Middle East, and
the wider world. I'm not an expert on this area, other than to obviously know the importance
of this region to the rest of the world. Half to two-thirds of the world's remaining oil
reserves are within 1,000 miles of Israel, and there are increasingly countries choosing
sides. I don't know enough about this to speak intelligently to it, so I invited my colleague
Chuck Watson for a special episode to discuss what's going on and what it means. Chuck has
been on this show three times before to talk about nuclear war, nuclear weapons, the outcome
of a nuclear exchange, and the broader perspective of a future using a military lens. Chuck has
a long career in military and intelligence work. His specialty is natural and human-made
disaster modeling. He worked for the US Air Force and was a special attach√© to US ambassadors
to the Middle East, Robert McFarland, and later secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld,
as a Soviet expert. Chuck has worked in the military or as an advisor to the military
for over four decades with a particular emphasis on big data, open-source intelligence, with
an emphasis on the Soviet Union and Russia. Chuck joins me today to integrate what's going
on in the Middle East into a broader global risk assessment. I'll caution that our conversation
is not uplifting, but it's one that I feel is important for more people to understand
and integrate into their thinking and their planning. Ultimately, Chuck concludes that
we're going to need different modes of problem-solving and governance in order to successfully navigate
this spiraling global political situation, and I agree. This was a clear but intense overview
of the challenges the world faces with respect to Israel and Palestine, Ukraine, and the
broader economic implications of the financial system interest rates, global trade, etc.
Please welcome Chuck Watson. Good morning, Chuck. Great to see you.
Hey, good morning. At least it's cooled off a little bit here.
Cooled off temperature-wise, not geopolitics-wise.
Well, no.
Are you feeling better? I thank you for doing this impromptu. I know you're just getting
over COVID. Yeah, it was mostly COVID-hypersensitivity. I think I was over COVID in about 24 hours,
the virus itself. I think we've reached a stage now where the immune system reactions
about as bad as the actual virus itself for most people.
Just to timestamp this, since world events are quite dynamic, this is Wednesday, October
18th at 8 in the morning, my time. You and I talk quite often. You were one of my very
first podcast guests. Our first conversation was almost two years ago, recorded in December
2021, before the Russia-Ukraine NATO incursion. I asked you on that podcast, what was the
biggest risk facing humanity? You immediately mentioned nuclear war possibilities in the
next 24 months, and you said, and I quote, I think the biggest thing is we've got to
reduce the level of geopolitical tensions. At the time, this was not something on my
radar. Looking through the transcript of that podcast, we talked about Ukraine, Taiwan,
Africa, and the Middle East. Two months later, the war in Ukraine broke out, and there have
been revolutions in Africa. War is now broken out between Israel and Hamas, with the risk
of spreading through the region and possibly going nuclear. Tensions with China are high.
It feels like we're on the verge of a tectonic shift and perhaps World War III. Are things
really falling apart, and why? Can you give us a big picture update?
I think the big picture is that things are falling apart, and part of the reason is that
the international order, the systems where countries deal with each other, talk with
each other, have just pretty well broken down. That's a tough place to be, because once
you start breaking up into these different camps that not only don't talk to each other,
but fundamentally don't share values. By values, that don't mean moral ethical values.
You look at how BRICS solves problems, look at the US, the West solves problems.
They're radically different approaches to international problem solving. The UN systems
completely broken down. Yeah, it does feel like things are worse.
How does Israel complicate this situation?
Gosh, in the Israeli situation, Nate, on my background, I basically lived in Israel for
two years. I ran secure satellite communications for the US Middle East diplomatic missions,
guys like McFarland and Rumsfeld and Habib. That's an area I know something about.
I can give you just one little maybe snapshot to put it in context. Everyone is subset with the
Russia-Ukraine about civilian casualties. Well, there have been more civilian casualties
in 10 days of the war between Hamas and Israel than there have been in two years of high-intensity
conventional warfare between Ukraine and Russia. Think about that. The level of brutality in the
Middle East is really phenomenal. The question is why? Here in the West, we tend to not like to
talk about it that much because we tend to think of things in more secular terms. We tend to think
that religion and these kinds of things are something you do on Sunday. It's a way of life
in most of the world. I think that's one of the areas that in US foreign policy, we don't fully
appreciate the depth of feeling, of hatred, of animosity, and of resentment and of history
that is involved in this conflict. You can easily eat that whole concept and I won't bore you with
the details, but periodization. You think of where do you start history? Well, okay, if you're going
to start it on October 7th, then your sympathies will be with Israel. But if you started two days
earlier, even on October 5th, then you go, wow, the Israelis were encouraging rabbis to do prayers
within the Muslim compound on Temple Mount. That was a trigger maybe for promos. You start going
back more and more in time until eventually you realize this is just a lot of complex history with
a lot of blood. The level of brutality, I think, is something that people don't really appreciate
in the West so much. Well, you know the focus of this podcast is systems and I often say that
we're energy blind and between half and two-thirds of the world's remaining oil reserves are in
roughly 800 miles of Israel. We're also ecology blind on our impact on the oceans and other
species, but even at an almost deeper level than that is we're geopolitics blind because
we've assumed this complex six-continent supply chain and global peace and collaboration and
the upslope of the carbon pulse will continue. Boy, this morning I saw that President Biden
gave the green light to Israel to do whatever they see fit and the Arab leaders of the Gulf
nations refused to meet with him and his delegation. It just seems to me that there's a further
isolation of the West because of this and I'm kind of surprised so far that the markets haven't
discounted this into the future. I mean, these are tectonic shifts that are potentially happening.
Well, what are your thoughts on that? I agree completely then and again that lack of realization
of the fundamental shifts. It used to be the U.S. president goes to the Middle East or any region
and says, I want to meet with leaders X, Y and Z. Well, they're going to do it. You know, you would
just the level of influence that the U.S. has and I'll be blunt, the level of fear. A lot of the
reason that various countries meet with us is intimidation and fear because of the U.S.,
particularly the last 30, 40 years, primarily has exercised its power through military means.
It's been an astonishing reversal for me growing up, you know, coming of age professionally within
State Department and Defense Department to see the really almost reversal of roles and that our
State Department is often now much more militaristic than our own Defense Department. So you're right,
you look at what's going on for the president to go to the region and to have at the last minute
key leaders, the leader of Jordan to have King Abdullah to withdraw from and cancel a meeting
with the president. That's just astonishing and it shows the tremendous decline of American
diplomacy and influence through the region. We are at severe risk of isolation. The Russia-Ukraine
thing started our road to isolation and with Israel in particular because of the strong emotional
connections there and the whole situation now with the fairly obvious extreme response of and
again you look at Israeli a bit of a rabbit hole, try to avoid but I do think it's worth mentioning
that Israel's security has largely rested on the brutality of its response. The being a smaller
population they've always said we need to kill at least 10 or 20 times as many of our adversaries
as they kill of us and okay that works for a certain level of intimidation but after a certain
point that becomes self-destructive and I think we passed that point. So is it kind of a bluff
intimidation that's been built up over years and decades or yeah that's an interesting question.
Israeli security has rested really on four pillars and what we're seeing with the current
Hamas wars there's at least three of those pillars that have started to collapse. The first one is
the myth of Israeli invincibility. Now that had some merit to it. You look at the early wars 48,
67, 73 Israel had a definite quantitative qualitative advantage over the over its
air of neighbors particularly the education level of NCOs and officers and you know let's vary the
details on that but they did have a significant superiority in that sense but over time that's
gone away. Once they've moved into more of a police action population control instead of
a peer-on-peer military they lost that edge so that's pillar one. The second pillar is of course
US support. The US having their back well are countries afraid of the US anymore you know you
look at the devil of Afghanistan you look at how our weakness militarily has been shown through
our support to Ukraine hasn't worked out that's become more in question. Now US remains a very
dangerous adversary but that pillar has some holes in it. Third pillar brutality and again
people don't like to say this but this I'm using Israeli terminology here a brutal response to any
action again kill 10 or 20 to one that's been the signature of Israeli response that you kill one
of our people we're going to kill 10 of yours and again that's very understandable they're isolated
you know they're outnumbered you almost have to go that way but that only gets you so far.
The only pillar remaining is the nuclear deterrent the so-called temple weapons or
samson options it's sometimes called and so that gets us to a question that you raised earlier
that we've always discussed in our conversations risk of nuclear war well that was always considered
more of a last resort option but when all of your other means of deterrence start to fall apart
and your survival is at stake then you start to look at those nuclear weapons and start to
think well maybe we need to use them and so that's what I'm afraid will happen if Israel
goes into Gaza if it goes badly if Hesba Law starts a second front third front even with
Jordan and West Bank is a possibility once desperation sets in then you face that choice well
are you willing to lose or are you going to go the route of nuclear weapons and I cannot see the
Israelis ever picking the option of submission they will use the Masada option they will go with
nuclear weapons so that's why I think this particular scenario is of such extreme risk.
Okay so I want to dive into that obviously but let me take another step back first boy it sure
seems that this is all happening at the same time that there's this global growing anti-imperialist
anti-colonialist bricks expanding and people are kind of rising up to a global response to
limits and poverty and other things kind of against the West and now it seems like
even with the brutal attacks from Hamas that a lot of the international community seems to be
siding with or against Israel and I'm not paying super close attention to this and I don't have a
lot of background in it but it really seems potent the anti-western sentiment that is different
from when you worked in this region when the US was highly respected and admired is that also
changing or what are your thoughts on that? Yeah Nate it's interesting because there's a couple
of complex phenomenon work and I apologize I keep using the word complex but that's
I'm very aware that every question I ask you you could talk for 90 minutes on which is the
challenge of doing a short podcast but go on. So let's take one piece of that which is the US
reputation. Back during the Soviet era the US was that shining city on the hill sure people
realized we had our flaws but the good intent of the US was never really questioned. I remember
during the Persian missile crisis in Europe or even traveling in the Middle East people would say
you know we don't like some of your policies but we don't think you're being evil we don't think
you're trying to just gain for your own benefit you do care about the world. I don't hear that
anymore. I very much hear that America is being very selfish that America is if you look at things
like the deals we do with dictatorships and you look at how we have sponsored various regimes
where we're friends with dictators when really we should have been pushing maybe for more liberalization
you look at what happened in Syria. Assad Bashar Assad was trying to liberalize but we took advantage
of that to try to overthrow his government rather than work for an evolutionary improvement and we
ended up destabilizing the country. We did the same thing effectively in Egypt many of the Arab
spring countries went down look at Libya where now there's open air slave markets and you know we've
had a secretary of state who was laughing about it well that's just you know you might have gotten
away with that 30 or 40 years ago and but now with social media with networks with widespread
independent journalism in the developing world we can't get away with that people see the U.S.
and see our actions so that kind of hits the second point of social media and networks and how
governments don't control the media the way they used to and of course we've discussed that and I
mean your excellent podcasts with Daniel and others about the role of how media has changed the
landscape politically here in the U.S. well it's radically changed the landscape in the Middle East
in that you can't have this control of information now a lot of people will say a lot of it's
misinformation and there's some fairness to that but this just a landscape where you could control
the narrative is is gone and so what you now have is multiple narratives and people choose the ones
they feel most comfortable with or they feel is most realistic and the narrative in the Middle
East right now is that the U.S. Israel are in it for their own good and keeping the rest of us down
this is something I learned first hand with the Ukraine Russia situation is that there are two
wars there's the kinetic war military versus military and then there's the information war
the propaganda on both sides and like you just said with AI and social media and all that it
becomes increasingly difficult to really know what's going on last night soon after it happened
there was a a missile that apparently hit a hospital in in Palestine in Gaza and it was
immediately said 500 were dead and now it turns out that it might have been a failed rocket from
Palestinians themselves and it didn't actually hit the hospital it hit the front courtyard of the
hospital I mean I don't know what to believe but increasingly there's going to be people on both
sides of all these engagements highlighting things on social media to generate empathy
with citizens around the world paying attention to this and it seems like the information war is
almost as important as the real war because it builds up support for a certain plan of action
yeah and it's funny you say that about the it was probably a gbu-31 jdam exploding as an air burst
just based on the the video that was available immediately at the time before people had a
chance to start screwing with it and it probably was an Israeli strike I mean if you look at
at it but of course that in a sense that almost doesn't matter after about 24 hours because the
most of the world is going to believe it was an Israeli strike an intentional Israeli strike
um you know Israel has gone and flooded social media with a variety of uh honestly I'm surprised
at the amateurish nature of some of their counter narrative uh attempts but I think well it would
be good enough to fool me that's for sure I mean people don't have the your ability to
suss what's really going on most people well and that's an interesting point too because
what passes for journalism these days is and having expertise in those areas the problem
is how do you find an independent analyst who is going to look at that and give you a neutral
opinion that you trust you know if you pull somebody from the u.s military and well chances
are they're going to follow the whatever the u.s narrative is likewise if you are you going to
ask an Israeli spokesperson yeah probably that's not going to give you a neutral viewpoint you're
going to ask somebody from Gaza or from one of the NGOs yeah again there there's so many agendas
and finding someone who does not have an agenda or a group trusted group there's
there's just no trusted space for information and that's catastrophic from the standpoint of
the average person trying to sort out what's going on so setting aside the the nuclear war risk
for the moment which is in reality of course impossible to set aside but just focusing on the
information how does someone make sense of Ukraine and Russia and Israel Hamas going forward for the
people listening that want to understand what's going on in the world but understand that a lot
of the the media is goal-seeked to support a certain narrative what do you do just tune out and
tend your potatoes or I mean what do you do yeah that's tuning out and tending your potatoes or in
my case my tomato patch felt back is awfully appealing so I made a short list of the areas that you
should become at least somewhat knowledgeable in if you want to understand things and okay maybe
it's not such a short list of in history link language linguistics international law economics
engineering military science theology okay that's just half the list and that's not even going into
the details and I hate to throw up my hands and say I don't know how the average person does it
you know I've got decades of experience in this and it's virtually a full-time job trying to
create a worldview that I have some level of confidence in and so I don't know for the average
person I don't know how to do that somehow we've got to build some institutions where their job
and obligation is to be trusted sources of information and it's clearly not the media
because there's too much of a financial incentive and too much of a governmental regulatory pressure
to not be objective and so I don't know how we do that Nate I don't either but it uh as someone
who's an educator and a scientist uh and trying to I think we need an informed public uh to have
any chance of of benign outcomes and all these things and it I lose sleep over this um especially
with what I'm learning about AI and and uh the ability to create fakes and then there's real
false flags and I think people are just not going to know what's really going on um well
Nate forget it forget an informed forget an informed public I would be happy with informed
legislature legislators and informed leaders yeah because I look at the the horrific knowledge gap
among elected leaders in this country you know trying to brief people who are supposedly in
positions of power and they don't understand basic science or engineering much less history
or linguistics or any of those other things and these are the leaders people who supposedly are
and I know this sounds probably pretty arrogant but you know I was raised in or my professional
career started in an era where you know you were expected to take decades of studying all these
fields before anybody took you halfway seriously and today the people making the decisions don't
have the background in these fields they seem to be driven more by ideology and by their own
stovepipe narratives and it's frightening you just look at you know what's going on in our
and congress versus the administration right now and there's a death of expertise and that is frightening
from a governance standpoint much less from an electorate standpoint and and so because of that
situation we end up having these soundbite cartoon like summations of a really complex and dangerous
situation exactly you look at something that I cite quite often is how and again not to defend
the president of the Russian Federation but he'll make a statement it's immediately pulled out
translated usually mistranslated into English without context and then paraded as evidence of
his evil well you know a good example of that is when he was discussing the collapse of the Soviet
Union Putin called that the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century well what he meant
by that the context of that is that the way the Soviet Union fell apart created a lot of the
problems that we see in the world today and I think if you look around you have to say he's not
wrong you look at the conflict in Ukraine you look at the conflict in the Middle East that was
the Middle East was just left negligent for years while groups like Hamas and Hezbollah
gained power you look at how Afghanistan was ignored for what 12 years until suddenly they were
flying airplanes into buildings and so that that context from that statement is missing
yet that gets paraded all over American media as as proof that he's evil well that that's just one
very small tidbit of an example I could show misquotes from other world leaders just as easily
or even our own leaders that show the same thing so let's segue that back to the Middle East is
this a completely different segregated war than Ukraine Russia or is the fact that Iran and Russia
are are backing Hezbollah and and Syria and it's all kind of interlinked is this kind of an extension
of the NATO Russia situation no that's not to say they aren't convolved but they're completely
different you know this war has been going on for 2000 years I mean at least so it's
it they're not directly related what is related is that the Middle East conflicts have been tied up
in great power struggles and again you know periodization how do you figure out where to
start your narrative and start history and probably we're going to have to start it at the collapse
of the Ottoman Empire which controlled that entire region and then how did things get split up you
look at World War one the the Sykes-Picot arrangement where they literally in a cafe in Paris drew the
boundaries on a napkin I mean that's you can't make this stuff up sometimes they and so those
boundaries you look at Balfour in the 40s and how the nation state of Israel got started and all of
that complex history that led us to the point where you now have a situation where you've got a
entrenched resident population the Israelis who feel threatened on all sides you have a neglected
population of the Palestinian Arabs who lived there for generations and now have been lived as a
diaspora for several generations constantly keeping alive the thought of going home again
and reclaiming their lands that you know that has nothing really to do with the US foreign policy
or Russia or even to a lesser extent Iran other than they are taking advantage of that situation
for their own political purposes and you know that's where it does get convolved and particularly
right now what you're witnessing is the is it the last grasp of the American Empire or is
it the desperate attempt of the US to remain a global unipower there was an article just recently
in Foreign Affairs magazine discussing how the US is still the world's dominant power by far
and you read their argument and Nate you would look at it and shake your head and go what the
heck are these people talking about because they're mainly basing it on GDP well we know GDP is a
horrible measure of the capacity of the country particularly when you're talking about financialization
and so when you look at they're talking about oh well you know we spend more on our military than
the next 10 militaries combined okay well a rational military analyst looks at that and goes
yeah but it costs us 20 times more to blow up a given target because of the way that our system
works than it does our next level of potential adversaries so in terms of resources those
kind of measures and metrics don't work yet this couple of very respected foreign policy
authors were arguing that the US is still the dominant world power and we can basically act as
a hegemon well what do you do in that environment this is another thing that I've come to terms with
and learned in the last 18 months is when people say the US wants to do this or the US wants to
go to the war with Iran or or take out their potential of nuclear weapons or the US wants
to do something with Russia it's not really the US there are several and multiple factions within
government that wax and wane and their their voice and their power but it's not a unified thing it's
not like there's 20 politicians sitting around in agreeing on something there are all kinds of
unfolding alliances that that somehow get their way and so it's not the United States as one entity
that is desiring these things and as a citizen you and I are doing this as a pro social pro future
pro life on earth you know contribution to the discourse because we as Americans we deeply
care about the state of the future of our world but getting back to this question about factions
let me jump in please just for a second because I think you've raised an important point
that politically there is an incredible uniformity of thought within US foreign policy
if you go back to the 80s there were basically two schools of thought there was a stronger military
emphasis on military emphasis on power projection and there was another school of thought that was
more no we need to concentrate on soft diplomacy we need to see things like peace corps we need to
engage there were actually two substantially different schools of thought today there really is an
remarkable uniformity of thought within the US think about how and I've been on the receiving
end of a lot of this hatred for even suggesting that you know maybe we should talk to Russia maybe
we should have diplomatic outreach and you look at how the US has very much both parties democrat
and republican are very aggressive the so-called neoconservative philosophy which says that the
US cannot allow any regional much less global powers to approach it in terms of ability to
project military power that is a remarkable level of uniformity now there's some details that get
people argue over and make more of them there are there's at least within the republican party now
somewhat of a hesitate to use the term America first but a little bit more of a well maybe we need
to look after ourselves first but it's a very small movement it's not the majority by any stretch
the majority of both parties and almost uniformly it's incredible the democrat party used to have
a fairly significant peace movement within it you can't find a peace activist in the democrat
party anymore without a magnifying glass so i i did want to jump in and say that within America
there is a remarkable uniformity of thought that the US should project military power and use that
almost as a first option i was more uh pointing out like last week um i guess it's two weeks ago
now october 7th that on the morning of october 8 there was this very detailed wall street journal
article uh pointing that iran was behind um what hamas did and with all kinds of references like
12 hours after it happened and you know so there are definitely some strong iran haters in our
government as there are people that dislike russia etc and so there are these sub campaigns
happening absolutely there's yeah absolutely there's there's argument as to who we should
blow up first but there doesn't seem to be that much consideration on maybe we should try not
blowing people up for a while and see if we can negotiate or come up with alternative methods
and i know i'm being a little bit sarcastic on that but uh it does seem like uh our uh
kinetic military form policy that goes to that attitude change within the state department
where state department is now often more militaristic than the defense department but you're right
it's you know the there's the iran first crowd there's the russia first crowd there's the china
confrontation crowd but what's the common thread through all that it's confrontation
so let's get back to the middle east situation um you mentioned that uh rather than losing
that israel will choose a nuclear option so nuclear israel has nuclear weapons um what is the
the nuclear risk here um and maybe you could uh talk about the the wider uh context uh with iran
and the situation in the middle east yeah um so the obvious fear is that should israel start to lose
conventionally that they will resort to nuclear weapons to preserve the state and i i don't think
there's any doubt about that so the next love question is are there any other actors in the
region of iran's probably pretty close to developing uh having the ability to deploy nuclear weapons
that's why just as a sideline i'm not entirely convinced iran was behind this latest outbreak
i don't think they were quite ready for this uh it doesn't out it would seem to make more sense
for them to wait until they had a nuclear capacity as a deterrent to rather than starting a major
regional war of course pakistan the so-called islamic bomb they pakistan has a number of uh
nuclear weapons those are largely reserved for dealing with india so you know would they be
willing to part with any that that's a separate question i think probably not but given the
emotion and given pressures maybe uh so we're talking tactical nuclear weapons we're talking
tactical nuclear exchanges of you know the low single digits to tens which you know has regional
impacts certainly changes the political single digits to tens what does that mean uh you know
under 30 uh 30 weapons in the you know 10 to 50 kiloton range which again is some of the stuff
we've talked about in our previous podcast about when you start to look at environmental effects
that's where you're starting to have regional environmental effects but you're probably not
going to get global kinds of they clearly be uh effects beyond the immediate middle east fall out
and particularly impacts from temperature changes things like that but they'd be transient for the
most part um now in the region of course you're talking about hundreds of years for within the
target sense of impacts but um the bigger that in terms of wider context one of the fears is
that the us gets itself involved with iran and i find it hard you know we've got some very advanced
conventional weapons but the iranians have gone to great lengths to protect a lot of their nuclear
infrastructure and so the question is can we with assurance destroy iran's nuclear capacity
without using tactical nuclear weapons because it would take something of a tactical nuke to get
to the underground locations where they're located or something like that exactly to assure
yourselves that assure yourself that you have destroyed that target but there's another factor
too that i've heard discussed by us military officials and that's you know we haven't used
a nuclear weapon in 75 years so then the question becomes do people doubt your nuclear deterrent
are you willing to use a nuke and you know this gets into that where one of the things on my
list was anthropology and psychology and spite and all those things that that you've talked about
and the question is uh do you there there are literally senior u.s military officials who have
argued that we need to find a reason to use a nuclear weapon so people will still be afraid
and believe that we will use a nuclear weapon and they say that with a straight face it's like some
rod surling twilight zoom movie that that we're watching and living it it's just i keep yeah
i keep looking for him to step out of the i keep looking for him to step out of the shadows
it's like rod when are you gonna step out and tell us that this is just a bad dream but uh
well i i mean not to to you know go too far off off tangent but would uh given what we face
i think you and i agree that the odds of at least some nuclear weapons going off in the next
decade are much higher than the average person expects and that's partially because we've been
paying attention to this and partially because of what you talked about i think it was our first
or second podcast the concept of risk homeostasis that if you run a red light 12 times and nothing
bad happens you're going to adjust your behavior to not think about that risk in the same way we
haven't had a nuclear war or a nuclear weapon and as you say 75 years so people minimize emotionally
what the risks really are but what if a tactical nuke or a nuclear weapon were to go off
wouldn't that be a psychological and emotional reminder and wake up call to the rest of the
world of how horrific and potentially civilization ending a strategic peer-to-peer exchange of those
weapons would be maybe maybe not modern tactical weapons with the precision targeting um one of
the arguments and this gets you talk about a rabbit hole this is one that we could easily
blow several hours on and put most people to sleep but the issue of given precision
targeting of small tactical nuclear weapons they're more usable in the sense they don't
either not city busters it's not like kurosha or nagasaki where you're trying to target and
wipe out the entire city you're trying to destroy you maybe have it detonate at or even under the
surface to be able to destroy a hardened structure now there's good and bad to that there's maybe
fewer direct civilian casualties in that kind of an environment the bad side is you're lofting a lot
of particulates into the upper atmosphere and you know again that gets very messy very quickly but
the point is that and that's another reason why the fear is that crossing that nuclear
threshold is much easier now because of precision targeting and you can convince yourself well i
can hit just what i'm after and not cause a lot of collateral damage uh again though you're right
the psychological threshold of okay now you have used a nuclear weapon does the the other side now
feel freer to use a nuclear weapon against your troop concentrations against a port maybe do you
start to then and that's where as we discussed in our previous podcast the whole proud profit
exercise and this whole attitude of once you cross that nuclear threshold where's the bright
line where you stop and once you're at war and once you're starting to sling these things around
i'm not sure that there's a place where you can where one side of the other is going to stop you
have to be willing to lose again i keep coming back to are you what what line are you not willing
to cross at what point are you willing to lose rather than cross some line i don't think the
israelis have a line when it comes to that does the us i have fears about that i know that uh i
don't believe that russia does in the sense that if it becomes existential um i think that they would
result to a strategic exchange in order to preserve some semblance of the russian federation so let's
talk about russia and ukraine briefly does this middle east israel hamas situation um reduce the
odds of a really bad global strategic nuclear war between the west and russia um which i think is
something you and i both have been quite worried about that if ukraine loses what will fill that
vacuum will the west try and double down and does the result end up escalating how how does the
middle east situation change the russia nato situation i think it increases the risk of the
cranians doing something really stupid in the short term uh just last uh yet yesterday they
of course the us has been secretly shipping them these advanced tactical missile systems that
attack them that uh have they started using them the longer range missiles um that kind of happened
under the radar here with all the stuff going on with hamas the problem is that i the money is drawing
up you can already see a lot of the pro ukrainian twitter bots are starting to disappear because the
money's dried out uh which has made my life a little bit easier um so you can see that i think
that ukraine's going to get desperate and they're likely to try to do something i think we're going
to have a radiological event within the next few months unless russia's very careful and
rep and pulls this thing to a close in the short term what's a radiological event
so blowing up a reactor and causing a mass casualty event within ukraine
i think that has a very high likelihood right now because they're desperate they need to try to
reengage of western attention which right now is entirely focused on israel and the middle east and
the us in particular if it's a choice between israel and ukraine where ukraine goes under the bus
so i i think they realize that and they kind of uh they're desperate so the question is are they
desperate enough to negotiate or are they desperate enough to try to do something to reengage western
attention unfortunately i think it's it may well be that latter thing now i think the chances of us
intervention just got a lot smaller um i you know we're having to redeploy forces to the middle east
if this does start to involve where the us is protecting israel's northern flank with
hezbollah and i think you're going to see a massive us intervention in syria and if that happens to
try to block the iranian pipeline from uh the supplies getting the hezbollah so i i think if
it goes that route then we actually will have a lower chance of any kind of a direct war with
russia i think it'll be very ugly and messy what happens in ukraine but it'll get sorted out without
us and then unfortunately there there's the higher risk of tactical exchange in the middle east of
some kind but at least a strategic exchange will be lower so in today's world um is it possible for
the united states to fully support two war fronts uh in the middle east and in ukraine with munitions
and money and and everything that you know the logistics i mean i know nothing about that but
it seems that that stretches uh the united states and its allies pretty thin
yeah i mean we weren't even really able to support ukraine to the level that they needed
so you know we pulled a lot of the war reserves out of israel to send to ukraine and that's created
a bit of a bind so now we're having to send our strategic reserves into israel
so we have very rapidly depleted our reserves and if they do go into gaza if operations start in
earnest in the northern front with hezbollah much less at confrontation in syria with iran um
you know we we're going to be really stretched to to handle all that we'll be dipping into our
actual operational reserves which is and we don't have the industrial capacity to replace it in short
notice why is that we don't build stuff here you know we're we build we are basically producing in
terms of artillery ammunition which again is the the core thing you need in a modern conventional
battle is uh the 155 millimeter artillery shell is kind of the the metric you use and we basically
are you we it takes us a year to produce one month's worth of consumption so you know we're
we're in desperate shape on that and with no potential in the longer term to get to the
point where we could produce those kind of levels we just don't have the manufacturing capacity in
this country anymore oh boy i mean we talk about this all the time and then um we joke that about
monday morning that um you always give me bad news and it feels like that again you're telling me
things that i that i didn't know um you know i'm i'm a systems guy i look at ecology and energy
and and human behavior and if you if you kind of squint and see what's happening any one of these
bad outcomes destabilizes the oil uh the the spice flow uh to use a dune reference to the
rest of the world from the middle east which given the fragility of our financial system
the just in time nature of our medicines and everything else could be catastrophic even
without the use of of nuclear weapons um if if the if the middle east is destabilized
and it now seems that from that perspective there are thousands of potential archduke
ferdinand pathways and vectors that you and i can't even predict but how likely are we going to
navigate diplomatically this minefield uh in coming months wow nate i i don't i i have a really
hard time seeing how we get out of this one the us is really painted itself under a set of rhetorical
corners here and i particularly in the middle east
you know how do you you've got a very intransigent
israeli leadership you've created a situation where you've got you know several million
refugees multi-generational refugee system the the level of hatred and resentment between the
parties is such that it's going to be very difficult to come up with any kind of an acceptable
stabilizing solution you can maybe through enough application of enough force maybe beat
people back down to the point where they're not actively resisting but again does that pop back up
in six months or a year or whatever the long-term solutions are very difficult here you can go back
to at the end of world war one with between turkey and uh greece where there was an exchange of
populations and you know you had stabilization that way but that's the un resolutions around
israel are just the opposite because they guarantee a right of return and all of that so
we've structurally created a situation in the middle east where it's intractable there's no
there there isn't i don't know where there's a solution because neither side really everybody
talks about the so-called two-state solution but neither side accepts that they both want
a one-state solution so i i don't know you know other than coming in with overwhelming force
separating the parties and giving it a you know enforcing the peace at the point of the gun for
a least a generation or two how do you solve this i i don't know but but even if you did
solve that what happens with iran iraq and all of the the saudi arabia and all of the oil
nations the nations who have the oil that the world uses under their land how do you solve
avert them from getting involved but let me ask you this and i i'm really curious as to your
answer so i often say that i got my masters in in business from the university of chicago and the
word energy was never mentioned in the two years i was there i've been talking with you a lot in
the last few years and so i know you've had really good calls and are on top of the situation yet
since the israel hamas situation started on october 7th the long-term oil futures are up like
two dollars or two dollars and fifty cents like six seven eight years out and the short
term is up like four dollars like and the stock market is actually up since this happened so
most people with voting with their dollars strongly disagree with the risks that you've
just outlined well why is that risk coming a stasis you know we've gotten away for the last 30
years with ignoring the middle east for practical purposes and okay there's an occasional flare up
2006 11 on war okay yeah there's some terrorism blah blah but as you say the spice still flows
you know the oil is still coming so i think people tend to they think well you know we muddle through
last time we'll muddle through this time and that's where we have the hard task here is it
different this time because at one point it's going to be different at one point you know
that you you're going to run out of road at some point and the the people who say that well we'll
figure it out what's different this time well for one thing we've blown up the whole energy
connection with russia which has as we've discussed such a huge influence you look at my god the the
wahabi sunni leadership of saudi arabia is talking hourly daily if not hourly with the chia
radical quote unquote is a radical leadership of iran how that has never happened so if you're
talking about coordination between the different oil producing countries you know and they have
other markets too you've got now you know china is coming in willing to pay for resources you've
got the rest of the world is you know we're not the biggest market anymore we we're on the on the
downside of that uh people don't need the west anymore is where this is headed and once that
critical mass happens i think it'll fall apart very quickly except the west does need the middle east
and other places well i mean he does exactly um so what about europe i mean are they strongly
it's supportive of israel as as the u.s is and they're they're getting the double whammy here
because they've lost the the pipeline to russia and then also if there's something goes in the
middle east then then that's oil and and other things that they import yeah because what now a
third of their lng is coming through the straits of four moves i saw that statistic right correctly
recently um i you know europe is deindustrializing i and it's hard to see how europe survives that
if there's any kind of a normal winter this year if this conflict even if the conflict in the middle
east doesn't continue to the spiral uh it's hard to see how they're going to make it through this
winter without drastic cutbacks and so from an economic standpoint you look at well yeah again
we talk about gdp but you look at incomes and disruptions across europe are likely to become
quite uh severe which has of course political ramifications so i i just yeah europe has been
acting against its own interests for the last two years with the whole ukraine thing and i
especially germany i do not understand other than they have become that they're uh
they stopped being pragmatic and started german foreign policy through the cold war was largely
pragmatic but it's become much more ideological and you know ideology won't hit your house so i'm
not sure how long that's sustainable i actually think they with a normal winter they might be okay
this winter but every subsequent winter is going to get tougher especially if um they can't rely on
katar and and and other lng imports but that's a separate conversation um in in our first podcast
chuck i asked you what recommendations you would have for our political leaders and you replied
that we have to focus on reducing the level of geopolitical tensions uh and i asked you
how we would do this and you said don't buy into the propaganda don't buy into this adversarial
relationship that we increasingly have with other nations so this is almost two years from now
when i asked you that where do we stand now and how would you change your recommendations to
um our leaders uh two years on i think i'd use more profanity and yell more because it's
essentially the same uh the same situation is that you know this whole thing of immediate
comic books simplified oh hamas had our evil people with blood dripping from their fangs and
whatever i'm sorry that's not the real world and yes what happened the seventh was pretty
terrible but you know what the israeli bombings have done within gaza is pretty horrific also
and the point being that human beings are pretty crappy to each other and so at some point you've
got to decide well why are they being crappy and do they have any legitimate interests and legitimate
concerns and whatever you think of their ideology the fact is the people of gaza have been living
effectively in an open-air prison camp for years and when they're not resisting they get ignored
when they do flare up and resist they get bombed so don't let my biggest advice is don't let problems
fester when there's a quiet period don't go about your life and cash your checks go in and fix the
take the opportunities to fix things look at you can apply that to ukraine you could apply that to
any of a dozen conflict zones around the world neglect is what causes them to flare up and once
they flare it up it's damn hard to fix it and if at all well you can apply that to probably the
personal lives of everyone watching this program as well when there's a quiet period get some of
this other stuff prepared and done so is there a common thread through this entire conversation
that unites all of these issues that seem so existential and worrisome complexity in a word
it's complexity these are not simple and again as i just said to avoid comic book kinds of good
evil right wrong depictions sure there are some cases where that applies but it's actually fairly
rare there's always context there's always history there's always detail that matters and if you look
at all the problems we face whether it's economics or ai or geopolitics a lot of it boils down to the
fact that our modern world is so complex it has exceeded the ability of our governance it's exceeded
the ability of our political structures to handle them and that i think is is the existential
problem humanity faces is we can't we don't have a means of governing ourselves that takes into
account and handles complexity so as you know i care deeply about the natural world and other
species the oceans climate change the environment how humans are going to navigate the great
simplification it seems to me and in recent presentations i've talked about the four horsemen
of the 2020s it seems to me that geopolitics and our response in this arena trumps all those other
things that none of that other stuff is good is going to matter until we have a stable or more
stable than we have today situation with the major powers in the world most of which have nuclear
weapons what are your thoughts on that i lose sleep over this i agree completely nato a lot of my
research active work is trying to figure out implications of changing climate that sort of
thing using models that were originally developed for for nuclear strategy nuclear war and that kind
of thing but you know it's you're right none of it matters you can try to look at flooding in
africa or try to figure out any of these other problems and none of them matter if we blow
ourselves up but more generically you can't solve any of these problems you can have the greatest
technical fix in the world but if you cannot get the political leadership to understand
and buy in and to take actions that are perhaps not to their short-term advantage but long-term
advantage it doesn't happen of course that's one of the areas that you've talked about extensively
with various people is that have the you know human nature and going from the short-term
high the short-term fix versus long-term planning and deferred pleasure and all those kinds of
of things that all all interact with the fact that complex problems require solutions where
the benefit and payoff isn't immediately obvious and it's also hard to explain to an electorate
or to voters or supporters so that means our political system basically isn't capable of
dealing with it and so I know that how do we I think the key is if you want to fix the environment
if you want to fix geopolitics if you want to fix resource limitations you got to fix
governance first because until you get structures in place that let people solve those problems
and carry those solutions forward into the future then they don't get fixed
is AI and potentially AGI going to make this even worse because we've got thousands of
wealthy people and corporations and nation states that are in this arms race to get
there first with the best AI and it seems like governance of the type that you're talking about
requires wisdom and restraint as opposed to amassing more financial military geopolitical power
so does does AI accentuate the risk vectors that you're discussing or is that overblown?
I tend to think it's a little bit overblown in the sense that yeah it makes things worse
at the margins but we've been quite good at screwing ourselves over for a long time and so
it maybe it makes things happen a little bit faster but the flip side of that is hey if it
triggers a war then it crashes all the networks and the resources that are required to make AI
work so you know it's a self-correcting problem which is a very cynical thing to say because
you're talking about millions of possibly even billions of lines at stake but you know that's
being cynical and having gala's humor is the only way you can survive in this business sometimes
but bottom line is I agree AI is a problem but I think it's going to ultimately be self-correcting
and not in a good way. So I had planned since this is our fourth recorded conversation
to finally give you a chance to answer the questions that I ask all of my guests the
personal questions but in nine minutes from now believe it or not I have a presentation to
about a hundred college students which is of course very difficult for me to leave a conversation
like this and explain the world to bright-eyed pro-social 19 to 20 year olds.
Do you have any just general thoughts on that and or closing words?
Try to to younger people particularly those that are getting started I think it's important that
take the world as it is and it's not a very pleasant place that humans are often cruel to
each other there's a lot of horror in the world and particularly when you look at governments and
how to try to make things work it's unbelievably frustrating but the flip side is people can also
be quite kind to each other they can also you know they also have cats that they you know and
that keep us in line and so you know yeah it's it's a dark discouraging business sometimes
but just understand that way the way we survive this is not in spite of our humanity but because
of it. Well we've we've been close to nuclear war many times and you've discussed that on previous
podcast where someone didn't follow orders and someone dug down deep into their humanity and
made the right choice and I'm hopeful that in the broader arena of what's coming that those sorts of
situations will will happen but I think we have to be informed. Yeah and be the one who sees the
humanity don't be the one who signs on to you know dropping people into you know we're very much
now into identity politics and classifying and grouping people and assigning motivations to them
understand that the person on the other side of there more than likely has valid reasons for
believing what they're believing in and you need to understand that and find the commonality rather
than constantly looking for the divisions. That's good advice. Chuck in all four of our conversations
you've mentioned the imperative that we're going to need different governance structures
to make it through coming decades that is an entire conversation unto itself. I would love to
have you back maybe as part of a round table on unpacking how we could at least take the first
steps towards a different governance fit for purpose in this human predicament sort of era
if you'd be willing. Yeah absolutely because again all this other stuff we're talking about
are symptoms we've got to fix governance and that's that's the hard question isn't it Nate?
Yeah thank you for your time and your your lifetime of expertise on this and to be continued my friend.
Sounds good sir take care good luck with your class. If you enjoyed or learned from this episode
