people listening that want to understand what's going on in the world but understand that a lot
of the the media is goal-seeked to support a certain narrative what do you do just tune out and
tend your potatoes or I mean what do you do yeah that's tuning out and tending your potatoes or in
my case my tomato patch felt back is awfully appealing so I made a short list of the areas that you
should become at least somewhat knowledgeable in if you want to understand things and okay maybe
it's not such a short list of in history link language linguistics international law economics
engineering military science theology okay that's just half the list and that's not even going into
the details and I hate to throw up my hands and say I don't know how the average person does it
you know I've got decades of experience in this and it's virtually a full-time job trying to
create a worldview that I have some level of confidence in and so I don't know for the average
person I don't know how to do that somehow we've got to build some institutions where their job
and obligation is to be trusted sources of information and it's clearly not the media
because there's too much of a financial incentive and too much of a governmental regulatory pressure
to not be objective and so I don't know how we do that Nate I don't either but it uh as someone
who's an educator and a scientist uh and trying to I think we need an informed public uh to have
any chance of of benign outcomes and all these things and it I lose sleep over this um especially
with what I'm learning about AI and and uh the ability to create fakes and then there's real
false flags and I think people are just not going to know what's really going on um well
Nate forget it forget an informed forget an informed public I would be happy with informed
legislature legislators and informed leaders yeah because I look at the the horrific knowledge gap
among elected leaders in this country you know trying to brief people who are supposedly in
positions of power and they don't understand basic science or engineering much less history
or linguistics or any of those other things and these are the leaders people who supposedly are
and I know this sounds probably pretty arrogant but you know I was raised in or my professional
career started in an era where you know you were expected to take decades of studying all these
fields before anybody took you halfway seriously and today the people making the decisions don't
have the background in these fields they seem to be driven more by ideology and by their own
stovepipe narratives and it's frightening you just look at you know what's going on in our
and congress versus the administration right now and there's a death of expertise and that is frightening
from a governance standpoint much less from an electorate standpoint and and so because of that
situation we end up having these soundbite cartoon like summations of a really complex and dangerous
situation exactly you look at something that I cite quite often is how and again not to defend
the president of the Russian Federation but he'll make a statement it's immediately pulled out
translated usually mistranslated into English without context and then paraded as evidence of
his evil well you know a good example of that is when he was discussing the collapse of the Soviet
Union Putin called that the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century well what he meant
by that the context of that is that the way the Soviet Union fell apart created a lot of the
problems that we see in the world today and I think if you look around you have to say he's not
wrong you look at the conflict in Ukraine you look at the conflict in the Middle East that was
the Middle East was just left negligent for years while groups like Hamas and Hezbollah
gained power you look at how Afghanistan was ignored for what 12 years until suddenly they were
flying airplanes into buildings and so that that context from that statement is missing
yet that gets paraded all over American media as as proof that he's evil well that that's just one
very small tidbit of an example I could show misquotes from other world leaders just as easily
or even our own leaders that show the same thing so let's segue that back to the Middle East is
this a completely different segregated war than Ukraine Russia or is the fact that Iran and Russia
are are backing Hezbollah and and Syria and it's all kind of interlinked is this kind of an extension
of the NATO Russia situation no that's not to say they aren't convolved but they're completely
different you know this war has been going on for 2000 years I mean at least so it's
it they're not directly related what is related is that the Middle East conflicts have been tied up
in great power struggles and again you know periodization how do you figure out where to
start your narrative and start history and probably we're going to have to start it at the collapse
of the Ottoman Empire which controlled that entire region and then how did things get split up you
look at World War one the the Sykes-Picot arrangement where they literally in a cafe in Paris drew the
boundaries on a napkin I mean that's you can't make this stuff up sometimes they and so those
boundaries you look at Balfour in the 40s and how the nation state of Israel got started and all of
that complex history that led us to the point where you now have a situation where you've got a
entrenched resident population the Israelis who feel threatened on all sides you have a neglected
population of the Palestinian Arabs who lived there for generations and now have been lived as a
diaspora for several generations constantly keeping alive the thought of going home again
and reclaiming their lands that you know that has nothing really to do with the US foreign policy
or Russia or even to a lesser extent Iran other than they are taking advantage of that situation
for their own political purposes and you know that's where it does get convolved and particularly
right now what you're witnessing is the is it the last grasp of the American Empire or is
it the desperate attempt of the US to remain a global unipower there was an article just recently
in Foreign Affairs magazine discussing how the US is still the world's dominant power by far
and you read their argument and Nate you would look at it and shake your head and go what the
heck are these people talking about because they're mainly basing it on GDP well we know GDP is a
horrible measure of the capacity of the country particularly when you're talking about financialization
and so when you look at they're talking about oh well you know we spend more on our military than
the next 10 militaries combined okay well a rational military analyst looks at that and goes
yeah but it costs us 20 times more to blow up a given target because of the way that our system
works than it does our next level of potential adversaries so in terms of resources those
kind of measures and metrics don't work yet this couple of very respected foreign policy
authors were arguing that the US is still the dominant world power and we can basically act as
a hegemon well what do you do in that environment this is another thing that I've come to terms with
and learned in the last 18 months is when people say the US wants to do this or the US wants to
go to the war with Iran or or take out their potential of nuclear weapons or the US wants
to do something with Russia it's not really the US there are several and multiple factions within
government that wax and wane and their their voice and their power but it's not a unified thing it's
not like there's 20 politicians sitting around in agreeing on something there are all kinds of
unfolding alliances that that somehow get their way and so it's not the United States as one entity
that is desiring these things and as a citizen you and I are doing this as a pro social pro future
pro life on earth you know contribution to the discourse because we as Americans we deeply
care about the state of the future of our world but getting back to this question about factions
let me jump in please just for a second because I think you've raised an important point
that politically there is an incredible uniformity of thought within US foreign policy
if you go back to the 80s there were basically two schools of thought there was a stronger military
emphasis on military emphasis on power projection and there was another school of thought that was
more no we need to concentrate on soft diplomacy we need to see things like peace corps we need to
engage there were actually two substantially different schools of thought today there really is an
remarkable uniformity of thought within the US think about how and I've been on the receiving
end of a lot of this hatred for even suggesting that you know maybe we should talk to Russia maybe
we should have diplomatic outreach and you look at how the US has very much both parties democrat
and republican are very aggressive the so-called neoconservative philosophy which says that the
US cannot allow any regional much less global powers to approach it in terms of ability to
project military power that is a remarkable level of uniformity now there's some details that get
people argue over and make more of them there are there's at least within the republican party now
somewhat of a hesitate to use the term America first but a little bit more of a well maybe we need
to look after ourselves first but it's a very small movement it's not the majority by any stretch
the majority of both parties and almost uniformly it's incredible the democrat party used to have
a fairly significant peace movement within it you can't find a peace activist in the democrat
party anymore without a magnifying glass so i i did want to jump in and say that within America
there is a remarkable uniformity of thought that the US should project military power and use that
almost as a first option i was more uh pointing out like last week um i guess it's two weeks ago
now october 7th that on the morning of october 8 there was this very detailed wall street journal
article uh pointing that iran was behind um what hamas did and with all kinds of references like
12 hours after it happened and you know so there are definitely some strong iran haters in our
government as there are people that dislike russia etc and so there are these sub campaigns
happening absolutely there's yeah absolutely there's there's argument as to who we should
blow up first but there doesn't seem to be that much consideration on maybe we should try not
blowing people up for a while and see if we can negotiate or come up with alternative methods
and i know i'm being a little bit sarcastic on that but uh it does seem like uh our uh
kinetic military form policy that goes to that attitude change within the state department
where state department is now often more militaristic than the defense department but you're right
it's you know the there's the iran first crowd there's the russia first crowd there's the china
confrontation crowd but what's the common thread through all that it's confrontation
so let's get back to the middle east situation um you mentioned that uh rather than losing
that israel will choose a nuclear option so nuclear israel has nuclear weapons um what is the
the nuclear risk here um and maybe you could uh talk about the the wider uh context uh with iran
and the situation in the middle east yeah um so the obvious fear is that should israel start to lose
conventionally that they will resort to nuclear weapons to preserve the state and i i don't think
there's any doubt about that so the next love question is are there any other actors in the
region of iran's probably pretty close to developing uh having the ability to deploy nuclear weapons
that's why just as a sideline i'm not entirely convinced iran was behind this latest outbreak
i don't think they were quite ready for this uh it doesn't out it would seem to make more sense
for them to wait until they had a nuclear capacity as a deterrent to rather than starting a major
regional war of course pakistan the so-called islamic bomb they pakistan has a number of uh
nuclear weapons those are largely reserved for dealing with india so you know would they be
willing to part with any that that's a separate question i think probably not but given the
emotion and given pressures maybe uh so we're talking tactical nuclear weapons we're talking
tactical nuclear exchanges of you know the low single digits to tens which you know has regional
impacts certainly changes the political single digits to tens what does that mean uh you know
under 30 uh 30 weapons in the you know 10 to 50 kiloton range which again is some of the stuff
we've talked about in our previous podcast about when you start to look at environmental effects
that's where you're starting to have regional environmental effects but you're probably not
going to get global kinds of they clearly be uh effects beyond the immediate middle east fall out
and particularly impacts from temperature changes things like that but they'd be transient for the
most part um now in the region of course you're talking about hundreds of years for within the
target sense of impacts but um the bigger that in terms of wider context one of the fears is
that the us gets itself involved with iran and i find it hard you know we've got some very advanced
conventional weapons but the iranians have gone to great lengths to protect a lot of their nuclear
infrastructure and so the question is can we with assurance destroy iran's nuclear capacity
without using tactical nuclear weapons because it would take something of a tactical nuke to get
to the underground locations where they're located or something like that exactly to assure
yourselves that assure yourself that you have destroyed that target but there's another factor
too that i've heard discussed by us military officials and that's you know we haven't used
a nuclear weapon in 75 years so then the question becomes do people doubt your nuclear deterrent
are you willing to use a nuke and you know this gets into that where one of the things on my
list was anthropology and psychology and spite and all those things that that you've talked about
and the question is uh do you there there are literally senior u.s military officials who have
argued that we need to find a reason to use a nuclear weapon so people will still be afraid
and believe that we will use a nuclear weapon and they say that with a straight face it's like some
rod surling twilight zoom movie that that we're watching and living it it's just i keep yeah
i keep looking for him to step out of the i keep looking for him to step out of the shadows
it's like rod when are you gonna step out and tell us that this is just a bad dream but uh
well i i mean not to to you know go too far off off tangent but would uh given what we face
i think you and i agree that the odds of at least some nuclear weapons going off in the next
decade are much higher than the average person expects and that's partially because we've been
paying attention to this and partially because of what you talked about i think it was our first
or second podcast the concept of risk homeostasis that if you run a red light 12 times and nothing
bad happens you're going to adjust your behavior to not think about that risk in the same way we
haven't had a nuclear war or a nuclear weapon and as you say 75 years so people minimize emotionally
what the risks really are but what if a tactical nuke or a nuclear weapon were to go off
wouldn't that be a psychological and emotional reminder and wake up call to the rest of the
world of how horrific and potentially civilization ending a strategic peer-to-peer exchange of those
weapons would be maybe maybe not modern tactical weapons with the precision targeting um one of
the arguments and this gets you talk about a rabbit hole this is one that we could easily
blow several hours on and put most people to sleep but the issue of given precision
targeting of small tactical nuclear weapons they're more usable in the sense they don't
either not city busters it's not like kurosha or nagasaki where you're trying to target and
wipe out the entire city you're trying to destroy you maybe have it detonate at or even under the
surface to be able to destroy a hardened structure now there's good and bad to that there's maybe
fewer direct civilian casualties in that kind of an environment the bad side is you're lofting a lot
of particulates into the upper atmosphere and you know again that gets very messy very quickly but
the point is that and that's another reason why the fear is that crossing that nuclear
threshold is much easier now because of precision targeting and you can convince yourself well i
can hit just what i'm after and not cause a lot of collateral damage uh again though you're right
the psychological threshold of okay now you have used a nuclear weapon does the the other side now
feel freer to use a nuclear weapon against your troop concentrations against a port maybe do you
start to then and that's where as we discussed in our previous podcast the whole proud profit
exercise and this whole attitude of once you cross that nuclear threshold where's the bright
line where you stop and once you're at war and once you're starting to sling these things around
i'm not sure that there's a place where you can where one side of the other is going to stop you
have to be willing to lose again i keep coming back to are you what what line are you not willing
to cross at what point are you willing to lose rather than cross some line i don't think the
israelis have a line when it comes to that does the us i have fears about that i know that uh i
don't believe that russia does in the sense that if it becomes existential um i think that they would
result to a strategic exchange in order to preserve some semblance of the russian federation so let's
talk about russia and ukraine briefly does this middle east israel hamas situation um reduce the
odds of a really bad global strategic nuclear war between the west and russia um which i think is
something you and i both have been quite worried about that if ukraine loses what will fill that
vacuum will the west try and double down and does the result end up escalating how how does the
middle east situation change the russia nato situation i think it increases the risk of the
cranians doing something really stupid in the short term uh just last uh yet yesterday they
of course the us has been secretly shipping them these advanced tactical missile systems that
attack them that uh have they started using them the longer range missiles um that kind of happened
under the radar here with all the stuff going on with hamas the problem is that i the money is drawing
up you can already see a lot of the pro ukrainian twitter bots are starting to disappear because the
money's dried out uh which has made my life a little bit easier um so you can see that i think
