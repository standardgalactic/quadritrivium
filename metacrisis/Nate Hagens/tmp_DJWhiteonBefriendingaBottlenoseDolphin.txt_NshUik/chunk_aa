One of the pieces of research that I was doing back when I was doing it not in my lab but back
for University of Hawaii was they were doing visual acuity experiments on a dolphin and
the setup was very accrued by modern standards but it had two targets and if the dolphin made the
correct visual choice as to the one it was supposed to choose showing it had good vision
and it would push the paddle associated with that one and then the person running the trial
which in that case was me would be hidden from the dolphin in theory the dolphin didn't know that
the anybody was back there just you throw a herring over the edge of the pond and the pool and the
dolphin would get it and the operant conditioner type thing you know the you know stimulus response
reward kind of a thing problem is the dolphin clearly knew that I was in there she just see
the people go in there and she knew that I was running the experiment and she also knew that
she was going to get to the same amount of total food to the ounce whether no matter how she did
experiments so she just had fun with it and she she'd do all kind of different games that dolphins
in general I find you they'll flip the game on you but in this case and I had no flexibility
there was a specific protocol I had to follow because it was it was not my research it was I
would just run it running the things and so she'd get she'd get them all right for a while but
instead of eating the fish she'd put them in the tank was only five feet deep she'd put
she'd build a pile of herring on the bottom and then she'd start getting them 100 wrong
and what I was supposed to do was not chance not chance at that point no no no when she when
she got it right I was supposed to push a button that made a reward siren you got it right and
then she'd get the fish and she'd pair that if she got it wrong you hit a buzzer there was a
klaxon but you got it wrong and you get no fish so she'd she'd make this pile of fish on on the
floor down there here I was skulking behind this plywood you know thing that opening and revealing
the things and once she had a big enough pile of fish she'd start getting them all wrong of course
you have to see just as well get them all wrong as to get them all right but she'd get them all
wrong and then she'd pick up a fish and cock her cock her rostrum back to throw it there's a my
observation was through like a five by five inch hole in the in the plywood which she wasn't supposed
to be able to see because they didn't think all of us could see that well and it was dark in there
so I'd be looking to see what she was doing and uh she'd push the wrong one and I'd hit the paxing
and she'd wing a fish through the hole and smack me in the forehead and so she ended up shaping my
behavior she'd keep doing that smack and it's amazing how accurate she was I didn't everyone
didn't hit me in the forehead but most of them did whack whack just you know herring against my
forehead and after a while she started shaping my behavior I got so tired of getting slapped in
the face with herring that I would I would wait even I wasn't supposed to wait in terms of pushing
the klaxon buzzer and she would wait too it's like she'd get it wrong and she go I know you
got to push the buzzer dude you know and it I'd wait for like 60 seconds and finally
so anyway I'd walk out of there with a data sheet that showed she was virtually blind
and covered with little silver scales on my complexion and then then then later later on
of course I'd go in with her and we'd swim for an hour and she'd sonar my skeleton and you know
what what does that mean all the things you're skeleton well you know they they see a dolphin's
primary perceptual modality is sound and it's like we had a flashlight in our heads they they
can I mean when they look at a human with a sonar they're looking with something like you know it's
like a you know x-ray like an enhanced ultrasound in other words they could they can see the contents
of your stomach the the air spaces everything like that and it's very interesting to to be friends
with with a person who could see you in that way and and and it was pretty it was it was just
amazing and by the way dolphin she weighed 325 pounds she could have killed me at any time any
dolphin any full-size violinist often could at any time kill anybody they're in the water with
they don't is to their credit but it's
uh it interesting the whole process of getting to know and trust each other and stuff and
over many months of spending time in in with with the dolphin uh it was just
it was it was intense and it was definitely one of the most meaningful experiences of my life that
is with me still today and will be always is this the same dolphin that you um regularly
did yoga with listening to music uh yeah and one thing she'd like to do is is like would be on the
surface and she would she would do it do a kind of a twist to balance my nose and her blowhole out
of the water and then sing you know well holding on to my hands with with her pectoral fins and then
uh it just sort of swam to the center of the pool and just uh yeah sounds good just sing a little
song sort of things and uh with her eyes closed and I closed my suit it was sort of a meditative
thing so I don't know if that's dolphin yoga or whatever it is but it was a thing it wasn't
it wasn't my creation either it was something that she created and decided to do and that's just
one of oh you know a thousand different things that she would innovate to do I was just in there
to be friends and she would say okay well you know we've got nothing to do here's all of these games
here's all these things that we could do and uh I will note that this particular dolphin was kept
in solitary confinement had not been in with another dolphin in many years are dolphins
social creatures they're incredibly social uh and I say that as a human introvert but dolphins
are incredibly social it is not right to keep dolphins away from other dolphins in solitary
but this particular one was in solitary and although I wanted to know her as well I also
felt a bit of an obligation because of this you know social deprivation that she was so
I'm sure I was a very poor substitute for other dolphins but I didn't have control over that
situation and I tried to be as good a friend as I could and you know and not just for her
but also while doing that realizing okay this gift that I've been given there's no way I'm
ever going to be able to pay this back but one thing I can do is save a bunch of other dolphins
that I'll never meet and I have and I hope to continue doing that uh and uh you know it's uh
it's such a small payback for such a wonderful thing to to have lived
