that ukraine's going to get desperate and they're likely to try to do something i think we're going
to have a radiological event within the next few months unless russia's very careful and
rep and pulls this thing to a close in the short term what's a radiological event
so blowing up a reactor and causing a mass casualty event within ukraine
i think that has a very high likelihood right now because they're desperate they need to try to
reengage of western attention which right now is entirely focused on israel and the middle east and
the us in particular if it's a choice between israel and ukraine where ukraine goes under the bus
so i i think they realize that and they kind of uh they're desperate so the question is are they
desperate enough to negotiate or are they desperate enough to try to do something to reengage western
attention unfortunately i think it's it may well be that latter thing now i think the chances of us
intervention just got a lot smaller um i you know we're having to redeploy forces to the middle east
if this does start to involve where the us is protecting israel's northern flank with
hezbollah and i think you're going to see a massive us intervention in syria and if that happens to
try to block the iranian pipeline from uh the supplies getting the hezbollah so i i think if
it goes that route then we actually will have a lower chance of any kind of a direct war with
russia i think it'll be very ugly and messy what happens in ukraine but it'll get sorted out without
us and then unfortunately there there's the higher risk of tactical exchange in the middle east of
some kind but at least a strategic exchange will be lower so in today's world um is it possible for
the united states to fully support two war fronts uh in the middle east and in ukraine with munitions
and money and and everything that you know the logistics i mean i know nothing about that but
it seems that that stretches uh the united states and its allies pretty thin
yeah i mean we weren't even really able to support ukraine to the level that they needed
so you know we pulled a lot of the war reserves out of israel to send to ukraine and that's created
a bit of a bind so now we're having to send our strategic reserves into israel
so we have very rapidly depleted our reserves and if they do go into gaza if operations start in
earnest in the northern front with hezbollah much less at confrontation in syria with iran um
you know we we're going to be really stretched to to handle all that we'll be dipping into our
actual operational reserves which is and we don't have the industrial capacity to replace it in short
notice why is that we don't build stuff here you know we're we build we are basically producing in
terms of artillery ammunition which again is the the core thing you need in a modern conventional
battle is uh the 155 millimeter artillery shell is kind of the the metric you use and we basically
are you we it takes us a year to produce one month's worth of consumption so you know we're
we're in desperate shape on that and with no potential in the longer term to get to the
point where we could produce those kind of levels we just don't have the manufacturing capacity in
this country anymore oh boy i mean we talk about this all the time and then um we joke that about
monday morning that um you always give me bad news and it feels like that again you're telling me
things that i that i didn't know um you know i'm i'm a systems guy i look at ecology and energy
and and human behavior and if you if you kind of squint and see what's happening any one of these
bad outcomes destabilizes the oil uh the the spice flow uh to use a dune reference to the
rest of the world from the middle east which given the fragility of our financial system
the just in time nature of our medicines and everything else could be catastrophic even
without the use of of nuclear weapons um if if the if the middle east is destabilized
and it now seems that from that perspective there are thousands of potential archduke
ferdinand pathways and vectors that you and i can't even predict but how likely are we going to
navigate diplomatically this minefield uh in coming months wow nate i i don't i i have a really
hard time seeing how we get out of this one the us is really painted itself under a set of rhetorical
corners here and i particularly in the middle east
you know how do you you've got a very intransigent
israeli leadership you've created a situation where you've got you know several million
refugees multi-generational refugee system the the level of hatred and resentment between the
parties is such that it's going to be very difficult to come up with any kind of an acceptable
stabilizing solution you can maybe through enough application of enough force maybe beat
people back down to the point where they're not actively resisting but again does that pop back up
in six months or a year or whatever the long-term solutions are very difficult here you can go back
to at the end of world war one with between turkey and uh greece where there was an exchange of
populations and you know you had stabilization that way but that's the un resolutions around
israel are just the opposite because they guarantee a right of return and all of that so
we've structurally created a situation in the middle east where it's intractable there's no
there there isn't i don't know where there's a solution because neither side really everybody
talks about the so-called two-state solution but neither side accepts that they both want
a one-state solution so i i don't know you know other than coming in with overwhelming force
separating the parties and giving it a you know enforcing the peace at the point of the gun for
a least a generation or two how do you solve this i i don't know but but even if you did
solve that what happens with iran iraq and all of the the saudi arabia and all of the oil
nations the nations who have the oil that the world uses under their land how do you solve
avert them from getting involved but let me ask you this and i i'm really curious as to your
answer so i often say that i got my masters in in business from the university of chicago and the
word energy was never mentioned in the two years i was there i've been talking with you a lot in
the last few years and so i know you've had really good calls and are on top of the situation yet
since the israel hamas situation started on october 7th the long-term oil futures are up like
two dollars or two dollars and fifty cents like six seven eight years out and the short
term is up like four dollars like and the stock market is actually up since this happened so
most people with voting with their dollars strongly disagree with the risks that you've
just outlined well why is that risk coming a stasis you know we've gotten away for the last 30
years with ignoring the middle east for practical purposes and okay there's an occasional flare up
2006 11 on war okay yeah there's some terrorism blah blah but as you say the spice still flows
you know the oil is still coming so i think people tend to they think well you know we muddle through
last time we'll muddle through this time and that's where we have the hard task here is it
different this time because at one point it's going to be different at one point you know
that you you're going to run out of road at some point and the the people who say that well we'll
figure it out what's different this time well for one thing we've blown up the whole energy
connection with russia which has as we've discussed such a huge influence you look at my god the the
wahabi sunni leadership of saudi arabia is talking hourly daily if not hourly with the chia
radical quote unquote is a radical leadership of iran how that has never happened so if you're
talking about coordination between the different oil producing countries you know and they have
other markets too you've got now you know china is coming in willing to pay for resources you've
got the rest of the world is you know we're not the biggest market anymore we we're on the on the
downside of that uh people don't need the west anymore is where this is headed and once that
critical mass happens i think it'll fall apart very quickly except the west does need the middle east
and other places well i mean he does exactly um so what about europe i mean are they strongly
it's supportive of israel as as the u.s is and they're they're getting the double whammy here
because they've lost the the pipeline to russia and then also if there's something goes in the
middle east then then that's oil and and other things that they import yeah because what now a
third of their lng is coming through the straits of four moves i saw that statistic right correctly
recently um i you know europe is deindustrializing i and it's hard to see how europe survives that
if there's any kind of a normal winter this year if this conflict even if the conflict in the middle
east doesn't continue to the spiral uh it's hard to see how they're going to make it through this
winter without drastic cutbacks and so from an economic standpoint you look at well yeah again
we talk about gdp but you look at incomes and disruptions across europe are likely to become
quite uh severe which has of course political ramifications so i i just yeah europe has been
acting against its own interests for the last two years with the whole ukraine thing and i
especially germany i do not understand other than they have become that they're uh
they stopped being pragmatic and started german foreign policy through the cold war was largely
pragmatic but it's become much more ideological and you know ideology won't hit your house so i'm
not sure how long that's sustainable i actually think they with a normal winter they might be okay
this winter but every subsequent winter is going to get tougher especially if um they can't rely on
katar and and and other lng imports but that's a separate conversation um in in our first podcast
chuck i asked you what recommendations you would have for our political leaders and you replied
that we have to focus on reducing the level of geopolitical tensions uh and i asked you
how we would do this and you said don't buy into the propaganda don't buy into this adversarial
relationship that we increasingly have with other nations so this is almost two years from now
when i asked you that where do we stand now and how would you change your recommendations to
um our leaders uh two years on i think i'd use more profanity and yell more because it's
essentially the same uh the same situation is that you know this whole thing of immediate
comic books simplified oh hamas had our evil people with blood dripping from their fangs and
whatever i'm sorry that's not the real world and yes what happened the seventh was pretty
terrible but you know what the israeli bombings have done within gaza is pretty horrific also
and the point being that human beings are pretty crappy to each other and so at some point you've
got to decide well why are they being crappy and do they have any legitimate interests and legitimate
concerns and whatever you think of their ideology the fact is the people of gaza have been living
effectively in an open-air prison camp for years and when they're not resisting they get ignored
when they do flare up and resist they get bombed so don't let my biggest advice is don't let problems
fester when there's a quiet period don't go about your life and cash your checks go in and fix the
take the opportunities to fix things look at you can apply that to ukraine you could apply that to
any of a dozen conflict zones around the world neglect is what causes them to flare up and once
they flare it up it's damn hard to fix it and if at all well you can apply that to probably the
personal lives of everyone watching this program as well when there's a quiet period get some of
this other stuff prepared and done so is there a common thread through this entire conversation
that unites all of these issues that seem so existential and worrisome complexity in a word
it's complexity these are not simple and again as i just said to avoid comic book kinds of good
evil right wrong depictions sure there are some cases where that applies but it's actually fairly
rare there's always context there's always history there's always detail that matters and if you look
at all the problems we face whether it's economics or ai or geopolitics a lot of it boils down to the
fact that our modern world is so complex it has exceeded the ability of our governance it's exceeded
the ability of our political structures to handle them and that i think is is the existential
problem humanity faces is we can't we don't have a means of governing ourselves that takes into
account and handles complexity so as you know i care deeply about the natural world and other
species the oceans climate change the environment how humans are going to navigate the great
simplification it seems to me and in recent presentations i've talked about the four horsemen
of the 2020s it seems to me that geopolitics and our response in this arena trumps all those other
things that none of that other stuff is good is going to matter until we have a stable or more
stable than we have today situation with the major powers in the world most of which have nuclear
weapons what are your thoughts on that i lose sleep over this i agree completely nato a lot of my
research active work is trying to figure out implications of changing climate that sort of
thing using models that were originally developed for for nuclear strategy nuclear war and that kind
of thing but you know it's you're right none of it matters you can try to look at flooding in
africa or try to figure out any of these other problems and none of them matter if we blow
ourselves up but more generically you can't solve any of these problems you can have the greatest
technical fix in the world but if you cannot get the political leadership to understand
and buy in and to take actions that are perhaps not to their short-term advantage but long-term
advantage it doesn't happen of course that's one of the areas that you've talked about extensively
with various people is that have the you know human nature and going from the short-term
high the short-term fix versus long-term planning and deferred pleasure and all those kinds of
of things that all all interact with the fact that complex problems require solutions where
the benefit and payoff isn't immediately obvious and it's also hard to explain to an electorate
or to voters or supporters so that means our political system basically isn't capable of
dealing with it and so I know that how do we I think the key is if you want to fix the environment
if you want to fix geopolitics if you want to fix resource limitations you got to fix
governance first because until you get structures in place that let people solve those problems
and carry those solutions forward into the future then they don't get fixed
is AI and potentially AGI going to make this even worse because we've got thousands of
wealthy people and corporations and nation states that are in this arms race to get
there first with the best AI and it seems like governance of the type that you're talking about
requires wisdom and restraint as opposed to amassing more financial military geopolitical power
so does does AI accentuate the risk vectors that you're discussing or is that overblown?
I tend to think it's a little bit overblown in the sense that yeah it makes things worse
at the margins but we've been quite good at screwing ourselves over for a long time and so
it maybe it makes things happen a little bit faster but the flip side of that is hey if it
triggers a war then it crashes all the networks and the resources that are required to make AI
work so you know it's a self-correcting problem which is a very cynical thing to say because
you're talking about millions of possibly even billions of lines at stake but you know that's
being cynical and having gala's humor is the only way you can survive in this business sometimes
but bottom line is I agree AI is a problem but I think it's going to ultimately be self-correcting
and not in a good way. So I had planned since this is our fourth recorded conversation
to finally give you a chance to answer the questions that I ask all of my guests the
personal questions but in nine minutes from now believe it or not I have a presentation to
about a hundred college students which is of course very difficult for me to leave a conversation
like this and explain the world to bright-eyed pro-social 19 to 20 year olds.
Do you have any just general thoughts on that and or closing words?
Try to to younger people particularly those that are getting started I think it's important that
take the world as it is and it's not a very pleasant place that humans are often cruel to
each other there's a lot of horror in the world and particularly when you look at governments and
how to try to make things work it's unbelievably frustrating but the flip side is people can also
be quite kind to each other they can also you know they also have cats that they you know and
that keep us in line and so you know yeah it's it's a dark discouraging business sometimes
but just understand that way the way we survive this is not in spite of our humanity but because
of it. Well we've we've been close to nuclear war many times and you've discussed that on previous
podcast where someone didn't follow orders and someone dug down deep into their humanity and
made the right choice and I'm hopeful that in the broader arena of what's coming that those sorts of
situations will will happen but I think we have to be informed. Yeah and be the one who sees the
humanity don't be the one who signs on to you know dropping people into you know we're very much
now into identity politics and classifying and grouping people and assigning motivations to them
understand that the person on the other side of there more than likely has valid reasons for
believing what they're believing in and you need to understand that and find the commonality rather
than constantly looking for the divisions. That's good advice. Chuck in all four of our conversations
you've mentioned the imperative that we're going to need different governance structures
to make it through coming decades that is an entire conversation unto itself. I would love to
have you back maybe as part of a round table on unpacking how we could at least take the first
steps towards a different governance fit for purpose in this human predicament sort of era
if you'd be willing. Yeah absolutely because again all this other stuff we're talking about
