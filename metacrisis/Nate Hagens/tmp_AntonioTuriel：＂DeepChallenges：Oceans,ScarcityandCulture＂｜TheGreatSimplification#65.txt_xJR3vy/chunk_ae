contaminating ourselves i mean they are poisoning ourselves all the end so at the end and all these
things may be because we have we have had intent of growing forever in a free planet and this
fortune cannot work and this fortune should at one point of our should break at some place it is
breaking several places at the same time okay it doesn't matter we have arrived to this point
as i used to say that i am not looking for um how do you say ah sorry i i i i i i i i i i i i
i'm not interested in in in finding the guilty persons i'm interested in finding the solutions
so forget about how we are here it doesn't it doesn't imply for it that for sure people
some people have more responsibility than others but for the time being the chat's
concentrating the solutions which is the thing that we need and as you have said um we are going
to run probably very different pathways for instance in spain in europe in united states in
china in russia the situation is going to be quite different for the different regions and so on
but in the long run we need all of us to become really sustainable in some sense so europe for me
is already in the in the fast track to that and we need to figure out how to do this in this way
and the problem from now is that they are completely blind to the real to the real um death of the
problems that we have yes i see um i want to be respectful of your time i'm not getting to all
the questions i want to ask you so you might have to come back uh in six months or so so uh in six
months we we may live in a totally different world so um antonio society in the planet uh as
you're well aware face many risks and challenges um what are you most worried about now like in the
near term well for sure that risk of nuclear war cannot be ruled out unfortunately i don't for
me this is not the main scenario but unfortunately it's an SNF that cannot be ruled out and this
for sure will be overwhelmingly the the main risk but putting this apart for me the main
problems is that probably we're going to observe a proliferation of wars and revolts on the planet
it is already happening the problem is that this is already happening we have many countries that
are becoming failed states failed states for instance Sri Lanka is only keeping more or less
something to say because india is investing a lot because india is very worried about the
situation of Sri Lanka also because they have this Tamil minority there that can be influenced
with what's happening in Sri Lanka and india is ejecting a lot of resources on Sri Lanka just to
keep the it afloat but Sri Lanka is completely collapsed we have Pakistan which is a country
which is also in a very delicate situation and we are talking about a country having
a 220 million person and atomic bombs so this should be taken and they can't buy natural gas
because europeans are buying it yeah exactly absolutely absolutely correct we have a dire
situation now in south africa which is in principle the richest country in all africa
well this in terms of gdp for sure and they have a very delicate situation right now a lot of
instability and so on but we have many many countries having quite dire situations in africa
latin america i mean asia at this moment at this exact moment so the main risk right now is that
we can observe a real breakdown of a lot of conflicts inside the countries among the different
countries wars and all this kind of stuff we can go to a global this stabilization process and this
in turn could severely affect those united states because united states some of the resources they
are obtaining you're obtaining from other countries and in these countries you get very
destabilized this is going to create problems also for you even if you can run much more
self-sufficient than that for sure for me this is the main risk right now i mean in the social
times because this can be the question for me is that the reason why i think this is the the worst
the risk right now is because probably this is going to claim at all in terms of human
lives which is going to be available so do you have any personal advice to listeners who understand
what you're talking about at this time of global economic crisis kind of the john michael gareer
variations simplify first and beat the rush or what what do you tell people yeah i again
it's different united states and in europe so in europe the people people listen to this podcast in
all countries of the world it's a global audience the problem is that probably the response depends
on the place you are living in for instance if you live in latin america nobody needs to explain
you because probably you are living this sleep maybe a slow motion or not as a slow motion as you
would like so they already know the situation is becoming very very many parts in latin america
in the case of europe i think that's yes so simplifying your lifestyle is something which is
important and also to gain something which is important very important is to gain psychological
resilience because if you have a life expectation they have a you know a lot of expectations on how
the things should go out and now all your worldview is being shattered by the reality this is very
hard this is really very very hard so i think that it's quite important to gain this psychological
resilience to gain this adaptability that here in europe you are not so used as in united states
people tend to have a lifelong work here this is the usual thing so people work in the same
thing for all their lives at the same place everything all the same and probably now the
scene the thing is going to be quite different so we need to adapt and we need to face this with
that repeat dose of optimism understanding that we can improve but we need to put the
means to improve this is completely different from the american mentality i mean it's a different
completely completely different way thinking things and in europe i think these are things
which are important also trying not to get depth because it is going to be very hard
i am very i am very happy because just yesterday i cancelled my my the loan on my house i am very
happy right now and i think that this this other part is important and also trying to work locally
to gain resilience at the community level working community are things that are important so in the
case of these states i think that these prescriptions are useful anyway the problem is that it's not
going to be so evident in probably 10 years during the next 10 years probably you are going to be in
a completely different situation because also you are going to lose our let's say dead weight the
dead weight of europe because europe is going to get in some sense disconnected and this will allow you
without your own means probably to be more or less okay more or less in a world that has
become smaller suddenly for better 10 years more it is going to depend on a lot of factors that
for me it's very hard to to evaluate precisely for instance how the situation with oil production is
going to keep in united states because even if we know that fracking as it is going right now
this decrease of the drill and compete the wells and so on probably is going to to get us a very
drop in the next months but at the end it depends if you restart a new cycle of investment the involvement
of the government because you have the resources at the end so even if they're expensive you can
exploit them so this will imply that maybe you are reducing social welfare in order to
produce this thing okay this is going to be hard to to to be sure how solid it's going to be deployed
in united states but most likely you have for saying something 10 years more to adapt so
a taking drastic measurement right now probably is going to be seen as a weirdness something which
is not fit for normal social standards but something that could be useful for you is to
observe what happens in europe and to try to learn the lessons from what is going to happen to us
would you change your advice on what to do to young humans teenagers or college age students
what what do you tell them about the future antonio well i have my own teenagers at home so
do they understand all this about the energy and climate yes yes yes my daughter usually says
that we have a skewed up this situation she blames us but in fact i need to accept that it is true
actually i mean she's also she's also participating in in the in the in the same part right now i mean
because if you cannot avoid it okay but yeah this is true that we need to do more than on that
my recommendation for people who are the for the youngsters well i think that um even united states
the life they are going to live is very different from the one that their parents have lived and this
is clear they need to understand that getting resilient to be adaptable to not be not be very
dependent on um supply chains that need to arrive to isolated places this this is important we need
to avoid that it is better to love in communities which are more or less self-sufficient that can be
um supplied easily uh this kind of stuff and also regarding the choices for career
for instance if you are going to college or whatever i think that it is better
my i cannot avoid that because i am a physicist myself but i think i think that in general stems
are better choices than others my unfortunately i mean taking into account the the the
the diners of the predicament that we have so if you could go for stems i think it's preferable
sensibly taking into account if you could i mean not not not anyone has the skills or the
natural inclination to this and also other other other skills are useful and for sure
but stems are going to be massively massively needed yeah no i agree with that um what do you
care most about in the world antonio my my kids no doubt no no i mean uh sometimes uh
there are always people that because as i make a lot of inconvenience statements
some people look for some hidden motivation in myself and looking for some i don't know
economic motivation but this is very hard i've been sometimes blamed for working for possibly
industrial industry nuclear uh i don't whatever um and i always give the same answer when i ask
my motivation i have two motivations in my life and well what is 16 years old something that is 12
years old these are my real motivations and this is the reason why i'm doing what they're doing
if you could wave a magic wand and there was no personal recourse to your decision what is one
thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures and since you are a polymath i will give
you up to three things with the magic wand i actually will just need one okay one because
the problem is as i have said it's a culture we will have we will need uh um how do you say uh
a collective um a collective attack of common sense this is what we need the most we need to have
a lot of common sense that we are actually lacking of it we are putting short term interests
completely skewed views of the world and something that for me is quite annoying actually
is disturbing that many times you observe that people are um are giving up on their personal
responsibility on the public affairs so you need to get involved and this concerns you and you
cannot say the typical saying that is okay well someone is taking care someone is in charge in
charge this is what kids say adults take care of their own business adults know that they
need to take responsibility we cannot act as children we need to act as adults so if we all
act as adults i think it will be enough with education though to understand our biophysical
reality as a as a key component are you active politically in in in spain with sustainability
issues and and getting these ideas scaled so that common sense has a better chance of of manifesting
well you know uh when you say political sometime uh it is important i don't know if the connotation
is the same in in the case of the United States but um it's different to distinguish between
political and partisan so of course everything what i do is political because by definition
of political comes from the word the greek word police within city and it's the things that are
interesting for the citizens of for sure what they are discussing is important for the citizenship
so something for by the way you don't know the word idiot uh was applied in the it's also
greek one and it was applied for the people that were not aware about the the affairs of the city
so the people that really didn't want just the word idiot is coming from that isn't it's a greek
word so it's quite so should we should we title this episode antonio touriel common sense versus
idiots this is exactly this thing so but anyway regarding my engagement with public authorities
administration and so on i am trying to convince them i am talking to them frequently some they
are frequently asking me what's the mean it is very funny because uh they don't really trust
everything what i say by they fear that i am right so and this proposition they keep on coming and
asking me asking me even if they don't like what they say because of course what they are saying
is not totally likelihood yeah excellent so i i want to keep my word to you so you can catch
your train to get back to your children a final question this was an introductory overview of
your expertise your work your worldview on on the climate ocean a little bit on energy if you were
to come back on this podcast six months from now or something what is one question one topic
that you feel passionate about that speaks loudly to you that you would like to take a deep dive and
just speculate the real energy transition that we need to do i mean there are many things that
we need to discuss on on that but something that probably we are going to be in urgent need a massive
need to be discussed in six months from now it's about food because food is going to become a very
big issue globally so probably see we could discuss again in six months from now we're going to talk
about food a lot okay it's a deal mucho mucho gracias mi amigo thank you so much for your time
and uh and and your work and let's stay in touch and let me know if i can help you Antonio thanks
