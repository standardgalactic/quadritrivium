the problem with uh heavy metals which are very intense in some in some oceans and some
for instance in the Mediterranean the presence of heavy metals is quite important we have in
general the releases of the oxines and other chemicals organic chemicals that have a lot of
dangers a lot of dangers for life in general because they are very toxic and we have the
problem of signification one of the problems that we have for instance very close to the coast
all over the all over the the earth but for instance in the Mediterranean is that as we are
dispensing several drops and all the water table is getting down because also we are over exploiting
it and then the the the sea enters from below the ground you don't see it but the sea is entering
and it is signification this this path so it is reading this this water table this is not going
ever going to be able to to be used because of the control of the presence of the water that's
happening in Bangalore there's so many things yeah yes so there are so many many things that
for me would be hard to say which is the greatest risk for me one of the important risks that for
sure the ocean is going to have at least for the following I hope a few years is the the pressure
for exploiting natural resources in the sea in order to compensate for the lack of resources on
earth all on the sea right right you mean the undersea mining of nodules of copper and things
like that yeah yeah okay I knew that this conversation would go six hours so we're
going to keep it to 90 minutes per our agreement so let's switch to energy again hey you you know
a lot about this topic let's just start here can you explain what the second law of thermodynamics
tells us about what types of energy we should be using and what types of tasks and how it relates
to the ability and the desirability of electrification of our economy yeah well it's also a very
complicated question actually well let's just start by the beginning the laws of thermodynamics so
we know everyone knows about the first law of the thermodynamics so the energy is never destroyed
it's only transformed so you are you cannot win energy nor lose energy it's only transformed all
the time alone and this is quite I understand that for many people this is a bit strange
because what you know is that you are putting gas in your in your car and at the end of the day
you have less gas so you need to refill so you are losing energy but the question that this
energy which is concentrated organized energy is getting disordered it's been converting heat
because something that most people that know don't know is that doesn't know excuse me is that heat
is actually the energy the kinetic the kinetic energy associated to the movement of the molecules
of the of the authentic body so what you are doing at the end is you have this orderly movement of
your car that by friction by the fact that it is I mean passing my other surfaces by the air and so
on you are losing you are converting in a disorder movement or that also molecules in a substance
I explain in this because this has a lot of to do with the second principle of thermodynamics
what when you say when they're applying the second principle of thermodynamics says
that when you are doing any transformation regarding energy no matter what you are going to
lose a part of the energy in the transformation because it is going to be converted in this
disorder movement of the things and this is what typically we call entropy so when you are for
instance converting the energy from your gas in the engine in your car even in the process that
is taking place in your engine this process is not hundred percent efficient it couldn't be
and one part of the thing is just being dispersed as heat and you cannot avoid that so the question
is that when you are transforming energy from one type to the other you are going always to
pay a toll an energy toll you are going to lose some part of the energy and the amount of energy
is going the amount of energy you are going to lose is larger as the types of energy the original
type of energy and the final type of energy are more different for instance if you want for instance
to have a water bill and what you want is to convert the mechanical energy of the of the flow
of the river and you want to convert this linear movement in a circular movement of the wheel
so this is mechanical to mechanical this is very efficient and typically you are going to lose
very low amounts of energy because of this so from all the incidents that are coming to the wheel
probably are going to take in profit of 90 percent of even more which is the most inefficient way
the most the kind of transformation for which you pay the largest amount of energy in the
transformation for instance photovoltaics because you are converting uh let's say solar energy
which is the energy of the photons coming from the sun that's a light which is a kind of very
order but also very dispersed energy and because of this specific uh one tune effect on the atoms
you are able to convert these to electricity they are very different don't you very different
types of energy you are taking essentially one of the most disordered types of energy more dispersed
which is light and converting to one of the most order ones which is electricity the efficiency
is typically quite low so for typically pv panels installed today i mean the commercial ones it is
around the efficiency is around 20 21 person on the lab on a specific conditions very well
devices pv panels with very expensive materials as well maybe you can attain 30 40 i think the
largest possible amount theoretically is about 50 c but then under very very very controlled
situations which is not going to happen ever in reality so this question regarding efficiency is
quite important because sometimes when you are making plans for all the transformations of the
different types of energy as we are passing through several steps of transformation every
every step in plus a loss of energy so we are getting energy from the sun which is light
on on electricity on the pv panel so we are losing around let's say 80 person in a commercial
panel then you are taking this electricity and for instance you want to convert this to hydrogen
because hydrogen is more convenient let's say uh uh to be a store to be manipulated
i'm not completely sure because i think it's quite bad actually but anyway so you are going to lose
another 50 person of this 20 person that you have forgotten so you are losing you are going to
to have just 10 remaining and maybe this this hydrogen you want to use in a car or in a truck
and then you need to do all the many processes in between you need to compress the hydrogen you need
to first reduce the temperature because otherwise it is going to be very warm very hot and it could
explode and then you are going to take this advantage of this in a in a fuel cell so you
are going to lose incredible amount of energy because of any one of these transformations so
all the idea regarding regarding the energy transition the way in which we are going to apply
these different steps are relying on the fact that at some time we are going to increase the
efficiencies so that everything is going to run smooth and we are not going to lose
incredibly huge amounts of energy but but if the sun is if the sun is so ubiquitous and huge
and the photons hitting the earth are abundant then who cares if it's only 20 efficient on the
solar panels i mean that's right well this is this is a good point because typically this is
the kind of argument that was used for a long amount of years sometime ago so they say okay the
amount of energy coming every year from the sun equals let's say eight thousand nine thousand
times the amount of energy being consumed here using all the different sources of energy so
it is so large that who cares the problem with this is that first of all well let's recall that it is
this energy arrives dispersed over all the earth's surface which is huge and few quarters of the
of this surface is is erosion it is not easy to gather the energy there other parts are deserts
other parts are mountains i mean it's not that easy to gather it but the question also is that
from time some since some time ago we know that at the end the earth is already using the energy
from the sun for doing things which are important for instance i mean to to create winds rain to
make the the plants grow you know these kind of things that are important at the end for the
functioning the normal functioning of the earth so at this point this this has been analyzed by
at the at the suric technology institute i direct to the conclusion that in the best of the cases
the amount of energy that we can intercept from the sun without altering all the normal
functioning of the earth in a catastrophic way even worse that the climate change will be
to gather around 0 point i don't remember the percentage but it will be a key equivalent
to four times all the energy that we are consuming right now which is a huge amount actually but it
is not eight nine thousand times it's just four times so this first implies that okay it is not
as abundant as many think it is abundant but it is not incredibly not look seriously
abundant it's this is not true and then if it is a large amount but it's not so large
then the way in which you are using it is very important and the efficiency of all the transformations
are crucial if you want to make something which is functional and this is just one
of the many problems that we have with all the systems devoted to gathering the gathering
real energy so if you want i can i mean it's a typical when i'm making my talks i typically
explain why this model of real energy is not necessarily the best one the best fit one and
this is just one of the four main problems that we have with it so the first one is this one
the second one is that it relies on materials that are not so abundant on earth because the
systems for harnessing this energy maybe the kind of energy they are harnessing is renewable
but they are done from renewable materials and the point is that some of these materials are
actually scarce on earth and they have also their own depression curves so you can obtain a given
rate so it's not that easy to make the substitution and even the non-rare ones that if we were to scale
them you know two orders of magnitude like copper will will have their own depletion curves
and it will take more energy to get them yeah exactly well in fact in the case of copper
if you see what is happening in Chile right now it is quite clear that very you are we are arriving
very close to the peak of copper production in principle it was intended to be around
2035 but i think that probably we're going to accelerate it and and then if we do mine all
that additional copper then we have another shortage which is water in Chile because you
need a lot of water to mine the copper okay keep going what are the third and fourth let me let me
say something about this because it is interesting because uh some months ago i was contacted by a
mining industry in Chile because they wanted a system to predict the presence of jellyfishes
because they have also a lot of jellyfishes there coincidentally and the problem that
they need to get in order to operate a desalination plant they need to keep the main
duct taking the the sea water free from jellyfishes because it blocks and every time it blocks it
it makes a breakdown for several million dollars and they wanted to have a system to predict this
so you know everything at the end is is connected in a way
yeah it is i mean the uh uh the late Albert Bartlett said that um the greatest uh inability
of humans was to understand the exponential function i would i would append that by uh the
ability of humans to think in systems to think and then what because we're so reductionist looking
at one thing but now we know the jellyfish impact copper impact solar impact energy okay
what are the third and fourth uh challenges yes so um the third and this one is quite crucial right
now is the so far when you consider all the steps on the life cycle of any renewable
gathering system uh it depends i mean it depends on fossil fuels so for each one of the steps on
the life cycle from destruction of the materials that you need in order to make the the different
pieces the different components of the systems the energy devoted for this making of these components
all the phases of transportation all the phases regarding the deployment installation
and the maintenance of the systems at the end of the commission in if a phoenix because they
are not the commission in all those phases you are using fossil fuels it's very hard to avoid
using fossil fuels at up to date nobody has ever gaffer managed to to be able to do all the steps
on the life cycle of our renewable system uh in which fossil fuels were not uh appearing
so for instance this makes people like gail berber to say that in fact um the new world
systems are fossil fuel standards something that you can you can get around if you have
some fossil fuels by the hands otherwise you cannot because they need fossil fuels to break
and i think this is a quite serious concern right now because something that we are observing
is in the current situation in which for instance we are struggling to keep on the level of diesel
production because diesel is the thing that is decreasing the fastest regarding all the all the
fuels derived from oil we are observing that in general all mining on the earth transportation
on the earth has become much more expensive during the last years and this is affecting for
instance companies that are working manufacturing windmills and manufacturing wind power to be
and systems and so on to the point that they have incredible losses i was getting the information
quite recently from the losses accumulated during the last year just last year and i see that for
instance the three greatest wind manufacturers on earth they have very incredible losses for
instance of festas has losses for one and a half billion dollars past year just 2022 and gamesa
which is now part of semen's it was a former spanish company and is now part of semen's
they have two billion losses past year and um general electric the wind power division they
have uh two two billion losses so it's absolutely amazing yeah i'm much more sanguine about solar
than than wind as as a you know potential resource but but keep going on because i have like
19 more questions for you so what is the number what is and by the way real quickly on this i
totally agree with you that all the renewable advocates in government and and industry kind of
neglect the fact that we that they think that uh we just keep everything the way it is and we build
out all this other stuff without understanding that this huge subsidy of uh fossil helpers
500 billion strong in terms of of human labor equivalent are going to be retiring and declining
and that is what is supporting the build out of of renewables right now but keep going um
antonio what is your fourth my fourth question is savvy that they find also quite interesting
that nobody wants to discuss about this and is the fact that those systems are um by design
design to produce electricity and electricity is something which is cool i think something
is very nice it's a high value kind of energy is a source of energy need to produce consumer energy
but at the end of the day in the context of the world it represents 20 21 percent of all the fine
energy consume of the world and in advanced economies it's it's a bit more but you are
typically moving on the range of 20 something person and the question at the end is you have a 70
something percent of the energy which is not electricity currently and we're assuming that
it's going to be easy to convert this to electricity usage and it is not clear because some of the things
that we know that are hard to be given to go to to become electric and even more important
interesting than that is that when you analyze the consumption curves of electricity for instance
in spain in the european union and in the in the ensemble of all advanced economies we have said
that this stagnation or decrease of the electricity consumption since the year 2008 so we have 15 years
in a row with oscillation i mean it's not that simple decline but you have a clear trend of
decreasing electricity consumption when the previous years will have a very steep increase of electricity
consumption so it seems that it is very hard to increase the amount of electricity that are
consuming this is normal because electricity is not the preferred way to consume energy still
the preferred way to consume energy because of the flexibility the all the possibilities that it gives
is from a fossil derived from from oil this is the main source of final energy in the world
when you say when for instance in the case of spain that now they are pushing very strongly
on ocean europe that we may just make this substitution because it's going to be simple in
some sense and i say okay but at the end the consumption of electricity is being reduced from
15 years so it's not something which is accidental the last year i mean the covid the
pandemic no no no no no it's something that actually is happening for 15 years in a row
so something is happening here of course it has a lot to do with the lack of the the loss of
industries in general the industrial reaction is something that in europe now is getting very intense
because of the situation in europe and it's not easy to say that this is going to change so why
do you want to increase the amount of systems able to produce electricity when you have no
market for it this interesting question
well you and i have never actually spoken about that but your four um your four categories there
are exactly what i say in my presentation so either we're reading each other's work um or
this is a this is a robust finding um so um so you've said before antonio that based on analysis
of various studies that the world would likely be able to sustain around 40 percent of the current
energy that we consume in kind of the intermediate to longish term you've also said that if planned
for and managed well that this doesn't have to result in a drop of standards of living for most
people but rather a change in lifestyle can you unpack what you mean by this and what is the difference
between standard of living and lifestyle in your opinion i think this is quite big
seen quite differently in europe than in united states because here we have not the superman
sprawl and it is easier because we need less um let's say private transportation systems
