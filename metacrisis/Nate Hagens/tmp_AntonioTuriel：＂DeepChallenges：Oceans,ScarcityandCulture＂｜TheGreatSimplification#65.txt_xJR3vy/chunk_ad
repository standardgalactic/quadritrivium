so for instance in my case i live in uh in a town outside of Barcelona and i commute by
train to my work here in Barcelona and back um well for me this is not quite complicated
not to have a car but for some other states quite complicated so the question for instance the
discussions here is in europe now as you know the european commission has said that in principle
the selling of cars working on on gas or diesel could be forbidding starting in 2035
and this is because they come and they start to realize that it's going to be very hard to
keep all the amount of cars that we have here so how you can manage to make these changes in the
taxi consumption without affecting your life standard so maybe not owning a car but selling
the car with other people that are going the same direction of view probably this is much
easier to be done in places like Spain or in places like europe in general they did in
united states because you you live in a quite different way okay we know also that 30 percent
of all the food produced globally is wasted even without anyone touching it and so the
point we are talking about the problem that we have in the food system that we have a problem
a serious problem in the global food system but this problem is mainly a distribution problem
it's not a production problem i mean we have also production but for sure but the main
contributor a nice distribution problem we have in the huge waste of for instance
clothings there is this i don't know you know that in atacama dessert in in in the sort in
in chile there is a vast extensive terrain at which there are a lot of clothings being dropped
there some some of them are still wrapping the plastic they were producing it so because now
body has other types then just because now are out of fashion and they are not interested in them
but this of course is a very huge waste of energy resources whatever whatever you want
and in in general this methods of car sharing something that for instance in spain it's quite
common that you have a washing machine inside your house this is not typical in united states but
here it's quite common i mean the blocks of apartments people have a washing machine
for its own at each apartment so you can share them for instance this is done a lot of in united
states you can share them you can share other electric appliances i mean at the end it's a
question of reorganizing the way in which things are done and in the case of spain for instance it
will be relatively easy to reduce our energy consumption by two thirds by two thirds yes
relatively easy really yeah but the problem the problem is that this will have a huge
economical impact right and financial on stocks and bonds and things yeah yeah yeah so the question
is i am just discussing here the technical part the problem is that of course the what it implies
in terms of economics and financial is devastating because you are really cutting up cutting off
sharp a lot of uh industrial activities for sure the problem at the end is that maybe probably
this is going to happen anyway also if you want the people to leave they need to have jobs they
need to do something for living for a living so at the end they need to work in something
so it's not that easy as okay we are going to shut up all the factories i mean it's not that this
is us but from the technical point of view what we need to leave is not as much as it puts in
the problem is how we pass from this oversized economic system oversized production systems
to something that can be encompassed with the limits of the planet and this for sure is the
hardest but that is something that i usually insist in my talks that typically the problem
rather than energy is posed as a question which is a technical question and this is a reason why
a physicist like myself is asking well how can we solve this and i did i say i mean from the
technical point of view this is not a real problem the main problem is a society problem
it's a cultural problem we need to change the way in which we consume and we um make relations
is between among each other and with the planet it's a cultural thing maybe it's not really a
technical question but i'm pretty sure making such a huge transformation of the economic system
is not an easy task and i understand that many people go desperate when you see that because
it's okay this is almost it's probably more difficult to do that the transmitter looking
for a magic and that is also incapable of doing everything but but at least we're now talking
about it i think the ukraine situation has at least made the words that you just said
sound somewhat plausible so uh moving on to another topic related to what you just said
that i know you uh have researched and thought about why is the idea of rationing something
that is generally associated with scarcity something that economics and economic theory
which is supposedly the science of scarcity is not good at thinking about or handling and
how have the minimal and temporary rationing systems in europe uh because of the russia
ukraine situation been received so far this isn't the scene also for many avenues actually
so first of all something that should be say about rationing of course rationing implies that
you have not enough resources in order to keep the things the same way you were doing previously
so this meaning that in some sense you have a scarcity but the question is that the economic
theory of course is not um able to cope with rationing by a simple fact is because in a standard
economy theory you have a principle which is going the infinitive sustitutability principle
that says any factor reproduction factor can be substituted by another one the market will be
finding the invisible hand of the market except for energy they get that totally wrong well i think
it's not only that it is not the only case but it is there probably the main case right now so
and in at the end this is just a hypothesis it's not a law of the nature it's something that well
it is hypothesized to be there like that but it's not true this is what's happening it's not true
the idea is that in principle if you put um price tag large enough you are going to the
market is going to find a substitute well at the end it will be okay provided the physical
reality allows it that sometimes is not the case because for instance in the case of energy
you have energy that you have but even in the case of materials it happens that you have not
really appropriate substitutes and if it is something that is essential as energy is then
you have a problem for sure so that this is a reason why a standard economic theory does not
contemplate rationing rationing always is seen as a failure of the market because the market
should be able by definition to provide a substitute so if it is not doing is well because
someone is interfering with the market and creating this situation and this is not truly
meaning this is just because the physical reality with this interface is physics at the end okay so
at the end the question is well how do you deal with rationing ration at the end implies okay you
can you have not enough for what you wear your expectations because at the end is that i mean
you are expecting to spend as much in in all the things you are doing but you have not enough
so you need to decide how do you how do you assign this and you in the case of rationing
you cannot use the typical market laws because what is going to happen is that the one who is
able to pay the most is the one who is going the largest portion but sometimes you have some
essential activities like say for instance agriculture food production food distribution
i mean all the things that are related to water is bringing water to have clean water
drinkable water i mean all these things implies a lot of energy and other things and well in general
they put in all the essential goods to the reach of all the cities so those things also
for sure should have a priority in the use of energy so at the end the question is that when
you are thinking about rationing the way in which you are rationing is a political decision
i'm pretty sure that it is going to be presented as it has happened in the case of europe as a
technical as a technical issue but it is not it is always a political issue because it is the idea
that you have a house or say it should work that makes you to decide okay how am i going to assign
for instance you can say okay we are coming you are giving to everyone uh this uh the proportional
amount of food things so you have let's say 10 percent less so everyone has 10 percent less
okay but this is a way of saying that everything is equally important to you but it is not or you
say okay these activities are more important than others but then the others that are going to be
reduced the most you are taking a decision on that and this has to do with your or our ideas
principles ideology whatever it's a political thing and in the case of europe what has happened
is that um uh of course we we have not enough gas for for all the the things that we wanted to do
so we have passed by several rounds of rationing in europe even maybe well you are probably aware but
it's something that even people in europe has not been aware of this but first we have a
rationing of gas so we were told in the past summer that we should reduce our gas
consumption by 15 percent in the case of spain because it was a different it was just seven
percent but later in september october we were told that we will have to reduce electricity
consumption by 10 percent which is a significant amount and at the end we have been able to cope
with this we have been able i mean we have met the goals the two reasons for which we have met
the goals first in the case um of this particular winter is because the winter in europe this year
has not been really cold it's amazing because for instance in central europe we have observed
temperatures with more 15 Celsius above above the average i mean i don't know how many Fahrenheit
just multiplied by 1.48 but it is really it it is really it is really very warm
so this has favored that the typical needs for energy for heating has been much more reduced
during this year the other thing is that we are experiencing a massive closer of factories
enterprises and industries in europe it at a really massive massive rate so i think that
people don't want to speak out aloud but it is exactly what is happening and for instance germany
is taking is taking a great hit with this so uh altogether has allowed us to significantly reduce
to ration but uh what is interesting is that it has been done almost not taking any specific
measure because the the stated measurements were quite weak quite unconcrete but at the end taking
account what has happened that the winter was milled that the industries are closing so actually
they have not need to to implement anything on place even so even so the european commission
has announced that for the from here to the year 2030 we should reduce our total consumption of
energy another 12 percent or total consumption of energy taking into account that we are starting
from what where we are starting them with this additional natural gas with the reduction of
electricity not only that but for instance in the specific case of france we have we
they they have they have a real very complicated situation uh the what they call it subjected
sovereignty sovereignty plan i mean austerity plan for energy consumption they they say that
they are going to reduce the total energy consumption by 10 percent from now to 2025 so
interviews and they are going to reduce the total energy consumption by 40 percent from now to 2050
which is a huge amount i mean this for sure is going to apply to a huge economic transformation
at the end the problem is how are they going to do it you are following for instance the
situation in france right now it is quite uh heated i mean they have massive strikes i just can't
imagine i mean given your knowledge that the linkage between the energy and gdp if you reduce
your energy by 40 percent your gdp is going to go down which what about all the debt the the
trillions of dollars of debt by the european central bank how is that going to be paid back
that spells the end of the euro and all kinds of other other issues um a comment and a question
first of all that the fact that european governments are actually stating these things
is hard for me to imagine the same statements being made in my country i just cannot imagine
it even though you're at least facing reality well but we have we are facing a different
reality than yours that's true because we still have 80 of our own uh energy yeah yes this is
the key point you have resources we have not yeah this is so do you think do you think uh um in the
near future in the next decade that we europe and the us uh or anywhere globally are are going to
need to um as part of this rationing discussion are we going to nationalize essential industries
such as energy to ensure that everyone who needs access to resources get the gets them is that is
that on the horizon well it's not interference it's already happening in the case of europe
i mean france has nationalized them well they have the apart which was um non-nationalized
which which private of the main electricity utility that they have in the country elitist
in the forms so 16 percent of these was in private hands and they decide to nationalize
by year but at the same time germany uh decide decide to nationalize the three largest um
distributors of natural gas in in germany but at the same time belgium privatize the electricity
utility of brussels and the same time austria privatize the same the main utility on vienna i mean
this is happening all over europe but it is be done in such a i don't know how to qualify this but
let's say silent way that nobody is actually talking about this and for me this is very funny
because um um the european union has specific regulations against that against doing exactly
that but as all the countries are doing nobody's saying anything it is quite funny so it is already
happening but probably this is not enough because the key point for us is that we have not the
resources we have not the resources so we need to get the resources from somewhere in the case of
united states you have the resources you have plenty of resources i mean they are not infinite
you are going to run out of them you are going to um before that you are going to run low on them
in the amount of resources is going to be deployed and this is going to cost problems there but it's
not the same as in europe we have really nothing so i wonder who's going to be better off spain
because we don't have the resources and you're going to be faced with a hardship now and figure
out how to navigate it at a lower throughput or the united states which has another decade or two
of resources and will continue to living in an unsustainable way and not prepare
you know this there is a sentence by john michael grill which is quite good so collapse now and
i'm going to rest yeah i think maybe this is going to be good for us even if it is going to be
harder right now we'll see we'll see yeah so many people uh antonio um moralize capitalism as either
a savior of the world or the root of all our problems what is your stance on this and given
energy depletion that and climate and ocean risk which you are fluent in do you see capitalism
as having a place in future societies well i need that we need to um to go to the next step i mean
capitalism is just one step in the evolution of economical thinking so we have before that we have
what is called i don't know how to say in english or i know the term in spanish but we have a
which is called physiocracy them well another term that i know how to translate so we have
passed it by several different economic systems capitalism as we understand it now uh you typically
when you look for definition for instance at the wikipedia or whatever you say capitalism is a
system which is characterized by private property free market and so on and this is this isn't right
i mean in capitalism you have that but you have also in other systems in previous systems we have
also uh private property and free market this is not what makes the essence of capitalism
we make the essence of capitalism right now i mean at the beginning of 21st century and the
thing that in fact puts everything in compromise is the necessity of growth this is the key point
so the question that the capital um the money uh has right to have an interest rate so this
interest rate is what makes you uh makes the need for this exponential increase on wealth this
exponential increase on production and consumption and everything and for sure this is
completely incompatible with a finite planet this is the critical point at the end so
we need to overcome the limitations of the current system and to go to a different system
which is just another one in a section historical uh succession of systems in which you can have
private property you can have free market but you cannot have infinite growth because of course
if it's not it's impossible in a finite planet this is the key point so some people when i am
discussing this thing some people here in europe you know in europe the political thing is different
in united states but they they like to post themselves as anti-capitalism i i think that this
is uh from my point of view is a wrong a wrong way to to post the thing it's not a question of going
against because capitalism with these lights and shadows is just a promise just a step in the
evolution so the question is not going to be anti-capitalist but be post-capitalism going
to a system that is going to be created after this one and this is something which is natural i mean
all living things as civilizations for instance progress change along the time to adapt to the
situation so we need to adapt to the current situation and this adaptation implies an evolution
in our way in which we relate with each other and also with the planet and something that should
be have been obvious from throughout the case now but now it's impossible to avoid it is that
we cannot grow from everything the planet is and it is so simple statement very very clear
statement all the statement all the parts that we have is from one one hand we have run with the
inputs because we cannot keep the pace the rhythm at which inputs are entering the system we are not
running out we are running short so and you have a problem with the inputs and we have a problem
with the outputs because all the ways we are generating are changing the climate but are
