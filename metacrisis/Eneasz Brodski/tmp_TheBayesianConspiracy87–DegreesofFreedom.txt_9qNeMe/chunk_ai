That's not what pregnancy is.
No.
The last nine months, you can die.
Your brain gets rewired.
Your body gets changed permanently.
And now you've got a kid to take care of for like 20 years.
The effects of having a kidney removed are worse than what you were saying, but yeah, it's not as bad as nine months.
And like when you're done, having, when you're done recovering, you're done.
Whereas like you're not, when you, when you go through childbirth, like you can physically recover most of the way in most cases, maybe even all the way in almost all the cases, but as someone who doesn't go through childbirth.
You're often changed permanently.
Yeah, physically for sure, but you can recover.
And psychologically.
That's the part that doesn't recover, right?
But they'd be like, oh, that's not an injury or something, but it's like it is if you didn't want it.
It's like, I don't know, it's like getting hit in the head.
And like, sure you can retrain yourself to like, whatever, do all the functions you lost.
But like, if you could ever do them like you could before, or like your values changed, you'd be like, I didn't want to be a different person.
And now I am, you've wronged me.
So you're picking a random male from the population and then just scrambling their brain a little.
And sometimes you'll come out pretty much the same and sometimes you will be complete, like your values will be completely changed.
Yeah, I'd be fucked up.
Would you choose to do that?
It's so weird because this particular example of choosing a person at random to be a donor.
It's not, for me on the face of it, a terrible thing.
Well, it would be, it'd be super weird and counterintuitive.
I don't mean to interrupt, but like if you had a long line of people volunteering, you're like, nope, we're going for random.
That's weird too, right?
We don't have a long line of people volunteering though.
I'm looking forward to the universe where, and like we're getting there where you can just like grow an organ and not have to take one from a donor.
I mean, I'm also looking forward to the universe where we have like, you know, birth control is implanted in everyone at birth and you have to choose to turn it off.
Yeah.
And we can have babies in artificial wombs.
I mean, of course, now I'm just talking about like in my perfect universe, here's how things would be.
But you know, I don't like the fact that we're really like thinking about the way things are.
Like right now being the way things have to be.
I would also find myself wanting for the state to be much more of a police state if this was the case.
Because like, sure, I understand some people can't help it and they get bone cancer and they need a bone marrow transplant.
Like if someone had an injury where they were playing football and they ruptured their spleen and now they need a spleen at random, I'd be like, hey, wait a minute.
I don't play football.
I never put my spleen at risk.
Why do I got to give my spleen to this person who was, you know, recklessly playing football with people?
Especially if they're burning through three spleens a year because they realize that there are no risk of losing it forever, right?
Right.
Or like maybe lung transplants for the same thing.
It's like, oh, I can smoke like a chimney because there's all the lungs I need out there in society.
And now all of a sudden I would want society to be much more policing of everybody's bodies, which probably not a good thing.
Yeah.
That's what I was thinking too.
Like you imagine that people getting picked at random are probably going to try to run or like, you know, skirt around the system somehow.
I mean, kind of the way that, you know, wealthy people who live in.
I got bone spurs.
I can't give you my lung.
Right.
Yeah.
No, there's, you know, there's wealthy people who are very, very pro life and then like their kid gets pregnant and then it's like, oh, but not us.
Yeah.
And I'll go say, I really have an abortion.
Like, yeah, there's going to be all kinds of negative externalities to this kind of world.
The same way there are lots of negative externalities to a world where fetuses are considered people.
The health analogy or the health example in that comment reminded me of another thing from Sam Harris's book where like health is a vaguely defined word like healthy.
Like it's not clear exactly what that means.
Like it's clear what it doesn't mean.
And like, you know, not always being in pain, not always vomiting.
His use of the word always.
I mean, we just think of something that was constantly vomiting.
It's kind of funny.
And like, even though it's transient, like, you know, right now, if you, if you can run a mile at 80, you're like amazingly healthy.
But there could be a time where like, you know, if you can't run, you know, a five minute mile at the age 200, you're like seriously unhealthy.
Right.
But that doesn't mean that like healthy is completely void of all meaning.
Right.
Even if the definition is transient over time.
So it doesn't really tie into anything.
It's just not the mental model of always avoiding this sort of sort of ever present in my head.
I just wanted to bring it up for that reason.
One more thing about this.
Here's another thing I just thought of.
So what if the person who's randomly chosen to be the donor doesn't like they have to pay for their own medical care forever?
Yeah.
And what if they're doing something that they find really important right at the moment, like my mother is dying of cancer and I want to be with her.
Or I'm working on this thing that will solve poverty and I.
Nope.
You've been chosen to go give your kidney and you got to pay for it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The paying for it and like the fact that this is like a life ruining expense for almost half of America is kind of like a big deal.
Right.
See, I almost feel like there like there would be certain changes we could make that would make a pro life position more palatable to me.
I still don't like it for the bodily autonomy reasons.
But like, hey, what if like society compensated you for having a kid?
I mean, it does a little bit.
Get back breaks.
Not positively though on the aggregate.
No, no, it still costs you more than you get back.
Yeah.
But yeah, if this if this was if this is a money making scheme, then people could be pumping them out as fast as possible and cashing their $200 a month per kid or something.
Right.
But since things aren't quite so simple and there's there's more to the equation than that.
Then yeah, selecting people at random saying, look, this is now your problem.
Deal with it.
I think that puts a really fine point on it.
Jess saying that like, look, it's one thing to say, all right, you're elected at random.
We're going to give you a procedure.
You're out for a week.
Presumably in this thought experiment, like society would understand, you're not going to get fired.
You're not going to, you know, lose your house because you missed a couple of payments or something.
But you're also not going to be out $25,000.
Right.
Whereas if you have a kid, it's like, oh, yeah, you're going to, you can have all those things.
No paternity leave.
So you need to, you know, wipe your wipe yourself off and get back into the work on Monday morning.
There was a TV show I was watching completely aside from the point, but she works at like a supermarket.
And they she's like, oh, I'm going to leave, you know, like my shirt at home so the baby can learn my smell.
And it's like the saddest thing, but like, it's completely normal because she doesn't have any time off.
Right.
Right.
So there's a lot more to this in the real world examples of forcing people to have children than there is in this nicely hypothetical world of like selecting people at random for procedures.
But it's a fun thought experiment.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm not trying to devalue like it's usefulness and fun to talk about, but it was, I don't think there's too many disanalogies here.
Yeah.
We should probably wrap it up because it's 3.30.
Yep.
Cool.
We have one more important thing to do before we wrap this up though.
Yeah, we do.
I think it's been a while since you've thanked the patron in the ash.
Very well.
I will do it then.
Even though I always had picked it because they've got the coolest first name ever.
And you got a good one.
Do you guys want to take this?
It's okay.
I'll grab the next one.
No, you can have it.
So Alistair Park, everyone loves your name.
You are awesome.
And you are extra awesome for helping us with this podcast.
Everyone has great names.
It's not going to be wrong.
Well, Alistair has been one of my favorite names since when I was 14 and read The Goblet
of Fire.
That's Moody's first name.
Oh, right.
Yes.
Okay.
Anyway, cool.
Thanks Alistair.
That's awesome.
Yeah, thank you.

And everyone else too.
Thanks for listening.
And you know where to find us for email, subreddit, all that stuff.
Just search the Bayesian conspiracy.
And feel free to share this with friends, iTunes, all that stuff.
I'm really bad at it.
Like we should just do a candidature that we all read.
But leaving a rating on iTunes can also help.
Yeah.
That sort of thing.
Yeah.
