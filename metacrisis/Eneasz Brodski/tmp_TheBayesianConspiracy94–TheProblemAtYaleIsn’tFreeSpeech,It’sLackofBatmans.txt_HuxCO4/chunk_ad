out uh the post says not only did religion not only did religion used to make claims about factual
and scientific matters religion used to make claims about everything religion laid down a code of
law the sexual morals the form of government answered scientific questions from biological
taxonomy to the formation of stars the modern concept of religion is purely ethical derives
from every other areas having been taken over by better institutions ethics is what's left
or rather people think ethics is what's left ethics has not been immune to human progress
why do people think that ethics is still fair game which yeah what the fuck i think because you can't
just prove ethics ethics is still like you can still debate about it and you can still have
two different ideas so the fact that you can't um do an experiment and be like well animals evolved
or no stars are created by big burning clouds of gas uh you can argue with somebody all you want
about whether ethics are evolved or whether god sent them down and you can't really do anything to
prove it yeah i mean i guess you kind of can but it's it's much fuzzier but like when the bible
says grasshoppers have four legs people are like well the bible isn't supposed supposed to be a
scientific document right so no big deal but then the bible says you can't uh that it's okay to keep
slaves no one says well the bible isn't supposed to be an ethical document they're still like
it's an ethical document we just ignore that part yeah no but you were used to be allowed to keep
slaves yeah yeah but not anymore right so yeah but just the fact that people still say that it's about
ethics is weird when they don't say that it's about laws of governance or about scientific claims
because it's just as wrong on the questions of ethics as it is on all these other things
it's yeah super wrong uh where were we if you say the earth is flat
people will look at you like you're crazy but if you say the bible is your source of ethics
women will not slap you most people's concept of rationality is determined by what they think
they can get away with they think they can get away with endorsing bible ethics so it only requires
immanageable effort or self deception for them to overlook the bible's moral problem yeah
and the idea that religion is a separate magisterium that cannot be proven or disproven
is a big lie a lie which is repeated over and over again so people will say it without thinking
yet which is on critical examination simply false it's a wild distortion of how religion
happened historically of how all scriptures present their beliefs of what children are told
to persuade them and of what the majority of religious people on earth still believe
and there we go it's giant montan bailey lie and we should call people on that crap when they try it
yeah actually like if i really think about it the thing that finally made me an atheist was
reading the bible yeah um and it was in college i actually took a bible as literature class because
i had a lit minor and uh we read it with accompanying i think they were like the dead sea scrolls and
there was um a feminist interpretation of the bible and a couple of other different feminist
interpretation of the bible yeah the the instructor really wanted us to analyze it through various
lenses and that takes some mental gymnastics oh no it was like not pro bible oh okay it was very
much like this is a horrifying book that tells that like tells terrible stories about women's
suffering and being disenfranchised and okay i thought it was somehow a feminist pro bible thing
i'm sure that probably exists i'm sure lots of those exist yeah but uh yep that that did it
i think i wish more people would just read the damn thing there's parts of it there like a lot
of the old testament is just animal sacrifice yes so much animal sacrifice because it's endless
detail about what color the cow has to be and how old it is and whether it's got spots and
it's awful on the altar and what time of year you're allowed to do this and yeah yeah ethics
i liked the post and it made a good point and it stuck with me especially the first ever
scientific experiment part that really made it memorable yeah i think i wish that it had actually
gone into why it is disprovable why which is disprovable religion okay well i mean anytime
religion makes a claim and that claim is contradicted by reality it's partially disproven
right yeah and you get enough of those claims and you're like this is just a giant blow to
horseshit isn't it i think that somebody who was not already convinced of the atheist viewpoint
wouldn't read this and come out of it like feeling like that this was a good argument right yeah this
is kind of a preaching to the choir like maybe that was its purpose and it's more about um it was
definitely preaching to the choir in the uh in the effect of because there were a lot of people who
are basically or there still are i guess a lot of people who are basically non-religious in their
day-to-day life but will still go to church a couple times a year and say that they are like
christian or whatever and when this separate magisteria stuff comes up they're like oh yeah you
know you bible is not a scientific document i still believe that there's some kind of big god
thing out there and and the the jesus helped us out or whatever i just don't bother with all the
little minutia because the bible writers probably got that wrong you know and i think this is a very
good counter to that um if someone was exposed to this being like no that's just you lying to
yourself and it is a very big lie because i need a lot of people like that i'm friends with a lot
of people like that yeah i just wish this article would be something that i could point to them
i remember having a co-worker who was religious and actually asked like well if you can prove to me
that evolution happened then um i don't know i've never encountered anything that i thought was
good proof so i spent a really long time sending him documents showing like dna and fossils and like
it's literally and yeah there's there's so much evidence that was just like spamming this guy and
then like i think he kind of like pretended to read a little bit of it and then closed it and
then stopped reading any of it and was just like i'll read that another time like okay yeah you
want to be proven wrong all right all right okay i wish yeah that there was like a place that i
could have just sent him one link i had like the knockdown argument for here's why the bible is a
lie maybe that exists now if anyone knows where that is yeah there's there's no such thing yeah
religion is such a deeply entrenched in your emotions and your mind kind of thing that it's
in my opinion literally impossible to send someone one link that would change your mind
it's a process that takes lots of time and some social support but i just want there to be one
website that has all the evidence for the fact that life evolved there's there's many websites
like that there's many yeah but that's intimidating but if there were one link that
i could send that just had all the information and you could go into uh history and mathematics and
just like no wouldn't wouldn't matter worst case scenario they would accept that evolution is true
but it was guided by god but that would still be a step forward i think okay anyway let's go on to
the next one okay the importance of saying oops which religious people don't do until
eventually one day it starts out with a comment on enron enron for people who weren't around at
the time was a big energy firm based out of texas i believe who were doing gangbusters
making lots of money great great company and then all of a sudden it turns out the entire
thing is a fraud they've lost five billion dollars and the whole thing collapses overnight
lots of people are out a lot of money and it was a huge financial scandal and of course
no one went to jail because no one ever goes to jail for stealing five billion dollars you only
go to jail for stealing 10 20 bucks um but uh uh eliaser read a book about it and he said that a
unsurprising feature of enron slow rot and abrupt collapse was that the executive players never
admitted to having made a large mistake when catastrophe number 247 grew to such an extent
that it required an actual policy change they would say too bad that didn't work out it was
such a good idea how are we going to hide the problem on our balance sheet as opposed to
it now seems obvious in retrospect in retrospect that it was a big mistake from the beginning
if we only admit to small local errors we will only make small local changes
the motivation for big change comes from acknowledging a big mistake this is a post
that is pro epiphany basically uh it's saying you know what every now and then take major stock
of your life and this i get the feeling this is how most people actually do abandon religion so
maybe it was related to the previous post but uh it it it takes a lot of little small errors and
mistakes and oops is over a long period of time until eventually you're like holy shit this whole
thing was wrong right or at least that was the case for me i think that is probably the case for
most people i expect that there's a few people who converted on the spot or deconverted as the
case may be but probably more often there's more and more questioning over time yeah but at some
point you gotta you gotta acknowledge you made a big mistake and eliezer says a traditional
rationalist upbringing tries to produce arguers who will concede to contrary evidence eventually
there should be some mountain of evidence sufficient to move you this is not trivial it
distinguished sciences it distinguishes science from religion but there is less focus on speed
on giving up the fight as quickly as possible integrating evidence efficiently so that it
only takes a minimum of contrary evidence to destroy your cherished belief there is a powerful
advantage to admitting when you have made a large mistake it's painful it can also change your whole
life and i don't know entirely how i feel about this because i mean sure if you're wrong about
something especially something important you want to stop being wrong as soon as possible right
yeah like if you're wrong about whether slavery is good you want to change your slavery position
as soon as you can i want to change uh whether if you're wrong about whether global warming is a
thing and that we need to do something about it i want to very quickly change to hey let's
do some mitigation yeah let's very quickly try to do what we can to fix this i hear in business
it's always best to if you're going to fail in something fail fast that way you don't spend a
lot of time and a lot of money on something that's going to fail yeah i mean that's kind of um more
related to agile sort of structures where you're coming up with lots of different ideas and trying
to move quickly and really quickly like test them all figure out which ones don't work throw them out
keep moving towards the better ones the ones that work the ones that test the best um
and so i agree that's a big advantage and something one would want but i mean the problem is if you
knew the thing was wrong you would already not be doing it right well when you find out it's wrong
is what he's saying you have to be willing to be like oops i was wrong i fucked up big time
and i'm gonna acknowledge that and move on and i agree i remember um somewhere in the rational
sphere i read people talking about wanting to norm uh if people admit that they have made a mistake
that everybody cheers and high fives them and i love that and uh actually i've started like a
little habit of doing that with my friends cool where like oh i realize i realized i messed up or
like uh leaving my last job i got cheered and high five by my friends i was like yeah that was
a mistake and now i'm unemployed i gotta find another job and it's like it felt great for them
to be like yeah that job sucked get out of there you did it you now you can find a better job and
it's like yeah well kick this idea in the trash now i can find a better idea something that you
should feel proud of and that i wish society like didn't punish us so hard for like the
societal norm wasn't that it's embarrassing and you lose face if you go and publicly say i've
made a mistake that should be something that we're like you know uh if a politician comes and says oh
i i realize i've made a mistake about this policy and that science shows that actually this is better
that should be something that people are like yeah like i want to vote for that politician
you know it's like uh we have this like weird idea that people need to always be right and
always look confident and but i also think giving up on things too quickly can be a problem too like
that would make you a easy target for like get rich schemes mass whatever what do they call those that
i'm a multi-level marketing schemes or uh i think the point is religious claims and cults and
things like that once you have evidence that shows that you were wrong then you unless like somebody
faked some evidence or something no i mean people often do fake evidence yeah i guess i mean and in
general like you want to investigate and really find out whether you were wrong and i think you
should be really rigorous about that but yeah some things are not that clear cut and you can be
confused about something and i think that's a case where you wouldn't throw it out if you're not sure
you have to keep investigating eventually you'll find enough evidence one way or the other right
well i mean but that's that's that that is what what eliezer is sort of arguing against he did say
that there is everyone agrees there's at least everyone in the rationalist sphere agrees that
there's some mountain of evidence that can change your mind on some things but eliezer is saying
that that level might should maybe be a little bit lower so people don't hang on to ideas for too long
which on the one hand is true but on the other hand is also a bit of a defense mechanism i think
it's also fine to be able to admit that i used to have absolute faith and confidence in this
hypothesis but now i'm reading this stuff that seems to say the opposite thing and i'm not quite
sure which one it is yet so i'm kind of holding off on saying which one i'm going to support until
i have collected more evidence and that should also be fine i think that's yeah i think that's
the biggest advantage of of this whole Bayesian rationality movement is the idea to have degrees
of confidence and beliefs rather than being just like i'm a capitalist or i'm a communist you know
it's more like you know give 80 percent credence to the capitalism thing and uh i'm not i'm not
being on one side or the other yeah so much because you know there was there was a time when
it was easy to convince people that uh socialism was the best thing to do because it hadn't been
tested it hadn't been tested on on paper it looked great you know everything would be better
if this worked out so people are like yeah i find this convincing and that uh turned out to be bad
so people were some people were too easily swayed in that regard uh this article ends with
don't indulge in drama and become proud of admitting errors it's surely superior to get
it right the first time but if you do make an error better by far to see it all at once which
is kind of the thing that i disagree with i think that we should as a society norm it being fine to
admit when you've made an error especially the whole fail fast thing too like i like that that's
becoming something that's more widely known that businesses are using that people developing
software are using try lots of stuff if it doesn't work move on to the next thing
oh i do think he's right that i mean it is better to be right the first time but yeah but yeah you're
right admitting error should be a celebrated thing he says i have watched others making their own
series of minimal concessions grudgingly conceding each millimeter of ground never confessing a
global mistake where a local one will do they do their best to minimize their embarrassment by saying
i was right in principle or it could have worked or i still want to embrace the true essence of
whatever i'm attached to defending their pride in this passing moment they ensure they will again
make the same mistake and again need to defend their pride so yeah i in general i think he
makes a good point about failing fast when you can you're failing publicly and owning up to it
yeah yeah next time we're gonna read focus your uncertainty and the proper use of doubt yes and
there are links to those again at the basin conspiracy dot com and going on to listener
feedback yes yeah let's do it all right all right we've got one from zcaran which was on
are the bayesian conspiracy on death lists
lee yeah i know but i'm saddened by how katlyn dowdy was represented in a previous discussion
it seems unfair to paint her as an enemy of immortality seeking transhumans
she's a mortician with two main goals prevent grieving people from getting scammed by expensive
mortuaries and to help grieving people have a healthier view of death to get them through
the grieving process quicker she focuses on natural burials that are better for the environment
better for your wallet and better for your relationship to your dead relatives okay and
i think that's a fair point people are complicated and i don't like to take one bad thing that someone
has said are done and then throw them under the bus hole you know hole hog uh i actually believe
i have watched some of her videos and i think they're pretty good but i do still not like the
pro-deathism yeah i i am happy to say that uh i would be you know i would be happy to say that
she's probably a good person and probably doing a lot of good work overall yeah and at the same
time say that her statement that uh life is meaningless without death or whatever it was
that we were um harping on that one time is a morally abhorrent statement and i is just wrong
and people shouldn't say that and should feel bad for saying it yeah i hear a lot of i hear this
phrase a lot that death gives life meaning and i'm like no like living gives life meaning i could i
could see um um the idea that something is impermanent gives it more value this is true
but um there's even if you live forever there's still parts of you there in permanent you're
you grow up you change you get different jobs um you get different lovers and you're in different
relationships you have kids your kids grow up i mean lots of things are impermanent but like
change is great when you're dead that's you're not changing anymore you're you're done
and i i don't like the idea that uh death gives life meaning is like kind of put as this overarching
