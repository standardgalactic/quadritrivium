they were like my my cousin was wearing little suits with like short pants and speaking with
a fake british accent he had to pretend to be interested in economics and i don't know if he
had to pretend but he's just this like child businessman that's that's the kind of thing i
would i would want harley to be doing to their kids i don't know he's gonna have to take care
of the economy when he grows up i guess i mean there's probably better ways that you could
like but it's again it's teaching them signaling it's not teaching them how to
like what are the most effective charities and here's moral theory um and i guess that's yeah
where i take issue um and yeah i agree with the article in that yeah maybe maybe uh elite schools
should be taking on some of that responsibility that used to be what they were for what are they even
for now although uh also i kind of wish colleges would go away and then maybe maybe that's how you
get rid of it i don't know like that's kind of an interesting idea if college does go away and um
education starts to take the form of more of boot camps or online learning i wonder how
that's going to affect this and what other institutions are going to pop up as replacements
do we even does something need to replace it well i think that my idea of college going
is the place where you go to get the training for a good job is kind of like what boot camps and other
training institutions should be and they should wipe away most colleges but then there's
these universities which like you said are basically training the elite how to use their
power in a way that's to society's benefit and i think those would should stay around because
that is an important thing and they should work like they did you know a hundred years ago back
before all this crap started happening i don't think they should work the way they did a hundred
years ago because probably or even thirty years ago outdated shit well okay yeah but you know
before they gave up all responsibility on training the elite and powerful into how to
use their powers for good because i think that's an actual important job still and someone needs
to do it yeah i wish something like that existed in general like i wish there were there was enough
emphasis on things like teaching social skills to kids or like how to deal with trauma instead of
you know schools are still structured in this like training you to be an office worker or
factory worker kind of way and college my college education was useless it was not the thing you're
describing uh where you go to learn how to get a good job or how to do a good job i didn't learn
any job skills i learned lots of theory i learned lots of abstraction that was cool i like learning
things but uh i didn't i didn't graduate college feeling ready to start and like i didn't know how
to do anything it took me a long time to learn how to do things like repair my car or pay my taxes
or and i know there's there's a chorus of people that'll say like we need to school needs to bring
back home back and they need to teach kids real skills and but like yeah i think to some extent
yeah um there's a lot of kids that never learn how to do anything and then suddenly they're in
their 20s and they're living on their own for the first time and they don't know how to fry an egg
that is a bit sad and they also don't know what to do about their depression which is sad or like
their abusive boyfriend or girlfriend or you know it's just i think a lot of colleges like the
middle-class colleges uh style themselves after the elite universities like Yale because they're
like oh we're offering the same sort of service but they're not at all because their their user base
is so drastically different that modeling themselves on those universities was a huge mistake and
doesn't help anyone i didn't it didn't strike me that uh the school i went to was modeling itself
after Yale or anything like i didn't get any of you tried to teach you culture and theory and crap
right no they didn't really i mean um i you know i picked what classes i was taking and i started
as an environmental science major and then switched to a visual arts major and then learned
flash and other random stuff but uh no there wasn't any like cultural studies really or like
there wasn't any kind of instructive cultural studies like this is what is good this is how
you should behave um it's more like completely abstracted like here is how some cultures in
the past have behaved the thing i remember most from my year in college was basically the culture
of college and it was a beautiful wonderful thing and i really liked it and it was just this
this sequestered place away from the rest of society where everyone just liked to
live the life of the mind you know and it was amazing but that is not what my experience was
like and that sounds cool yeah but i mean that also and in that environment they try to teach
you job skills which it's not a good match and i think boot camps are much better there you know
here's your job skills we're not bothering with all these like dormitories and quads and greens and
after class activities this is just here learn your thing yeah my boot camp was like okay here's
an intensive uh here's an intensive walk through the material that you need to know um and for me
it was clinical research so it's like here's medical terminology here's fda regulations here's the
belmont report here's how to do there's how to draw blood and stuff and then like right and then
they brought in uh career coaches who were like here's how to dress here's how to write a resume
here's where to go to put your resumes here's how to network i never learned any of that in school
that would have been useful if they were teaching me actual job skills like how do you get a job i was
never taught how to get a job yeah maybe my school was especially bad but where did you go uh stocked
in university in new jersey there wasn't like a campus feel to it at all uh i mean i commuted so
maybe i missed out on that okay yeah maybe but uh i didn't i don't know i never got a sense that
there was any kind of like even the have you seen the show community uh yeah you showed me some oh
that's right yes even that show like it's a community college but it still kind of has the
campus feel while they're on campus you know this is a separate area yeah i didn't experience
any of that okay i'm like trying to project the future if uh universities do start going away
and like how things might change maybe it would be a good thing i could see um kind of it democratizing
education in a way and everybody but like it also could do the opposite where i think that um
our culture currently has this problem where nobody has taught what to do um what your place
in society is like i think that this is kind of a narrower this article is kind of a narrower scope
of uh this this overarching people kind of are like all right here you go to school you learn math
you learn history you learn whatever and then it's like all right go off into the world and you're
like i don't know how to be a good person i don't know what my job or my role in society is supposed
to be i don't know how to be or feel useful and that's like very isolating and kind of crippling
for a lot of people there's other societies that have these uh kind of coming of age rituals where
and and structures to them where you grow up like knowing okay here's here's what your job is going
to be like here's here's what your role in this community is here's how you achieve your you know
here's how you get to your rate of passage here's how you earn it we don't really have i think that's
a big problem is we don't really have community here in the u.s everyone breaks up and moves to
wherever the jobs is so much that there's no like shared this is where we as a people have lived for
300 years and we help each other out and i know the guy across the street yeah i grew up in a
suburb where there was no sense of community there was no gathering place um i went to church but
we didn't really hang out with anybody else from the church so like i didn't have any like church
friends i kind of hung out with like some of the kids on my block but it didn't feel like the adults
were connected in any way or that like once we got older we were connected with anybody in any way
it was pretty uh i don't know everybody kind of lived in their house with their family and that
was their whole network i wonder if it's like that in europe i think my impression is i'm like
i guess it depends on the country but europe seems like they have more a little bit more
kind of history of their being cultures that are more closely tied together yeah i mean they're
also a capitalist system so i imagine it's weaker than it used to be but it they do seem to be
yeah more closely tied together than us in the u.s obviously there's some bad things about cultures
like the one i was describing to where if you are assigned a role in society that limits your
freedom right and some of these rites of passage were pretty horrific like i think there's this one
in south america where you have to put your arm into a glove full of bullet dance that sounds
terrible yeah bullet dance bite feels like being shot yeah so the kid just has to deal with being
basically shot in the arm multiple times and then they're like congratulations you're now a man
that's like child torture but right but also gives this kid this feeling of all the adults in
my village have done this thing and if i want to be an adult i have to do this thing so it's a
commitment device and it's like now you know i'm an adult and i accept my role in society and that
i'm going to do the good things and you know so there's got to be like some ways that we could
kind of replace that in a better way that than the way that our schools are trying to do it or
that our communities are totally lacking it maybe there's a little bit of that and like
boy and girl scouts i don't know ensured suffering ensured hardship really brings people together
too yeah so if you know everyone else has gone through the same painful experience i mean and
then afterwards when someone else does it you're like i was there too you know i know what you're
feeling yeah i like the solstice that i went to that was about smallpox yeah or it was about us
overcoming smallpox because i did feel kind of the the thing they intended was we were talking
about how terrible it is and lighting up like blowing out all the candles and then talking
about the defeat of smallpox and how humanity came together and we used the power of science and
not knowing us to die anymore from this stupid disease lit all the candles again and sang happy
songs and it's like you can generate that kind of feeling without having to put your arm in a
a glove full of bullets you can get it you can get some pretty strong emotions from just like
kind of doing little rituals which uh have their own set of problems the rituals yeah i mean you
were the one that was uh he felt squicked out by the idea of doing rituals yeah in general because
they can brainwash you yeah i mean like anything that's trying to intentionally manipulate your
emotions i would like to like i would like to like rituals yeah that's the first step
well yeah i think we've exhausted this topic though okay onto the less wrong posts then
okay cool and if anyone has any other comments about this topic we have both the uh basing
conspiracy subreddit and a discord which are always linked in the show notes at the basing
conspiracy dot com let us know what you think the future without colleges might look like
or the future within elite class shirking their responsibilities well there does seem to be
some pullback from that now like i think it was at its nadir in like somewhere in the 2016 2017
range things feel like they're pulling back a little bit from there what's that the whole um
everything succumbing to wokeness i guess okay maybe i'm just seeing it less yeah i know i'm
definitely seeing it less because i'm just not on facebook yeah exactly all righty so
less wrong posts the first one we have is religions claim to be non-disprovable which is one of my
favorites yeah it's a good one uh so it starts with uh this biblical story the people of israel
are waving between jehovah and bail so elijah announces he'll conduct an experiment to settle
quite a novel concept in those days the priests of bail will place their bull in an altar
and elijah will place to hovis bull on an altar but neither will be allowed to start the fire
whichever god is real will call down fire on his sacrifice the priest of bail
serves the control group for elijah the same wooden fuel the same bull and the same priests
making invocations but to a false god then elijah pours water on his altar ruining the
experimental symmetry but this was way back in the early days to signify deliberate acceptance
of the burden of proof like needing a 0.05 significance level the fire comes down on
elijah's altar which is the experimental observation the watching people of israel shout
the lord is god peer review i i'd yeah i love this whole explanation of history's first recorded
experiment which it isn't technically but you know it was it was beautiful it was all the parts
of an experiment are there laid out and and it was just really fun to read yeah especially this
and then the people haul the 450 priests of bail down to the river kishan and slit their
throats this is stern but necessary he must firmly discard the falsified hypothesis and do so swiftly
before it can generate excuses to protect itself if the priests of bail are allowed to survive
they will start babbling about how religion is a separate magisterium which can either be proven
or disproven firm but necessary stern but necessary you know every now and then just a little bit of
mass murder to get the experiments going it was it was wonderful and it is in the making of this
broader point that as he says back in the old days people actually believed their religions
instead of believing in them and saying something like the local religion could not be proven would
have gotten you burned at the stake the vast majority of religions in human history tell stories
of events that would be that would constitute completely unmistakable evidence if they'd
actually happened uh i actually i'm not sure exactly uh why this post appears here in the
sequence of posts it seems a bit disconnected from the rest of them but i love it so much i don't
really care um but yeah it's it's uh one of those this was still the early days early ish days of
the new atheism and there were still fights going on as to you know whether the new atheists should
just shut up about things and uh religion is its own separate magisteria that science can't say
anything about it and so forth so this was this was pushing back on that points out that early
Egyptologists were genuinely shocked to find no trace whatsoever of Hebrew Hebrew tribes
having ever been in Egypt they weren't expecting to find a record of the 10 plagues but they
expected to find something and they found out that during the supposed time of the exodus
Egypt ruled much of Canaan ad is a huge historical error but if there are no libraries no one can
call you on it the roman empire did have libraries and thus the new testament doesn't claim big
showy large-scale geopolitical miracles like the old testament did do we want to say anything about
the whole experiments in in religion thing uh why did you have something in mind what i have in
mind is that i agree completely with all of this that people always say crap like you know science
can't you can't test religion with science or whatever but then as soon as this is like the
old montan bailey thing then as soon as you're out of an actual formal debate they're going back to
their church and all their religious friends and family and being like yep this god miracle
gave me a winning scratch ticket or cured my child's gout or whatever it was you know like
they're they always act as if god really is there and is present in the world and is doing things
which if it was the case would be testable because anything that has an effect on the
real world can be seen in the real world right you can measure it yeah i was earlier telling a
indian steven this story about watching one of my cancer patients receiving CAR T cells
and they had a priest in the room who came over and blessed the cells
and they blessed our hands i would have kindly like i bless these cells yeah i would have kindly
said i'd rather not have my hands blessed and i blessed the hands of the healers oh my god it's
like now let us all bow our heads in prayer and i was i had no idea any of this was going to happen
apparently the patient was religious and had requested this happen so we all had to kind of
just go along with it but it was it was awkward dude we've got these like bioengineered high tech
cells that are being injected and it's waving his hands around them like doing his magic on him
uh anyway yeah uh yeah when i uh was a kid i was told that if you pray and you are good and
you know you go to confession because i was catholic god will give you whatever you want
like god will answer your prayers so i'm like okay i got on top of my desk and i was like
i wished to fly and then i fell and i got back on the desk and i was like oh i really wished
to fly i super duper believe and i've been good and said my confession and i don't think i've
ever done anything bad because i'm a little kid anyway so i just just let me fly just for two
seconds fell again got back up and i was like all right god if you let me fly i will do extra
chores and i will be so good i'm gonna donate money to charity i'm gonna then fell again all
right god i'm gonna stop believing in you if you don't make me fly oh threatening god yeah and
then i fell again and then uh my young self didn't come to the conclusion that god doesn't exist but
that he exists but he's an asshole it took me a little while longer to write my head around the
atheism thing because i've just never heard of it i didn't know that that was an option right
but yeah i definitely kind of was like god after that yeah that guy all right sure jerk
that's cool yeah there's also the whole uh women can't do stuff part of or like i don't know weird
outdated shit was that still in part of Catholicism oh yeah like i mean that you read the bible yeah
then you're supposed to kind of double think the bad shit that you've read out of the bible
but like oh but that was back in the day and like now we do things this way but that's fine
and i'm just like yeah but what about what the slaves were okay but we're just gonna not talk about
that okay all right we're just gonna pretend god's not a jerk just like when he didn't let you fly
god's a jerk yeah thanks this goes into the next point uh that i was actually gonna that i pulled
