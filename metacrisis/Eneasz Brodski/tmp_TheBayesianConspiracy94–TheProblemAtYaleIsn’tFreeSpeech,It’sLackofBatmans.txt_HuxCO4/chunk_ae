thing that gives life meaning i think what gives life meaning is are the experiences you have while
you're alive the things that you care about the people you care about like what you see
what you accomplish your hopes and dreams i mean come on we can do better um but yeah like the other
things that zeke mentions about helping people avoid getting scammed and especially the thing about
the like natural burials i really hate the whole process like and bomb you forever in the ground
that's another thing that like rationalist should support though i like yeah cremation pumping like
a whole bunch of um or or cryogenically freezing your brain that i am a big proponent of that one
yeah that's because then maybe you can be brought back i don't know how environmentally friendly
that is but i think it probably still beats uh being embalmed and stuck in a box that's never
going to biodegrade i mean i think you're allowed to be a little environmentally unfriendly in the
interest of not killing yourself yeah that's that's the thing most people i i believe would get
behind aside from extinctionists so yeah i'm okay saying katlin dowdy probably a great person doing
good work who said one or maybe several morally abhorrent things which uh doesn't make her a terrible
person or invalidate her work but those things are still bad i kind of want to email her yeah i wonder
if i could kind of i mean you probably could find her email address yeah probably why would you say
oh just hey it i love your show but this one thing you said like here's my take on this i
wonder if she'd respond or if she gets so much email that i mean probably but it's worth a shot
every now and then people have a chance to get to an email and you might be the lucky one
yeah i mean i think it is an interesting uh assuming that uh you know she's not just going
to throw out anything that goes against her um core beliefs or whatever yeah that there's probably
like less interesting emails that she gets okay let's go on to why weaker i think oh go ahead
okay uh this one was in response to i think it was two or three episodes ago
where we mentioned scott's scott from slay star codex scott's post about how society has basically
taken away a lot of people's ability to support themselves they can no longer go out and uh
forage and do those sorts of things that people used to be able to do because society has paved
those parts of the world and replaced it with this hierarchical structure where the only way to
live is to work in a factory or be you know useful in some other way yeah exactly and so that uh
society does owe people things because it did that um and why weaker would like to point out uh
saying if we were if i were to guess i'd say hunter gather societies had basically the exact same
problem but at a smaller scale i very much doubt that a human could venture out of his tribe alone
into an area with good resources without being forced out by another group claiming that area
i think as a human you're always dependent on some sort of society since no human can live
alone and compete against other humans who cooperate and i think i mean first of all
that's a good point if anywhere where there is other humans also find for the same resources
you're gonna have an issue and you're going to need to be part of a society and uh i would like one
i would like to once again um bring up the movie noa which i thought was a fantastic
representation of that that uh noa and his his family were super rich because they had this
really fertile area of ground that they kept all to themselves and then these people that were
literally starving to death were like well fuck you we need this or we're gonna die and then he
loses everything because they come in here and they take all his land and now he's not rich anymore
which uh i'm not sure that's the story the the movie was trying to tell but it was it was really
interesting and i enjoyed that aspect of it but yes uh first of all yeah you any any group of humans
could push you out so you do need society anyway and even if there were no other humans around
if like if your tribe was on the frontier here and the first one's there uh i i don't think you
can live without a society anyway you're gonna be eaten by an animal or you won't be comfortable
anyway yeah some people can live as a hermit most people do need uh human contact for social
animals and not just for the social stuff i think even for survival it'd be really important it would
yeah it definitely helped survival but i think that this is kind of missing the point of scott's
statement there where what he meant wasn't that you could go off on your own and forage like what
he meant was that the system that we have built is incredibly complex and we would it didn't evolve
for it there's a lot of people that can't hold down a good job and make good money who would have
had no problem living in a hunter gatherer society where they had just have to collect
acorns all day or you know one to do one thing which is build arrows or you know um slightly
better standards of life in some cases slightly worse i mean if you uh look at a lot of anthropological
studies they show that hunter gatherer societies people tend to be a lot happier than we are
there's almost no depression or anxiety uh because they're living in the environment we were
that we evolved in originally now does that mean that people don't still die in childbirth all the
time and have totally preventable diseases or a cut to your knee yasher so benefits drawbacks but
also society was rather unequal and horrible so that part sucks too but i mean if you're used to
the hunter gatherer society was it was pretty uh egalitarian uh was i mean it continues to be
there's still hunter gatherer tribes yeah yeah well i mean i guess in terms of general hierarchies
yeah pretty egalitarian but it was once our agriculture uh developed that the inequalities
started becoming really intense although yeah when when i read about the levels of um i guess
nowadays we would call it domestic violence of just like men abusing women and and hurting them
using power over them in those societies i'm like holy fucking shit i this is horrible and i
do not want to ever go back to that sort of society this morning i was uh i'm actually
gonna get a playstation uh vr because i want to play beat saber and as i was looking at this
ridiculous k-pop music video where this k-pop star is like playing this really intense beat
saber in vr and just like running up walls and i was just like man i really like the time that
i was born into and it's like well of course i don't know any kind of like future time periods
that might be even cooler than this one but if i look back at the past nope i'd probably be a mom
of nine kids or dead of malaria all righty next next one just reply to this shit just to reply to
this shit yeah i think the framing of people as means versus people as ends helped clarify somewhat
my own values and this is on the same topic yeah what's the point of the system the whole system
society ask the system how do we measure progress what are we trying to maximize gdp it's not that
the people don't care about anything else it's that the suicide rates can keep rising and if the
gdp also rises at least something percent head of state can stand in front of the people and
boast of progress and prosperity the utility function of society is currently misaligned with
human values if the system's ever been good to you it's only because it has been thus far necessary
to keep you a compliant productive member of society a lot of things are capitalized in this
i'm trying to convey that i don't know if i'm doing a good job this is why automation can feel
like such an apocalyptic threat in the current economic system because suddenly you're not even
that necessary to society's goals and you know its goals don't explicitly include you your means to
an alien end society is an alien god and i think that really put into perspective exactly why
automation does seem so threatening and ubi does seem so important because
yeah in theory the gay space communism is what we all want right uh yeah the the uh nobody has to
work because automation has completely replaced all labor and we're all happy but uh in practice what
it looks like is automation replaces all need to work and therefore we all die because the only thing
the system needs us for is producing things and when we aren't even useful for producing things
anymore there's no point in keeping us around i think there's two arguments though if we've got
intelligent ai it's not going to care about our values anymore or other people say uh if we automate
away all the jobs then people won't know what to do with themselves and they'll be sad i think the
second one is dumb i yeah super disagree with that um i don't like the evil ai version uh i'm not a
fan of that one hopefully it doesn't come to that i think what he's saying though is that society is
already sort of a um or the system in caps is already a sort of weak level uh ai that is
unfriendly it is not aligned with our goals because as humans we have a lot of goals like
happiness and the prosperity of our loved ones and so forth but all society currently cares
about is gdp and uh since that's what society is working towards that is what all of our human
labor is more or less being put towards it is misaligned with our values and this is becoming
a problem yeah i mean like bringing up global warming again because we're all gdp maximizers we
can't admit that we we aren't allowed to go on air and say actually 90 something percent of
scientists all say that this is real and it's a problem without having to have somebody else
on there who's some crackpot that got paid off by not in around they're gone but uh oh we're
gonna give them both like equal time to debate with the global warming debate and it's like
meanwhile we all know that this is happening uh and we really should have started doing something
about it years ago but considering that we're gdp maximizers that's going to hurt the gdp we
can't do anything about it and yeah since society is the aggregation of all human effort it's much
bigger than any one person and thus having its values misaligned to our own values is kind of a
problem yeah we've got like old people in nursing homes i don't know i could think of a lot of
examples of ways that society is scoring people over and the reason people put old people in
nursing homes is i guess because it's more economically efficient yeah to pay somebody else
to take care of your elderly parent i guess the same thing with daycares too i mean it's more
economically efficient to have both parents work full time and have an any take care of your baby
yeah you're very busy out there being productive and keeping that society gdp on target yeah well
now i'm sad thanks uh just to reply to this shit yeah jerk send a nice you're just like god next
time i'm just kidding that was a good comment yeah it was all right um how about we like
thank some patrons let's do that so this week we would like to thank our patron dan wall
as our patron um every other week thanks dana we appreciate you gratitude being sent your way
yes you are helping redirect some of society's resources to things that are more aligned with
our values as opposed to simply maximizing gdp because this show as far as i know does not
produce any gdp although i guess it does provide entertainment value which is a big part of gdp
too yeah you know what the more money people give us the greater a percentage of gdp we will be
so someday if all the money comes to us we will be society what i'm saying is everybody should
give us all of their money i don't know you don't know about that i'm not sure if we become gdp
okay we should still give some money to this cancer research place you're working for
uh i would appreciate that actually we live in a terrible little office right now and they're
putting off the renovations to the new office because the college across the street wanted money
for their renovation and they anyway well i didn't know that i assumed since it was like
leading tech edge stuff you had fancy offices and shit i don't know research is crammed in like the
fourth floor and a little closet oh damn dude yeah we totally got to get more money towards
this cancer research thing then sounds pretty awesome all right anyways dan wall thank you
and uh thank you all for listening and we will thank you guys yeah we'll be back in two weeks
with more stuff and with a steven zuber oh yeah steven should be back from cancun unless he decides
to just stay there i mean i wouldn't blame him i wouldn't blame him anybody's gotta come back
right he's gonna run out of money eventually yeah we need him he needs this portion of the gdp
we need him to go on more tangents i think we're like making reasonable time yeah i know all right
goodbye
