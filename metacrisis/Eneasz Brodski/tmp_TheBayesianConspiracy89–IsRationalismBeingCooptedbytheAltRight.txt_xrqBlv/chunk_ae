again have you decided that every like cold medicine doesn't work
because if you aren't actually living by your beliefs
then you don't understand the network of reality that underpins your society
like that's the argument against that like you're a hypocrite yeah that's great
you actually do believe all of this stuff because your actions say it
if you didn't you would be living in the woods making herbal medicines yourself
but i bet you you're going to take that aspirin when you're hung over
can i bring us back to the original topic
i think at least one of us should okay now let's do it
i wanted to make a um i don't know if this is a point
a suggestion that was brought up again by not without incident this goes into
the school of nobody as an agent we're all just
cliches of the times
he points out that where was it or i don't know vei i'm not your gender of
this person um that uh rations tend to be
contrarians generally tend to be people who are like well i've
looked at things and i disagree with what the rest of society says
and here are my reasons why right and uh as it turns out
a lot of the early rationalists around eliasers and mind age who are now
late 30s maybe even early 40s we grew up in the 80s
and the 80s were an extremely right decade uh they were a reaction against
the 60s and 70s and so pop culture was far on the right
and as contrarians we are all very far left we are
poly we're open we're anti-religious we tend to have very left
leaning positions the newer generation of rationalists that are joining now that
are in their 20s maybe early 30s uh grew up during a very left
leaning time and as rationalists tend to be contrarians
they're going to the right because that is contrary from the
milieu they grew up in so once the cycle goes a little bit further and we're
far into the right again then all the newest generation of
rationalists in about 10 years will be left again uh is a possibility
and i kind of agree that rationalists tend to be
contrarians and that uh this may just be a cycle of us
always being the the opposite of what the general culture is
i don't think that we are necessarily just like rebellious teenagers being
like oh yeah dad no not this contrarian doesn't
necessarily mean a rebellious teenager like yeah but i mean it just means
people who do not like being lumped in
and accepting what everyone else yeah i mean like we're people that tend to
reject the status quo and want to take it apart and figure out which things are
good and which aren't but um i will accept things from the
culture that i think are doing a good job right i'm not going to be good
and so when the culture is more to one way then like for example they were in
flux of rationalists will tend to be the other way
am i in my early 30s and i grew up in a liberal time and i'm still mostly
liberal i didn't feel the need to i mean i i guess i i didn't go into the like
regressive left but i i think i'll be i'll be concerned for the
future of the rationalist community of in 10 years we switched a lot of our
positions like from if we start being
anti-chronics or we like we start reacting against the things i mean i
don't want to say like we're we're right about all these things now and we
shouldn't change our minds and yet like this is only the kind of
experiment you could look at 100 years hence but like if things swung back and
forth every 15 years it would be just like every other
group yeah and that's not the point of this this is supposed to be like no
we're figuring out reality we're gonna get more and more correct
we're not gonna keep swinging around and and uh although of course like i said
i don't know how you avoid doing any of that when you're like
trying to you know make your map as accurate as possible and be willing to
change your mind unless you get everything right the first time
yeah right and also because the maps that i mean to adulthood with are the
ones that we are raised with so the way we fix our maps is always going to
often have to be moving away from how we were the maps we were given
so i want to bring up the amish community
okay i live near the amish and i heard you guys
talking a few weeks ago about them and i think there's a misconception you guys
have the amish are not against technology per se
they are against technology that destroys their community
for example a lot of these amish farms around me have computers in their barns
because they have multi-million dollar businesses like you can't run one of
those today without a tool to help you but they're like the most basic
excel only computers they have and and when they want to bring in a new
technology to their community every amish family thinks about it but they
also have elders in the community and it's kind of like a ground up decision
like now they've just started to get cell phones but they don't have smartphones
so how do they have computers but not like buttons
and blood transfusions not what like buttons for t-shirts
i mean why do something new if you don't need to it's not that much harder to do
at the old i would feel like having a cell phone would destroy your community a lot
more than being able to button your shirt they don't have so many buttons he was
saying that they're looking at having cell phones just not smartphones
oh well okay as long i don't know i uh i don't know what you're talking about
the ones around me wear buttons they kind of look like dorky accountants
so what i there's i could just when we talked about this and like buttons was
the go-to example of like one of the technologies they resisted that's why
they had i don't remember talking about this and i've never heard about the
buttons am i totally making you yeah i live in the amish community and i tell
you they wear buttons just prove i can go take a picture i believe you i'm
weird el song amish paradise specifically references he's got a lot of buttons
and he wears a cool hat i thought it was buckles i think it was buckles
oh crap it's always hard to hear words and songs honestly a third of what i
know about the amish community comes from that song
another third comes from the movie um the the shamanland movie
oh the village the village i don't think they weren't even they weren't amish
they weren't amish exactly so my my i realized my my math's very fuzzy
okay um and i guess the rest comes from but like pop culture
rum springa and all that random stuff i think that's what david's trying to say
we don't actually understand the amish yeah the amish has
really improved a lot since david first explained them to me a few months ago
so fair enough so what just my i guess my last thing to make sure i'm not
totally crazy they're anti-medicine or they're not pro-medicine right like
they can still die of an infectious disease because they you know they won't
take antibiotics no not at all in fact hersey medical center near my
house has one of the best genetic disease sections in the world because
they're such an inbred community they have the highest rate of
genetic diseases in america so it sounds like they're trying to rectify some of
the uh maybe more extreme aversions to technology they've had in the past
i mean they they do have some issues with blood transfusions
but they're actually pretty okay with like plasma as long as there's no actual
human blood like if it's all artificial like they're not against every
technology but they do have a way of deciding which technologies and which
things they want to let into their communities and which ones they've
decided are frivolous uh comings and goings of the outside world let's put it
that way okay the reason i bring them up is i think that the
rationalist community if we want to move towards a more intelligent way of
progressing forward instead of just whiplashing left and right with every
generation needs to have a similar structure but with ideas because the
truth is a lot of traditionalist ideas i think are a lot of valuable like i
often find myself a little bit right of a lot of people in this community but
that doesn't mean you shouldn't look at the evidence and update
like at this point i don't understand how you can be a conservative
and be against universal health care especially considering there are
conservatives in other countries that are like already have it
so that would be something that i think would be a good
stable idea to put into the canon of rationality
you don't have to do universal health care but it seems to have worked well
for all these other countries and there's a lot of evidence for it
and this is something that maybe we should espouse in general
or maybe it would be something more about psychology like we have discovered
a new way of thinking about psychology and there's a lot of evidence for it
yeah like parts theory or a surfing uncertainty
what was that and yeah and nobody is required to believe anything that a
high council says but it definitely helps if there's like
at least a robust discussion within the community about it
and then a group of smart people that we all kind of trust saying like
this is where we generally lean so two quick things
um i like this conversation but i need to go roll up my car windows because it
looks like it's going to start thunderstorming and two i'm still
coming to the overcoming the trauma of having been wrong about everything i
believed about amish people if you have if you have a any sort of like
less than an hour documentary or like youtube video to explain all this to me
that'd be great um kevin kelly uh who i think is the
founder of popular science or popular mechanics one of those
he has a book about um a bunch of stuff that's cool and i remember i was
listening to an interview with him he and his family go and like stay with the
amish perfect that'll be my resource i need to
go out my windows i'll be right back you guys keep going cool while steven's
going we should also probably start considering wrapping up because it's
been over an hour since we actually started started and we should have hit
some less wrong posts i had a couple more points
go for it and probably the rest of you have some
final points uh i was trying to find a segue to this and
we weren't able to get to it but as far as the
people using the name rationality um i remember
i have the frustration that like we're stuck with this name now because a lot
of people confuse it with rationalism which is a different philosophy
and um i would like it if we could at least maybe start calling ourselves
bayesian rationalists i think that was suggested at one point
early on in less wrong and i don't know if it necessarily caught on or not
but then at least like we can differentiate from
ben Shapiro's form of rationalism or if somebody confuses us for
somebody who believes in rationalism i do generally when i talk about my
myself and my belief grouping use the term bayesian rationalist
just for that reason you you were saying david
oh i was just gonna say i don't know how successful such an endeavor will be
but i agree that it's a good one and i'll start doing the same
it can't hurt yeah i'd like for that to catch on i think that'll help a lot
too uh if we do actually have any kind of concerted effort at
going on ben Shapiro's blog and arguing with him
steven welcome back okay jess you were saying something cool
yeah it also started hailing out there so that was cool i made it out there
sometime oh that's what i heard yeah it didn't occur to
me that actually it did but it was by that point i was too
into it to try and pull my phone out and turn off the noise but i'm sure you
heard the car going and all that so you know what this means though
it sounded alarming yes it won't stop people
you know it might stop this so i mean this it's spring it goes it'll
hail for an hour and it'll be done so all right jess you had a thing
oh yeah really quick the fireworks though for anyone listening outside the
united states who doesn't know today is the fourth of july right which everyone
in the country gets together to set off fireworks to celebrate captain america's
birthday huzzah a truly a holiday worth celebrating that's
right this is the day will smith saved us from aliens
that's right cool two things worth celebrating and everyone puts out a
tree and then captain america puts a bald eagle egg
underneath it so all right and we burned an alien on top of the
alien effigy like guy thawkster
um uh suggest yeah gosh what was i saying okay
i was talking about wanting to
uh change to saying oh my gosh it's hailing yeah
yeah it's something you wanted to segue to but there was no good said segue so
you're just going to bring it up i'm very distracted by the fact that it's
hailing yeah it's pretty epic did you see that like
three feet of hail that mexico got earlier this week i did not that's
horrifying yeah yeah they got a meter and like
one point two meters of ice it's the most ridiculous pictures i've ever
seen so then like four feet i guess four and a half
those are some big hill chunks outside look at that
but anything my car is going to totally normal weather people
no end of the world coming everything's fine
