I'm assuming is that racism is bad if you want proof
here's some numbers but like it's it's not bad because the numbers
it's bad for the reasons but if you're not convinced that it's bad for those
other reasons here's here's uh you know empirical evidence that it's
bad but the the empirical evidence could have gone
the other way I remember I think uh Sam Harris put it
poignantly when what two three years ago it showed that
um something like 50% of or I forget the number some
sort of staggering number or percentage of of humans today have neanderthal
DNA and it happens basically everyone outside of Africa
right but if it happened to have been people from Africa instead
um this would have been a nightmare for the people who discovered this right
right yeah like he he tweeted out oh it turns out that yeah we do have neanderthal
blood as long as you're you know as long as you've left Africa or
something you're part it was like yeah whites are special where part neanderthal
right right that was it like in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way yeah but
but that's the thing is like if if you're
if you're gonna hedge anything on any empirical evidence right then there's a
chance the evidence could go against your your your sacred cow
right um don't get me wrong racism is is bad whether or not it's
like even if it worked out to where like a an economy was five percent less
efficient when it you know wasn't racist even if that was the case which it's
not don't don't mishear me um it would still be good to you just suck that up
and because it's there are other benefits aside from like the measurable
you know economic output or something right yeah and in that case then if the
economic uh if it were economically beneficial then
it's like okay we'll take that into account but like you're going to measure
all the other ways in which it is bad i mean you're studying it for a reason
people think it's bad first of all is it bad what
what are the components that make it bad and then how do you um ameliorate those
components so i would still want to know okay like if the economics aren't a
problem then that's not a problem so we're not going to look at that we're
going to make different kinds of solutions that help these other things
that are actually problems that's why it's still important to know what the
truth is but yeah that's the problem is we actually care
about what the truth is and we do look into these sorts of things
and if the truth could destroy your beliefs
there's a lot of people that say you shouldn't even be fucking looking at the
truth which is awful um if you care about fixing things
if you just care about being right well they care about
fixing whatever social issue they are they think is important to fix
and the fact that we would be looking at evidence
shows that we're on the wrong side i mean i don't know how you can possibly
win those people over necessarily you win them over
you win them you win them over by not only having the moral high ground
but beating them to the punch when it comes to the things that they care
about most like i agree i am not a fan of the
illiberal left but the way i've been looking at things
is that the illiberal left the biggest issue is
ostracization and that's not great nobody wants that
what do you mean like when
if you cross that boundary that one strike
policy you were mentioning earlier you are ostracized you are cut off from
your community if you are part of those communities
and they will sometimes go out of their way to make sure it's hard for you to
form a new one okay so you're talking about like
a terrible thing yeah and group out group bullshit
yeah but i can deal with that what scares me more
is seeing the same kind of
dark magic tactics used on the right like i'm way more worried about ben
Shapiro because yeah he can say from now until
sunday that he is a jewish person and that he is not involved in these things
but the guy who shot up that synagogue literally cited him and made sure to say
oh they were religious jews not cultural jews a phrase that ben
Shapiro uses like the rhetoric of the left is bad
and the way they don't use rationality is bad
but the way that the right is going is significantly more dangerous to human
lives and it starts with people who
essentially are spreading propaganda under the guise of reasonability
yeah and if we want to have any chance to show the left
that even if we don't agree with them we deserve to be respected
we should be on the front lines of the part of the fight that we're good at
and that is like cleanly and clearly going through and being like hey
you made these crazy claims that you say are just
questions about like you know black on black violence
but when someone brings up these other issues around those studies you don't
listen to them it sounds like you don't actually care about the truth you
don't actually care about these questions
you are using this as a justification for
further violence and and then just tear them down in the public
court i don't think it'll win every time but i'm pretty sure if you do that
enough times even like the illiberal left will
eventually start to look i do think we should probably
speak out a little more often about that
it's weird because i don't consider anyone on the right
in my community really and so you get more worried about people in your
community fucking things up whereas if someone on the other team is
being asked all you're like well they're on the other team obviously they're
going to do that but i i totally get what you're
saying because i have noticed i don't know there's there is a very
wide spread of of political opinions in the rationality movement which i think
is pretty healthy but i also think it's weird that like
a not insignificant portion of rationalists were really into jordan
peterson i'm like what the fuck he's spouting like
weird random rationalist jargon and some of the stuff he says is useful but
overall he's kind of an idiot and and i as i was one of those people
like i think that's why i'm more sensitive to these things because i'm
a lot closer to the right and what i've noticed is that a
lot of times these individual speakers in the dark
web are very reasonable on their own and if you look at their early career
there's no problem yeah but as they get rejected by the left
the natural political gravity is for speakers on the right to invite them in
and that of course is going to create cross-contamination
like every time jordan peterson has to communicate with more right-wing people
his next speech is worse and he's more insane
so it's like they start pandering to the crowds that are accepting of them
i think that's part of it yeah do you think they genuinely start
absorbing some of the mindset of those groups or
do they still have their previous position in mind and they're kind of
just doing it for political uh status i think
i think they get absorbed i think as a human it's impossible not to become
more like the people you spend most of your time with
yeah certainly if one group's kicking you out and you're like okay these people
don't think i'm crazy the other people that i used to cohort with they must
be the crazy ones well and those people hurt you yeah
these people are here like helping those wounds heal so obviously you're
going to feel more emotional gratitude towards them
like here's the best example i can give from the jordan peterson perspective
i watched him give one of his lectures on biblical psychology that he did in
canada and there's a part where he comes up to an
orson wells quote where he talks where orson wells discourages socialism
and you see jordan peterson tap down surround the fact that
canada is essentially a democratic socialist country and he's like yo i love
the government structure we have here he's talking about like communist
socialism and like it's not an entirely
vapid point but whatever and then a few weeks ago or like a month or two ago
he goes into this debate with slavak zizek who by the way
all of the craziness aside is a really smart dude
and instead of completely owning the debate by
playing the intelligent moderate ground of being like hey you're
advocating for communism i am a pro democratic socialist
now he's espousing like crazy clear right-wing libertarian propaganda not
even like the good stuff and i'm like what happened
in the course of like a year and a half this person went from
defending democratic socialism to ignoring the fact that it is the
government that he grew under yeah that is weird
i actually liked some of his stuff peterson is like
long-winded and boring but uh i think he had some good things to say
i read uh 12 rules for life and i read some of maps of meaning but like
he's yet turned into this weird internet meme person
radicalized it's scary that that can happen
yeah it's really sad too because like i still recommend to people if you can
find his old like 2014 psychology lectures
they're really insightful like he sounds like he would have been a great
teacher but it's a little bit of that uh dunning kruger effect
just because you're good at psychology doesn't mean maybe you have the best
political insights yeah this is true back to
rationality it's a bit sad i think that we're stuck with
a label it's really hard to rename yourself
maybe impossible i've been i thought about that as well i don't think we
could really rebrand at this point it would be very difficult
and i guess this is me trying to make a call to arms
and i'll try to put my money where my mouth is and actively do it myself
but maybe we should take it on ourselves to actively go into those
communities where we're like oh we should just give up on these people
and find out what their reasoning actually is
because i bet you wouldn't be very hard to dismantle it
and even if we only help five percent of people
those five percent are probably going to be the most fervent supporters
what's that uh old saying there's no faith like the faith of the converted
now hold on a sec what do you mean go into these communities and reach out to
people because i don't know what communities you're talking about or how
we're going to go into them go to the republic national convention and
start yeah preaching the good word okay
i hate to say it but yeah like going online to these forums if not us who
okay like no one else is going to do this social role
and it's important and it's a place where we can thrive
and i think it would help us both kind of rectify the name of rationality
and try to actively divorce it from politics
like i think it would be just as reasonable for us to do this same sort
of like rigorous work in our own like more left
leaning circles but let it be known and let it be going on
forth like oh man have you heard the rationality
community stormed like storm watch or something or an
alt-right group and just destroyed them and refused to give up and then when
they wouldn't listen we destroyed their website
like i i'm not i have no guilt over such ideas
like i say that we need to go like refute all their arguments and then ddos
them because that would be fun
i'm actually kind of i'm not sure how i feel about literally trying to take
down people's websites like why are we doing this
because it'd be funny no i don't think that that's a good way to win arguments
it would be funny um i mean the best way to run arguments is street
epistemology which i learned from this podcast when you guys first started
yeah i really like want to be confident enough to start doing that
i do think it's important that when we see things
shared like ben Shapiro being an idiot to point out this is not
rationality this is a douchebag co-opting the words of rationality
to sound smart but i don't know what can we call them like straw vulcan or
something i don't even know what you would straw rationalist
i like i think david used rationalizer rationalizer yeah yeah
i mean that's i guess i i i think i mean i i'm convinced that
there's something that could be gained from like undertaking this effort and
you're right like i don't see a lot of rationalists
arguing with people online or at least they don't i mean if i see some
arguing with somebody on reddit i don't know if they're rationalists or not
right so maybe but i guess so this isn't an argument
against like the attempt it's sort of just like
then you we've got to think about how to do this tactfully because like
the beige and conspiracy doesn't have the listenership that the ben Shapiro
