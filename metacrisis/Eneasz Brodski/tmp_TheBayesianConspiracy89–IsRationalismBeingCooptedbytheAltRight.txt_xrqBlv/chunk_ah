fuzzies yeah um there was the uh post about
keeping your utalans and your warm fuzzies separate yeah i think that's
uh yeah so maybe i won't talk about it now but i think that was another good
way of addressing the kind of disconnect between wanting to be
to satisfy morals and wanting to actually help
i should clarify i'm explaining i think the internal algorithm in like
non-rationalist people's brains um yeah we as rationalists we're aware of the
problem we should do better now that we're aware that this this glaring
issue exists um but i i know i've told this before but it's probably been
years i i had a roommate who's gay and we were
leaving king supers and it was one of those
like bell guys for salvation army and he threw his change into the guy's bucket
and i was like you realize that like this is one of the groups that gives like
anti-gay rights and stuff and he was like i don't care where the money goes it
just made me feel nice to give that's exactly what he actually said
he's a great guy um but it was just uh and an example of like okay so
you really like this this this could have been anything and it was just
about you know i think um that's that sort of thing
goes on all the time with people who just you know give a couple bucks to
something if you're gonna sit down to write a thousand dollar check i hope
the average person sits down and actually thinks about it but actually
that the average person doesn't sit down and write down a thousand dollar
charity checks so i have a hard time not giving when
people are if you're in pet smart and they're like oh do you want to give a
extra dollar to the save the puppies foundation and you're jerk if you don't
right but i'm like but i could also send this dollar to the
bill gates foundation and buy a bunch of mosquito nets to save children from
malaria and it would go a lot further yeah i have a policy of people with
people ask me at the cash register to round up or donate a buck or whatever i
have policy of always saying no i didn't have time to look into this i feel
like i'm being mugged right now so no you cannot have my money
i like it i mean that that's one approach i i tend to just
it's completely random sometimes i've heard of the charity i'll round up
um and sometimes i've heard of it i won't like if i know you know like i'd
never round up to give to the uh the pink ribbon breast cancer thing because i
know all they do is spend 90 something percent on buying more pink ribbons
um so like they're not getting my money but
yeah it's especially suspicious if there's a store that's trying to get you
to donate to a charity because it's like
oh no now walmart is altruistic and it's like uh
what are you trying to do you're trying to improve your own company self-image
by like branding yourself as a charitable corporation yeah you don't
actually care about these copies i had this i had a job like this i used to be
a canvasser for save the children so i was one of those people who'd wear a
yellow vest and get you to stop on the street corner and
give me your credit card damn shady it was a
dude that was a hard sales job i bet real hard people spit on me in philly
someone threw beer bottles at me why would they spit on you because it's philly
people are insane in philadelphia can confirm
always sunny was the documentary a city brotherly love
more than anyone likes to admit anyway uh the reason i bring it up is
while it was very hard to get people to sign up initially
once people did we had a very high retention rate
because as a charity one of the things they do really well
is every month you get a letter in the mail from a kid you're helping yeah i
used to donate to that chair when i was a kid it's
yeah and my family did it as well for a while and i don't think they're that
efficient and in fact i'm a little afraid to look
how wasteful they are but i know that at least some of the money they do they
give does good and by giving people that dopamine
hit every month and they know they can expect it
it helps that charity carry forward i think that if
you created like a stock portfolio of charities
where you donated 10 percent and then every month you were like hey
here's the little kid who this month your money went to go buy them a net over
their bed and next month here is a little kid
in a different part of the world who has clean drinking water today because of
your like percentage contribution
uh let's move on to the next one oh wait you look at your head thought
no i think that's about it i mean the just it i guess we we kind of talked
around a lot of the stuff but the main the the post talks about this is scope
and sensitivity and here's like that's that's not the
way that it should work that's it's really straightforward short post
yeah uh elias or even ends it at the end with the moral of the story
is if you want to be an effective altruist you have to think it through
with the part of your brain that processes those unexciting inky zeros
on paper not just the part that gets really worked up about that poor
struggling oil soaked bird which is yeah being effective is about math yep
all right i guess what i was talking about is more like the next post
the next post is one life against the world
such a cool dramatic sounding name yeah whoever saves a single life
it is as if he has saved the whole world the tall mood
sanhedrin four five um i think the main the main point of this
post is uh if the world really is bigger than one person
so even though it feels like saving the world if you save one person
you should generally choose the world above the one person if you're ever
given that choice yeah something that makes me mad and a
lot of media is like we as a culture think that it is
morally good to when like your your character your
protagonist has to choose between his love interest
and the world and they're like i'm gonna save the love interest and we're
like oh how romantic and i'm like bad utilitarian so as
much as i loved uh avengers um what was the first one not the
last one infinity war infinity as much as i loved
avengers infinity war i was so fucking pissed when everyone was like
you know what we're gonna protect vision no matter what
you know you can't have this stone or we're not gonna take a stone out and
crush it you know and it's like literally half of all
intelligent life in the universe versus this one guy that the people like a
lot a lot of bad utilitarianism went on in that
movie absolutely oh yeah there was that was not even the only case there were
several cases of people being like the entire fucking world
or this one guy i think it wasn't even the world it was like the universe right
right yes or that universe to be fair to the avengers so like another good
example of this would be in the first product man movie with hobie maguire
when groblin's got the cart full of kids and uh mary jane hanging from the
bridge and he ends up saving both but he jumps up to her first
like the the protagonists aren't supposed to be utilitarian monsters right
they're supposed to be people like they're supposed to be people with like
human goals and feelings and so granted but at some point you draw the line
they do and well at some point they did an infinity war right they they decided
hey you know what if if things get if we start like they had no idea
how much time they had it could have been days
and so when they went to go you know get the stone out safely which is a good
option if you think you might have days and it might take a couple hours to get
the stone out whatever that's true it turned out they got ambushed right away
so when that happened like all right it's time to fucking kill them and they
didn't they didn't you know she helped she the the person who could do it
held off for all of the eight seconds they took to agonizingly stare at the
person she loved before she blew his brains out right so okay like
they did do it okay so that you know but but point taken
yeah i mean frankly so this could you imagine how bad the movie would have
been if the second they got this news and they believed it you like cap just
turned to vision and smashed him in the face with a shield and like tried to kill
him like that's that's a good point so they have to
it would have been better if vision looked at him and he's like
you know what you need to do and bash his own
i think actually i don't know if i'm remembering this correctly but i'm
pretty sure vision himself was like no you should do it and and the rest of the
team were like no man we don't we don't give up our own that is accurate they
like no really lives was there yeah we don't trade lives he's like and then
of course there's no point out the hypocrisy like captain didn't you down a
ship that you know to save everybody else and it's like
fuck off ish and just pg-13 so he didn't say that but his eyes did so
there's also a thing with uh i think more to the
people on the right that uh if if if someone has if someone is a couple
then and they have children the mother shouldn't be put in danger and i saw
this in some books i've read where both couples had
superpowers and the author made the mother stay
home rather than help find the world ending threat but i also saw this in
response to avengers endgame where someone made like that
super weird racist misogynist cut or something
that just cut out all the women from the movie or whatever and i didn't hear
about this the comment was that pepper pots should not be on the front lines
fighting Thanos because if uh iron man die if
what's iron man's character's name tony stark if tony stark dies
and pepper dies that child is now an orphan and i was like i don't think they
had a kid but i get what you're saying they didn't have a kid in the last
they did oh and you know the the point is that if
pepper can change the odds of them winning by even a minuscule fraction
she should be in that fight because that kid isn't going to live anyway if they
lose yeah that's i feel like when you're fighting an existential
threat like that you don't you don't bother with that kind of
yeah you can stay at home and hug your kid right up until you're killed or you
can go out and try and fight yeah yeah i can't imagine who would be trying to
make that reverse argument in good faith and i mean sure both of them might die
and the rest of the team might save the world and it turned out she wasn't
needed there and the kid could have still had a mom but you know what you don't
take that kind of risk with the entire universe on the line and she might have
helped i mean you know there wasn't much help a little bit yeah exactly i mean
she definitely did but like we don't know how much tide she turned because you
weren't able to see everything going on at the same time but like yeah if she
held things off for one more second that's the second that we needed to win
so yeah that's weird yeah even if she didn't help
it was still a better decision to put her on the battlefield than to keep her
off on the sidelines absolutely yeah she was useful okay sorry we got way off
track yeah i'll always indulge in it i mean that was actually on topic uh we're
talking about the saving one person still for once the adventures are relevant
yeah that said i saw the new spiderman movie last night it was a lot of fun
subverted my expectations twice which was really cool cool so
it was like homecoming like the same kind of vibe
but it was a lot of fun so if you if you like superhero movies i give it my
thumbs up but that's not a surprise just side too i liked it more than homecoming
because uh just for me personally uh i don't like high school dramas
i think it's the target market uh i think they do a great job with okay like
here's the high school vibe peter parker is the high school kid and we're gonna
have stories that are about crushes and school i hate all that i hated high
school this one has much less of that going on
and much more superhero stuff so i was into it i will say this post is the
first one where i discovered that eliezer is absolutely against
mind-altering substances and drugs those sorts of things
where he says that uh the the experience of making a new scientific
discovery is my best reference for what it might feel like to do drugs and i
thought that was an interesting fact about him and later when i met him at a
world con several years later i found out that he doesn't even drink
he's i think i had half a glass of wine once in his life
i wonder if he's changed his opinions on that regarding uh first of all no
tropics and uh and psychedelics actually having a
interesting therapeutic and cognitive enhancing potential
i don't know i know i saw a q and a with him a few years ago
and it was he had said he doesn't do any of that stuff mainly because he's
worried about fucking with his brain chemistry personally i don't think he
advocates not using it um i haven't heard to make make a positive
that's cowardly well it is but it but it is like the evidence is strongly
against him at this point millions of people have done it and nobody has
been i think the percentage of people who've
done it intelligently and safely i think his concern is that he he has an
atypical brain that he's worried about screwing with and like if it's
currently working for him you know if it ain't broke don't fix it
right or if it ain't broke don't fuck with it
