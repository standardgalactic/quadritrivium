we're ready rock and roll okay welcome to the Bayesian conspiracy I mean Ash
Brodsky I'm Steven Zuber I'm Jess Dickie and in running with our tradition of
having a David on the podcast we have wait that's a tradition as of last
episode okay yeah so every we need to find more Davids every three years we'll
have two Davids on in a row how's that can we like alternate between Davids and
Matt's sure I don't last meet-up we have three mats I think between Davids and
Matt's we'll never need a guest again early to search for a guest yeah
reminds me of the Steven project you remember the Steven project no how did
I how did I not hear about the Steven project they didn't invite you
the Steven project was oh scientist named Steven who would sign on to say illusion
was real yes I remember this okay yeah all right so David Yusef is back on
thanks for coming on David no problem guys and the reason I wanted to talk to
you again well we all did was the very thought-provoking and engaging Reddit
post on the subreddit from I guess like what 10 days ago or something something
like that yeah and yeah who wants to take the lead on this well it should be
David since it was his post that makes sense David what's the problem that you
have seen okay I wrote a little something out because I wanted to make my
thoughts clear okay I am frustrated in Harry Potter and the methods of
rationality Voldemort's big reveal of a plan is that he wanted to create a
essentially a terrorist group so that they could be defeated by him you know
gaining all the accolades but it didn't work out that way because the wizarding
community was such cowards that a group of two dozen people was able to utterly
wreck most of their world if we take this analogy at the kind of direction that
it was implied where rationality is magic what does that imply for us it
implies that when we see people using the dark arts in public it's cowardice for
us not to step up and call them out on what they're doing and I see it
everywhere right now I brought up Ben Shapiro in my original post because he
is the most grating version of this he's a person who claims to be rational and
intelligent when really he is a rationalizer and the kind of person that
both would appreciate rationality the most and is abusing it the most currently
and I really don't know exactly what to do but I do know that if we don't step in
and do something what it means to be rational will eventually have a
definition that is going to be co-opted and essentially changed in its
connotation by political forces and politics is the mind-killer yeah I see
this happening a bit already I think rational wiki has some people editing it
in a very negatively skewed way that's been the case I I discovered rational
wiki on the same day that I never went back to it when I googled I found it
and then it's like Eleazar Yudkowski no it was extremely derisive mm-hmm and he
is the basilisk guy yeah and like Alexander is racist and yeah so I
googled the few people I knew and I was like okay this is obviously some like
conservapedia style thing and I never went back to it so is this something
that people actually trying to reference rational wiki I think the ones who
like rational wiki sometimes reference it but it's more of a like an inner
circle fun thing that they do in my opinion I'm worried that it exists
because it slanders a bunch of people in the movement mischaracterizes their
views picks and chooses quotes to try to make people look bad yeah but I mean in
that way it's no different than info wars or any other like ideologically
driven group that has their own wiki I mean conservapedia yeah but I mean I
hate the fact that those exist too well I don't like the fact that they exist but
like everyone knows conservapedia is a joke but not everyone knows that rational
wiki doesn't I think anyone who takes more than three or four page views on
rational wiki is going to realize it's basically a different kind of
conservapedia okay good I wasn't sure what someone yeah someone in the
rationalist movement would know that somebody who's just heard about it for
the first time like I had on an argument with my partner recently who's not in
the rationalist movement and is kind of more social justice aligned and he was
saying these things about rational like saying some stuff about Scott Alexander
and like oh yeah this guy is racist and sexist and so I don't really listen to
anything that he has to say and I don't I'm really skeptical of the whole
rationalist movement in general they think that they're rationalist but they
actually do and it was like just saying a bunch of stuff that didn't actually
characterize the movement at all and I'm like where are you hearing this stuff
well I mean they hear it from the far left circle jerky places yeah so I I
actually want to disagree yeah because I think what's happened is we have decided
to just to cut ourselves off from the public political discourse because of
our natural and I think reasonable trepidation of being involved in that
and so who are the people talking about what is rational and intelligent and
logical in the public sphere a lot of times it's crazy people on the alt
right it can you blame people on the social justice left if the only time
they hear about rationality is people being like yes race science is a
rational decision no they're gonna get a bad taste in their mouth and I don't
blame them yeah that's what irritates me I think we've abdicated
responsibility I don't go ahead yeah I don't know I have a bunch of thoughts
one is I wonder whether we actually have the political
uh clout or popularity or whatever do we have like a big enough voice to be
able to actually reclaim rationality for what we think it means we're smaller
than Ben Shapiro and like the international what is it the dark web
people yeah intellectual the international dark web
that's a different thing I mean I believe in us maybe I'm overly
optimistic but this community has consistently surprised me with its
ingenuity we haven't really tried yeah running
running with your death theater metaphor if we were the death eaters there's
there's only you know a few dozen of us that well if we're all smarter then we
can still win right yeah but we also have to be coordinated
and we also aren't in a uh fictional world where the author gets to
do cool shit and we don't have a dark lord yeah we just need a dark lord
damn it has no one realized that there are literally military
tanks going down washington dc right now what more do we need from a dark lord
no no no no we need our own dark lord yeah yeah we need a light lord
to put it that way I don't know okay so I don't think this rationalism thing is
necessarily a new problem because I mean going far as at
least as far back as the 1800s where people were measuring people's skulls
and saying that yes you can tell because of this racist typical skull
dimensions they are obviously inferior at doing these things
that uh that people have been using scientific ish methods and rational
sounding ish methods to justify their own racism for as long as
science has existed and I think that's a problem I
think that that turns off a lot of people to things like
science and rationalism because they're like oh that's just what you
hide behind when you want to be a racist piece of shit
um but I don't know what the hell to do about that this has been
around way longer than we ever have and there is
I mean there's a distinct advantage to being actually rational
and the problem is that that advantage
I mean the actual advantage that that gives you does
is noticeable in the real world people get more done if they can
if they can be rational and invoke it got someone commented on this in the
thread somewhere where they said that since it works
and people see that it works people who use
rational looking or rational sounding vocabulary
are going to have the authority of that thing working
added to their words and so people who don't necessarily
actually have rationalism in their blood at all well in their blood
in their thought processes at all will co-opt the vocabulary in order to make
themselves sound more authoritative and give their crappy
arguments weight even though they aren't actually rational
and then the entire the entire thing is tainted with
they're using that vocab and I don't know how
you can fight that I mean what do you do
uh going back I mean go ahead David yes oh I was gonna say that like if we were
scientists and we found out there was a scientist who was
spreading false information or using unethical methods
we would publicly and as a group repudiate them
as well as publicly like release information describing
every way they were wrong it won't convince everyone some of the people
who got fooled will stay fooled but at least then we can say we did our best
we didn't just let it slide yeah well that's literally what happened with uh
was it now I think everyone's first name is a David but was it David Wakefield
Andrew Wakefield Andrew Wakefield okay so we need like a public crucifixion
of Andrew Wakefield or of Ben Shapiro from the rationalists the way that
Andrew Wakefield got crucified by scientists I guess but I mean what was
his crucification they withdrew his study and they said publicly that this was
a scientific fraud and it should not be followed
but all every there's still a huge anti-vax movement out there because of
what he did and they still believe him they're like no he was he was a doctor
I don't care what all these other people say true but I think that's more than
what what the rationalist community has done for someone like Ben Shapiro
yeah but we also don't have like a central organization that can say
this this view is not officially endorsed that there was fraud used
yeah we don't have I mean we don't need that we just need good arguments
like authority is always the second best thing
if we just publicly go out and say yo this is dumb
we know this is dumb and we can explain why it's dumb here here and here
well we do have good arguments for some things in uh the writings of Scott
Alexander and yet he is still by a lot of people
they won't read his stuff because they've heard he's a racist
sexist whatever which he's obviously not if you actually read his things but
some of the stuff he says goes against the
the liberal narrative of whatever the liberal narrative is and so
he gets the well you're not you're not speaking for us on this particular
issue so you must be one of the alt-right trolls that's the exact
reaction that this partner had which I was so frustrated by that
I remember being more in the social justice community and
having that kind of knee-jerk reaction like anytime you're introduced to
it makes you really paranoid and it trains you to be looking out for
who's an enemy and then who's on our side and you're looking for these little
secret cues and like one strike means that you're out
right oh man you misgendered somebody that one time
it's like oh the minus points if you've been on a podcast that has had
friendly conversations with different people who are on the right then
you're automatically smeared as well can't talk to those people
I mean it's weird because I've seen people call him a Nazi sympathizer
and he actually has great aunts and uncles who died in the Holocaust
you know makes his Nazi sympathy sympathy way
confusing yeah maybe he just really hated those
great aunts and uncles right I think he has an incredibly nuanced
view on race and gender too and is a very like compassionate person
somebody's actually willing to look at like what are the problems
he has a post that I shared with my partner that was
he did a calculus for here's what the cost of racism is
just here's what just what the economic cost of racism is based on like here's
some studies that show the impacts that racism has and then
weighs that out to a monetary amount and is able to show besides all the like
actual stress trauma and unhappiness that this causes here's the economic cost
of racism so like this is my point that racism is bad
and here's the evidence for it and I was kind of telling my partner I'm like
yeah like this is why I'm annoyed at the social justice stuff because
this this here is quantifying something you know like we're trying to find
like is racism bad yes or no okay
let's look at these studies that show the impact of racism and then quantify it
in some manner and then maybe try to come up with different frameworks and
models where we can try to make that better
measure the results and see whether they worked or not and I think the problem
with that is you are not viewing racism as
automatically intrinsically evil you are saying let's look at the
world and the situation and see if it's evil or not and
I mean it is as we know but anyone who is on the
I keep calling it the far left I don't know what term to use for this the ill
I had heard the regressive left regressive left okay anyone on the
regressive left side does not want to see any sort of
studies or anything because they don't care racism is just bad period
emotional appeals and I mean it is bad period but the fact that someone would
take the time to bother to look at studies to show that it's bad
is in their opinion a sign that you know what if
if the data showed that racism isn't evil then this person would be on the side
of racism and therefore this person is evil automatically
I think that's because if you're citing studies like so what if it turned out
that it was more economically beneficial to be
have a racist community or something right or like like if that so if you're
basing it I am I I mean Scott Alexander's position
