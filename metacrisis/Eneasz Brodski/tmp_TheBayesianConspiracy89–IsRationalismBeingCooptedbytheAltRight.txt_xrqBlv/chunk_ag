self-aware enough to be like am i updating or am i just finding confirmation
bias like i didn't even have the language then to realize when i was doing
that
and what we're like 0.001 percent of the population if i'm optimistic
all right moving on also also okay go ahead with the also
oh i was just gonna say the best repudiation of uh ben Shapiro i've seen
was on philosophy tube last week and it kind of was
the reason i posted because i was upset i was like this is the best
logical argument against him and this dude is hyper leftist
so anyone who's new is gonna see this and assume leftism equals rationality
right no and always the best response to these sorts of things is actual logic
and real rationality as opposed to like i don't know screaming about emotions or
whatever because that that only that further is like an
applause light for people who are already against him and it does nothing
to help anyone who isn't against him or who is on side on his side but
actually using real logic and real rationality to show
how he completely falls apart in the face of meeting the real world
really would i don't know maybe get a lot of people who are currently sort of on
his side to see what an idiot he is and it's it's just the way we want to do
everything right because things that can be destroyed by the truth should be
and the truth is the best weapon there is and if you can't destroy him with the
truth then maybe there's a problem but since we can do that
and on that note and on that note let us move on to the sequences
for this week uh we didn't actually take any notes on this one but they were
both pretty short so the first one is scope insensitivity
i guess i will quickly summarize it yeah i mean i this one i think we're all
kind of familiar with okay you can take the leader i can whatever
or jess can whoever wants to let's all take the lead
no let's not ready let's all talk at once
my my read on scope intensitivity is it's our inability to
do emotional math basically we should really quickly like point out a few
things that he actually said in there are actually the post yeah good point
okay well uh the it starts off by uh quoting a study where subjects were
asked how much they would pay to save two thousand
twenty thousand or two hundred thousand migrating birds
from drowning in oil ponds and the answers were
eighty dollars for two thousand seventy eight dollars for twenty thousand
and eighty eight dollars for two hundred thousand basically all about the same
amount uh and the post goes on to show uh over
and over in many different uh studies that this
tends to be the same case people regardless of how the
numbers are uh they more or less choose the same
amounts to fix things the number seem to be more or less irrelevant
it's worth pointing out that you can't you have to ask different groups of
people yes yes the the note you can't ask them
one after the other right obviously if you ask them the same number they would
just multiply it by 10 well actually i sort of doubt that like you know because
part of my don't my donating power like i might give
you know 50 bucks to somebody's charity but i can't if they said hey you know
what this actually going to help 50 000 people not five
i can't give a thousand more dollars oh right a thousand times as much right
so part of it is just by how much you have to give
um well i think what the article says is that it follows a logarithmic scale
so even though the problem may have gotten 10 times worse
you only emotionally give as though it got like
1.5 times worse yeah i don't know if this is like you
sorry oh i was just gonna say it's not that we are completely
incapable of scaling up or even that groups don't scale up
it's that once we find a point like whatever we can give
we don't really know how to do proportions correctly
we think the problem is twice as bad when it's 10 times as bad
yeah i wonder if and this might um actually be controlled for in the study
but like instead of how much would you give of your own money to save these
birds imagine that you're um in charge of a
fund for these birds like and uh how much would you allocate for
these many birds versus these many i wonder if that would
change the way people are doing math or fit the scope and sensitivity still
applies it's too bad katrina isn't here because she
worked with nonprofits a lot and she mentioned that
they found if they showed like pictures of large groups of people
the donations would often go down but if it was just a picture of one person
looking really sad the donations would be much higher
that's that's true as far as i know i know that um like sam harris talks about
this in his podcast all the time but that's something that um you know like
will mcaskill and peter singer have been on about that you know you show a
picture of one sad little girl starving in africa
you can elicit more charity for her than you can for her and her brother
yes at the same time or her and her brother and her their whole family
um because emotionally it's hard to you just can't
feel that many people i think that i mean there's a lot of components to it
like part of it i don't i i think it's too generous to say that it even doubles
when the problem you know goes up by 10 because the bird thing doesn't even
map to that um but there's there's like a sense of like
yeah how much will you give to like save africa like to your average you know
american you know tele teleprompter what do you call him
telephone charity things right telephones like nothing i can't save
africa why am i gonna throw my money in that in the bucket like into that fire
that's not gonna do anything but i can save that girl
right i think there's a efficacy that comes into play too
like you start feeling more hopeless the more people you start adding to that
equation right first of all it depresses you and then
secondly you're thinking about what can i do to solve this whole village's
problems yeah it seems totally futile to you know ask
can you save these thousand people um i think that's part of it but yeah the
post goes on to talk about a bit more too so um
but i think i think that's the the general thrust of the
uh the essay right that um
this this is a problem of human cognition yes and
like i think and the way to think about it is that we can't multiply
emotionally which is probably good um is it going insane
it well i mean like imagine like i could be really bummed to learn
that you know one person died yeah and if i was a thousand times as bummed to
learn that a thousand people died i'd probably just kill myself
um well like if you know every now and then we hear about a celebrity that
died right like uh when alan rickman died
everyone was like super bummed because he's cool we really loved him his
Snape and all his other roles right but then like you learned that six million
people were killed in world war two just in the extermination camps
and you're like that's that's a statistic i can't
multiply alan rickman's death by even 10 much less six million that's just a
number on a paper yeah and i mean part of it is because
we know alan great i mean we quote no alan rickman right
um but i mean like even if i'm just trying to think of
you know yeah but even if you're thinking about a thousand
alan rickmans that doesn't you just you can't emotionally think about a thousand
yeah isn't that related to um i forget if this is called
uh dump bars number where probably you uh also can only kind of mentally keep
track of about a hundred friends hundred two hundred fifty
acquaintances that might be the might be related to that i mean but i don't
know if alan rickman's in my monkey sphere right or in my done bars in my
done bar circle um like it's i mean and
earlier this week a co-worker told me that he knew somebody who died and i was
like oh that's terrible like because they just had like monday
um and you know like it sucks and it you know bummed me out a little bit
but um i didn't know this person the guy that was telling me this didn't know him
that well and so you know it wasn't that that tragic i mean i was
probably you know more bummed when you know
name a celebrity died or something right um but that's sort of an aside sorry
were you saying something david
no let me think this through before i speak you guys go on okay
he did also point out the same thing in this post that you said that people
were more willing to give when they could save
4500 lives in a camp of 11 000 rather than 4500 camps it 4500 lives in a camp
of a quarter million just because it was a larger
percentage of the whole problem so felt like they could maybe
contribute in some meaningful way yeah whereas 4 000 people out of a quarter
million just doesn't feel like doing much to address the problem right and
that sounds good or let me rephrase that um fixing that problem sounds like
something that we should do yeah but i don't know like if i could
took my brain to be a thousand times sadder if a thousand people died then
if it was one i don't think i would right um what i should do is just curb my
actual response like my behavior to the to the problem and scale that up rather
than like my emotional response yeah yeah i don't i don't think you would want to
ramp up the emotions associated with that and just go into a horrible depression
every time you think about sad things exactly but uh
being able to think about it um maybe in a practical terms i i don't know if this
is even possible uh neurologically i think it's possible to try to base your
actions on the numbers rather than the emotions i think that's what ea tries to
do i mean um yeah that's the entire i think that that would be like that the
people who i think are doing the most about these sorts of problems right
now are the effect of altruists who first of all have kind of said like if you
make above uh whatever the whatever the kind of baseline like you're you're
living a comfortable life salary then in order to i think it was like $62,000 but
it's probably going to go up to 65 in the next few years with inflation but
somewhere around yeah for the us um uh then it is good to contribute 10% of
your income to charity to effective charities and then like i like that
because it's uh one simple thing that you're doing uh it's not like i think a
lot of people who want to be altruistic can get burned out by there's so many
causes which ones do i pick am i not devoting enough my attention time
money to this important thing over here what about animal welfare you know
what about rape victims what about africa africa i i use that also tongue
in cheek it's just i know but um yeah like i it's like okay what do we do well
let's target the worst problems and let's find the best solutions for the
worst problems and let's find the way that we can get the money the most
efficiently to where it needs to be and use it in the best way totally let's
tackle the problem with math as much as we can yeah and my whole digression on
emotions i should have set up better which was that i think that the reason
that people give consistent numbers across orders of attitudes of dead birds
is because they they pick that they they respond with a with a dollar amount
it's proportional to how emotional they feel about it right and i think even
in the post he says like they they imagine one dying bird
they go that's sad and they might be able to picture a hundred no i'll be able
to picture 50 or 100 but they can't picture 20 000 and if they picture a
swarm of birds that's 20 000 they don't they can't accurately scale it up to
make it 200 000 in their heads or at least if they're going by their
guts exactly so they what has yeah they're they're emotional attunement to
the problem is how much is a plausible explanation for how much they they give
he also uh brought up so oh do you go ahead
oh what i was going to say is as a theoretical way to deal with this one of
the things you could do as a rationalist is before you hear a plea for your money
make your own mental guess of how many people were affected and how much money
you would donate like write down before they say like this
like a flock blank big was affected before you hear the number write down
what you think and what you'd be willing to give and then see the difference
between the two like if you said i would give 70
dollars for 200 birds and then the newscaster says it's 200 000
i think that would give you pause maybe you can't give like a thousand times
more but you would at least look at your number 70 and be like i definitely need
to make this go a lot higher i might just give the 70 dollars and say i hope
i hope i hope that one bird and the other 199 000 of them i hope they find
199 000 other people with 70 bucks that's a good point
that's true on a practical level on a practical level i think jess is right
like a once a year or once a month type is something that if everyone did it the
world would be better and it's pretty goddamn good
he did also aliza did also bring up the alternate theory that people may be
moral satisficers where uh they see something bad and they
feel guilty and so they do something to feel better
and then they feel better and they're done they got that warm happy glow of
helping to contribute in some way and the actual number doesn't matter at all
it's just a matter of relieving moral guilt or even just looking for warm
