because that's the way you actually maximum David said it here first that
will mcaskill selfish and uh short-sighted I'll fight him we've talked about this
I'll fight him before the prior episode I think we spent an entire episode on it
at one point uh where this just doesn't work very well with humans
especially when we draw these things out to their
quote unquote logical conclusions so it's the logical conclusion like an
economic argument is the logical conclusion of something right but it's
not taking into into account like how people work and so like Peter Singer's
essay that you know the feminine affluence and morality won in what 1975 or
six that had the little drowning kid in the pond
parable was was all about that right so like the key like at some point and
like he's not even necessarily saying you should do this um like at least not
straight up about like buying a cup of coffee but like the coffee you buy
could have gone to something way more important than the coffee for you
but I think it was it was it slate star codex I must have been where it's like
you know look if you give five percent if you give one percent
but if you do anything you're doing better than almost everybody yes yes
and so like you don't have to worry about being perfect just do good if you
want to slate star codex post about ten percent is one of the best posts I
know of for for making life livable for people who care
about others yeah and for me it's just the switch like you know I eat a
um I try to eat a somewhat ethical diet I eat meat
fairly commonly but not as commonly as money many people
um but like there's still less animals dying from my diet than there used to be
and so like I'm not it's not so much about like I can never touch chicken
because you know ever if this was ever produced in a factory that was near
chickens like I'm not going to take it to some like to that kind of like religious
level of commitment but it's like no I'm I'm doing better like the world's a
better place than it was if I was doing the normal thing but I cut off just a
minute ago I was just excited to get going sorry
I forget what I was gonna say shoot I'm sorry sorry so I basically agree with
the concrete example that if you can save two children from the train and you
only save one and then walk away you're basically murdering the other one
and I also agree with the fact that if you're giving a thousand dollars to a
charity to make people have shoes uh you should probably feel bad about that
because who giving people shoes isn't really that big a deal when there's
people dying spend the thousand dollars in a more efficient manner please this
really does matter to a lot of people uh but I think there definitely needs to be
a line drawn at the place that makes life still livable for people following
your philosophy and I feel like Elias are absolutely failed to draw that line and
make that distinction in this post also I think this forgets something really
important which is the reason life is livable is not just that we have our
base needs met but the fact that there are things that are beautiful in our
lives that give them that sense of meaning and if you are living a life
where every single resource you have that isn't going towards your survival is
going towards other people you are denying yourself the very thing that
makes life living livable for other humans it's not just like negative it's
like actively punishing yourself okay and I said we only listeners only have to
skip ahead for five minutes we should probably cut it off there that sounds
good okay unless did it come back to Jess I'm really sorry I was no I I'd
sorry all right yeah we need to cut this off yep no no user by the way this user
feedback no listener feedback this time because we have run out of time but we
never don't have time to thank our our guest absolutely do you want to thank
him this time yep dibs on thinking uh Lydia Marie big shout out thank you so
much for your support I like that maybe we'll leave that in instead of putting
in the sound effect thanks David just this one time so yeah cool yeah once
again your support means a lot to us as does everyone who listens and does
anything you find us on iTunes do all those usual things and you know that's
about it you help keep us going we we do the payout to the three of us every
six months and we are just in the process of doing it right now so this is
particularly relevant to us right now and we all feel really happy that we have
a little bit more money in our bank accounts to buy coffees and or safe
children so thank you very much for that Lydia and everyone else who who helps
yeah and thank you to people who comment and who go on the subreddit that's also
helpful and uh I mean we are talking about a subject that was brought up on
the reddit today so that's right helps us to come up with topics yeah we've got
the the vision conspiracy subreddit uh to make this phone call we started a
discord server so that will be there'll be link to that in the show notes I think
for yeah we'll have a discord server people can get on there and chat if you

learned today that there's a way like just sit on the like in a voice chat of it so
there's good chance I'll be hanging out there at some point you know people want
to get on a chat I work human hours usually but yeah something to look at
there so the permanent link for the discord chat will be in the description so come talk to us
