we're ready rock and roll okay welcome to the Bayesian conspiracy I mean Ash
Brodsky I'm Steven Zuber I'm Jess Dickie and in running with our tradition of
having a David on the podcast we have wait that's a tradition as of last
episode okay yeah so every we need to find more Davids every three years we'll
have two Davids on in a row how's that can we like alternate between Davids and
Matt's sure I don't last meet-up we have three mats I think between Davids and
Matt's we'll never need a guest again early to search for a guest yeah
reminds me of the Steven project you remember the Steven project no how did
I how did I not hear about the Steven project they didn't invite you
the Steven project was oh scientist named Steven who would sign on to say illusion
was real yes I remember this okay yeah all right so David Yusef is back on
thanks for coming on David no problem guys and the reason I wanted to talk to
you again well we all did was the very thought-provoking and engaging Reddit
post on the subreddit from I guess like what 10 days ago or something something
like that yeah and yeah who wants to take the lead on this well it should be
David since it was his post that makes sense David what's the problem that you
have seen okay I wrote a little something out because I wanted to make my
thoughts clear okay I am frustrated in Harry Potter and the methods of
rationality Voldemort's big reveal of a plan is that he wanted to create a
essentially a terrorist group so that they could be defeated by him you know
gaining all the accolades but it didn't work out that way because the wizarding
community was such cowards that a group of two dozen people was able to utterly
wreck most of their world if we take this analogy at the kind of direction that
it was implied where rationality is magic what does that imply for us it
implies that when we see people using the dark arts in public it's cowardice for
us not to step up and call them out on what they're doing and I see it
everywhere right now I brought up Ben Shapiro in my original post because he
is the most grating version of this he's a person who claims to be rational and
intelligent when really he is a rationalizer and the kind of person that
both would appreciate rationality the most and is abusing it the most currently
and I really don't know exactly what to do but I do know that if we don't step in
and do something what it means to be rational will eventually have a
definition that is going to be co-opted and essentially changed in its
connotation by political forces and politics is the mind-killer yeah I see
this happening a bit already I think rational wiki has some people editing it
in a very negatively skewed way that's been the case I I discovered rational
wiki on the same day that I never went back to it when I googled I found it
and then it's like Eleazar Yudkowski no it was extremely derisive mm-hmm and he
is the basilisk guy yeah and like Alexander is racist and yeah so I
googled the few people I knew and I was like okay this is obviously some like
conservapedia style thing and I never went back to it so is this something
that people actually trying to reference rational wiki I think the ones who
like rational wiki sometimes reference it but it's more of a like an inner
circle fun thing that they do in my opinion I'm worried that it exists
because it slanders a bunch of people in the movement mischaracterizes their
views picks and chooses quotes to try to make people look bad yeah but I mean in
that way it's no different than info wars or any other like ideologically
driven group that has their own wiki I mean conservapedia yeah but I mean I
hate the fact that those exist too well I don't like the fact that they exist but
like everyone knows conservapedia is a joke but not everyone knows that rational
wiki doesn't I think anyone who takes more than three or four page views on
rational wiki is going to realize it's basically a different kind of
conservapedia okay good I wasn't sure what someone yeah someone in the
rationalist movement would know that somebody who's just heard about it for
the first time like I had on an argument with my partner recently who's not in
the rationalist movement and is kind of more social justice aligned and he was
saying these things about rational like saying some stuff about Scott Alexander
and like oh yeah this guy is racist and sexist and so I don't really listen to
anything that he has to say and I don't I'm really skeptical of the whole
rationalist movement in general they think that they're rationalist but they
actually do and it was like just saying a bunch of stuff that didn't actually
characterize the movement at all and I'm like where are you hearing this stuff
well I mean they hear it from the far left circle jerky places yeah so I I
actually want to disagree yeah because I think what's happened is we have decided
to just to cut ourselves off from the public political discourse because of
our natural and I think reasonable trepidation of being involved in that
and so who are the people talking about what is rational and intelligent and
logical in the public sphere a lot of times it's crazy people on the alt
right it can you blame people on the social justice left if the only time
they hear about rationality is people being like yes race science is a
rational decision no they're gonna get a bad taste in their mouth and I don't
blame them yeah that's what irritates me I think we've abdicated
responsibility I don't go ahead yeah I don't know I have a bunch of thoughts
one is I wonder whether we actually have the political
uh clout or popularity or whatever do we have like a big enough voice to be
able to actually reclaim rationality for what we think it means we're smaller
than Ben Shapiro and like the international what is it the dark web
people yeah intellectual the international dark web
that's a different thing I mean I believe in us maybe I'm overly
optimistic but this community has consistently surprised me with its
ingenuity we haven't really tried yeah running
running with your death theater metaphor if we were the death eaters there's
there's only you know a few dozen of us that well if we're all smarter then we
can still win right yeah but we also have to be coordinated
and we also aren't in a uh fictional world where the author gets to
do cool shit and we don't have a dark lord yeah we just need a dark lord
damn it has no one realized that there are literally military
tanks going down washington dc right now what more do we need from a dark lord
no no no no we need our own dark lord yeah yeah we need a light lord
to put it that way I don't know okay so I don't think this rationalism thing is
necessarily a new problem because I mean going far as at
least as far back as the 1800s where people were measuring people's skulls
and saying that yes you can tell because of this racist typical skull
dimensions they are obviously inferior at doing these things
that uh that people have been using scientific ish methods and rational
sounding ish methods to justify their own racism for as long as
science has existed and I think that's a problem I
think that that turns off a lot of people to things like
science and rationalism because they're like oh that's just what you
hide behind when you want to be a racist piece of shit
um but I don't know what the hell to do about that this has been
around way longer than we ever have and there is
I mean there's a distinct advantage to being actually rational
and the problem is that that advantage
I mean the actual advantage that that gives you does
is noticeable in the real world people get more done if they can
if they can be rational and invoke it got someone commented on this in the
thread somewhere where they said that since it works
and people see that it works people who use
rational looking or rational sounding vocabulary
are going to have the authority of that thing working
added to their words and so people who don't necessarily
actually have rationalism in their blood at all well in their blood
in their thought processes at all will co-opt the vocabulary in order to make
themselves sound more authoritative and give their crappy
arguments weight even though they aren't actually rational
and then the entire the entire thing is tainted with
they're using that vocab and I don't know how
you can fight that I mean what do you do
uh going back I mean go ahead David yes oh I was gonna say that like if we were
scientists and we found out there was a scientist who was
spreading false information or using unethical methods
we would publicly and as a group repudiate them
as well as publicly like release information describing
every way they were wrong it won't convince everyone some of the people
who got fooled will stay fooled but at least then we can say we did our best
we didn't just let it slide yeah well that's literally what happened with uh
was it now I think everyone's first name is a David but was it David Wakefield
Andrew Wakefield Andrew Wakefield okay so we need like a public crucifixion
of Andrew Wakefield or of Ben Shapiro from the rationalists the way that
Andrew Wakefield got crucified by scientists I guess but I mean what was
his crucification they withdrew his study and they said publicly that this was
a scientific fraud and it should not be followed
but all every there's still a huge anti-vax movement out there because of
what he did and they still believe him they're like no he was he was a doctor
I don't care what all these other people say true but I think that's more than
what what the rationalist community has done for someone like Ben Shapiro
yeah but we also don't have like a central organization that can say
this this view is not officially endorsed that there was fraud used
yeah we don't have I mean we don't need that we just need good arguments
like authority is always the second best thing
if we just publicly go out and say yo this is dumb
we know this is dumb and we can explain why it's dumb here here and here
well we do have good arguments for some things in uh the writings of Scott
Alexander and yet he is still by a lot of people
they won't read his stuff because they've heard he's a racist
sexist whatever which he's obviously not if you actually read his things but
some of the stuff he says goes against the
the liberal narrative of whatever the liberal narrative is and so
he gets the well you're not you're not speaking for us on this particular
issue so you must be one of the alt-right trolls that's the exact
reaction that this partner had which I was so frustrated by that
I remember being more in the social justice community and
having that kind of knee-jerk reaction like anytime you're introduced to
it makes you really paranoid and it trains you to be looking out for
who's an enemy and then who's on our side and you're looking for these little
secret cues and like one strike means that you're out
right oh man you misgendered somebody that one time
it's like oh the minus points if you've been on a podcast that has had
friendly conversations with different people who are on the right then
you're automatically smeared as well can't talk to those people
I mean it's weird because I've seen people call him a Nazi sympathizer
and he actually has great aunts and uncles who died in the Holocaust
you know makes his Nazi sympathy sympathy way
confusing yeah maybe he just really hated those
great aunts and uncles right I think he has an incredibly nuanced
view on race and gender too and is a very like compassionate person
somebody's actually willing to look at like what are the problems
he has a post that I shared with my partner that was
he did a calculus for here's what the cost of racism is
just here's what just what the economic cost of racism is based on like here's
some studies that show the impacts that racism has and then
weighs that out to a monetary amount and is able to show besides all the like
actual stress trauma and unhappiness that this causes here's the economic cost
of racism so like this is my point that racism is bad
and here's the evidence for it and I was kind of telling my partner I'm like
yeah like this is why I'm annoyed at the social justice stuff because
this this here is quantifying something you know like we're trying to find
like is racism bad yes or no okay
let's look at these studies that show the impact of racism and then quantify it
in some manner and then maybe try to come up with different frameworks and
models where we can try to make that better
measure the results and see whether they worked or not and I think the problem
with that is you are not viewing racism as
automatically intrinsically evil you are saying let's look at the
world and the situation and see if it's evil or not and
I mean it is as we know but anyone who is on the
I keep calling it the far left I don't know what term to use for this the ill
I had heard the regressive left regressive left okay anyone on the
regressive left side does not want to see any sort of
studies or anything because they don't care racism is just bad period
emotional appeals and I mean it is bad period but the fact that someone would
take the time to bother to look at studies to show that it's bad
is in their opinion a sign that you know what if
if the data showed that racism isn't evil then this person would be on the side
of racism and therefore this person is evil automatically
I think that's because if you're citing studies like so what if it turned out
that it was more economically beneficial to be
have a racist community or something right or like like if that so if you're
basing it I am I I mean Scott Alexander's position
I'm assuming is that racism is bad if you want proof
here's some numbers but like it's it's not bad because the numbers
it's bad for the reasons but if you're not convinced that it's bad for those
other reasons here's here's uh you know empirical evidence that it's
bad but the the empirical evidence could have gone
the other way I remember I think uh Sam Harris put it
poignantly when what two three years ago it showed that
um something like 50% of or I forget the number some
sort of staggering number or percentage of of humans today have neanderthal
DNA and it happens basically everyone outside of Africa
right but if it happened to have been people from Africa instead
um this would have been a nightmare for the people who discovered this right
right yeah like he he tweeted out oh it turns out that yeah we do have neanderthal
blood as long as you're you know as long as you've left Africa or
something you're part it was like yeah whites are special where part neanderthal
right right that was it like in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way yeah but
but that's the thing is like if if you're
if you're gonna hedge anything on any empirical evidence right then there's a
chance the evidence could go against your your your sacred cow
right um don't get me wrong racism is is bad whether or not it's
like even if it worked out to where like a an economy was five percent less
efficient when it you know wasn't racist even if that was the case which it's
not don't don't mishear me um it would still be good to you just suck that up
and because it's there are other benefits aside from like the measurable
you know economic output or something right yeah and in that case then if the
economic uh if it were economically beneficial then
it's like okay we'll take that into account but like you're going to measure
all the other ways in which it is bad i mean you're studying it for a reason
people think it's bad first of all is it bad what
what are the components that make it bad and then how do you um ameliorate those
components so i would still want to know okay like if the economics aren't a
problem then that's not a problem so we're not going to look at that we're
going to make different kinds of solutions that help these other things
that are actually problems that's why it's still important to know what the
truth is but yeah that's the problem is we actually care
about what the truth is and we do look into these sorts of things
and if the truth could destroy your beliefs
there's a lot of people that say you shouldn't even be fucking looking at the
truth which is awful um if you care about fixing things
if you just care about being right well they care about
fixing whatever social issue they are they think is important to fix
and the fact that we would be looking at evidence
shows that we're on the wrong side i mean i don't know how you can possibly
win those people over necessarily you win them over
you win them you win them over by not only having the moral high ground
but beating them to the punch when it comes to the things that they care
about most like i agree i am not a fan of the
illiberal left but the way i've been looking at things
is that the illiberal left the biggest issue is
ostracization and that's not great nobody wants that
what do you mean like when
if you cross that boundary that one strike
policy you were mentioning earlier you are ostracized you are cut off from
your community if you are part of those communities
and they will sometimes go out of their way to make sure it's hard for you to
form a new one okay so you're talking about like
a terrible thing yeah and group out group bullshit
yeah but i can deal with that what scares me more
is seeing the same kind of
dark magic tactics used on the right like i'm way more worried about ben
Shapiro because yeah he can say from now until
sunday that he is a jewish person and that he is not involved in these things
but the guy who shot up that synagogue literally cited him and made sure to say
oh they were religious jews not cultural jews a phrase that ben
Shapiro uses like the rhetoric of the left is bad
and the way they don't use rationality is bad
but the way that the right is going is significantly more dangerous to human
lives and it starts with people who
essentially are spreading propaganda under the guise of reasonability
yeah and if we want to have any chance to show the left
that even if we don't agree with them we deserve to be respected
we should be on the front lines of the part of the fight that we're good at
and that is like cleanly and clearly going through and being like hey
you made these crazy claims that you say are just
questions about like you know black on black violence
but when someone brings up these other issues around those studies you don't
listen to them it sounds like you don't actually care about the truth you
don't actually care about these questions
you are using this as a justification for
further violence and and then just tear them down in the public
court i don't think it'll win every time but i'm pretty sure if you do that
enough times even like the illiberal left will
eventually start to look i do think we should probably
speak out a little more often about that
it's weird because i don't consider anyone on the right
in my community really and so you get more worried about people in your
community fucking things up whereas if someone on the other team is
being asked all you're like well they're on the other team obviously they're
going to do that but i i totally get what you're
saying because i have noticed i don't know there's there is a very
wide spread of of political opinions in the rationality movement which i think
is pretty healthy but i also think it's weird that like
a not insignificant portion of rationalists were really into jordan
peterson i'm like what the fuck he's spouting like
weird random rationalist jargon and some of the stuff he says is useful but
overall he's kind of an idiot and and i as i was one of those people
like i think that's why i'm more sensitive to these things because i'm
a lot closer to the right and what i've noticed is that a
lot of times these individual speakers in the dark
web are very reasonable on their own and if you look at their early career
there's no problem yeah but as they get rejected by the left
the natural political gravity is for speakers on the right to invite them in
and that of course is going to create cross-contamination
like every time jordan peterson has to communicate with more right-wing people
his next speech is worse and he's more insane
so it's like they start pandering to the crowds that are accepting of them
i think that's part of it yeah do you think they genuinely start
absorbing some of the mindset of those groups or
do they still have their previous position in mind and they're kind of
just doing it for political uh status i think
i think they get absorbed i think as a human it's impossible not to become
more like the people you spend most of your time with
yeah certainly if one group's kicking you out and you're like okay these people
don't think i'm crazy the other people that i used to cohort with they must
be the crazy ones well and those people hurt you yeah
these people are here like helping those wounds heal so obviously you're
going to feel more emotional gratitude towards them
like here's the best example i can give from the jordan peterson perspective
i watched him give one of his lectures on biblical psychology that he did in
canada and there's a part where he comes up to an
orson wells quote where he talks where orson wells discourages socialism
and you see jordan peterson tap down surround the fact that
canada is essentially a democratic socialist country and he's like yo i love
the government structure we have here he's talking about like communist
socialism and like it's not an entirely
vapid point but whatever and then a few weeks ago or like a month or two ago
he goes into this debate with slavak zizek who by the way
all of the craziness aside is a really smart dude
and instead of completely owning the debate by
playing the intelligent moderate ground of being like hey you're
advocating for communism i am a pro democratic socialist
now he's espousing like crazy clear right-wing libertarian propaganda not
even like the good stuff and i'm like what happened
in the course of like a year and a half this person went from
defending democratic socialism to ignoring the fact that it is the
government that he grew under yeah that is weird
i actually liked some of his stuff peterson is like
long-winded and boring but uh i think he had some good things to say
i read uh 12 rules for life and i read some of maps of meaning but like
he's yet turned into this weird internet meme person
radicalized it's scary that that can happen
yeah it's really sad too because like i still recommend to people if you can
find his old like 2014 psychology lectures
they're really insightful like he sounds like he would have been a great
teacher but it's a little bit of that uh dunning kruger effect
just because you're good at psychology doesn't mean maybe you have the best
political insights yeah this is true back to
rationality it's a bit sad i think that we're stuck with
a label it's really hard to rename yourself
maybe impossible i've been i thought about that as well i don't think we
could really rebrand at this point it would be very difficult
and i guess this is me trying to make a call to arms
and i'll try to put my money where my mouth is and actively do it myself
but maybe we should take it on ourselves to actively go into those
communities where we're like oh we should just give up on these people
and find out what their reasoning actually is
because i bet you wouldn't be very hard to dismantle it
and even if we only help five percent of people
those five percent are probably going to be the most fervent supporters
what's that uh old saying there's no faith like the faith of the converted
now hold on a sec what do you mean go into these communities and reach out to
people because i don't know what communities you're talking about or how
we're going to go into them go to the republic national convention and
start yeah preaching the good word okay
i hate to say it but yeah like going online to these forums if not us who
okay like no one else is going to do this social role
and it's important and it's a place where we can thrive
and i think it would help us both kind of rectify the name of rationality
and try to actively divorce it from politics
like i think it would be just as reasonable for us to do this same sort
of like rigorous work in our own like more left
leaning circles but let it be known and let it be going on
forth like oh man have you heard the rationality
community stormed like storm watch or something or an
alt-right group and just destroyed them and refused to give up and then when
they wouldn't listen we destroyed their website
like i i'm not i have no guilt over such ideas
like i say that we need to go like refute all their arguments and then ddos
them because that would be fun
i'm actually kind of i'm not sure how i feel about literally trying to take
down people's websites like why are we doing this
because it'd be funny no i don't think that that's a good way to win arguments
it would be funny um i mean the best way to run arguments is street
epistemology which i learned from this podcast when you guys first started
yeah i really like want to be confident enough to start doing that
i do think it's important that when we see things
shared like ben Shapiro being an idiot to point out this is not
rationality this is a douchebag co-opting the words of rationality
to sound smart but i don't know what can we call them like straw vulcan or
something i don't even know what you would straw rationalist
i like i think david used rationalizer rationalizer yeah yeah
i mean that's i guess i i i think i mean i i'm convinced that
there's something that could be gained from like undertaking this effort and
you're right like i don't see a lot of rationalists
arguing with people online or at least they don't i mean if i see some
arguing with somebody on reddit i don't know if they're rationalists or not
right so maybe but i guess so this isn't an argument
against like the attempt it's sort of just like
then you we've got to think about how to do this tactfully because like
the beige and conspiracy doesn't have the listenership that the ben Shapiro
show does right so you know even if we were to then you
know plus i don't want to have to listen to the show listen to the ben Shapiro
show yeah only to say like oh he was wrong about these
things um i guess if something comes across my
my feed and then there's an opportunity for me to do something i'll say
something but right i think the people we hang out with
don't generally quote ben Shapiro yeah i think the people that we hang out with
generally aren't the kind of people that are going to go pick fights on the
internet like and maybe that's part of the problem
and the reason we're not doing this there's i think like the goals of a lot
of rationalists are not build a bigger political
presence and convert people not saying whether they should or shouldn't be but
people are more concerned with effective altruism and
trying to align ai and trying to get like effective self-help and you know
whatever our topics of interest are so i have a former partner who's a satanist
and the thing is the vast majority of americans when they hear satanist
they think you know worships the devil possibly does black
blood sacrifices things like that right definitely eats babies definitely eats
babies yeah that's like number one rule for being a satanist might be a lesbian
but you know it's just this group a small group in denver with you know
they're a chapter of an overall national organization more or less sort of
of people who get together do some fun ritual stuff
are generally pretty left-leaning pretty open pretty poly
and just really enjoy making fun of the catholic church right
almost all of them are atheist or agnostic or
at any point there was no literal worshiping of the devil as they don't
actually believe in him as a as a person
and they're like yeah i mean we're satanists that's our name now
and the people who like know them and care to find out
can find this out and the rest of the world are just like oh
evil satan worship person like yeah whatever blow me we don't care
i've got a this is a side point but i now i can't help but think of the question
if somebody showed up at the church doors of the church of satan
and seemed in all earnest all all earnestness to be presenting an honest
belief in satan as the one true savior and they weren't like trolling like
the organization is like gold to do yeah
how do they handle that somebody shows up and they're like i believe satan and
like they're not budging and they're like and i brought my bag of dead babies
i'm pretty sure that's never happened in the history of the world that's cool
people don't generally worship the evil deity
there's all kinds of crazy people in the world that's true but they probably
wouldn't show up at the satanist church anyway they would have like the
they'll have their own cool satanist church with blackjack and hookers and
dead and dead babies right well they'd probably have a basement with a cooler
and bodies in it and he and eventually end up in jail
i shit okay so enias yes and so i'm not saying that the way they do things is
right but on the other hand i kind of admire the whole
not giving a fuck that other people don't know shit about us thing
but yes to my thing but here's the thing they actually
do go out into the public when it's important for example
satanic temple oh i love those guys sued arkansas simple
sued arkansas city because they had a copy of the ten commandments
and they were like we're gonna put in a baphomet statue
our thing is the separation of church and state
even though any individual chapter is small and most of the time all we do is
hang out when we see someone clearly violating this
we are going to go into the public sphere and we're not afraid to attract
that attention like we should have a similar kind of conviction
i agree like i think and i think that's totally within our power as a
community and you know what they won they ended up
having to put a statue of satan in front of arkansas city state house
right next to the ten commandments absolutely bananas it's like a statue
of baphomet like patting the child's head yeah yeah
yeah it looks so cute they ended up just taking both of them down
yeah and they won like they and why are we not just as persistent well for
starters we don't have any sort of organization
we right now are just a bunch of people who hang out on forums and sometimes
have meetups i think that's people that are working at
miri yeah i don't know do you think we should
i kind of have been thinking we should organize for a long time but on the
other hand who wants to do that fucking work man
yeah they're pros and cons of organization and um also i think the
type of people that you need to be management oriented people
are hard to come by in our group
i'm i'll do it like i'm not even joking david for dark lord
it's kind of been my it's kind of been my goal for a while
and i enjoy social communication the only reason i haven't tried is because
this community is some of the smartest most
motivated people i've ever met and i don't feel like i'm
quite there yet let me finish my degree but
one year and i am willing to do that legwork
i just don't want to do it if i think that no one is gonna care and no one's
gonna like want to join i'm in the bay area
raymond arnold had put out a call asking if anyone is actually genuinely
interested in doing community building stuff reach out to me and come talk
i'm not sure exactly what he's got in mind or whether they're just kind of
trying to develop plans and assign people rules right now i'm also super
interested in that but uh i'm not like out of place in my life where i could go
i know we do that i know we've mentioned this at least once before and
steven was really against it but um i don't think it would be a bad
idea to incorporate like as a religious organization under
us law i'm probably less against that now than i was
i mean i i do feel like well i guess i get i don't remember my previous
stance on this but i i mean thinking about it i never see that working we'll
never get the big names in i don't think i can't imagine
elizabeth kowski being on board with this right i mean
many people who find rationality found it uh you know it would have to have some
kind of tongue-in-cheek name yeah but it would be like as part of their
religion right and so like i i mean i
i guess you know you're saying similar to the church of satan
yes and i mean i guess i like what they do i don't see myself attending but
mainly just because i don't think that i'd have fun but i like that they do
stuff um i mean no one could stop you from
making well i guess you have to you have a little bit of legwork but i mean if
the 20 of us to come to meetups here in denver want to make a church out of it
we can right um i'm not sure what it costs not that much
no so uh i and well maybe a church maybe a church
isn't the best form of organization like i think we
mentioned once the idea of like a guild of rationalists which i like the turn of
phrase there oh i would love to have a guild
but i do think the idea of a more structured
group that can like successfully support franchises like i know how
frustrating it is to be a rationalist in a super small community with
literally only one other person to talk to about it
and it would have been amazing for me if there was a group out there i could have
reached out to you that would have been like here's the handbook
you don't have anyone like to go here's like your first few meetings got set up
for you and yeah we there's always someone to contact
those would be immensely valuable at helping someone who
is even less social than me at getting one started
like my goal is to make it so easy to start a chapter
of like a discussion group about rationality that
almost every town of over 2000 people has at least five
well i mean it is already that easy you just create a group on a
meetups and then you try to meet up the problem is getting enough interest in a
small community to get those people yeah the problem is the getting the person
who's going to organize the group and do all the logistics which uh
not a lot of people have those skills especially i think in this group people
tend to be more introverted um and involved in their own
kinds of projects it's often a concern with making money
and that doesn't you know well i mean steven and me
and that and it's just awkward yeah before like most people don't have the
social skills to run their first meeting when they've never won one before
having like a plan just for your first like five or six meetings as a group
would be really really useful i think there are guides like that online
um like unless wrong and on somewhere else it was uh it may have been the
might have been slay start codex actually might have been slay start codex
might have been i remember um scott was encouraging people to start slay start
codex meetups nice and had i think a post that would
explained the steps i don't remember back when i was
when i was getting this one trying to get this one well when we were getting
this one going it was i looked up some of this stuff and it might have been the
columbus rationality group who put out some sort of you know no i think it was
on the community i whatever it was there was something like this but the fact
that i can't remember you know then therefore easily find it again probably
means that it needs to be more prominent what were you gonna say though inyash
well i was gonna say that when steven and me started the denver group uh we
spent a number of months like three or four months at least
just like going to a place and the two of us hanging out for like an hour and a
half and then going home again because just no one came
it's not a thing that our type of people generally go out to it
we were basically on the verge of giving up i think we skipped a couple months
and then uh hpm noir wrapped up and ellie aser said hey anybody who
wants to have a thing do it on pie day this year
the last chapter is coming out that day and everybody meets up and we can just
kind of like have fun and celebrate and at that point we said okay we're doing
this at darcy's and i think 25 people showed up it was
ridiculous i thought maybe we'd get five based on how before we had zero aside
from steven and me and we just had to keep adding tables and chairs and having
that one spark to start things off is how the denver
denver group got going and i don't know how you could recreate that
there needs to be some sort of central clearing house area where people that
are interested in this sort of thing can go and see like ah okay here's where
the group is meeting and and maybe once a year this is our
official new people come and be welcome
thing a lot of sounds like we should have a rationalist holiday
yes we have solstice everyone has solstice though
that is good petrov but yeah that is good has
pagan and wiccan connotations and influences and nothing against those
communities god knows they're awesome and i enjoy being a part of them and
communicating with them but maybe like when was thomas's
bae's birthday or his death day well i'd like pi day
like it would be great every rationalist in the world had like an event that day
and maybe volunteered at schools or something like
did something to help the community and make it a little bit more rational and
then went out and celebrated we could get that off the ground before the next
petrov day on a small level possibly yeah i mean
at least i could take the day off and you know go find support to talk
yeah i could probably um have an event at a library like the republic library
yeah i mean if it's our religion it's a religious holiday and they can't stop
us from taking a day off god bless america we still got incorporated as a
religion first yeah that's like what 500 bucks
i actually don't know there's a couple other groups to jump through you've got
to like have and it depends on the problem
sure it varies state by state but some of the base ones like you need to have
some tenants which we have but you need to have i mean well we possibly have if
we're going to say our religion we're not but if we're going to say that fine
um i think you need to have a place of sacredness
whether it's and maybe sacred is even too loaded of a word but there it has to
be a location that people congregate at and it can't be the common room i'm
assuming of an apartment complex at least not without their endorsement
right um so you know i guess i doubt you know a restaurant would let you use
their back room as your as your church spot i do think we're getting no it
should be outside i do think we're getting a bit
far afield of the original why are right-wing people creeping into
rationality and co-op can we do about it topic yeah
we we sorry we went off the tangent and i like this tangent and we will have to
pursue this tension someday this is probably not a thing we're going to
hammer out on one podcast episode you're correct
i feel like that conversation is one that we should rope um matt freeman into
also yeah i agree
um so we can fulfill our math i guess so i had a list of questions we already
went through most of them so do you guys think this is a problem
if it is do you think this is our battle the third problem was
can we coordinate and then the last one is what we should do
i and i do think it's a little bit of a problem i mean like
not without incident i pulled their reply to your
to your initial post uh said that i think the rational community has some
specific properties that make it attractive to the right
generally uh it's not just the general diffusion of a successful set of ideas
let me skip down a little bit
so the properties first the community is very against perceived censorship
and pro absolute tolerance which i think is true right
yeah uh and not without incident says i believe this will always drag a
community to the right which i don't think is true at all
actually the absolute tolerance thing i think is taking it a bit far
i think that we're a community that will listen to your ideas and won't censor
you yeah and like you know i think we're absolute free
speech but also like i think that if somebody is at a
rationalist meet up harassing people insisting that like
blacks are inferior and they're not listening to any of the arguments that
you're saying why do you have any of these other races in your media
would kick that person out for for harassing people and you know
derailing whatever conversation you're trying to have i could even imagine
you know sitting down for half an hour with somebody who's spouting some
egregious bullshit and you have a long conversation with them and at the end
per you know the rap of horrors rules of good discourse you're able to repeat
their argument in a way that they totally agree with
so i really understand you mean this this and this they're like yeah absolutely
like cool i think that's a fucking stupid idea
don't come back right well at the very least you know let's
let's talk about why i think it's stupid so like tolerance would be like okay
well that's your opinion whereas yeah cool now that i fully understood your
position now i feel fully qualified to say you're in it that's not necessarily
that you're an idiot but that's a really stupid belief i do think those are good
qualities of the rationalist community though willing to engage with any idea
at least once that's why i brought it up is that it was that that's
distinct from tolerance yeah it's just a it's a willingness to listen to good
faith arguments yeah i don't think that'll necessarily
drag a community to the right though unless a community is already to the
left of the truth whereas if a community is to the right of the truth
that such a thing would drag them to the left right
i disagree the argument that leftists give against liberals is very similar
when you have free speech and you encourage it
like alt-right nazis aren't gonna come out and say that they're alt-right nazis
unless they're real idiots they're going to use every dirty trick of
conversation every tactical error and allowing
them to do this gives them more opportunities to spread their propaganda
if they come up with new arguments that's one thing
but every time you allow one of them to rehash an old argument that has been
settled about race science or crime or statistics like
that you're giving them another opportunity to infect the audience
if it's a private conversation between two people that's one thing but that's
almost never the case anymore yeah but that kind of person you're
describing sounds like somebody who would get banned from the less wrong
comment field or the slight star codex open thread
there is actually a policy at least in most i think rationalist fears of okay
we've heard this argument you're not listening to anybody who's arguing
back at you this is not a good faith
conversation so you know like strike one and then like oh they're doing it again
strike two strike through your band i see this happen all the time
and that's true and i actually think that's one of the strengths of the
community but we don't show that part of us banning
people that often what people know is that you can do
like you can take refuge in our community as long as you don't say
anything too egregious and you never cross certain boundaries
verbally regardless of what your beliefs very clearly imply
um that was one of the that was something that like the partner i was
having an argument with had said like based on me reading the slight star
comics slight star comics slight star codex comments field i
see people making all kinds of like horrible things
no one should have read the comments on anything ever yeah first of all the
comments section are not representative of the community i mean isn't that the
rule for the entire internet never read the comments
yeah that was actually very responsive so keep it you read the comments now
actually i like the comments and sleister could extend to be pretty
high quality but occasionally yeah you do get trolls and assholes and
usually they get dealt with either by people ignoring them uh people
arguing with them uh or eventually them being banned if they're
refused to engage in good faith conversation i feel like yeah
so did you get sorry i'm sorry go on jess i was interrupting um i think i
want to agree with what you're what i think you were saying
where it would be nice if kind of as a community we could agree on a set of
norms where this is if you want to be a
member of the rationalist community exist in a rationalist space either a
physical meetup or a comments thread this is the way we will deal with you
you're welcome to join your you can say whatever you want um but you have to be
willing to engage in good faith arguments and if you troll or if you refuse to
change your mind and just keep saying the same something over and over again
then we will ask you to leave well you can refuse to change your mind
no one is required to have certain beliefs
i don't i think if you're unwilling to update based on evidence then you're
not a Bayesian rationalist yeah and you don't belong in the group i think you
guys are talking about different kinds of things like we could have a very
serious disagreement about like how we want to like you know work and how
much we want to donate to charity or something but like
you know if you're if you're coming to you know a local meetup or less wrong
dot com and you're insisting on being a flat
earth or then like we're not like if you if you're not getting over your
flat earth ism you're not getting the point of what we're doing here
i think the only real line for me i i disagree the way you should deal with
that is you talk with this flat earth or if they
claim to be a rationalist and be like let us let reality decide between us
between the two of us or as a group let's feel like let's figure out an
experiment that you can trust and let's do it
or find someone who has done it and see the results
and if you don't update after that that's more suspicious
yeah that's basically what i was what i meant i guess
i mean like i i i like the idea of actually doing the experiment
um but i think that it's also an unnecessary step because we there's
mountains of evidence for you know evolution happened
um like in general i don't think it's not flat humans humans don't update
immediately it's a it's a process and it takes time but
more importantly i don't think that we should require anyone to
necessarily update in in a in any certain direction just to be around us
i think the only really bright line i would draw is
anyone who's trying to invalidate someone else's humanity
or or imply that someone else's humanity should be invalid like someone who is
disabled or someone who is a different color or anything
like that uh that would be the line where i'm like i'm
sorry i'm i'm not even going to tolerate you being around
yeah i absolutely agree with that but i everyone has a right to live and to
flourish every human does but i also think that
i don't know i don't think that people belong in the rationalist community if
they're not going to update their beliefs based on facts
like that's the core tenet of what it is to be a rationalist
yeah i mean yeah you have to make your map more accurate for all the crazy
things i've said about magic and wizardry and all that nonsense
i consider myself a rationalist because every day i think at least a little bit
about what can i do to make my next day better by predicting it and
changing stuff based on what i learned that's it
if you don't do that i don't know why you're even involved yeah i agree that
is a core requirement just that i don't think anyone should
have a say on what the actual truth that people should update towards is
like there's some things that are patently obvious like you know the
shape of the earth but uh i'm still uncomfortable with
saying you aren't updating in the right direction
therefore you aren't a rationalist like if someone is actually trying
yeah no um if they're trying then like it could be that's called doing a good
faith argument um the thing that i'm saying is or the
scenario i'm imagining is someone joining the group and
very insistently trying to argue whatever they're whatever their talking
point is that 9-11 wasn't inside job or god
the proletariat needs to rise up well i mean that's something we could all
actually have an interesting conversation about
but like somebody that has a a fallacious belief about stuff
say uh
chinese people are more violent uh or i don't know i'm trying to think of
something are you saying they aren't more violent their kung fu skills are
too great right so you're trying to pick something
less obviously absurd than flat earth is i mean well i'm trying to pick something
that's not like an actual position that's going to like poke
somebody sure well like what if it was something pointless like
like asian people um live longer or something like that's an empirical
question yeah right and so if if i believed that
they did and i have no idea if they do or not they do
they do well it's actually uh that's complicated but gone
it probably depends if you live in hong kong or not right um like if you're
living a high pollution area i'll mention your life expectancy oh yeah
yeah anyway the so like whatever whatever my
belief was you know you can make it specific enough
and then like all right cool let's go look and like we're not going to follow
people around we're not going to follow around 10 000 people and see how long
until they die we can just look at the statistics of you know
mortality rate by air or whatever life expectancy by area you can also look at
genetics uh a lot of asian people have a fax
o3 or o8 i forget gene that is correlated with longevity
that you could do that too um but then you know i guess
i guess not really sure i see what you guys are talking about like
do we kick people out based on i think it's pretty easy to spot if somebody's
not making good faith effort and like if i came to you and i was like no no i
insist they actually you know all the numbers you see online are fake
this gene's not real um you know they the census data is all made up they all
actually die at like 60 you've never met a person
you know that's chinese over 60 but they're just lying like
if i if i'm coming to you with those many caveats as like to why my
my belief must be true um now i'm pretending like that they live
less or something or shorter um it i think it's it you can spot that coming
right and like i guess i i to teeny i was just concerned
of like whether or not you're giving them you know
whether or not they might be right we want to update in their direction
sometimes you can just tell and like that's a very dangerous thing to say and
like to hold on to because you can just use that justify you know fully
justify anything and sometimes they're like they have an argument that's a
popular argument that we know is wrong like a
acupuncture works or uh andrew wigfield was right and vaccines cause autism if
somebody came into the group i mean we've all been over this a million
times if they start saying vaccines cause autism
and they have as ammo the same bullshit arguments that we've heard a million
times before then you know and that person is unwilling to
actually be like here is the evidence against this
yeah and i'm torn on how to handle that i don't want that person to be in the
group i've seen arguments go it's like well have you
read the sequences and it's like i'm not going to go off and read a million
words of stuff and then come back to you in eight months
and let you know if i still agree with you or not like can we hash it out now
and so like i don't know my answer is always
my answer is always your beliefs have to pay rent
if you don't trust vaccines you don't trust the rest of modern medicine which
is based on it so have you decided to never go to a doctor
again have you decided that every like cold medicine doesn't work
because if you aren't actually living by your beliefs
then you don't understand the network of reality that underpins your society
like that's the argument against that like you're a hypocrite yeah that's great
you actually do believe all of this stuff because your actions say it
if you didn't you would be living in the woods making herbal medicines yourself
but i bet you you're going to take that aspirin when you're hung over
can i bring us back to the original topic
i think at least one of us should okay now let's do it
i wanted to make a um i don't know if this is a point
a suggestion that was brought up again by not without incident this goes into
the school of nobody as an agent we're all just
cliches of the times
he points out that where was it or i don't know vei i'm not your gender of
this person um that uh rations tend to be
contrarians generally tend to be people who are like well i've
looked at things and i disagree with what the rest of society says
and here are my reasons why right and uh as it turns out
a lot of the early rationalists around eliasers and mind age who are now
late 30s maybe even early 40s we grew up in the 80s
and the 80s were an extremely right decade uh they were a reaction against
the 60s and 70s and so pop culture was far on the right
and as contrarians we are all very far left we are
poly we're open we're anti-religious we tend to have very left
leaning positions the newer generation of rationalists that are joining now that
are in their 20s maybe early 30s uh grew up during a very left
leaning time and as rationalists tend to be contrarians
they're going to the right because that is contrary from the
milieu they grew up in so once the cycle goes a little bit further and we're
far into the right again then all the newest generation of
rationalists in about 10 years will be left again uh is a possibility
and i kind of agree that rationalists tend to be
contrarians and that uh this may just be a cycle of us
always being the the opposite of what the general culture is
i don't think that we are necessarily just like rebellious teenagers being
like oh yeah dad no not this contrarian doesn't
necessarily mean a rebellious teenager like yeah but i mean it just means
people who do not like being lumped in
and accepting what everyone else yeah i mean like we're people that tend to
reject the status quo and want to take it apart and figure out which things are
good and which aren't but um i will accept things from the
culture that i think are doing a good job right i'm not going to be good
and so when the culture is more to one way then like for example they were in
flux of rationalists will tend to be the other way
am i in my early 30s and i grew up in a liberal time and i'm still mostly
liberal i didn't feel the need to i mean i i guess i i didn't go into the like
regressive left but i i think i'll be i'll be concerned for the
future of the rationalist community of in 10 years we switched a lot of our
positions like from if we start being
anti-chronics or we like we start reacting against the things i mean i
don't want to say like we're we're right about all these things now and we
shouldn't change our minds and yet like this is only the kind of
experiment you could look at 100 years hence but like if things swung back and
forth every 15 years it would be just like every other
group yeah and that's not the point of this this is supposed to be like no
we're figuring out reality we're gonna get more and more correct
we're not gonna keep swinging around and and uh although of course like i said
i don't know how you avoid doing any of that when you're like
trying to you know make your map as accurate as possible and be willing to
change your mind unless you get everything right the first time
yeah right and also because the maps that i mean to adulthood with are the
ones that we are raised with so the way we fix our maps is always going to
often have to be moving away from how we were the maps we were given
so i want to bring up the amish community
okay i live near the amish and i heard you guys
talking a few weeks ago about them and i think there's a misconception you guys
have the amish are not against technology per se
they are against technology that destroys their community
for example a lot of these amish farms around me have computers in their barns
because they have multi-million dollar businesses like you can't run one of
those today without a tool to help you but they're like the most basic
excel only computers they have and and when they want to bring in a new
technology to their community every amish family thinks about it but they
also have elders in the community and it's kind of like a ground up decision
like now they've just started to get cell phones but they don't have smartphones
so how do they have computers but not like buttons
and blood transfusions not what like buttons for t-shirts
i mean why do something new if you don't need to it's not that much harder to do
at the old i would feel like having a cell phone would destroy your community a lot
more than being able to button your shirt they don't have so many buttons he was
saying that they're looking at having cell phones just not smartphones
oh well okay as long i don't know i uh i don't know what you're talking about
the ones around me wear buttons they kind of look like dorky accountants
so what i there's i could just when we talked about this and like buttons was
the go-to example of like one of the technologies they resisted that's why
they had i don't remember talking about this and i've never heard about the
buttons am i totally making you yeah i live in the amish community and i tell
you they wear buttons just prove i can go take a picture i believe you i'm
weird el song amish paradise specifically references he's got a lot of buttons
and he wears a cool hat i thought it was buckles i think it was buckles
oh crap it's always hard to hear words and songs honestly a third of what i
know about the amish community comes from that song
another third comes from the movie um the the shamanland movie
oh the village the village i don't think they weren't even they weren't amish
they weren't amish exactly so my my i realized my my math's very fuzzy
okay um and i guess the rest comes from but like pop culture
rum springa and all that random stuff i think that's what david's trying to say
we don't actually understand the amish yeah the amish has
really improved a lot since david first explained them to me a few months ago
so fair enough so what just my i guess my last thing to make sure i'm not
totally crazy they're anti-medicine or they're not pro-medicine right like
they can still die of an infectious disease because they you know they won't
take antibiotics no not at all in fact hersey medical center near my
house has one of the best genetic disease sections in the world because
they're such an inbred community they have the highest rate of
genetic diseases in america so it sounds like they're trying to rectify some of
the uh maybe more extreme aversions to technology they've had in the past
i mean they they do have some issues with blood transfusions
but they're actually pretty okay with like plasma as long as there's no actual
human blood like if it's all artificial like they're not against every
technology but they do have a way of deciding which technologies and which
things they want to let into their communities and which ones they've
decided are frivolous uh comings and goings of the outside world let's put it
that way okay the reason i bring them up is i think that the
rationalist community if we want to move towards a more intelligent way of
progressing forward instead of just whiplashing left and right with every
generation needs to have a similar structure but with ideas because the
truth is a lot of traditionalist ideas i think are a lot of valuable like i
often find myself a little bit right of a lot of people in this community but
that doesn't mean you shouldn't look at the evidence and update
like at this point i don't understand how you can be a conservative
and be against universal health care especially considering there are
conservatives in other countries that are like already have it
so that would be something that i think would be a good
stable idea to put into the canon of rationality
you don't have to do universal health care but it seems to have worked well
for all these other countries and there's a lot of evidence for it
and this is something that maybe we should espouse in general
or maybe it would be something more about psychology like we have discovered
a new way of thinking about psychology and there's a lot of evidence for it
yeah like parts theory or a surfing uncertainty
what was that and yeah and nobody is required to believe anything that a
high council says but it definitely helps if there's like
at least a robust discussion within the community about it
and then a group of smart people that we all kind of trust saying like
this is where we generally lean so two quick things
um i like this conversation but i need to go roll up my car windows because it
looks like it's going to start thunderstorming and two i'm still
coming to the overcoming the trauma of having been wrong about everything i
believed about amish people if you have if you have a any sort of like
less than an hour documentary or like youtube video to explain all this to me
that'd be great um kevin kelly uh who i think is the
founder of popular science or popular mechanics one of those
he has a book about um a bunch of stuff that's cool and i remember i was
listening to an interview with him he and his family go and like stay with the
amish perfect that'll be my resource i need to
go out my windows i'll be right back you guys keep going cool while steven's
going we should also probably start considering wrapping up because it's
been over an hour since we actually started started and we should have hit
some less wrong posts i had a couple more points
go for it and probably the rest of you have some
final points uh i was trying to find a segue to this and
we weren't able to get to it but as far as the
people using the name rationality um i remember
i have the frustration that like we're stuck with this name now because a lot
of people confuse it with rationalism which is a different philosophy
and um i would like it if we could at least maybe start calling ourselves
bayesian rationalists i think that was suggested at one point
early on in less wrong and i don't know if it necessarily caught on or not
but then at least like we can differentiate from
ben Shapiro's form of rationalism or if somebody confuses us for
somebody who believes in rationalism i do generally when i talk about my
myself and my belief grouping use the term bayesian rationalist
just for that reason you you were saying david
oh i was just gonna say i don't know how successful such an endeavor will be
but i agree that it's a good one and i'll start doing the same
it can't hurt yeah i'd like for that to catch on i think that'll help a lot
too uh if we do actually have any kind of concerted effort at
going on ben Shapiro's blog and arguing with him
steven welcome back okay jess you were saying something cool
yeah it also started hailing out there so that was cool i made it out there
sometime oh that's what i heard yeah it didn't occur to
me that actually it did but it was by that point i was too
into it to try and pull my phone out and turn off the noise but i'm sure you
heard the car going and all that so you know what this means though
it sounded alarming yes it won't stop people
you know it might stop this so i mean this it's spring it goes it'll
hail for an hour and it'll be done so all right jess you had a thing
oh yeah really quick the fireworks though for anyone listening outside the
united states who doesn't know today is the fourth of july right which everyone
in the country gets together to set off fireworks to celebrate captain america's
birthday huzzah a truly a holiday worth celebrating that's
right this is the day will smith saved us from aliens
that's right cool two things worth celebrating and everyone puts out a
tree and then captain america puts a bald eagle egg
underneath it so all right and we burned an alien on top of the
alien effigy like guy thawkster
um uh suggest yeah gosh what was i saying okay
i was talking about wanting to
uh change to saying oh my gosh it's hailing yeah
yeah it's something you wanted to segue to but there was no good said segue so
you're just going to bring it up i'm very distracted by the fact that it's
hailing yeah it's pretty epic did you see that like
three feet of hail that mexico got earlier this week i did not that's
horrifying yeah yeah they got a meter and like
one point two meters of ice it's the most ridiculous pictures i've ever
seen so then like four feet i guess four and a half
those are some big hill chunks outside look at that
but anything my car is going to totally normal weather people
no end of the world coming everything's fine
steven slowly just closing the curtain
this kind of got a fun quality to watching it like watching a fire you
know let's go back out well even slowly opening the curtain
no um oh gosh okay nature back to the topic
so you wanted to call us bayesian rationalists yeah well i mean i have been
for quite a while when i introduce when people ask me about like my beliefs and
stuff i said i'm a bayesian rationalist because just saying rationalist is
i have run up against the like um you know i belong to the rationality
movement or i am a rationalist and they're like oh you're like one of
those people that thinks and then they say something that totally mischaracterizes
right the rationality community that's exactly what david has a problem with
right at that point then i can say no i'm a bayesian rationalist and
what that means is we update based on information and
try to improve our thinking by identifying cognitive biases and
using techniques and you know the whatever definition
but there's a lot of people that are too polite to say oh so you're one of those
racist alt-right people so they won't say anything this which is why i head
it off and just say bayesian rationalist right at the front
i often just drop rationalists and just say i'm a bayesian
huh and then when people ask what that means i'm like
well i think about things as rationally as i can
and this guy named thomas bayes created a formula that allows me to be a lot
clearer and cut through a lot of the mental bullshit so i'm a bayesian
that's not bad i do like the fact that thomas
bayes is dead why yeah because he has the best
quality for being a religious leader i think that is actually pretty important
because then nobody can be like there it's just this one guy trying to
self aggregate self self-aggrandize yeah he also can't get old and get a
twitter and start tweeting weird stuff he also can't start sleeping with
like all of the youngest of his followers because then that always makes
your religion look bad yeah um what else
what else about this topic i have some concerns about uh
about our ability as a community to just organize on something
not not like necessarily that we can't um coordinate in general but i think that
we won't run up against uh resistance from people who think that
we should be working on these other most important things our public image is
not in the top five most important things that we need to be worried about
right now do those people deny the fact
that things are easier when others want to help you
they would probably be of the opinion that the people that we want to have
helping us or the people who are already here or who are going to find us
and aren't going to be listening to ben Shapiro anyway
and uh that we don't really need to have a
organization with outreach and uh recruiting the common folk
let he who was born rationalist cast the first logical stone wasn't eliezer
had come up with this whole metaphor for the the Bayesian conspiracy
as is our name where it seemed like he actually liked
liked the idea that like okay we're gonna exist out here and then if people
want to find out what we're about they have to come find us and read the
sequences and right that the uh knowledge is more valuable
when it is seen to be hidden right like
this like like how do i mean martial arts schools get around that
they they encourage you to enter because they show valuable skills in the public
but then once you go in you still have to do a lot of the hard work to like
learn how to do it yourself yeah it's a lot harder to show off your rationality
i think we had talked about that before and i do really like that idea like if
there were some places that we were really kicking ass
um either you know just publishing lots of really high quality papers
cranking out scientific discoveries uh innovating in silicon valley in crazy
ways attacking politics in orthogonal like strange
directions that help people as a whole step one kick ass
yeah i think we need to do step one kick ass first before we start doing
step two that's step one we need more high-profile cases like i feel on musk
was like if you came out tomorrow and like i wouldn't be where i was without
the rationalist you know also yeah so i guess quick thing i
like rebranding i i always roll my eyes at that because i remember how badly
that went for the new atheists when they tried to do brights
oh i was thinking about that and yet beijing rationalist
is not a rebranding it's just one more it's a more accurate way to put it
right because rationalist has like oh you mean like day cart and they'll think
you're some esoteric you know snob or something
and day cart was not a by beijing stand beijing rationalist standards
a rationalist yeah right um
i i encourage people to just say beijing and then when people
ask for more information say i'm a beijing rationalist and then give your
spiel but i've in my limited ability to
practice this it seems to get around a lot of those mental connotations
i think i'm going to keep keep with beijing rationalist
i think that's enough of a difference that people get some impression that
there's something else in play here this will be the first schism in the
church of rationality in the bay area people are just
calling them the rats which i thought was really cute
yeah hang in with my rat i am as a as a person who cares about public
image i'm less cool with this rats can be able to call ourselves in
in private you know what up my fellow rat
but as far as my basic point i think you're right jess
and steven like we need to kick ass because
i i think this is just an area where the community
is being a little bit unwilling to look itself in the face a lot of it is very
introverted people and they're making in my opinion
excuses not to do the hard work of learning socialization and putting on a
good face even though the most powerful force on
earth is humans coordinating with each other and popularity is literally a
good measure of like how many humans you can get to coordinate with you
i feel like that's a whole other conversation that i'm very interested
in engaging in but as long as we don't do that
we will never get any further and i think the first step in a place we can
kick ass and the reason i brought up is tearing down assholes who use the
language of rationality as a way to hide their very
prejudice beliefs if nothing else it would be
possibly a way to get more mindshare if people are
are seeing this group always going after Ben Shapiro's and pointing out where
Jordan Peterson is just absolutely falling on his face and
we'd be like oh yeah the Bayesian rationalists those are those people who
are like kind of rightish but attacking all the rightish
assholes yeah like i would like for us to have
a reputation of not necessarily empathetic people
but people everyone can trust will genuinely listen to your side and
will tell you if you're right even if it's unpopular
and will call you out on bullshit when you're wrong i too would like to have
that reputation yeah that sounds awesome i mean i
aim for that that's easy to do in your personal life right i mean
if you subscribe to you know if you have a history among your friends of being
sane and like honest and trustworthy they can come to you and ask for honest
feedback and then you know if they if they already trust your judgment they
can like appreciate your answer right yeah i've been going around telling
people that i do radical honesty although there's
like asterisk it's not the original form but
it's at the point now where i do have people coming and like asking like so i
know that you do the radical honesty thing uh can i ask you something
and uh that's been cool and i wish people more people would do that yeah
i think that's a great tenant of rationality if we were to make it a
church like early christians won their advertising
war essentially by being hyper compassionate even to their enemies
and it was convincing at a certain point the roman empire
so if we become the kind of people who are hyper honest
that is the reputation we will earn yeah i don't know that all rationalists
are pro radical honesty or i guess there's the gap between uh teleculture
ask culture guest culture i think i think it should be towards ask culture
in the rationality community yeah i what is i think that's a good way to do it
i got i can guess most of those but what was asked or what was the
breakdown really quick of the three that you mentioned um
ask culture guest culture and teleculture guest culture is where you
socially competent people can communicate via hints
everything is implied that sounds kind of exhausting well it is but that's like
upside of preserving denied plausible deniability for everyone
which is why a lot of people like it yeah but it also throws people into the
bus you can't do it like most autistic people
and ask in or uh yeah ask in teleculture
more like radical honesty i will ask you things directly
rather than make vague hints about it like i will be like
are you interested in having a romantic relationship with me rather than like
hey you want to go hang out on thursday and so what's teleculture i i guess i'm
and teleculture is volunteering information yo
you me dating right not exactly but so i mean i guess i i that's all sort of
an aside i could just i could just imagine uh like
that's a whole other thing i'll say yeah this is another thing that deserves a
whole conversation we are getting low on time so maybe we should try to wrap
this up did anybody else have any final thoughts about the um
is is rationality being co-opted topic
i mean in my nice little bubble it's not but i can see if people out there are
you saying i guess does ben Shapiro use the word
rationalist i guess i didn't even ask that question
he's the word rational yeah and rationality
and to most people who aren't introduced to
like the sequences it's a lot to read and absorb over a long time
those things are the same as being irrational they are like talking fast
and sounding smart is being a rationalist to most people i think that's just an
admitted weakness and it's our job to dissuade that a lot of people's first
first idea stereotype of a rationalist is like some british person
explaining why empire is the best and it is the white man's burden to help lift
up the lesser races that kind of thing or spock
or spock yeah yeah that's the other one well that yeah i mean
i think maybe just rationalist i mean it was always a tough choice and what to
like name the thing right yeah but yeah i guess
bayesian would have been nicer if that if it started that way it might have been
bayesian is too vague no one would have jumped onto it sounds like a math thing
too it is a math thing it is a math thing but it's also just like it
doesn't tell you anything whereas bayesian rationalist
it has the rationalist core there which
greys you know conveys information to even someone who is not familiar with
bayes yeah i think it bayesian rationality is
more complete of an idea because we are rationalists
and this is the the protocol that we have for doing rationality
bayesian statistics or bayesian updating
i don't have anything else to add yeah all right that's all i got i think we're
all in agreement yeah we're all in agreement new church
david's the pope perfect okay jerk poke give me one year
so i can ordain myself properly or harmful to human anyway by the way
thank you guys for letting me talk about this it's been really getting under my
skin no it was a lot of fun i think i mean this is
this is an important subject i i i mean i didn't have a lot to
to add as far i think it's mainly because this is sort of like the
like noticing the problem stage right um
and other than for me to say oh yeah i see what you're talking about i i don't
have like a lot more to build on it yet so um and to be honest i think a lot of
people have been noticing it and we just haven't said anything
so i i mean saying it is good i i i knew i've seen the the
the tropes and memes of people making fun of ben Shapiro
like there's that onion article where he you know destroyed that homeschooled
you know 12 year old or something and or 17 year old or something and
like with facts and logic and rationality and i like they're always in all caps
like i'm assuming the titles of youtube if his youtube videos are
and i i just assumed everybody knew this that this guy was like that this sort
of thing was a joke i know he has a serious following but i always assumed
that no one thought that that was the same thing
and yet none of this pointed out to me how could there not be any confusion
so this is more reason that and i always try to remember my mind state
before i learned rationality and i probably would have been fooled
like i was smart and clever but i was very far from being
self-aware enough to be like am i updating or am i just finding confirmation
bias like i didn't even have the language then to realize when i was doing
that
and what we're like 0.001 percent of the population if i'm optimistic
all right moving on also also okay go ahead with the also
oh i was just gonna say the best repudiation of uh ben Shapiro i've seen
was on philosophy tube last week and it kind of was
the reason i posted because i was upset i was like this is the best
logical argument against him and this dude is hyper leftist
so anyone who's new is gonna see this and assume leftism equals rationality
right no and always the best response to these sorts of things is actual logic
and real rationality as opposed to like i don't know screaming about emotions or
whatever because that that only that further is like an
applause light for people who are already against him and it does nothing
to help anyone who isn't against him or who is on side on his side but
actually using real logic and real rationality to show
how he completely falls apart in the face of meeting the real world
really would i don't know maybe get a lot of people who are currently sort of on
his side to see what an idiot he is and it's it's just the way we want to do
everything right because things that can be destroyed by the truth should be
and the truth is the best weapon there is and if you can't destroy him with the
truth then maybe there's a problem but since we can do that
and on that note and on that note let us move on to the sequences
for this week uh we didn't actually take any notes on this one but they were
both pretty short so the first one is scope insensitivity
i guess i will quickly summarize it yeah i mean i this one i think we're all
kind of familiar with okay you can take the leader i can whatever
or jess can whoever wants to let's all take the lead
no let's not ready let's all talk at once
my my read on scope intensitivity is it's our inability to
do emotional math basically we should really quickly like point out a few
things that he actually said in there are actually the post yeah good point
okay well uh the it starts off by uh quoting a study where subjects were
asked how much they would pay to save two thousand
twenty thousand or two hundred thousand migrating birds
from drowning in oil ponds and the answers were
eighty dollars for two thousand seventy eight dollars for twenty thousand
and eighty eight dollars for two hundred thousand basically all about the same
amount uh and the post goes on to show uh over
and over in many different uh studies that this
tends to be the same case people regardless of how the
numbers are uh they more or less choose the same
amounts to fix things the number seem to be more or less irrelevant
it's worth pointing out that you can't you have to ask different groups of
people yes yes the the note you can't ask them
one after the other right obviously if you ask them the same number they would
just multiply it by 10 well actually i sort of doubt that like you know because
part of my don't my donating power like i might give
you know 50 bucks to somebody's charity but i can't if they said hey you know
what this actually going to help 50 000 people not five
i can't give a thousand more dollars oh right a thousand times as much right
so part of it is just by how much you have to give
um well i think what the article says is that it follows a logarithmic scale
so even though the problem may have gotten 10 times worse
you only emotionally give as though it got like
1.5 times worse yeah i don't know if this is like you
sorry oh i was just gonna say it's not that we are completely
incapable of scaling up or even that groups don't scale up
it's that once we find a point like whatever we can give
we don't really know how to do proportions correctly
we think the problem is twice as bad when it's 10 times as bad
yeah i wonder if and this might um actually be controlled for in the study
but like instead of how much would you give of your own money to save these
birds imagine that you're um in charge of a
fund for these birds like and uh how much would you allocate for
these many birds versus these many i wonder if that would
change the way people are doing math or fit the scope and sensitivity still
applies it's too bad katrina isn't here because she
worked with nonprofits a lot and she mentioned that
they found if they showed like pictures of large groups of people
the donations would often go down but if it was just a picture of one person
looking really sad the donations would be much higher
that's that's true as far as i know i know that um like sam harris talks about
this in his podcast all the time but that's something that um you know like
will mcaskill and peter singer have been on about that you know you show a
picture of one sad little girl starving in africa
you can elicit more charity for her than you can for her and her brother
yes at the same time or her and her brother and her their whole family
um because emotionally it's hard to you just can't
feel that many people i think that i mean there's a lot of components to it
like part of it i don't i i think it's too generous to say that it even doubles
when the problem you know goes up by 10 because the bird thing doesn't even
map to that um but there's there's like a sense of like
yeah how much will you give to like save africa like to your average you know
american you know tele teleprompter what do you call him
telephone charity things right telephones like nothing i can't save
africa why am i gonna throw my money in that in the bucket like into that fire
that's not gonna do anything but i can save that girl
right i think there's a efficacy that comes into play too
like you start feeling more hopeless the more people you start adding to that
equation right first of all it depresses you and then
secondly you're thinking about what can i do to solve this whole village's
problems yeah it seems totally futile to you know ask
can you save these thousand people um i think that's part of it but yeah the
post goes on to talk about a bit more too so um
but i think i think that's the the general thrust of the
uh the essay right that um
this this is a problem of human cognition yes and
like i think and the way to think about it is that we can't multiply
emotionally which is probably good um is it going insane
it well i mean like imagine like i could be really bummed to learn
that you know one person died yeah and if i was a thousand times as bummed to
learn that a thousand people died i'd probably just kill myself
um well like if you know every now and then we hear about a celebrity that
died right like uh when alan rickman died
everyone was like super bummed because he's cool we really loved him his
Snape and all his other roles right but then like you learned that six million
people were killed in world war two just in the extermination camps
and you're like that's that's a statistic i can't
multiply alan rickman's death by even 10 much less six million that's just a
number on a paper yeah and i mean part of it is because
we know alan great i mean we quote no alan rickman right
um but i mean like even if i'm just trying to think of
you know yeah but even if you're thinking about a thousand
alan rickmans that doesn't you just you can't emotionally think about a thousand
yeah isn't that related to um i forget if this is called
uh dump bars number where probably you uh also can only kind of mentally keep
track of about a hundred friends hundred two hundred fifty
acquaintances that might be the might be related to that i mean but i don't
know if alan rickman's in my monkey sphere right or in my done bars in my
done bar circle um like it's i mean and
earlier this week a co-worker told me that he knew somebody who died and i was
like oh that's terrible like because they just had like monday
um and you know like it sucks and it you know bummed me out a little bit
but um i didn't know this person the guy that was telling me this didn't know him
that well and so you know it wasn't that that tragic i mean i was
probably you know more bummed when you know
name a celebrity died or something right um but that's sort of an aside sorry
were you saying something david
no let me think this through before i speak you guys go on okay
he did also point out the same thing in this post that you said that people
were more willing to give when they could save
4500 lives in a camp of 11 000 rather than 4500 camps it 4500 lives in a camp
of a quarter million just because it was a larger
percentage of the whole problem so felt like they could maybe
contribute in some meaningful way yeah whereas 4 000 people out of a quarter
million just doesn't feel like doing much to address the problem right and
that sounds good or let me rephrase that um fixing that problem sounds like
something that we should do yeah but i don't know like if i could
took my brain to be a thousand times sadder if a thousand people died then
if it was one i don't think i would right um what i should do is just curb my
actual response like my behavior to the to the problem and scale that up rather
than like my emotional response yeah yeah i don't i don't think you would want to
ramp up the emotions associated with that and just go into a horrible depression
every time you think about sad things exactly but uh
being able to think about it um maybe in a practical terms i i don't know if this
is even possible uh neurologically i think it's possible to try to base your
actions on the numbers rather than the emotions i think that's what ea tries to
do i mean um yeah that's the entire i think that that would be like that the
people who i think are doing the most about these sorts of problems right
now are the effect of altruists who first of all have kind of said like if you
make above uh whatever the whatever the kind of baseline like you're you're
living a comfortable life salary then in order to i think it was like $62,000 but
it's probably going to go up to 65 in the next few years with inflation but
somewhere around yeah for the us um uh then it is good to contribute 10% of
your income to charity to effective charities and then like i like that
because it's uh one simple thing that you're doing uh it's not like i think a
lot of people who want to be altruistic can get burned out by there's so many
causes which ones do i pick am i not devoting enough my attention time
money to this important thing over here what about animal welfare you know
what about rape victims what about africa africa i i use that also tongue
in cheek it's just i know but um yeah like i it's like okay what do we do well
let's target the worst problems and let's find the best solutions for the
worst problems and let's find the way that we can get the money the most
efficiently to where it needs to be and use it in the best way totally let's
tackle the problem with math as much as we can yeah and my whole digression on
emotions i should have set up better which was that i think that the reason
that people give consistent numbers across orders of attitudes of dead birds
is because they they pick that they they respond with a with a dollar amount
it's proportional to how emotional they feel about it right and i think even
in the post he says like they they imagine one dying bird
they go that's sad and they might be able to picture a hundred no i'll be able
to picture 50 or 100 but they can't picture 20 000 and if they picture a
swarm of birds that's 20 000 they don't they can't accurately scale it up to
make it 200 000 in their heads or at least if they're going by their
guts exactly so they what has yeah they're they're emotional attunement to
the problem is how much is a plausible explanation for how much they they give
he also uh brought up so oh do you go ahead
oh what i was going to say is as a theoretical way to deal with this one of
the things you could do as a rationalist is before you hear a plea for your money
make your own mental guess of how many people were affected and how much money
you would donate like write down before they say like this
like a flock blank big was affected before you hear the number write down
what you think and what you'd be willing to give and then see the difference
between the two like if you said i would give 70
dollars for 200 birds and then the newscaster says it's 200 000
i think that would give you pause maybe you can't give like a thousand times
more but you would at least look at your number 70 and be like i definitely need
to make this go a lot higher i might just give the 70 dollars and say i hope
i hope i hope that one bird and the other 199 000 of them i hope they find
199 000 other people with 70 bucks that's a good point
that's true on a practical level on a practical level i think jess is right
like a once a year or once a month type is something that if everyone did it the
world would be better and it's pretty goddamn good
he did also aliza did also bring up the alternate theory that people may be
moral satisficers where uh they see something bad and they
feel guilty and so they do something to feel better
and then they feel better and they're done they got that warm happy glow of
helping to contribute in some way and the actual number doesn't matter at all
it's just a matter of relieving moral guilt or even just looking for warm
fuzzies yeah um there was the uh post about
keeping your utalans and your warm fuzzies separate yeah i think that's
uh yeah so maybe i won't talk about it now but i think that was another good
way of addressing the kind of disconnect between wanting to be
to satisfy morals and wanting to actually help
i should clarify i'm explaining i think the internal algorithm in like
non-rationalist people's brains um yeah we as rationalists we're aware of the
problem we should do better now that we're aware that this this glaring
issue exists um but i i know i've told this before but it's probably been
years i i had a roommate who's gay and we were
leaving king supers and it was one of those
like bell guys for salvation army and he threw his change into the guy's bucket
and i was like you realize that like this is one of the groups that gives like
anti-gay rights and stuff and he was like i don't care where the money goes it
just made me feel nice to give that's exactly what he actually said
he's a great guy um but it was just uh and an example of like okay so
you really like this this this could have been anything and it was just
about you know i think um that's that sort of thing
goes on all the time with people who just you know give a couple bucks to
something if you're gonna sit down to write a thousand dollar check i hope
the average person sits down and actually thinks about it but actually
that the average person doesn't sit down and write down a thousand dollar
charity checks so i have a hard time not giving when
people are if you're in pet smart and they're like oh do you want to give a
extra dollar to the save the puppies foundation and you're jerk if you don't
right but i'm like but i could also send this dollar to the
bill gates foundation and buy a bunch of mosquito nets to save children from
malaria and it would go a lot further yeah i have a policy of people with
people ask me at the cash register to round up or donate a buck or whatever i
have policy of always saying no i didn't have time to look into this i feel
like i'm being mugged right now so no you cannot have my money
i like it i mean that that's one approach i i tend to just
it's completely random sometimes i've heard of the charity i'll round up
um and sometimes i've heard of it i won't like if i know you know like i'd
never round up to give to the uh the pink ribbon breast cancer thing because i
know all they do is spend 90 something percent on buying more pink ribbons
um so like they're not getting my money but
yeah it's especially suspicious if there's a store that's trying to get you
to donate to a charity because it's like
oh no now walmart is altruistic and it's like uh
what are you trying to do you're trying to improve your own company self-image
by like branding yourself as a charitable corporation yeah you don't
actually care about these copies i had this i had a job like this i used to be
a canvasser for save the children so i was one of those people who'd wear a
yellow vest and get you to stop on the street corner and
give me your credit card damn shady it was a
dude that was a hard sales job i bet real hard people spit on me in philly
someone threw beer bottles at me why would they spit on you because it's philly
people are insane in philadelphia can confirm
always sunny was the documentary a city brotherly love
more than anyone likes to admit anyway uh the reason i bring it up is
while it was very hard to get people to sign up initially
once people did we had a very high retention rate
because as a charity one of the things they do really well
is every month you get a letter in the mail from a kid you're helping yeah i
used to donate to that chair when i was a kid it's
yeah and my family did it as well for a while and i don't think they're that
efficient and in fact i'm a little afraid to look
how wasteful they are but i know that at least some of the money they do they
give does good and by giving people that dopamine
hit every month and they know they can expect it
it helps that charity carry forward i think that if
you created like a stock portfolio of charities
where you donated 10 percent and then every month you were like hey
here's the little kid who this month your money went to go buy them a net over
their bed and next month here is a little kid
in a different part of the world who has clean drinking water today because of
your like percentage contribution
uh let's move on to the next one oh wait you look at your head thought
no i think that's about it i mean the just it i guess we we kind of talked
around a lot of the stuff but the main the the post talks about this is scope
and sensitivity and here's like that's that's not the
way that it should work that's it's really straightforward short post
yeah uh elias or even ends it at the end with the moral of the story
is if you want to be an effective altruist you have to think it through
with the part of your brain that processes those unexciting inky zeros
on paper not just the part that gets really worked up about that poor
struggling oil soaked bird which is yeah being effective is about math yep
all right i guess what i was talking about is more like the next post
the next post is one life against the world
such a cool dramatic sounding name yeah whoever saves a single life
it is as if he has saved the whole world the tall mood
sanhedrin four five um i think the main the main point of this
post is uh if the world really is bigger than one person
so even though it feels like saving the world if you save one person
you should generally choose the world above the one person if you're ever
given that choice yeah something that makes me mad and a
lot of media is like we as a culture think that it is
morally good to when like your your character your
protagonist has to choose between his love interest
and the world and they're like i'm gonna save the love interest and we're
like oh how romantic and i'm like bad utilitarian so as
much as i loved uh avengers um what was the first one not the
last one infinity war infinity as much as i loved
avengers infinity war i was so fucking pissed when everyone was like
you know what we're gonna protect vision no matter what
you know you can't have this stone or we're not gonna take a stone out and
crush it you know and it's like literally half of all
intelligent life in the universe versus this one guy that the people like a
lot a lot of bad utilitarianism went on in that
movie absolutely oh yeah there was that was not even the only case there were
several cases of people being like the entire fucking world
or this one guy i think it wasn't even the world it was like the universe right
right yes or that universe to be fair to the avengers so like another good
example of this would be in the first product man movie with hobie maguire
when groblin's got the cart full of kids and uh mary jane hanging from the
bridge and he ends up saving both but he jumps up to her first
like the the protagonists aren't supposed to be utilitarian monsters right
they're supposed to be people like they're supposed to be people with like
human goals and feelings and so granted but at some point you draw the line
they do and well at some point they did an infinity war right they they decided
hey you know what if if things get if we start like they had no idea
how much time they had it could have been days
and so when they went to go you know get the stone out safely which is a good
option if you think you might have days and it might take a couple hours to get
the stone out whatever that's true it turned out they got ambushed right away
so when that happened like all right it's time to fucking kill them and they
didn't they didn't you know she helped she the the person who could do it
held off for all of the eight seconds they took to agonizingly stare at the
person she loved before she blew his brains out right so okay like
they did do it okay so that you know but but point taken
yeah i mean frankly so this could you imagine how bad the movie would have
been if the second they got this news and they believed it you like cap just
turned to vision and smashed him in the face with a shield and like tried to kill
him like that's that's a good point so they have to
it would have been better if vision looked at him and he's like
you know what you need to do and bash his own
i think actually i don't know if i'm remembering this correctly but i'm
pretty sure vision himself was like no you should do it and and the rest of the
team were like no man we don't we don't give up our own that is accurate they
like no really lives was there yeah we don't trade lives he's like and then
of course there's no point out the hypocrisy like captain didn't you down a
ship that you know to save everybody else and it's like
fuck off ish and just pg-13 so he didn't say that but his eyes did so
there's also a thing with uh i think more to the
people on the right that uh if if if someone has if someone is a couple
then and they have children the mother shouldn't be put in danger and i saw
this in some books i've read where both couples had
superpowers and the author made the mother stay
home rather than help find the world ending threat but i also saw this in
response to avengers endgame where someone made like that
super weird racist misogynist cut or something
that just cut out all the women from the movie or whatever and i didn't hear
about this the comment was that pepper pots should not be on the front lines
fighting Thanos because if uh iron man die if
what's iron man's character's name tony stark if tony stark dies
and pepper dies that child is now an orphan and i was like i don't think they
had a kid but i get what you're saying they didn't have a kid in the last
they did oh and you know the the point is that if
pepper can change the odds of them winning by even a minuscule fraction
she should be in that fight because that kid isn't going to live anyway if they
lose yeah that's i feel like when you're fighting an existential
threat like that you don't you don't bother with that kind of
yeah you can stay at home and hug your kid right up until you're killed or you
can go out and try and fight yeah yeah i can't imagine who would be trying to
make that reverse argument in good faith and i mean sure both of them might die
and the rest of the team might save the world and it turned out she wasn't
needed there and the kid could have still had a mom but you know what you don't
take that kind of risk with the entire universe on the line and she might have
helped i mean you know there wasn't much help a little bit yeah exactly i mean
she definitely did but like we don't know how much tide she turned because you
weren't able to see everything going on at the same time but like yeah if she
held things off for one more second that's the second that we needed to win
so yeah that's weird yeah even if she didn't help
it was still a better decision to put her on the battlefield than to keep her
off on the sidelines absolutely yeah she was useful okay sorry we got way off
track yeah i'll always indulge in it i mean that was actually on topic uh we're
talking about the saving one person still for once the adventures are relevant
yeah that said i saw the new spiderman movie last night it was a lot of fun
subverted my expectations twice which was really cool cool so
it was like homecoming like the same kind of vibe
but it was a lot of fun so if you if you like superhero movies i give it my
thumbs up but that's not a surprise just side too i liked it more than homecoming
because uh just for me personally uh i don't like high school dramas
i think it's the target market uh i think they do a great job with okay like
here's the high school vibe peter parker is the high school kid and we're gonna
have stories that are about crushes and school i hate all that i hated high
school this one has much less of that going on
and much more superhero stuff so i was into it i will say this post is the
first one where i discovered that eliezer is absolutely against
mind-altering substances and drugs those sorts of things
where he says that uh the the experience of making a new scientific
discovery is my best reference for what it might feel like to do drugs and i
thought that was an interesting fact about him and later when i met him at a
world con several years later i found out that he doesn't even drink
he's i think i had half a glass of wine once in his life
i wonder if he's changed his opinions on that regarding uh first of all no
tropics and uh and psychedelics actually having a
interesting therapeutic and cognitive enhancing potential
i don't know i know i saw a q and a with him a few years ago
and it was he had said he doesn't do any of that stuff mainly because he's
worried about fucking with his brain chemistry personally i don't think he
advocates not using it um i haven't heard to make make a positive
that's cowardly well it is but it but it is like the evidence is strongly
against him at this point millions of people have done it and nobody has
been i think the percentage of people who've
done it intelligently and safely i think his concern is that he he has an
atypical brain that he's worried about screwing with and like if it's
currently working for him you know if it ain't broke don't fix it
right or if it ain't broke don't fuck with it
yeah yeah i think that that is completely within someone's rights to
choose and i respect their decision absolutely i also think that
i'm gonna reduce my judgment from cowardly to overly cautious in my
opinion but i do get where he's coming from well i think if you're one of the
like 50 people in the world working on what you think is the most
important problem for the human species you might want to take a little extra
care with your brain which i totally understand
um i what do you guys think like i think i don't know what the high of making a
new scientific discovery is like it's probably not the same as a drug
high like i'm not sure they're even comparable
but i also think the new scientific uh i know what this feeling is like
okay or at least i have had a mini taste of
it um so i don't know if i mentioned this to
you guys a while ago but i found this little buddhist
palm manual of non-newtonian calculus oh yes
and did but i think this may be an entire episode
yeah but the main point was i have been going through the process of deciphering
this weird abstract form of math and finding new applications for it
and at least one of them was completely novel like i've checked
every academic source i could in multiple languages
i think i have a completely unique math paper
and i have done a lot of drugs in my life and i can tell you
it is a comparable high and the math one is better because it's not just a
fleeting high it's like a warm feeling of satisfaction
that's growing more and more as i polish my work and work on my paper
i was going to say that i think that even if the drug one might be better
for like a few minutes like the drug thing goes away whereas
an accomplishment like that you have for the rest of your life
and maybe i haven't tried the right drugs but yeah i've tried like
you it's it's apples and oranges like i mean i guess because i'm always aware
that i've taken a drug and that's why i feel this way
um if i've done something nice for somebody and it's made you know made
them if if it's changed somebody's life and or you know if i figured something
out i've had small versions of both of those things not like an
innovative scientific discovery but for me that's why like programming when i
figure shit out i get that rush so it's a very small version of it because other
people can do it but when i do it originally it feels nice
um but the uh like with drug stuff it's like oh man i feel
crazy right now this is fun um like it's i mean you might as
well be comparing you know two other completely unrelated
things this is just like you know listening to a good song how does that
compare to like the joy of a scientific discovery it's like it doesn't
they're different they're completely different sensations for me yeah yeah i
don't even like i don't know i'm not gonna say i don't like
recreational drugs some of them are all right but i'm much more
interested in midafinil uh or cognitive enhancing drugs
nitropics and even psychedelics are interesting for me because it helps me
understand my own brain i think i mean i like mdma is the
drug i was comparing it to and that's just like a flood of happy chemicals
yeah based on the end based on the context of the post i was assuming that
he meant like recreational make you feel good and or happy
and i was thinking i think mdma too but like i still like i'm on it and it
felt great but like i knew like that you know it it
it wasn't like i like if you're it wasn't like i thought this feeling was
fake because the feeling is real it's as real as any feeling you can have because
it's your actual brain um but it's like i knew it wasn't
tethered to i we're kind of aside but yeah yeah
all right so back to the post then uh he says that it probably seems obvious to
almost everyone that yes the entire world is worth more than one life
but uh it might not be entirely that obvious to everyone
for example people who follow the greek greek conception of personal virtue
which uh rather than consequentialism which i feel slightly called out on not
because i'm a greek but because i am the virtue ethicist
he says uh someone who saves the world is virtuous uh because they are
fulfilling their duty to save life which is a virtue
but they're not six billion times more virtuous than someone who only saved one
life because they were also fulfilling that duty
they're certainly more virtuous if they save the whole world but not
six billion times more um and perhaps another way of of not
grasping this would be that uh the value of one human life is too great to
comprehend anyway so like a human just couldn't
comprehend it and it's like a scope in sense
insensitivity thing if one life is so immensely valuable
already how can you even think about you know saving the entire world
um and he points out that uh yes he agrees one life is of unimaginably high
value but that two human lives are twice as unimaginably unimaginably
valuable so um please save the entire world
if you have to uh you know if you manage to dedicate all of its resources
towards you know curing um whatever puppy disease or ALS
like he's he's saying yes that's like that's good
you can't say it's not good but like it is if we're gonna
if we need to we need to fix the most important thing and to him
you know it's obviously uh friendly AI research right
and he's probably right um certainly like
you know even like curing prostate or like whatever curing prostate cancer
breast cancer like great both good things but curing death
is a bigger is a bigger win and so like this is just
I think a of like the point of the post I guess
is almost to it's like if it was as simple as like what's
like written there it'd be like one sentence right I think the point is the
subtext of like no there's actually big problems that we need to actually solve
the really really really big problems that's that's how I read it
and he does say that if two deaf children are sleeping on railroad tracks
and uh someone screams at you to go save them if you run up
save one and uh then just kind of leave the other one there hang out have a
cigarette and I'm screaming quick go save the
second one too and uh Eleazar says eh I I already
saved one so I'm unimaginably ahead on points
because one life is unimaginably valuable I don't need to do another
unimaginably good deed and uh that that just does not seem
right at all plus you'd lose points for not saving the
second that's so weird what what's so weird
like
that doesn't even make sense by the definition of that worldview I don't
know if like isn't the goal isn't the goal to save an
unimaginably huge amount of good things you already did that when you saved one
because it's unimaginably valuable
so yeah it's also a fun like intuition pump for
like taboo trade-offs yeah right like I'm not going to bake up my hospital
buy one liver to save this little girl um because like we need to keep the
hospital running so I hate this can before we
continue by the way I was gonna say that one thing
I dislike about these posts is Julia Galef once said that
rationalists
try and work hard to get rid of the word should
from our vocabulary because it distracts from the reality that is there
and the reality that is there humans are sensitive to faces and
individuals so if we know that humans are scope
insensitive instead of saying humans should be changed into
beings who don't have this scope insensitivity
let's accept it as a fact of human nature until we can genetically modify
ourselves and work on creating tools that work
around it like people pictures and stuff like what
effective altruism and using those very mental biases to encourage us
in more intelligent donations this this post
does have a last paragraph here which I have issues with and
originally I wanted to not talk about it at all because I considered a memetic
hazard but then I figured one that would be cowardly
and two people who read this post are going to see it anyway so
I'm going to say right now that this next section of our podcast is a memetic
hazard you should probably avoid it if you
already have problems with guilt and super high scrupulosity
is that how you pronounce it okay uh because this will be
bad for you so um scrupulosity yeah feeling very responsible for everything
oh I call that heroic responsibility well this is more of a the bad version of
that thing yes this is also in my in in my head it's
always been a bad version too but I totally get it yeah okay I just thought
of her responsibility as a good thing method of rationality kind of give it a
great spin yeah but the way that I've had a complex
like that I've gotten over it I guess partly mainly it's by stopping caring
I guess about stuff I guess so I'll call it scrupulous scrupulosity
scrupulosity from now on so all right yeah so this next part um again
probably uh bad for people's emotional well-beings
and I would skip forward by about five minutes
uh if if you are in that but going forward
um he points out that combining scope insensitive
insensitivity the last post with uh this one uh if you were the guy who had the
two children on the train tracks and you only saved one and didn't save the
other one as if you could have uh not not only did you not save that
it's not you're not the person who saved one life you are the person who killed
one life when you could have because you could have saved the other one
so uh you have damned yourself he says you have damned yourself as thoroughly
as any murderer uh which he puts at the end of a sentence
at the end of a paragraph saying that
basically talking about donating money to curing fatal diseases right
um he says when human lives are at stake we have a duty
to maximize not satisfies and this duty has the same strength as the original
duty to save lives
so basically if you have any money left over after you're done providing for
your own uh continued existence all of it
should go to save other people is how I have interpreted these sorts of things
before and that really leads to a horrible life very quickly
yeah he also mentions that you should be disdained for uh
spending your life saving money inefficiently it's yeah so it'd be well
well wait wait I have a question does Elias or Yudkowski know anything about
mental health and like maybe people needing things like little luxuries to
keep themselves sane instead of just becoming
robots to give money to other people I think this is a common criticism
yes and it's like I think the I mean I imagine well maybe he
doesn't drink coffee but I imagine Elias here spends some of his time
like I mean he does in fact this was actually something I remember him being
called out for in the comments when he mentioned they had a girlfriend and
it's like what do you mean you hang out with your girlfriend aren't you like
busy saving the world how can you justify spending three hours
watching a movie when the you know those three hours could bring you know the
end of you know human death forward by five seconds right
hundred people to just kill aliizer yeah so like I think I don't remember
actually I remember his response to that it was
like grossly inadequate it was like you know those like quotes where like you're
not like typing it's like quote like shows girlfriends comments yeah they're
being super mean aren't they I wonder if he I'm sure there's more
rebuttal to that somewhere else in deeper comments somewhere in later posts but
like yeah people need to live and be happy
some people like will mcaskill does this he lives on I think like 37 000 pounds a
year and the rest he gets yeah and the rest he
gives to charity this is where the same Peter singers argument
with the drowning child is basically the same thing right
if you see a child drowning you should sacrifice your two thousand dollar suit
to wade into that river and save it uh which is true but
he uses that again to lead people to why are you not donating all your money you
don't need a two thousand dollar suit buy a hundred dollar suit and spend that
extra money saving dying people yeah and I mean
but that that ignores time I mean like if I have to dive in to a hundred lakes
and save a hundred kids I'm gonna drown I'm gonna be too tired
like the goal is not to just burn yourself out
and anyone who is encouraging you to give to the point of burning out or any
mentality that says that is shallow and selfish
it's short-sighted we should be like smarter than that
we should say give as much as you can so that it is sustainable and that you can
live your life the longest and healthiest way possible
because that's the way you actually maximum David said it here first that
will mcaskill selfish and uh short-sighted I'll fight him we've talked about this
I'll fight him before the prior episode I think we spent an entire episode on it
at one point uh where this just doesn't work very well with humans
especially when we draw these things out to their
quote unquote logical conclusions so it's the logical conclusion like an
economic argument is the logical conclusion of something right but it's
not taking into into account like how people work and so like Peter Singer's
essay that you know the feminine affluence and morality won in what 1975 or
six that had the little drowning kid in the pond
parable was was all about that right so like the key like at some point and
like he's not even necessarily saying you should do this um like at least not
straight up about like buying a cup of coffee but like the coffee you buy
could have gone to something way more important than the coffee for you
but I think it was it was it slate star codex I must have been where it's like
you know look if you give five percent if you give one percent
but if you do anything you're doing better than almost everybody yes yes
and so like you don't have to worry about being perfect just do good if you
want to slate star codex post about ten percent is one of the best posts I
know of for for making life livable for people who care
about others yeah and for me it's just the switch like you know I eat a
um I try to eat a somewhat ethical diet I eat meat
fairly commonly but not as commonly as money many people
um but like there's still less animals dying from my diet than there used to be
and so like I'm not it's not so much about like I can never touch chicken
because you know ever if this was ever produced in a factory that was near
chickens like I'm not going to take it to some like to that kind of like religious
level of commitment but it's like no I'm I'm doing better like the world's a
better place than it was if I was doing the normal thing but I cut off just a
minute ago I was just excited to get going sorry
I forget what I was gonna say shoot I'm sorry sorry so I basically agree with
the concrete example that if you can save two children from the train and you
only save one and then walk away you're basically murdering the other one
and I also agree with the fact that if you're giving a thousand dollars to a
charity to make people have shoes uh you should probably feel bad about that
because who giving people shoes isn't really that big a deal when there's
people dying spend the thousand dollars in a more efficient manner please this
really does matter to a lot of people uh but I think there definitely needs to be
a line drawn at the place that makes life still livable for people following
your philosophy and I feel like Elias are absolutely failed to draw that line and
make that distinction in this post also I think this forgets something really
important which is the reason life is livable is not just that we have our
base needs met but the fact that there are things that are beautiful in our
lives that give them that sense of meaning and if you are living a life
where every single resource you have that isn't going towards your survival is
going towards other people you are denying yourself the very thing that
makes life living livable for other humans it's not just like negative it's
like actively punishing yourself okay and I said we only listeners only have to
skip ahead for five minutes we should probably cut it off there that sounds
good okay unless did it come back to Jess I'm really sorry I was no I I'd
sorry all right yeah we need to cut this off yep no no user by the way this user
feedback no listener feedback this time because we have run out of time but we
never don't have time to thank our our guest absolutely do you want to thank
him this time yep dibs on thinking uh Lydia Marie big shout out thank you so
much for your support I like that maybe we'll leave that in instead of putting
in the sound effect thanks David just this one time so yeah cool yeah once
again your support means a lot to us as does everyone who listens and does
anything you find us on iTunes do all those usual things and you know that's
about it you help keep us going we we do the payout to the three of us every
six months and we are just in the process of doing it right now so this is
particularly relevant to us right now and we all feel really happy that we have
a little bit more money in our bank accounts to buy coffees and or safe
children so thank you very much for that Lydia and everyone else who who helps
yeah and thank you to people who comment and who go on the subreddit that's also
helpful and uh I mean we are talking about a subject that was brought up on
the reddit today so that's right helps us to come up with topics yeah we've got
the the vision conspiracy subreddit uh to make this phone call we started a
discord server so that will be there'll be link to that in the show notes I think
for yeah we'll have a discord server people can get on there and chat if you
guys feel like it let's do it a little more live than this there's a and I just
learned today that there's a way like just sit on the like in a voice chat of it so
there's good chance I'll be hanging out there at some point you know people want
to get on a chat I work human hours usually but yeah something to look at
there so the permanent link for the discord chat will be in the description so come talk to us
I'm actually on discord yeah regularly on like um reddit
I'm not on discord that much but you can talk to Jess and Steven
neither am I but I will be so all right cool then that's that for this episode
and for next episode our two posts will be uh risk free bonds aren't and corresponding spias
all right awesome all right David thanks again man always great talking to you
thanks I'll be back soon back peace out everyone see you bye bye
you
