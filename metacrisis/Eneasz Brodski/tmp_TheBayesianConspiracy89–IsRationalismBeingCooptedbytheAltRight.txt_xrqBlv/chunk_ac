show does right so you know even if we were to then you
know plus i don't want to have to listen to the show listen to the ben Shapiro
show yeah only to say like oh he was wrong about these
things um i guess if something comes across my
my feed and then there's an opportunity for me to do something i'll say
something but right i think the people we hang out with
don't generally quote ben Shapiro yeah i think the people that we hang out with
generally aren't the kind of people that are going to go pick fights on the
internet like and maybe that's part of the problem
and the reason we're not doing this there's i think like the goals of a lot
of rationalists are not build a bigger political
presence and convert people not saying whether they should or shouldn't be but
people are more concerned with effective altruism and
trying to align ai and trying to get like effective self-help and you know
whatever our topics of interest are so i have a former partner who's a satanist
and the thing is the vast majority of americans when they hear satanist
they think you know worships the devil possibly does black
blood sacrifices things like that right definitely eats babies definitely eats
babies yeah that's like number one rule for being a satanist might be a lesbian
but you know it's just this group a small group in denver with you know
they're a chapter of an overall national organization more or less sort of
of people who get together do some fun ritual stuff
are generally pretty left-leaning pretty open pretty poly
and just really enjoy making fun of the catholic church right
almost all of them are atheist or agnostic or
at any point there was no literal worshiping of the devil as they don't
actually believe in him as a as a person
and they're like yeah i mean we're satanists that's our name now
and the people who like know them and care to find out
can find this out and the rest of the world are just like oh
evil satan worship person like yeah whatever blow me we don't care
i've got a this is a side point but i now i can't help but think of the question
if somebody showed up at the church doors of the church of satan
and seemed in all earnest all all earnestness to be presenting an honest
belief in satan as the one true savior and they weren't like trolling like
the organization is like gold to do yeah
how do they handle that somebody shows up and they're like i believe satan and
like they're not budging and they're like and i brought my bag of dead babies
i'm pretty sure that's never happened in the history of the world that's cool
people don't generally worship the evil deity
there's all kinds of crazy people in the world that's true but they probably
wouldn't show up at the satanist church anyway they would have like the
they'll have their own cool satanist church with blackjack and hookers and
dead and dead babies right well they'd probably have a basement with a cooler
and bodies in it and he and eventually end up in jail
i shit okay so enias yes and so i'm not saying that the way they do things is
right but on the other hand i kind of admire the whole
not giving a fuck that other people don't know shit about us thing
but yes to my thing but here's the thing they actually
do go out into the public when it's important for example
satanic temple oh i love those guys sued arkansas simple
sued arkansas city because they had a copy of the ten commandments
and they were like we're gonna put in a baphomet statue
our thing is the separation of church and state
even though any individual chapter is small and most of the time all we do is
hang out when we see someone clearly violating this
we are going to go into the public sphere and we're not afraid to attract
that attention like we should have a similar kind of conviction
i agree like i think and i think that's totally within our power as a
community and you know what they won they ended up
having to put a statue of satan in front of arkansas city state house
right next to the ten commandments absolutely bananas it's like a statue
of baphomet like patting the child's head yeah yeah
yeah it looks so cute they ended up just taking both of them down
yeah and they won like they and why are we not just as persistent well for
starters we don't have any sort of organization
we right now are just a bunch of people who hang out on forums and sometimes
have meetups i think that's people that are working at
miri yeah i don't know do you think we should
i kind of have been thinking we should organize for a long time but on the
other hand who wants to do that fucking work man
yeah they're pros and cons of organization and um also i think the
type of people that you need to be management oriented people
are hard to come by in our group
i'm i'll do it like i'm not even joking david for dark lord
it's kind of been my it's kind of been my goal for a while
and i enjoy social communication the only reason i haven't tried is because
this community is some of the smartest most
motivated people i've ever met and i don't feel like i'm
quite there yet let me finish my degree but
one year and i am willing to do that legwork
i just don't want to do it if i think that no one is gonna care and no one's
gonna like want to join i'm in the bay area
raymond arnold had put out a call asking if anyone is actually genuinely
interested in doing community building stuff reach out to me and come talk
i'm not sure exactly what he's got in mind or whether they're just kind of
trying to develop plans and assign people rules right now i'm also super
interested in that but uh i'm not like out of place in my life where i could go
i know we do that i know we've mentioned this at least once before and
steven was really against it but um i don't think it would be a bad
idea to incorporate like as a religious organization under
us law i'm probably less against that now than i was
i mean i i do feel like well i guess i get i don't remember my previous
stance on this but i i mean thinking about it i never see that working we'll
never get the big names in i don't think i can't imagine
elizabeth kowski being on board with this right i mean
many people who find rationality found it uh you know it would have to have some
kind of tongue-in-cheek name yeah but it would be like as part of their
religion right and so like i i mean i
i guess you know you're saying similar to the church of satan
yes and i mean i guess i like what they do i don't see myself attending but
mainly just because i don't think that i'd have fun but i like that they do
stuff um i mean no one could stop you from
making well i guess you have to you have a little bit of legwork but i mean if
the 20 of us to come to meetups here in denver want to make a church out of it
we can right um i'm not sure what it costs not that much
no so uh i and well maybe a church maybe a church
isn't the best form of organization like i think we
mentioned once the idea of like a guild of rationalists which i like the turn of
phrase there oh i would love to have a guild
but i do think the idea of a more structured
group that can like successfully support franchises like i know how
frustrating it is to be a rationalist in a super small community with
literally only one other person to talk to about it
and it would have been amazing for me if there was a group out there i could have
reached out to you that would have been like here's the handbook
you don't have anyone like to go here's like your first few meetings got set up
for you and yeah we there's always someone to contact
those would be immensely valuable at helping someone who
is even less social than me at getting one started
like my goal is to make it so easy to start a chapter
of like a discussion group about rationality that
almost every town of over 2000 people has at least five
well i mean it is already that easy you just create a group on a
meetups and then you try to meet up the problem is getting enough interest in a
small community to get those people yeah the problem is the getting the person
who's going to organize the group and do all the logistics which uh
not a lot of people have those skills especially i think in this group people
tend to be more introverted um and involved in their own
kinds of projects it's often a concern with making money
and that doesn't you know well i mean steven and me
and that and it's just awkward yeah before like most people don't have the
social skills to run their first meeting when they've never won one before
having like a plan just for your first like five or six meetings as a group
would be really really useful i think there are guides like that online
um like unless wrong and on somewhere else it was uh it may have been the
might have been slay start codex actually might have been slay start codex
might have been i remember um scott was encouraging people to start slay start
codex meetups nice and had i think a post that would
explained the steps i don't remember back when i was
when i was getting this one trying to get this one well when we were getting
this one going it was i looked up some of this stuff and it might have been the
columbus rationality group who put out some sort of you know no i think it was
on the community i whatever it was there was something like this but the fact
that i can't remember you know then therefore easily find it again probably
means that it needs to be more prominent what were you gonna say though inyash
well i was gonna say that when steven and me started the denver group uh we
spent a number of months like three or four months at least
just like going to a place and the two of us hanging out for like an hour and a
half and then going home again because just no one came
it's not a thing that our type of people generally go out to it
we were basically on the verge of giving up i think we skipped a couple months
and then uh hpm noir wrapped up and ellie aser said hey anybody who
wants to have a thing do it on pie day this year
the last chapter is coming out that day and everybody meets up and we can just
kind of like have fun and celebrate and at that point we said okay we're doing
this at darcy's and i think 25 people showed up it was
ridiculous i thought maybe we'd get five based on how before we had zero aside
from steven and me and we just had to keep adding tables and chairs and having
that one spark to start things off is how the denver
denver group got going and i don't know how you could recreate that
there needs to be some sort of central clearing house area where people that
are interested in this sort of thing can go and see like ah okay here's where
the group is meeting and and maybe once a year this is our
official new people come and be welcome
thing a lot of sounds like we should have a rationalist holiday
yes we have solstice everyone has solstice though
that is good petrov but yeah that is good has
pagan and wiccan connotations and influences and nothing against those
communities god knows they're awesome and i enjoy being a part of them and
communicating with them but maybe like when was thomas's
bae's birthday or his death day well i'd like pi day
like it would be great every rationalist in the world had like an event that day
and maybe volunteered at schools or something like
did something to help the community and make it a little bit more rational and
then went out and celebrated we could get that off the ground before the next
petrov day on a small level possibly yeah i mean
at least i could take the day off and you know go find support to talk
yeah i could probably um have an event at a library like the republic library
yeah i mean if it's our religion it's a religious holiday and they can't stop
us from taking a day off god bless america we still got incorporated as a
religion first yeah that's like what 500 bucks
i actually don't know there's a couple other groups to jump through you've got
to like have and it depends on the problem
sure it varies state by state but some of the base ones like you need to have
some tenants which we have but you need to have i mean well we possibly have if
we're going to say our religion we're not but if we're going to say that fine
um i think you need to have a place of sacredness
whether it's and maybe sacred is even too loaded of a word but there it has to
be a location that people congregate at and it can't be the common room i'm
assuming of an apartment complex at least not without their endorsement
right um so you know i guess i doubt you know a restaurant would let you use
their back room as your as your church spot i do think we're getting no it
should be outside i do think we're getting a bit
far afield of the original why are right-wing people creeping into
rationality and co-op can we do about it topic yeah
we we sorry we went off the tangent and i like this tangent and we will have to
pursue this tension someday this is probably not a thing we're going to
hammer out on one podcast episode you're correct
i feel like that conversation is one that we should rope um matt freeman into
