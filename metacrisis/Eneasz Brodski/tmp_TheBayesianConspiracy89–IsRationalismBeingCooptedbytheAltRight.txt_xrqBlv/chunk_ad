also yeah i agree
um so we can fulfill our math i guess so i had a list of questions we already
went through most of them so do you guys think this is a problem
if it is do you think this is our battle the third problem was
can we coordinate and then the last one is what we should do
i and i do think it's a little bit of a problem i mean like
not without incident i pulled their reply to your
to your initial post uh said that i think the rational community has some
specific properties that make it attractive to the right
generally uh it's not just the general diffusion of a successful set of ideas
let me skip down a little bit
so the properties first the community is very against perceived censorship
and pro absolute tolerance which i think is true right
yeah uh and not without incident says i believe this will always drag a
community to the right which i don't think is true at all
actually the absolute tolerance thing i think is taking it a bit far
i think that we're a community that will listen to your ideas and won't censor
you yeah and like you know i think we're absolute free
speech but also like i think that if somebody is at a
rationalist meet up harassing people insisting that like
blacks are inferior and they're not listening to any of the arguments that
you're saying why do you have any of these other races in your media
would kick that person out for for harassing people and you know
derailing whatever conversation you're trying to have i could even imagine
you know sitting down for half an hour with somebody who's spouting some
egregious bullshit and you have a long conversation with them and at the end
per you know the rap of horrors rules of good discourse you're able to repeat
their argument in a way that they totally agree with
so i really understand you mean this this and this they're like yeah absolutely
like cool i think that's a fucking stupid idea
don't come back right well at the very least you know let's
let's talk about why i think it's stupid so like tolerance would be like okay
well that's your opinion whereas yeah cool now that i fully understood your
position now i feel fully qualified to say you're in it that's not necessarily
that you're an idiot but that's a really stupid belief i do think those are good
qualities of the rationalist community though willing to engage with any idea
at least once that's why i brought it up is that it was that that's
distinct from tolerance yeah it's just a it's a willingness to listen to good
faith arguments yeah i don't think that'll necessarily
drag a community to the right though unless a community is already to the
left of the truth whereas if a community is to the right of the truth
that such a thing would drag them to the left right
i disagree the argument that leftists give against liberals is very similar
when you have free speech and you encourage it
like alt-right nazis aren't gonna come out and say that they're alt-right nazis
unless they're real idiots they're going to use every dirty trick of
conversation every tactical error and allowing
them to do this gives them more opportunities to spread their propaganda
if they come up with new arguments that's one thing
but every time you allow one of them to rehash an old argument that has been
settled about race science or crime or statistics like
that you're giving them another opportunity to infect the audience
if it's a private conversation between two people that's one thing but that's
almost never the case anymore yeah but that kind of person you're
describing sounds like somebody who would get banned from the less wrong
comment field or the slight star codex open thread
there is actually a policy at least in most i think rationalist fears of okay
we've heard this argument you're not listening to anybody who's arguing
back at you this is not a good faith
conversation so you know like strike one and then like oh they're doing it again
strike two strike through your band i see this happen all the time
and that's true and i actually think that's one of the strengths of the
community but we don't show that part of us banning
people that often what people know is that you can do
like you can take refuge in our community as long as you don't say
anything too egregious and you never cross certain boundaries
verbally regardless of what your beliefs very clearly imply
um that was one of the that was something that like the partner i was
having an argument with had said like based on me reading the slight star
comics slight star comics slight star codex comments field i
see people making all kinds of like horrible things
no one should have read the comments on anything ever yeah first of all the
comments section are not representative of the community i mean isn't that the
rule for the entire internet never read the comments
yeah that was actually very responsive so keep it you read the comments now
actually i like the comments and sleister could extend to be pretty
high quality but occasionally yeah you do get trolls and assholes and
usually they get dealt with either by people ignoring them uh people
arguing with them uh or eventually them being banned if they're
refused to engage in good faith conversation i feel like yeah
so did you get sorry i'm sorry go on jess i was interrupting um i think i
want to agree with what you're what i think you were saying
where it would be nice if kind of as a community we could agree on a set of
norms where this is if you want to be a
member of the rationalist community exist in a rationalist space either a
physical meetup or a comments thread this is the way we will deal with you
you're welcome to join your you can say whatever you want um but you have to be
willing to engage in good faith arguments and if you troll or if you refuse to
change your mind and just keep saying the same something over and over again
then we will ask you to leave well you can refuse to change your mind
no one is required to have certain beliefs
i don't i think if you're unwilling to update based on evidence then you're
not a Bayesian rationalist yeah and you don't belong in the group i think you
guys are talking about different kinds of things like we could have a very
serious disagreement about like how we want to like you know work and how
much we want to donate to charity or something but like
you know if you're if you're coming to you know a local meetup or less wrong
dot com and you're insisting on being a flat
earth or then like we're not like if you if you're not getting over your
flat earth ism you're not getting the point of what we're doing here
i think the only real line for me i i disagree the way you should deal with
that is you talk with this flat earth or if they
claim to be a rationalist and be like let us let reality decide between us
between the two of us or as a group let's feel like let's figure out an
experiment that you can trust and let's do it
or find someone who has done it and see the results
and if you don't update after that that's more suspicious
yeah that's basically what i was what i meant i guess
i mean like i i i like the idea of actually doing the experiment
um but i think that it's also an unnecessary step because we there's
mountains of evidence for you know evolution happened
um like in general i don't think it's not flat humans humans don't update
immediately it's a it's a process and it takes time but
more importantly i don't think that we should require anyone to
necessarily update in in a in any certain direction just to be around us
i think the only really bright line i would draw is
anyone who's trying to invalidate someone else's humanity
or or imply that someone else's humanity should be invalid like someone who is
disabled or someone who is a different color or anything
like that uh that would be the line where i'm like i'm
sorry i'm i'm not even going to tolerate you being around
yeah i absolutely agree with that but i everyone has a right to live and to
flourish every human does but i also think that
i don't know i don't think that people belong in the rationalist community if
they're not going to update their beliefs based on facts
like that's the core tenet of what it is to be a rationalist
yeah i mean yeah you have to make your map more accurate for all the crazy
things i've said about magic and wizardry and all that nonsense
i consider myself a rationalist because every day i think at least a little bit
about what can i do to make my next day better by predicting it and
changing stuff based on what i learned that's it
if you don't do that i don't know why you're even involved yeah i agree that
is a core requirement just that i don't think anyone should
have a say on what the actual truth that people should update towards is
like there's some things that are patently obvious like you know the
shape of the earth but uh i'm still uncomfortable with
saying you aren't updating in the right direction
therefore you aren't a rationalist like if someone is actually trying
yeah no um if they're trying then like it could be that's called doing a good
faith argument um the thing that i'm saying is or the
scenario i'm imagining is someone joining the group and
very insistently trying to argue whatever they're whatever their talking
point is that 9-11 wasn't inside job or god
the proletariat needs to rise up well i mean that's something we could all
actually have an interesting conversation about
but like somebody that has a a fallacious belief about stuff
say uh
chinese people are more violent uh or i don't know i'm trying to think of
something are you saying they aren't more violent their kung fu skills are
too great right so you're trying to pick something
less obviously absurd than flat earth is i mean well i'm trying to pick something
that's not like an actual position that's going to like poke
somebody sure well like what if it was something pointless like
like asian people um live longer or something like that's an empirical
question yeah right and so if if i believed that
they did and i have no idea if they do or not they do
they do well it's actually uh that's complicated but gone
it probably depends if you live in hong kong or not right um like if you're
living a high pollution area i'll mention your life expectancy oh yeah
yeah anyway the so like whatever whatever my
belief was you know you can make it specific enough
and then like all right cool let's go look and like we're not going to follow
people around we're not going to follow around 10 000 people and see how long
until they die we can just look at the statistics of you know
mortality rate by air or whatever life expectancy by area you can also look at
genetics uh a lot of asian people have a fax
o3 or o8 i forget gene that is correlated with longevity
that you could do that too um but then you know i guess
i guess not really sure i see what you guys are talking about like
do we kick people out based on i think it's pretty easy to spot if somebody's
not making good faith effort and like if i came to you and i was like no no i
insist they actually you know all the numbers you see online are fake
this gene's not real um you know they the census data is all made up they all
actually die at like 60 you've never met a person
you know that's chinese over 60 but they're just lying like
if i if i'm coming to you with those many caveats as like to why my
my belief must be true um now i'm pretending like that they live
less or something or shorter um it i think it's it you can spot that coming
right and like i guess i i to teeny i was just concerned
of like whether or not you're giving them you know
whether or not they might be right we want to update in their direction
sometimes you can just tell and like that's a very dangerous thing to say and
like to hold on to because you can just use that justify you know fully
justify anything and sometimes they're like they have an argument that's a
popular argument that we know is wrong like a
acupuncture works or uh andrew wigfield was right and vaccines cause autism if
somebody came into the group i mean we've all been over this a million
times if they start saying vaccines cause autism
and they have as ammo the same bullshit arguments that we've heard a million
times before then you know and that person is unwilling to
actually be like here is the evidence against this
yeah and i'm torn on how to handle that i don't want that person to be in the
group i've seen arguments go it's like well have you
read the sequences and it's like i'm not going to go off and read a million
words of stuff and then come back to you in eight months
and let you know if i still agree with you or not like can we hash it out now
and so like i don't know my answer is always
my answer is always your beliefs have to pay rent
if you don't trust vaccines you don't trust the rest of modern medicine which
is based on it so have you decided to never go to a doctor
