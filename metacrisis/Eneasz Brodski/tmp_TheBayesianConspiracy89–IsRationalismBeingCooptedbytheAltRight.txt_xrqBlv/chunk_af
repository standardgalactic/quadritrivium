steven slowly just closing the curtain
this kind of got a fun quality to watching it like watching a fire you
know let's go back out well even slowly opening the curtain
no um oh gosh okay nature back to the topic
so you wanted to call us bayesian rationalists yeah well i mean i have been
for quite a while when i introduce when people ask me about like my beliefs and
stuff i said i'm a bayesian rationalist because just saying rationalist is
i have run up against the like um you know i belong to the rationality
movement or i am a rationalist and they're like oh you're like one of
those people that thinks and then they say something that totally mischaracterizes
right the rationality community that's exactly what david has a problem with
right at that point then i can say no i'm a bayesian rationalist and
what that means is we update based on information and
try to improve our thinking by identifying cognitive biases and
using techniques and you know the whatever definition
but there's a lot of people that are too polite to say oh so you're one of those
racist alt-right people so they won't say anything this which is why i head
it off and just say bayesian rationalist right at the front
i often just drop rationalists and just say i'm a bayesian
huh and then when people ask what that means i'm like
well i think about things as rationally as i can
and this guy named thomas bayes created a formula that allows me to be a lot
clearer and cut through a lot of the mental bullshit so i'm a bayesian
that's not bad i do like the fact that thomas
bayes is dead why yeah because he has the best
quality for being a religious leader i think that is actually pretty important
because then nobody can be like there it's just this one guy trying to
self aggregate self self-aggrandize yeah he also can't get old and get a
twitter and start tweeting weird stuff he also can't start sleeping with
like all of the youngest of his followers because then that always makes
your religion look bad yeah um what else
what else about this topic i have some concerns about uh
about our ability as a community to just organize on something
not not like necessarily that we can't um coordinate in general but i think that
we won't run up against uh resistance from people who think that
we should be working on these other most important things our public image is
not in the top five most important things that we need to be worried about
right now do those people deny the fact
that things are easier when others want to help you
they would probably be of the opinion that the people that we want to have
helping us or the people who are already here or who are going to find us
and aren't going to be listening to ben Shapiro anyway
and uh that we don't really need to have a
organization with outreach and uh recruiting the common folk
let he who was born rationalist cast the first logical stone wasn't eliezer
had come up with this whole metaphor for the the Bayesian conspiracy
as is our name where it seemed like he actually liked
liked the idea that like okay we're gonna exist out here and then if people
want to find out what we're about they have to come find us and read the
sequences and right that the uh knowledge is more valuable
when it is seen to be hidden right like
this like like how do i mean martial arts schools get around that
they they encourage you to enter because they show valuable skills in the public
but then once you go in you still have to do a lot of the hard work to like
learn how to do it yourself yeah it's a lot harder to show off your rationality
i think we had talked about that before and i do really like that idea like if
there were some places that we were really kicking ass
um either you know just publishing lots of really high quality papers
cranking out scientific discoveries uh innovating in silicon valley in crazy
ways attacking politics in orthogonal like strange
directions that help people as a whole step one kick ass
yeah i think we need to do step one kick ass first before we start doing
step two that's step one we need more high-profile cases like i feel on musk
was like if you came out tomorrow and like i wouldn't be where i was without
the rationalist you know also yeah so i guess quick thing i
like rebranding i i always roll my eyes at that because i remember how badly
that went for the new atheists when they tried to do brights
oh i was thinking about that and yet beijing rationalist
is not a rebranding it's just one more it's a more accurate way to put it
right because rationalist has like oh you mean like day cart and they'll think
you're some esoteric you know snob or something
and day cart was not a by beijing stand beijing rationalist standards
a rationalist yeah right um
i i encourage people to just say beijing and then when people
ask for more information say i'm a beijing rationalist and then give your
spiel but i've in my limited ability to
practice this it seems to get around a lot of those mental connotations
i think i'm going to keep keep with beijing rationalist
i think that's enough of a difference that people get some impression that
there's something else in play here this will be the first schism in the
church of rationality in the bay area people are just
calling them the rats which i thought was really cute
yeah hang in with my rat i am as a as a person who cares about public
image i'm less cool with this rats can be able to call ourselves in
in private you know what up my fellow rat
but as far as my basic point i think you're right jess
and steven like we need to kick ass because
i i think this is just an area where the community
is being a little bit unwilling to look itself in the face a lot of it is very
introverted people and they're making in my opinion
excuses not to do the hard work of learning socialization and putting on a
good face even though the most powerful force on
earth is humans coordinating with each other and popularity is literally a
good measure of like how many humans you can get to coordinate with you
i feel like that's a whole other conversation that i'm very interested
in engaging in but as long as we don't do that
we will never get any further and i think the first step in a place we can
kick ass and the reason i brought up is tearing down assholes who use the
language of rationality as a way to hide their very
prejudice beliefs if nothing else it would be
possibly a way to get more mindshare if people are
are seeing this group always going after Ben Shapiro's and pointing out where
Jordan Peterson is just absolutely falling on his face and
we'd be like oh yeah the Bayesian rationalists those are those people who
are like kind of rightish but attacking all the rightish
assholes yeah like i would like for us to have
a reputation of not necessarily empathetic people
but people everyone can trust will genuinely listen to your side and
will tell you if you're right even if it's unpopular
and will call you out on bullshit when you're wrong i too would like to have
that reputation yeah that sounds awesome i mean i
aim for that that's easy to do in your personal life right i mean
if you subscribe to you know if you have a history among your friends of being
sane and like honest and trustworthy they can come to you and ask for honest
feedback and then you know if they if they already trust your judgment they
can like appreciate your answer right yeah i've been going around telling
people that i do radical honesty although there's
like asterisk it's not the original form but
it's at the point now where i do have people coming and like asking like so i
know that you do the radical honesty thing uh can i ask you something
and uh that's been cool and i wish people more people would do that yeah
i think that's a great tenant of rationality if we were to make it a
church like early christians won their advertising
war essentially by being hyper compassionate even to their enemies
and it was convincing at a certain point the roman empire
so if we become the kind of people who are hyper honest
that is the reputation we will earn yeah i don't know that all rationalists
are pro radical honesty or i guess there's the gap between uh teleculture
ask culture guest culture i think i think it should be towards ask culture
in the rationality community yeah i what is i think that's a good way to do it
i got i can guess most of those but what was asked or what was the
breakdown really quick of the three that you mentioned um
ask culture guest culture and teleculture guest culture is where you
socially competent people can communicate via hints
everything is implied that sounds kind of exhausting well it is but that's like
upside of preserving denied plausible deniability for everyone
which is why a lot of people like it yeah but it also throws people into the
bus you can't do it like most autistic people
and ask in or uh yeah ask in teleculture
more like radical honesty i will ask you things directly
rather than make vague hints about it like i will be like
are you interested in having a romantic relationship with me rather than like
hey you want to go hang out on thursday and so what's teleculture i i guess i'm
and teleculture is volunteering information yo
you me dating right not exactly but so i mean i guess i i that's all sort of
an aside i could just i could just imagine uh like
that's a whole other thing i'll say yeah this is another thing that deserves a
whole conversation we are getting low on time so maybe we should try to wrap
this up did anybody else have any final thoughts about the um
is is rationality being co-opted topic
i mean in my nice little bubble it's not but i can see if people out there are
you saying i guess does ben Shapiro use the word
rationalist i guess i didn't even ask that question
he's the word rational yeah and rationality
and to most people who aren't introduced to
like the sequences it's a lot to read and absorb over a long time
those things are the same as being irrational they are like talking fast
and sounding smart is being a rationalist to most people i think that's just an
admitted weakness and it's our job to dissuade that a lot of people's first
first idea stereotype of a rationalist is like some british person
explaining why empire is the best and it is the white man's burden to help lift
up the lesser races that kind of thing or spock
or spock yeah yeah that's the other one well that yeah i mean
i think maybe just rationalist i mean it was always a tough choice and what to
like name the thing right yeah but yeah i guess
bayesian would have been nicer if that if it started that way it might have been
bayesian is too vague no one would have jumped onto it sounds like a math thing
too it is a math thing it is a math thing but it's also just like it
doesn't tell you anything whereas bayesian rationalist
it has the rationalist core there which
greys you know conveys information to even someone who is not familiar with
bayes yeah i think it bayesian rationality is
more complete of an idea because we are rationalists
and this is the the protocol that we have for doing rationality
bayesian statistics or bayesian updating
i don't have anything else to add yeah all right that's all i got i think we're
all in agreement yeah we're all in agreement new church
david's the pope perfect okay jerk poke give me one year
so i can ordain myself properly or harmful to human anyway by the way
thank you guys for letting me talk about this it's been really getting under my
skin no it was a lot of fun i think i mean this is
this is an important subject i i i mean i didn't have a lot to
to add as far i think it's mainly because this is sort of like the
like noticing the problem stage right um
and other than for me to say oh yeah i see what you're talking about i i don't
have like a lot more to build on it yet so um and to be honest i think a lot of
people have been noticing it and we just haven't said anything
so i i mean saying it is good i i i knew i've seen the the
the tropes and memes of people making fun of ben Shapiro
like there's that onion article where he you know destroyed that homeschooled
you know 12 year old or something and or 17 year old or something and
like with facts and logic and rationality and i like they're always in all caps
like i'm assuming the titles of youtube if his youtube videos are
and i i just assumed everybody knew this that this guy was like that this sort
of thing was a joke i know he has a serious following but i always assumed
that no one thought that that was the same thing
and yet none of this pointed out to me how could there not be any confusion
so this is more reason that and i always try to remember my mind state
before i learned rationality and i probably would have been fooled
like i was smart and clever but i was very far from being
