you know slowly economic growth in places you had little say
at the front is a part of the franchise but one of the parks
of that that tagline was that great again can mean whenever
they the listeners thinks it is right so it's fake it's
completely totally meant to you know let you may fill in the
blanks and that's the thing when I did go to that liberal
perspective I went with a lot of my where my academic friends
were going to these people they were they're not asking for
the racism back they're not asking for even the same type of
work a lot of times they're just asking for their communities
they're asking for a place that you could raise a kid without
worrying about drugs and some place where they can have just
a play not just the main street but a liveliness because my
hometown for example up until the 80s actually had a blue
grass festival small town but it was a place you had big blue
grass names come through my grandfather sat and talked to
many of them and though he doesn't play an instrument his
love of music is what got me into playing music you know
it's very much that like like how can I get you know how can
I encourage you Josh to pick up an instrument and he had all
these stories and he knew he knew what good music was but he
went but the point you had a community for there and then
when I was down you had he had a certain family that was
available they had the older generation that played music
and so I actually he took me out to play with them on Saturday
nights this at a guy's trailer he had a microphone set up the
whole kitchen was moved out to be a concert you know little
stage and they play traditional country music and so then on
the week on the on Sunday and then on their nephews and niece
would play bluegrass on Saturday and the car on Sunday on
Sunday and now there's nothing like that and there was
just one family that held that bluegrass together from the
80s where you had a community of rock bands playing into the
80s and then they then they left and then you had the bluegrass
that hang on hang on and then now that's gone and so and I
think it seems like part of what you were why I tied in that
other comment was that it's not just that there is no future
for them and life keeps getting worse and it seems that nobody
cares at all it's not just that nobody cares they don't expect
people to care is that the people when they do talk about them
denigrate them they're like get out of your shitty town stop
being a racist assholes you know yet with the times or you
deserve to be left behind like the you deserve to be shat on
thing is right and it's that's what the left is left can be
good at that is because they're very good at moralizing
things right and I mean so is the right at times right but
the moral majority but in this case talking about the particular
this particular group of people about you know what Hillary
was like yes she talked about helping bring in new jobs you
know and retraining but she forgot the identity aspect of
community you know a lot of that retraining would go to people
who don't have the same skill set you know so we're actually
like we bring in jobs but we're not going we're not going to
the same work hers filling those jobs and so a lot and there's
that big concern about brain drain and honestly if they
would you know southern Virginia northern Tennessee
western Virginia western Pennsylvania they're in Ohio now
there's kids if their kids are going to when they're going
to Cincinnati Columbus they're going they're moving to put
there and this is also why you know Ohio is booming in
respects they have a fair governor who is working well
enough to get with promoting R&D promoting job growth you
know retraining and being very active on that proton as a pro
job person a pro retraining person but giving opportunities
to people and the brain drain is not from rural Appalachia to
the big cities you know I'm a rare one going this far west
they're just going across the river because they want to be
close to home they want to be close to their families so
with your current econ degree is there and I realize this is
a tangent and we are getting off the Trump thing but is there
any hope for these small areas to be revitalized or is it
just an area of of America that is dying and everyone is
going to eventually have to move to cities like is there
there's really nothing in the modern economy that can be made
of value in those small areas now right and that's not no
not really transportation cost has gone down so dramatically
this is also why we back in the late 1800s early 1900s you
had to have your steel mills in the middle of the city like
Pittsburgh now we can we can put those outside of town so
we can we can put them 30 40 50 miles if not even two hours
away from their source I mean my hometown's a poultry coming
down we have two poultry plants middle of nowhere I mean
seriously I mean when I was a kid I had to go to a movie to go
to an actual theater to a mall meant to go to Maryland which
meant to drive an hour and 15 minutes and that was a big
thing to go to a good hospital was to go to Virginia and that
was another hour and 15 minutes we had we had a regional
hospital but deliver baby to go to a good hospital I got to
drive for an hour to it's just that it's only 20 miles away
for me there's a great distance when you're driving it's
you know 65 miles an hour to these places still not getting
there in time but keeping more the points that these no that's
actually not the problem a lot of the problem the thing
there's mindset issues my grandfather's mayor of my
hometown and understanding the importance of systems and
maybe get around to that later because I think in terms of
systems a lot because of economics but with it he my
town my county is like the second fastest current county
in the state and it has a lot to do with my hometown the other
Incorporate town in the in the county has a part-time officer
it's dying and it's dying because it was completely
agricultural and they refused to do anything other than
hospitality and they eventually lost the hospitality
no offense but if they're listening I don't think our
podcast is that kind of reach but with that said my my
hometown is industrial it's very cosmopolitan we have a lot
of influx of Hispanics from all over Latin America from the
Caribbean's and so it's actually very it's actually very
beautiful thing to look at that in retrospect so what I bring
it is that my grandfather is very thoughtful on what his
role as a mayor and also understanding the fact of the
charter for the town is set up in a way that mayor doesn't
have a lot of power it's it's the board there to counsel I
mean sorry it's the council but the people have voted in
consistently people in onto this council who are actually
barely educated with a lot of experience in management.
They you know so there's not a personal that on that board
that doesn't have a degree less sorry my grandfather has the
lowest amount of degrees on that board or the council excuse
me and that's that's what's funny though is he's still pro
Trump.
No my my grandfather he's he's very lukewarm okay but even
though your your town's doing very well it's not like they
were still very much in the the Trump no the town is yes but
my my grandfather is a little different breed okay but what
I'm getting to is this that thinking in terms of who's
actually running the town and keeping it on pace there and
and they're making decisions that are not anti-business but
not pro-business they're making decisions that how do we work
together as partnerships because the culture to plants
together both and make up 85% of the water usage the town
produces all the water for the region and they sell it they
sell it at cost to anyone outside of the town so the making
points here is that they're thinking systematically and so
when you get to when you get the Trump this is where a lot
people are not concerned so much with the Trump that the left
knows that's the other thing that's very important yeah so
we think in terms of systems but with how towns are run and
mice and so on but wanting to keep on keep on the Trump thing
a little bit more is that these people are they know Trump has
faults they know that he he tweets they're not oblivious
to it but that's not the Trump they're concerned with.
So this is what I really wanted to dive into and I haven't
really said anything in the last 35 minutes this I want to
understand the like for really quick my background is like
I have immediate members who voted Trump and they voted not
for the you know the reality TV show host the you know
proud I've ever read a book because I'm already so smart or
the you know the flagrant sexual offender they voted for the
guy that in one case you know wasn't Hillary Clinton no
matter what yeah that's a big thing and the other one was
just the well he's not a politician that's what makes
him good and people like that too because they they you know
at least in my in my small circle or my small window into
this world that you know what a politician has done for us
lately they fucked everything up for the last 50 years we
need to shake things up and that is that anything like the
common narrative in real Trump land or well there's some
appeal to the non-politician aspect but most of the but you
talked to these people and they understand that you need
people who know how things work they I think more of them
had better view of what his cabinet is going to look like
that the you know the lie lie things I hear about where I'm
from often excuse me something I hear a lot from where I'm
from is it's really about who you surround yourself with
that's the big thing and they assume Trump was gonna have
better people and honestly some of them are not bad people
I'm actually kind of lamenting McMaster's leaving keeping
a little bit more sane you know more a little more sanity
around but sometime there are some issues with with McMaster's
too so but with that said is that example of where they
weren't looking for Trump as being a being a non-politician
alone they were looking for someone who seemed to come
and talk to them and to not talk down them and this is the
third read that second part there about the belittling that
from that comment please we live at a time where the left
cannot fathom how everyone does not like the things they
like and value the things they value and the right preemptively
expects for the things they like to be belittled trashed or
look down on and the things they value to be judged quaint
old-fashioned backwards or stupid yeah and that's what I'm
the big thing that I find is that there's a not not the big
thing but a big thing is it the right is on defensive the
rural America is on defensive and so someone who was sticking
to the system regardless if it came from the system or not
that was really secondary it was just someone who was not
talking to down to them and Trump was not he much as he
looked like a goofball being you know in my state with a
you know coal miners cap on and it couldn't fit and try and
look like you suck shoveling out of the sandbox that to be
should have been an insult and that would have been an insult
if Hillary did it but Hillary would have come across as doing
it out of mockery Trump did it out of census of praise and
that's what these people really want to was not being talked
down to for once and this is the I want to the thing that also
is clever the end of clever some I hear a lot Trump is the end
of clever and not say the end of clever yeah so let's talk
and more economic point of view is all the money it's offshore
to have to come back to be taxed and look at you know Google
and Apple for example and they want to do a holiday and Trump's
