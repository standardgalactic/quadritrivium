respects but they now put the situation where these men don't
know how to respond there's no protocol for them to go out
there and interact with these ladies and this is what more
what my friend was mentioning was that there are you know I
don't know if I can say hi because I don't know how to say
hi now and of course this is you know and I hear from you
know from my academic female friends that you know victim
hood who you just like honestly can we just acknowledge that
people just don't know how to interact and communicate it's
not for fear of being sexually harassing it's just for fear
of not knowing how to be turned down I these these posts
sometimes by a particular friend I'm thinking of that is like
this this guy came over to me and was trying to buy me a
drink or something and I'm just sitting here drinking my my
coffee and reading a book I'm like what stop creeping on me
asshole right I'm like okay that's fair she didn't want to be
bothered and then like a week or two later I also see the the
same friend saying no one ever asks me out or hits on me I am
so alone I'm like these two might be related people are afraid
to approach people now because they don't want to be the
creeper that everyone's like oh watch out for that guy he'll
come over and start annoying you when you don't want it oh
god I'm trying to get how I phrased it to her but mainly
the the the issue was how do I know that what I'm doing is
being perceived as flirtatious versus being perceived as
aggressive and she's like you won't know until she likes you
and that's what's that's the job and that's not worth the
risk oftentimes and that's into this gets you don't want to be
aggressive so much that you don't bother with the flirting
you don't you don't want to be the aggressive asshole no one
does so there's two thinking economically about this there's
actually two books come to mind one is right years ago called
more sex is safe for sex okay and it's really more of a
theoretical thought experiment but the idea is that if you
want safe for sex you let's take the let's say there's two
kind of guys there's the guy who he would like to have sex
and he's you know and he's you want to do it safe and wants
it want to be respectful and then here is this other dude
who just doesn't you want to use protection just want to go
out with anybody and will in night after night with different
people then the middle you have this other lady who she
prefer guy a but if guy a leaves the market she will give into
a guy be every so often and so we need to find ways to incentivize
guy a to enter the market and what we're finding or at least
what I'm seeing from talking to people back in rewapilacha and
even around here even is that there is not that incentive
everything is a disincentive for the good guy well they're
trying to disincentivize guy bees from being like guy bees
but it doesn't stop guy bees and it does stop guy a's from
even showing up and you see the pool in which you're surrounding
when you're getting although now I feel like the dick hole
who's like telling women what their problem is no and I don't
want to be in that position I although I do want to say do you
think this this idea that there are no good men left is what
leads to the aggressiveness that the you see in from some
of these women in workplaces like when you do see the one guy
who looks like you might be a good guy you got to jump and
get on him right yeah that makes sense I'm not sure exactly
how how strong that is I did not I did not speak to anyone
directly on that level to have but that makes sense to me though
when you're looking because you're always out looking in those
areas looking for stability I mean remember actually think
about the first episode maybe a man men like if you play your
cards right you know Peggy you know you'll be living out in
the you know the hills I couldn't even finish the first episode
because it was so fucking misogynistic I wanted to throw
up I think that's part of the theme of the show I know I know
it is but it that is the thing that is I hate so much I could
not swallow it and I had to stop watching so I'm gonna get
shut on because I couldn't finish the first episode because I
got bored so okay like some people like horror and other
people are like I know that this is what a horror movie is and
I can't watch it and that was the same kind of thing I couldn't
watch Matt and the sad thing is that's my favorite TV show
of all time it's well renowned I mean people that I'm close to
really liked it but it's just I couldn't get into it now I
feel like I'd have to catch up on a lot and they're long
episodes I'm lazy right I mean it's like getting cut up on
Highlander so like what you cut up on Highlander right yeah
I think there's you know you got all the movies to watch and
also you have to watch the seven seasons or six seasons of
the show and then there's a seven spin-off season and you got
to watch Highlander too which is widely regarded as the worst
movie ever but there's actually three or four different versions
of it you got to watch the first one no aliens don't watch the
first one was God awful but I I do like the renegade version
which is the director's cut and then also the producers came
over one and there's a couple things I disagree with but
nonetheless let's get off the movie but I will say Highlander
is probably one of the most influential things in the way
I have you being a man so like we might be be interested to
come back to that maybe some point we'll put a pin in that
yeah I've never seen any Highlander so sad or Sean Connery
in it okay yeah he's only on the set for seven days oh yeah he
was not in much of it but here's a highlander the movie or
Highlander the TV series oh okay but mainly the show has a lot
of aspects to understanding the right amount of temperament
that I find at least for me to want to exude so but with that
let's moving back to this point of what were you saying I don't
recall but I do have some things I want to touch on before
okay let's do that yeah okay like somewhere along the way we
can edit so yeah so these are some things that you have said
over the past couple months I think I just started jotting
down because I was like I'm gonna have my podcast so I want
to hit on hilarious yeah someone actually pays that much
attention to my Facebook other than either a green or
disagreeing openly on the on the form okay the so we're gonna
hit two facts and a statement that you made in quick succession
and then we can hit that talk about these one was that non
Hispanic white males make up 31% of the US population but count
for 70% of suicides in the late 90s the risk of a non college
white person dying in his or her early 50s was 30% less than
that of his or her black counterpart but by 2015 the
risk was 30% more than his or her black counterpart yeah and
then you said we live at a time where the left cannot fathom
how everyone does not like the things they like and value the
things they value and the right preemptively expects for the
things they like to be belittled trashed or look down on and
the things they value to be judged quaint old fashioned
backwards or stupid my friends on the left do not see how
they blindly fueled the rise of Trump let alone continue to
do so are these related things the facts and then this I'm
not they're likely yes because I'm not going to time together
right now but they were kind of spread out they were spread
out they weren't that wasn't one post no that was the series
of the issue of the facts is to understand that the type of
men that are from where I'm from to realize that we do have
issues with suicide we do have issues with depression and
you know we got we look at life expectancy and that's the
thing that two things with life expectancy actually just came
across this the other day what a couple of counties in my
state their life expectancy is decreased to the point where
it is now equal to Ethiopia and that's something that I don't
think that people back to the privilege a little bit is that
it's hard to tell someone who has a life expectancy of
Ethiopia who doesn't have a septic system because available
to them when these kids go to you know besides when they go to
school I mean there don't have the type of education to you
know not education but the opportunities to have a life
that's going to put them on a path to getting out of that
area they're stuck there forever and they know it and they
a lot of them know it and so what's so with that said is
more of I'm my frustration is that people don't understand
exactly what's going on so at least back to statistically
with rural America in the sense that there is a there is a
male like divide as in like you know there's a group of males
who are getting healthier and there's group of males who are
getting poor who are getting less healthy or getting poor
and the main thing is with the line about the white men living
in 30 like what was the years again in 19 in the late 1990s
yeah so night with tonight late 1990s I had a 30 30 you know
30% less chance of dying than their black counterpart at the
certain age of early 50s and court had a lot to do with drug
usage particularly with opioids is what's doing a lot of that
but to underscore that's not a tie lifting all boats and
that's where it's where a lot of people looking around like
who had issues where with not a form of action but like exactly
but the policies that kept telling like these people who
were disenfranchised and you're not watching yourself get
better you're watching yourself getting worse in response and
that breeds some sort of and there's and yeah and they there's
a sense of being left behind leaving feeling ignored and
that's something that's really fascinating when you talk to
people in like Medau County or Clay County some of the poor
counties in my state or even getting further south even that
they don't expect a politician to come through to save them
they don't expect a politician even know they exist.
They do feel they're on their own and so it's a little bit
more about this community thing is that the aspect of this
and going to the friend to talk about not knowing how to discuss
things with women is that he the other thing he said besides
not having a protocol for for communicating with with the
opposite sex is there's no place to get together anymore.
There's not a dance hall there's not a there's not a nice place
to have dinners or there's not a place to go to sports games
these things are falling to the side and what I'm finding
from talking to people is that a lot of the behavior a lot of
choices particularly when it comes to voting is that these
men who are working at a plant be it a deliveries or you be
poultry be it a cabinets be whatever the they're making
I mean there's you've got so many different plants and
operation in West Virginia we make van shoes we also make
you know cold and I was like cool well we do make cold we
dig it up but I was like the charcoal we make charcoal and
so as a host of things going on there but far as the job I
said a lot of these men and the concern comes from not just
about their own livelihood some of them have like made things
like you know to go on into other occupations a lot of niches
like I have a friend who's doing leather work now he got out
of out of work and he now had to figure out a thing to do so
he's doing he's selling leather bags and leather belts and out
of a shed and you have other people who are making knives
but your custom knives selling it and they're they're using
the internet to do a lot of this too so do they they say the
benefits in one way but they're concerned about their
community they can and when so when people talk even for me
when I heard the line like back with Trump was make America
Gregian I did go to that liberal response like back when
there was slavery and inequality and you had had had tariffs
and strong unions to the degree that you're actually you know
