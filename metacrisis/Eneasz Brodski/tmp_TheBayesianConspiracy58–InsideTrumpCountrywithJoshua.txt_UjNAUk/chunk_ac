Why defend a falsehood?
Why commit a falsehood in the first place?
Does the position that men should be more sensitive to the
historical roots of present day inequalities require that we
assert a falsehood?
I hope not.
And yeah, that's the thing.
The Bailey is like a falsehood that does a lot of work,
but isn't defensible.
And I find that like you switch back and forth between them
whenever you need to defend your statement.
Exactly.
And I don't I don't like that approach and it's it.
I might do it in real life.
I'm not sure if you ever see me doing it,
call me out on it because it'd be interesting to see what it
feels like.
But from like from the outside,
it looks to it feels dishonest.
Yeah.
And you know,
I know people in real life.
We should we heard the doorbell.
So bink.
Yeah, remember what you were saying just that in real life
when people discuss privilege,
they they are equipped with the proper definition,
but that's not how it's usually employed.
Yeah.
And so if you ask them to be like,
well, can you explain that they'll give you the academic
version,
but then they'll go right back to not using it that way.
Yeah.
In my experience and the switch is always on the sly between
the mod and the Bailey,
which is what makes it such an effective tactic.
Yeah.
So that said,
we are we did the listener feedback first.
We're jumping back to doing the actual episode now.
So check out the subreddit for that episode for some
engaging conversation.
But there were two other things that possibly we can engage
before we jump into Josh's thing.
Yeah, go nuts.
You're going to jump in here whenever you want.
I was going to say when we talked about the punching thing
and you asked,
why are we punching anything punching is very similar.
The first time I heard it and I think this is where
originated though,
I'm not sure it was a term used by comedians that you're
allowed to make fun of the president because
he's the fucking president.
You can't hurt the president.
He's he's up there.
He's got a lot of power and they they called that like
punching up at the president.
You can mock him all you want.
But if you're like mocking the disabled black person in
your audience,
that's a shit thing to do.
Don't do that.
That's he's below you in his station in life and that's why
you don't punch down,
which was the where I believe that term originated from
comedy.
It could be punching up is funny punching down as a dick
move also like roasting would be funny to do with people
who are on board or like,
you know,
even somebody who maybe isn't on board,
but is socially equipped to take the reputational hit from
being made fun of.
Yeah,
but you don't grab some random person and start sitting on
him like roast style.
Right.
And then then the term gets co-opted by the larger society
and now all of a sudden anyone who you think is above you
in social privilege or status or whatever you can rip on
for whatever reason.
I'm also not a big fan and I mentioned this to use this on
the I had seen this mentioned to use this on the subreddit.
If this is 50 years ago and DNA tests were readily available
and people,
you know,
we're we're say like an Italian person.
This is,
you know,
back when they were less equal in society in America.
If they were punching up at somebody and then oh,
it looks like three out of the four grandparents were non
Italian white or something.
Then like,
are they doing the wrong thing?
It depends if they're not really Italian,
but if they thought they were,
I just I feel like you can avoid a lot of that thinking by
just not being just period.
But again,
I recognize that I say that for my for my position.
So I if there's something there to be had,
there probably is,
but I just feel like you also don't make friends that way.
And you know,
I don't know.
I loved uses as comments.
They were very long and thoughtful,
but I didn't find my mind changed.
But I just find them engaging and they're nice way to
to analyze this.
If things weren't clear in the episode,
I thought they were very clear in those comments.
I think he has,
you have some or I think they have some very good points
and I like what they have to say.
I just this is why we engage,
you know,
everyone,
right?
Yeah,
because there there are many sides to the stories.
Finally,
Mourin de Miao also on the subreddit.
We got to find out how that name is pronounced.
I couldn't help but apply a handsonian lens while listening.
Can't imagine why.
Essentially,
every culture war topic,
almost any tough topic is something that doesn't matter.
More concretely,
you're weighing in on the issue on Facebook,
Twitter,
or in person accomplishes almost nothing.
At most,
you will slightly change one mind via several hours of effort.
Mostly,
it's about tribal signaling.
You're showing off your allegiance to the tribe.
The left literally uses the term ally and your quality as an
ally is judged on the basis of your unquestioning compliance.
Hard to get more tribal than that and the right has their
version as well of things that you are.
Oh God,
there was a great article about not politically correct,
patriotically correct was what it was called,
that there are certain things that you can't say when you're
on the right,
even if you think them because then all the people on your
side will be like,
are you one of those hippies,
liberal tards that,
yeah.
Because arguments are soldiers and or because yeah,
arguments are soldiers and conversation is war,
right?
Right.
So anything that you say that that is the least bit
this merging of your own side.
If you're like,
hey guys,
maybe slow down here for a second.
Then it's like,
oh my God,
he's fighting against us.
He's shooting our own soldiers in the back.
Get him.
And yeah,
it's I think I don't really know the way to approach that
without getting too into it other than like just to not
care,
but it assuming that you do care,
which a lot of people care about stuff.
Maybe I'm weird and that I don't then you know,
I don't know how I don't know what their money is for that.
Maybe being aware of the fact that like it's okay to say
your side can do better or that you know,
just being willing to talk with other people.
Yeah,
and not shit on them and realize that you don't have to
you don't have to convert everyone all the time.
Just talk with people and have a civil conversation.
They're humans too.
Even if they may be wrong,
being wrong is not a sin.
Relating to that,
I really enjoyed the reason episode on Sam Harris's podcast
with a Christian something.
I forget his last name.
Oh,
Paulini,
the X X Hitler Youth guy,
right Christopher Palloni was the author of the inheritance
cycle book series.
Who?
Oh,
I met him at DCC.
He's the nicest motherfucker you'll ever meet.
