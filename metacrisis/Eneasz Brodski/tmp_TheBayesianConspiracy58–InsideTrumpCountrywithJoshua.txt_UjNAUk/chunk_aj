you're gonna that be valued in the primary and you got to
then get your voice your values and concerns and temper
people's views like like the issue like you know about trade
and which with China with it with doing tears I this is
something that much as I despise Trump for doing it and I
think it's it's why don't I know it's a faulty policy Obama
did it Bush did it this is not out of the norm for presidents
to do this and they do it because they have to appease the
voters Obama did it because of he had put he put tariffs on
cheap tires from China and in doing that we cost you know
you know I heard five thousand three billion dollars or
something is a nearly some don't like that but I was gonna
say that the but in doing thousands of jobs to a thousand
thousands because it was the myth to save a thousand tire
jobs in Ohio he made a campaign promise in this deal that
we actually track this politicians do keep the campaign
promises more times than not this is something that you know
go to political scientists and they do studies on this and
so keep it but maybe bring this back is that you know my
hometown is going to be affected by that by because China
was attempting a trade war you know response with tariffs on
chicken feet random thing but they didn't do it but now we
see a little more of this because it's a more aggressive
you know steals a bigger out you know export for China than
tires were I hate to do this but we did get started a little
late and I kind of have to wrap things up here in the next few
minutes I feel like we've got a round two in the works would
you be willing to come back for a second round talk about some
other things yeah well you totally I feel like it long
winded the big thing at the end is like trying to encapsulate
these things in conversation it's not about here's here's my
bullet point here's you know wrapping these things to people
in general and and what is their story with our neighbors and
so trying to exemplify that in some regards right now so yes
that'd be fine and you feel like we have learned quite a bit
more about you personally too but as you're saying with the
narratives and yeah and people well that's a big the big
thing is there's so many small and there's people yeah God
there's so many things I talk to people about back home not
just the me to movement not just about you know Trump is
specifically about his tweeting per se and about what where
of all the men gone there's a lot more that these people talk
about and a lot more about community that that matters to
these people and there's weird altruism and I hate the word
altruism but there is a sense of altruism out of it that people
are not concerned about what do you mean people they're not
so they can be doing well this is actually going to be a little
back to the side that the guys making knives out of their
you know and leatherwork these who are not concerned about
their jobs anymore they found the way to survive what they're
concerned about is their community and so and they're
concerned about the guy down the street they're concerned
about the kid they don't have a kid in high school anymore
but they're concerned about the kids in high school their
kid graduate and moved out but they're concerned about you
know the football team you know members but they're not about
keeping them giving their nose clean you're not tearing on
Christmas lights so yeah I had a English teacher in high
school who got got the book there and a bunch of the football
hairs did something ridiculous like that but great man really
they hit him hard and he grew up quickly and was it was one
of the best teachers I've ever had in high school but but
the point being the story is it is also understanding
narrative and people grow and there's redemption that's a
big thing also I find a lot people believe in redemption
and they believe in nuance much more in rural America than
people can credit for so much of what I come across by having
conversations you realize that no one really supports anything
100% any position you support sometimes it could be you know
55 and you see this with you know drug you know idea
legalization of marijuana and and that Bellaccia not a lot
people really support it on you know there's people who support
I'm saying there's a there's a good vocal side if you have
an argument you know the comparison with John K6 which
is it's hard to tell kids don't do drugs while legalizing
other drugs well and it's back to narrative how do you pitch
this right I think all the drugs should be legalized and
teach the kids what happens when you use them.
Well that's my grand my grandfather was very much about
else you bring brochures of like this is what happens or
here's a here's a photo of a guy we brought in it was on
meth last week.
I mean we already have legalized alcohol which is one of
the more dramatically bad for you drugs there's but there's
a cultural significance with this is another thing back to
narrative you know the there's a cultural significance of
alcohol that's different than a culture significance with
heroin sure with cocaine right and so but in terms of just
effects on your body alcohol is pretty high up there.
No I'm but again this is back to think again statistics and
reports do not convince people.
Okay.
So I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
Good.
What we're gonna say was not related.
One last thing I guess maybe this is not about role of
Appalachia but Tom in narrative.
So I write for a site called eraticus.co if you want to go
and check it out.
There's a lady who wrote on a piece about when she was in
Africa during the bull eye crisis and the important importance
of medical aid and medicine in general is not it was is
overshadowed.
I won't back that up.
So there's a Fargo back in the story mainly narrative matters
and so the lady wrote an article about being when she was
in Africa with a bull eye crisis and you have all the medical
treatment available and doctors and for trying to get people
vaccinated or kind of people quarantined and other different
things.
And without a narrative to tell people why they need to care
about the facts and they need to care about the medicine.
They need to care about their own health without care about
their children without a narrative medicine didn't work
and this is and so they had to develop this narrative structure
as aid workers to provide the medicine and the Ebola treatment
and available to these people and the same thing with with
Latin America.
Sorry with the rule of Appalachia nothing has hurt credibility
of doctors like the opioid crisis.
This is another thing of experts failing us doc you know we
have you have you know I have a friend who's in a band and we
really got to go.
Sorry.
All right go ahead quick.
All right friends in the band and they and it's a local band
and they are very popular around the area and they have a song
called white coat man is all about how doctors have hurt
you know the rural population.
So this is a very big you know thread right now is experts
are failing and not just in Africa but also in rural
Appalachia and that's been some narratives important to get
everyone out of this and so facts is not going to do it
statistics isn't its conversation and narrative.
I think the biggest takeaway for me is that the you know like
you said the the story that people have for themselves and
for what they're drives their beliefs is what really matters
it's not they're not they didn't hear a statistic on the news
and that's why they believe what they believe they have this
whole underpinning thing and there's this line that not you
know excuse me there's this line that every racist voted for
Trump but not every Trump voters are racist right they're not
all Tiki torch building Nazis don't be wrong none of the
Tiki none of the Tiki torch building Nazis voted for Clinton
but the overwhelming majority of Trump voters are just people
who you know aren't villains in most of our eyes you know but
they're but they're so they have they have stories that make
the sense for themselves and sort of the Nazis but the stories
that the the not Tiki torch people have have for their for
their motivations are the kinds of things that we can almost
all find common ground on you find something in the middle
and be like hey I care about that too I don't want I don't
want you dying of opioid addiction I don't want you
losing your job I don't want your society falling apart
that sort of stuff and you know there there's a huge collection
of everything that we all can care about together right and
I think I like humanizing people that we tend to disagree
with right it's really easy especially around the far left
to be like everyone over there is a monster and they're you
know they're they all you know wish they had swastika statute
on their foreheads or whatever it's like no they're they're
just people like you and me they just their their values
aligned a little differently from their from their narrative
history right yeah and that's the same few parts I mean of
course we like to look from the right to the left and everyone
to take your guns so yeah it's very much of you know my
sister and her husband voted for Trump and but they're not
homophobic they're not anti-Semitic they they voted
for not being talked down to and a lot of people they looked
at voting for Trump as an end of PC and censorship not about
his policies but not about his rhetoric itself but about
what Hillary responded to you know we're talking about what
Hillary represented and that's very similar to thinking
about what would you know Hillary presidency look like and
the counterfactual and I don't think a lot of people talk
about this you know Sam Harris had their first time yeah
and so yeah and so when you think about what the opportunity
is these people saw that and maybe you know just not being
talked down to for four years might help them and there's a
release valve of energy but you're lumping people that I
know who have the same values as I do who disagree on basic
like 25% here 5% you know 5% there and then they voted the
other way for someone who doesn't respect in my mind the
rule of law doesn't respect you know the norms of the office
or the dignity of the office doesn't have basic economics
on its side but with that said they're not bad people most
of the they agree on so many things back to the meeting
thing they agree there shouldn't be sexual harassment in the
workplace. They just don't see the narrative that is coming
across her Facebook thread or through the media as in the
one that reflects their reality. So there's a lot more
agreement but what we're doing is we are painting you know
people in one brush and say you're a Nazi or you are a
fascist and we're not actually getting much done from that.
Before we go is there anything you'd like to plug some place
people can hear your music or that website you're just talking
about.
So yes there's a website that I write for my buddy started
from DC called eraticus.co. It's just long form essays on
