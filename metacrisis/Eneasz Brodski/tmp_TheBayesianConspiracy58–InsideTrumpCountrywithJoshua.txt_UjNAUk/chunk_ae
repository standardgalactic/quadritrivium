a four-year degree so I could have an opinion because I felt
that I wasn't informed enough and so conversation led me to
realize how much I was missing in communicating with other
people and then I went with undergrad did did a bunch of
different you cross this whatever classes interested me took
that kind of but I gradually gradually with my degree in
economics and two minors just shy of majors with in English
and history and then I moved I went to DC worked in think tank
and then moved out here for grad school in economics nice
so that's how I'm out here that's and then and so when I went
back home yeah this was about a year after less than a year
10 months after Trump had been elected.
Yes actually it was November.
Okay, so bars wouldn't get inaugurated so I went back home
for seven weeks I was I was fortunate to be able to work
remotely and my grandmother is having some health issues and
so I went back home stayed with her and helped her get to the
hospital in Maryport but so I was like you know the one thing
I found with Trump was how much even I misunderstood the
people I grew up with.
I mean they're like these are my people I mean like I listen
to the same music still mean I still listen to country music
not stuff radio but like the 90s and so on and but we listen
to the metal music watching these guys on Facebook who are
metalheads are these huge Trump supporters and they're gun guys
now and I'm like what does happen you know where the women
who were the most spoken members of our class voted Trump like
what's going on things didn't line up in my mind and so and
I found myself getting very humble by the process I spent the
part of the five months after Trump's getting elected pretty
much just like you know laying around the house not reading
anything like I just like like give me a shelter but with
that's actually get that should give a prognosis of this so
I read quite a bit and so the year 2015 I read 67 books for
that year and then and then went up until Trump got elected
and I had 4546 read and then in the next five months I did
not complete a single book it was that kind of emotional
impact and so when I went back home basically I start
hashtagging like report from rural America or something of
that nature and just asking people not and it wasn't about
like I need to win an argument wasn't about understanding
the statistics are saying here look at these numbers or here
is an X textbook economics it was tell me your narrative
explain to me why you believe the way you believe and what
are your examples and you don't don't be antagonistic and I
think the one thing that when you first was actually an issue
over the me guarding me to movement and sexual harassment
in the workplace I think that was the first time you commented
okay me about about any of this okay if you want to hear a
bit about that I didn't see this exchange so is there anything
to dive into there that's not too far derailing no there's
no real exchange it was just more I posted I posted a thing
about some quote from a woman I spoke to and he mentioned
like we should talk when you get back to the thing and we
haven't talked yet not on this topic and so basically what
I found was talking to some of these women particularly who
work in the poultry plants or the cabinet factors around my
area was one thing it was mentioned like you know the
women are just as bad if not worse than the men it comes
to sexual harassment now in as in harassing other harassing
men or harassing other women both okay and it's actually
because my this woman actually said that's that's she's like
I don't she's very much like I don't care if you're lesbian
and that's how she preps it but when I put a ring on my
finger behave like the men and don't you don't start you
know trying to entice me to cheat on my husband the women
were not stopping when it came to that aspect of her co-workers
but when you bring in just the male were a new manager or
you bring another guy I mean I worked in these plants for two
summers and I kind of have to verify what she said is seems
pretty accurate I mean even when I worked in the hospital I
worked in a mental hospital in my undergrad the women were
very aggressive a new guy shows up and it's like I want that
one and they and they're now at lunch table like choosing
and they'll they're very physical they want they'll touch
you without quite without asking they will entice you and
even if you have a kid at home and a wife I mean there was
in my grandfather actually told me because I mentioned this
to him that this conversation I had and he's like he's like
yeah you know we actually had this new guy come in a manager
brought in from corporate and the vice president or okay but
not vice president but one of the upper management had to go
to lunchroom and tell all these women do not this man has
three kids at home he's here to work and so what the point is
even knowing the statistics and this is the point I'm trying
to see even knowing statistics about sexual harassment in
the workplace it doesn't line up with these people's reality
what they're seeing is something different and so what I learned
in this is I do can't win an army of statistics it's about
narrative it's about making people feel heard and it's about
making and the thing also is funny it's like not funny but
some none of them are advocating for it like no one said we
need to keep it the same no one says we need you know men and
women should be able to you know her sexual harass anyone in
a workplace it should be a sexual harassment free zone
no one's disagreeing with the same thing to me to move is
asking for but the fact that they make a narrative or the
movement has been a narrative about women only these women
are responding with I'm not a victim and I and also women
are just as bad when are we gonna take care of them and
that's what fascinated me was this hearing these kind of
stories.
I'm on a brief tangent you said something which which
surprised me in which I guess now I'm connecting the two
things that they might be related you said that the women
that you talked to said there was impossible to find any good
men anymore.
Okay, that's a that's a different time I say it's not
different but I count as a separate point because this
runs across the spectrum also voting.
I so I'm gonna do a shout out to my ex-wife she with the
Georgetown firm masters when I met her she both she and I
had a undergrad campus presence people knew who we were
because of our activities in different organizations she was
the president of Lambda she was the president of the Women's
Studies of Students Association.
So she had a very much a known record on campus as a very
liberal progressive minded person and here comes this boy
who at the time was identified as a libertarian and not say
maybe I don't identify myself but a people didn't find me as
that a guy who debated a guy who wrote columns in the in the
campus paper and so so she's actually back home in what in
Huntington, West Virginia where she has a urban farm for addiction
recovery help to deal with the opioid addiction and do with
the job training skills dealing with yoga and meditation
that even using was a Tai Chi using using a martial art of
some sort to help men and women both.
I mean she's working with the golden girls.
Is a home for abused women and so on neglected women.
So she's involved in that that's what she's helping with
and so here's that woman on the left and then I go to people
who I went to high school with home some of who are homeschooled
and very much a conservative you know you know the world needs
to be go back to the day of you know call the very much a
gotten guns kind of thing.
Well get very gotten guns but it's almost a new Luddite like
she doesn't have like she doesn't have Wi-Fi in her home
just have like she has electricity but there's no heat
it's done through wood.
Whoa.
Yeah.
The other dad's account to make I mean she's a wonderful human
and but the point is that she's on the she's on the on the
right that's what I'm getting to and so the thing I found was
the one on the right first said like where are they all the
men gone and I was like where have all the men gone and I
spawn because I'm going through my mind like well there's
masculinity and there's men and males.
There's a lot of male bodies and so going through that process
of what do you mean exactly and what she's meaning is men who
work men who provide men who are dominant in the way that's
appealing obviously not ones who you know batter and abuse
but there is a certain type of masculinity that she's attracted
to and then I go and I talk to people across spectrum from
some independence and people who don't vote at all to to
eventually over here the genie and I said that to her issue
to make sure I said Rachel said where have all the men gone
and she's like oh God that's so true where have they gone she
has no idea either and that's the point because I want to give
the point genie is in Cabell County which they actually if
you want to go on the Netflix they'll find a documentary
called heroin which the the E is in parentheses at the end
okay it's about the opioid addiction it's actually in
Huntington which is my and genie's undergrad hometown
and that's where we went to school in Marshall and you
follow these three women through that through this battle
and one is the fire chief and the things this point out is
that 11% of that county has been or are on opioids or heroin
the amount of money that's going to you know it's something
in the millions you know I think it's almost I think it's
six I think it's a hundred million dollars something goes
through that a year and so what's fascinating is that a lot
of these men aren't available because there are other things
going on there's a lack of education but there's also a
lack of motivation and and this leads into a whole other
topic that I find with other men is where the men I do talk
to back home who are like they're nervous they're scared
to talk to women they're scared of social interaction because
you might very well accidentally sexually harass someone
or something and then you're fucked for life well there's
no like it's it's not that you accidentally sexually harass
someone it's that you were joking you thought flirting
around or something and it turns out that you're a monster
well it's more yes so the point I think it goes back to
there's a book and I get I do not condone the books I've
never read it but I heard an interview and now like in PR
it's called manning up a woman wrote it about her like kids
and one thing she highlighted was in the 1950s men first
men aren't trained and understand other people on a personal
level the society has just failed to teach us interpersonal
relationships which they need to and we and we should advance
that cause but in the 1950s and 40s there was an expectation
this is what you do as a man women might not get what they
want but they knew what they're getting and as you go through
women liberation and women started becoming more individual
and so you have some women who are into Tantra and some are
into BDSM and you have others who are on the sexual level
but then you have others who they want to be stay home
moms and others who want to be corporate leaders and all
that's great and beautiful and you have entacious many
