a 10% tax rate on that 10% it's a nice brown number kind of
thing it's all it's easy to comprehend at least Paul Ryan
comes out a few weeks later and says no it should be actually
12.5 now you're like wait a second where did you get that
from five so 10 is easy to understand 12.5 is like what
math are you using and so the points they want to cut the
people are tired of being talked down to and lectured and
preach to and whatever else so with this at least from where
I'm from I don't think anyone likes any of that honestly
and this will get to another point about this how people
what led to this reactionary state of the right or role
America but the end of clever is very important the idea like
let's cut out a bunch of access even if it's going to be with
a you know an axe or chainsaw and then in eight years we will
then go back to rebuilding they just want to gut the red tape
they want to then they feel the net even if we know we know
economically a lot of the regulations are actually beneficial
you know for many things yes there are some costs but then
there's the cost also a lot of times pay for themselves
elsewhere so we can look at these studies but that's not the
narrative these will have and that's getting this narrative
there's like 500 things in my mind right now to go from that
direction but with narrative is horribly important to
understand these people and so the left often talks about
their voting is our own self interests you know we're the
ones wanting to give you good jobs we want you know we
government can give you these opportunities and redistribute
through the tax system give you benefits how can you vote
against your interest.
Well these people and not just an atalacha but also in
Louisiana for example there's sociologists out of California
she wrote a book called strangers in their own land
and what she really got to was it to them and it's very true
across rural America.
Businesses are not the enemy they are the things that give
you money to put food on the table for your kids they are
the saviors and every time you had a regulation you are making
it harder for you to get an income every time government
makes it makes you know regulation it makes it hard
for you to have an income and that's what they're seeing
that's a narrative even if we know Cole was actually you know
going down long before Obama came in the war on Cole is very
much you know is that a big narrative out there Oh God
yes I very much applaud my state on the fact that we have
have a lot of windmills we've taken a route to do some
version of alternative energy grant windmills are not
efficient in any meaningful sense I mean they are you
technology from like the like what the 1500s that's at best
I mean like we're going to say we'll give you if not back
in the 1100s so they're not exactly the future.
Now that gets until a different issue with with the
alternatives but but I'm glad we're doing that we're at least
showing some aspect of having those kind of jobs available
and a lot of engineering electrician jobs are created
with that but the war on Cole and that is a very big narrative
and realizing that states have identities when you're from
a state I never identify as a coal miner I don't think of coal
myself personally is an important thing I mean it's just a
fuel it's an energy but my grandmother is a coal miners
daughter you know my brother my well my uncles are coal
miners ones one was a president of a coal company worked his
way up from in high school digging coal to owning the
company in winning awards for environmental practices because
you can do that too but so taking into account that I did come
from a family of coal miners but it was back in my grandmother
generation it's with her siblings that I learned about
these going to family reunions with them I'm not exactly
someone who cares about the past and this is my grandfather's
influence he's a very non nostalgic person and so that's
what I learned from him was that that's a past energy you
know gasoline the question union should have been gone in
the seventies to him you know we need to be moving into other
technologies but he's also the guy who thinks that the worst
thing the government ever did was you know not fun NASA at
the same rate it was during the sixties so again he's your
grandfather sounds like a cool guy exactly what I was going
to say anything space program doesn't earn enough sounds to
that's a point in my book well it's he's a guy who thinks
okay so I think my grandfather would have been a great
economist actually because when I was in seventh grade there
was a we had to build a bridge in our little to have a little
river that goes through a little creek branch whatever
we want to call it and through the middle of town and so we
had we built a bridge in like 94 and then come 97 we had to
build a new one and they're like why this is a waste of money
and so I'm here in seventh grade and I'm in a group and this
one kid made a statement about how wasteful it was and my
grandfather picks me up from school and we're driving across
the bridge right after class and I said something about why
did we build this bridge and I and he's and I said we're talking
about this in class he said did your teacher say it and I was
like no it was you know so and so and he's like oh that's his
dad talking and he goes through and he explains to me why we
had to build the bridge why was based on an investment due
to the fact that we had it we were building a dyke because we
had a flood in 96 and thus we had to raise the bridge and going
through the steps and explaining there's multiple layers here
and so what happens a lot of times that people are stage one
thinkers it's what's directly in front of them and so he is
very good at trying to think out these extra things and so he
sees NASA as a huge investment in technology and it's because
it's a spin-off it's all about the spin-off and that's the same
with funding research and R&D I mean this is a man who yeah
we're we're starting to run low on time I was wondering you
posted I think this was recently about the populists just one
again in Italy they did they and and you seem to to you were
saying something along the lines of no one seems to realize
that this is a problem or what to do about it or well no
people realize it's a problem but you were saying along like
something along the lines of when will the left wake up and
yeah so I don't use the first the phrase wake up but much like
same Harris that's a horrible book title okay because he kind
of stole it from glimback and glimback stole it from every
other person before him hey they still from the Jehovah's
Witnesses yeah we had a magazine called awake I'm just I'm
not I don't know any of those other references but I think
the book waking up was about raising your consciousness
through meditation that sounds somewhat appropriate at least
I think waking up has been a common metaphor ever since
humans started waking up from sleep sure and all the kids
these days are saying woke like yeah yeah all the things you
gotta learn from you know like talk to your 14 year old
sister to figure out what they mean and I was old and I started
using Urban Dictionary so did she just say oh man now I'm
old so two things with with the populist one I grew with
now Ferguson on this one that Trump is not a fascist and the
left if they believe he is they have misdiagnosed what they're
up against he's a right-wing populist which you can be both
though a lot of fascist start out with populism well a lot of
fascist I mean the first fascist was a populist right well
the fascist appeals certain populist instincts but populists
you know least in the American sense and most of you know
European as well have been you know pretty much buried in
their own weight of bad policy you know when we look at back
to you because you the response to well it's not like populism
is known for good policy either no it's it's all for feel
goods and that's where the where the issue is like you know
there's no there should never be a concern well in the long
run about populism winning you don't think well I'm wishful
thinking because the reason I say that is that you know the
not Ferguson perspective is that there's no reason the long
run because the policies can't sustain themselves.
Well I guess what does winning look like just winning look
like a six million person genocide that seemed like a
populist like wasn't I mean I'm not a historian but I mean
that that looks like a if it wasn't it if it wasn't winning
it was certainly a hard price to the populists losing right
I mean ultimately sure Venezuela is going to go down in
flames or whatever but you don't want to get to well
Venezuela is a left-wing populism if we're going to
dinosaurs the populist and there's other aspects of
this way let's when you say in the long run populism can't
win and okay that's fair but you don't want to go through
the you don't want to go and down phase exactly no and this
is where the progressive saved us in the late eighteen
hundreds the progressive movement I look at the idea in the
U.S. back to systems the movements that created our
institutions and the systems in which we operate under are
basically two and that is the enlightenment that created us
as a country and in the basic institutional framework and
then the progressives who came in and built other institutions
to buttress the enlightenment and these are the lady to
eighteen hundred progressives late eighteen hundred progressive
and early you know nineteen hundred I know nothing about
them and they're basically the people who got water to the
towns they got they got crime down in the cities they were
the ones who made the Federal Reserve they're the you know
they were the ones who in did an income tax that we're able
to finance you know improvements in the economy we should
we should I would like to at some point if you have the
time like just discuss do an episode on the the progressive
history I I I'm a I'm a big fan of actually the radical
Republicans because the progressives were the Republicans
and actually that's when you look at Lincoln Lincoln wasn't
a conservative he might have been an opportunist at early
stages but he was you know he came out of the progressive
and you get in you look at the political writings leading up
to the Civil War and you see the multiple parties that fell
into the Republican Party they were pushing a pretty progressive
agenda at the time and then the Republicans that followed
after that were like the ones who were getting you know creating
the middle class and getting crime down and getting water
taking care for cities so what I'm getting to the story is
when you get so popular so the left needs to be a conscious
of they once won this battle by being progressive and the thing
that right now and I'm going to Sam Harris and I lost his name
is a what do you when British Muslim oh Majid Nawaz Majid
Majid yeah the regressive the the progressives and the
regressives have not been dealt with yet as far as parting
the two and this is where my issue with so every movement
needs to have to regulate itself and we can look at feminism
gets a bad name because of the few bad feminists will the
feminism has as a movement needs to extricate these people
from the movement and make a very hard line that's not
acceptable and the same thing with progressives progressives
need to realize regressives are in their fold and they need
to get you know move these people out of it and they and a
lot of them haven't yet come to that term yet eat surprisingly
to me I think it's but so with that the what I'm concerned
with is it the left doesn't seem to really acknowledge one
