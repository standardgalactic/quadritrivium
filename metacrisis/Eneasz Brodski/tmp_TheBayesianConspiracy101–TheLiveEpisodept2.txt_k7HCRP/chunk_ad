10, 11, 12.
Yes.
10, 11, 9.
No.
OK.
What other patterns could possibly fit this?
1, 5, 10.
Yes.
I've never actually seen anyone do this.
I'll do it in my life when I get home.
I just hope I didn't miss something that invalidated the increasing hypothesis.
OK.
What other hypothesis could possibly fit this that I can actually test?
10, 100, 1000.
Yes.
10, 100, 101.
Yes.
10, 100, 100.
No.
Uh, negative 3, negative 2, negative 1.
Yes.
Uh, negative 3, 2, negative 1.
No.
It feels faster typing than I'm listening to.
I'm not reading the chat right now.
Should I or should I not?
No, no, you're fine.
They're just going through and finalizing or writing down every prediction, putting true or false next to it.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah.
I appreciate you.
Don't read chat.
People are talking about it.
OK.
I will continue not reading chat.
Oh, gosh.
1, 1.5, 2.
Yes.
I know.
1, 2, 5, 2.
It has to be in the news.
Oh, OK.
Hold on.
Sorry.
I mean, that's not that big of a giveaway.
Well, I think that was one of the...
I mean, it's been a while since I've read that chapter, do you think?
You've read it much more recently than I have.
I'm sorry.
The correct answer is no.
Uh, whatever.
Wait, is he on spoilers?
Because I said that.
Oh, you spoiled it.
I spoiled it.
But I didn't spoil the rule.
You corrected me.
Yeah.
How long do we want to send you guessing before we tell?
I think if you make predictions, we'll just leave your predictions right or wrong and then let you try some more.
I feel like pretty high confidence.
I don't know, a number or whatever.
That it's just increasing integers.
That is the rule.
Correct.
OK.
But what's fun is apparently 20% of adults get this wrong on their first guess.
Also, people in the Discord have been doing this with friends and they get some more...
Well, I guess it varies.
I'd have to go through and see how people did it and what their results were.
But a lot of people got varying results.
Like they offered five bucks or something.
And guys, people actually think about it.
I could have sworn when Harry did it, he said that it was any real number.
As long as it was increasing.
You said integers.
I'll just check.
Cool.
So anyway, the point that Harry was making is people rarely try to falsify their own hypotheses.
So often when people do this task, they won't try to...
They won't do anything that would...
I was right.
It's any three real numbers increasing order.
I shouldn't have questions.
I didn't even think about putting more numbers in there.
Maybe...
That's a good point.
Maybe people just don't consider non-integers to be real.
Obviously not by definition, but intuitively, if you think of 1.34, that's not a real number.
You've got 1.34 children.
You can, but...
You can probably go on, too.
I've never seen 1.34 in real life either.
I don't think I've ever seen any numbers.
Yeah, you've seen instances of numbers.
Yeah, I've seen representations of numbers.
Numbers don't really exist.
If you've seen a number written down, that counts as seeing the number, though, right?
I don't know.
I'm just hurting my own brain, though.
You need to ask a philosopher of language or a mathematician or something.
Since you're on here, was there anything you wanted to talk about?
You guys, we've got to talk about the courage to be disliked at some point.
You've got to talk about the what?
The courage to be disliked.
It's a book.
You mentioned that on the episode you were over, right?
Yeah, I did.
It's like one of the other books that I think actually, literally, everyone should read.
I'd love to do an episode on it, sometimes.
You said you were going to do that sometime and get a chance.
I think that's it.
Do you have anyone for that episode?
Yeah, let's do it.
I thought this book was going to be weird.
Yeah, now that I've done an entire book review, that is much more worth than I was expecting.
I love doing book reviews.
It's like, I'm horrible.
I do critical analyses of books for fun.
I mean, I do that with fiction books.
Every time I go to a book club, I post afterwards a book review-ish thing,
but it's really different when you have a non-fiction book making an argument.
That doesn't come naturally to me.
Jess, at some point you mentioned having saved some of your old book reviews,
and I still want to read this.
I just have to go out and read it.
Yeah, I think I showed you.
I mean, I have one of the books that we're currently reading.
Oh, yeah.
I got you.
I'm happy to show you that after we read it.
How long has this gone on?
It's on my laptop also, just as old as that.
It's like 30.
We've been going for a pretty long time.
I went a lot faster than I thought.
Your calendar says it ends at 6.
Is that actually right?
No.
I just took a random end time there.
I had to think over the time that we were doing a lot faster.
I don't think we're going to go to 6.
You're not tethered.
Yeah, when people asked in the text channel how long it was going to go,
I said, hey, it's been two hours-ish since we got over the technical problems
and started the episode.
I thought we just got tired.
I mean, some of us are getting a little bit tired.
I've been tired.
I was born tired, Stephen.
Yeah, I was a group of tired folks.
Anyway, we had the courage to do an episode on it.
It's about that variant psychology.
I think it's useful, basically, just self-help-wise, but also...
It's kind of in the same...
It's weird in that a lot of the lessons are things that...
You can describe them, but then really to understand them,
you have to chew on them for like three months.
Yeah.
That's what we've been doing.
Like a...
It has really good advice.
I guess I should say that, oh, what are you doing?
We're going to be taking one of the pictures.
Yay!
Yeah, let's do this one.
No.
We're all born with stupid smiles.
That's what we're stuck with.
Some people have not stupid smiles.
Like, Stephen's got this.
Export.
So I'm not, like, tired, tired because I'm deaf in today,
which is what we use for...
The cool kids say when they're using the daffodil.
They say I'm daffodil.
But, like, I don't want to burn out either,
nor do I want to burn out our audience.
So we should probably wrap it up, like, in the next 15 minutes or so.
I thought you said you were just dying for a turn.
Well, I didn't...
I think it's Dr. Kylie.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, talk to Kyle.
They had a philosophy thing they wanted to talk about.
Oh, yeah.
Nice.
Kylie said her name was?
They're at Happy Tortoise.
Happy Tortoise, did you want to come in?
Koi says they could do four more hours of this, at least.
It's more than I could do, man.
There.
Glad that we did this, though, because...
Yeah, I think this would be fun.
We have the live channel, and maybe I'll just jump in there
while I'm on board.
It's been a really slow week at work.
It's not uncommon in software to have, like,
basically a code freeze for, like,
