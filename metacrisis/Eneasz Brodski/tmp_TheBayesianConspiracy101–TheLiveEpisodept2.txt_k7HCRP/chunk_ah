Yeah, it's definitely a thing.
The struggle's real.
Inyash, I would add on that it's weird
to know people are taking your advice shit thing.
I recall you commenting another time
on someone saying that about the marriage episode.
Yeah.
And it seemed relevant.
I don't know. Was it you?
I don't know.
I think that you said it certainly
impacts what you're thinking.
I've been told who it was,
but I don't know.
Okay.
Oh my gosh, there's a kitty.
Sorry, that was me.
Oh, that's Zelda?
She's a big sweetheart.
She slept in our bed last night for the first time.
She's come in a couple of times to, like,
wake us up and want attention,
but she's been in our bed for a long time.
She spent the first whole first day
on the top of the cabinets
just, like, getting acclimated.
I thought that she didn't like us and she was nervous.
But, yeah, so the last night,
I didn't even notice that she slept in our bed
until I woke up this morning.
And then she was just all attention wanting
and she wanted this.
And she did that thing where she pushes her face
into your face and, like,
you know, it was just very heartwarming.
So she still doesn't like being...
doesn't want attention, she'll walk away from you,
which we totally respect.
But she hung out with us.
She actually loves us.
We've only been a week, so...
That's a good amount of news.
I appreciate that moment.
How's life back on the East Coast?
I couldn't say.
I'm headed there next week, but I'm in Minnesota.
Oh!
Okay, long trip then.
It was... it worked out pretty great.
A couple of other people, including several from this discord,
went to a rat event in New York for the solstice.
Right, aren't you going?
Yes.
I'm definitely going to try to go.
I need to figure out logistics or whatever.
That sounds like a hell of a drive,
but, you know, if you're daffin...
Oh, well...
It's true.
I've done, like, 24-hour drives.
I wouldn't want to drive that far.
I mean, aside from just the...
I thought it was going to be terrible.
I drove from here to...
Scottsdale, Arizona, for my boot camp.
But New York, that's like...
I mean, like you said, that's 24-hours?
24-hours?
26-hours.
20 if you drive on a champ.
I looked at it.
Yeah.
Actually, on the drive to...
to and from Scottsdale, I felt myself actually really enjoying it.
Like, there's something really great about it,
especially if you're a lecture-related hectic,
just kind of realizing all I have to do is drive.
Oh, yeah.
Uh-oh.
The only thing I'm responsible for doing
right now is driving.
And then you can just kind of chill.
You can look at the scenery.
You can listen to lots of podcasts or audiobooks.
I think Matt Freeman put this on one of his Duke episodes
or one of his podcasts.
But he was like, do you guys remember when you used to listen...
Excuse me.
Do you remember when you used to listen to music in the car?
I can hear myself echoing.
That was driving me crazy.
I didn't listen to music in the car.
I had to disconnect my battery
to clean the terminals and stuff on it a couple weekends ago.
And as at my parents' house, my dad was helping
because it was over Thanksgiving.
And he was like, are you sure, you know,
it's not going to ruin your radio presets or whatever?
And like, I've had this car for six years.
I don't think I have any radio presets.
Like, I have a CD in the car.
And it's the only CD I own
because it's a comedy album by Tom Segura
and signed it when I saw my comedy works.
And I also only keep it in the car in the event
of something, right? So like, I have something to listen to.
So I'm not stuck with my thoughts.
There is no worse hell.
No, that was actually a very big step in my thoughts.
Well, I don't know.
It depends on your thoughts.
I guess.
I like thinking.
So, you know, getting a lot of time to just
sit and think
and work through your life.
I've found podcasts to be a really great...
Like, not having to waste time
on my commute anymore.
Or not having my commute be completely wasted time
has been a large life improvement.
Yeah, yeah, I would agree.
But I think we aren't getting less...
This may be false, completely false.
I fear it's possible that society may be getting
less contemplated on a whole
because we just don't have as much time
to spend alone with our thoughts.
That's true.
I like the recommendations that
I forget the blog,
but there's a professional blogger
recommended people to accept us.
Yes, that was a good one.
Yeah, wasn't that the Slack thing?
Yeah.
I need to do more, like, structured thinking time.
I feel like that would be good for me
to, like, just keep my files in order, you know?
I kind of...
It's not exactly the same, but
meditation is good for that too.
It's kind of sitting there and not thinking,
but you're getting less space
that you don't know how to do it.
If you do make it just
Phoenix, I will...
I have my next project in the works
that I should have a teaser up for
on the Mega Meetup.
Oh, awesome.
Oh, yeah.
They're doing their conference again.
Oh, conference?
Cool.
Yeah, I really enjoyed the one that they did last time.
Was that the New York sources?
If you're in the New York area,
I will be there talking, giving a better
organized version of some of what
I discussed in my own episode.
The chance to sort of call the
interesting broad strokes of the book.
The book itself doesn't...
gestures that it doesn't talk about.
I'm curious to...
check that out.
And I'll give it back to the people who are with me.
Yeah, we should probably wrap it up.
It's been three hours.
Yeah, it's been a bit.
I could make some dinner now and eat.
I haven't eaten since breakfast.
Probably do that.
Yes, that is a good idea.
Human fuel is important.
Okay.
Shall we wrap it up?
Oh, okay.
I guess we will, since this is actually going to be
the episode that we put out on Wednesday as well,
I will say at this point that we're not going to have
an episode in two weeks because, as is traditional,
I'm hoping I didn't clear this with you guys,
but I've never done a Christmas episode for anything
I've ever done because I'm like, fuck it, it's Christmas.
I'm taking it off.
You guys okay with skipping the next one?
Let's get started that way.
Honestly, we probably should.
It's like four hours.
That's well, yeah.
Maybe we will do that then.
That's...
I wish I thought of something like that for what I'm doing.
Next year.
Or you can just say, you know, guys, it's Christmas.
Happy having a week off and with that podcast.
Spend some time with your own thoughts, damn you.
I mean, I guess that's an option,
