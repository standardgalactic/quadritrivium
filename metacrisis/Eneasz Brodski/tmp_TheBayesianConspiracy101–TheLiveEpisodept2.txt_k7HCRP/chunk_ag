I don't think that hurt me being a good person,
but I think just being around good people
is the other main thing.
Like finding good influences for yourself
and you never stop being influenced.
So you just try to surround yourself with
with positive folks.
Yep, that's why I'm with you.
Speaking of which,
our very first caller from Kansas,
was the handle man, forget.
History will tell us when we put it such or that.
That's true, but maybe we can also
get them to join the
Denver, you know,
rationalist trap.
Like it sounds like we might be getting GSB here.
Yeah.
It's true.
Maybe they can import other Kansas people.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, we managed to get Jesse.
That was good fun. Good job, Steve.
He didn't have to try very hard.
I was so out of the jersey.
Cool.
Who brought you here?
Oh, yeah.
I honestly, uh...
You can actually take his headphones
and listen if you want to.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
GSB, did you
still want to talk?
Yeah.
He says it's also important to try
and improve problematic people, which is
true.
And, like, there's...
The best paraphrase I've heard of it,
and this isn't quite the same thing,
but, like, you can't keep other people warm
by setting yourself on fire, right?
Right.
And I know people have done that where they run themselves
dragging and trying to make everyone else happy.
And it's tough.
Because at some point you're like,
okay, now I've got to abandon this person.
Maybe it's a mentality.
And I've been there, too.
I mean, it's a long story,
but he was just the most...
You know, we got in two jobs.
He lost both of them within three days.
This is first shift for one of them.
Just a complete, like...
All right, cool. You're not ready to be helped right now.
And at some point it was like, all right, go...
You got to go fuck up. You got, like, two days.
Get your shit out of here.
But that took a long time.
So it's...
It's a weird balance to strike, because
did you see that, um...
That back and forth, text back and forth,
I posted it on Twitter about the mom
with the trans kid
and a friend.
It was like, I expected it to be,
because it started out with, you made my child sick.
And the response was like,
I am so sorry. Does she have a cold?
What happened? I didn't have any symptoms.
And the mom was like, she wants to be a boy now.
And, uh...
And I thought it was going to go directly into
where all of these things go to,
where one person slams the other one,
side cheers, and everyone on the other side goes like,
this is what's wrong with people on the
other side, whether we left or right, right?
But no, instead the mom was...
The friend was like, really like,
compassionate and caring
and just listened to her and replied.
And like, it ended after...
After going back and forth for, I don't know
how long it must have taken them, 20, 30 minutes.
But it ended with the mom being like,
you know...
I'm glad that my, uh...
My, I guess, I don't know if she was referring...
I don't think she was using son yet,
because she wasn't, you know, quite there.
She was like, I'm glad that my child has
this friend and I will get them a binder
and thank you, I want them
just to be healthy and happy as well.
And it was like the most heartwarming thing I've ever seen.
And...
Having had conversations that are fruitful,
I think it's super valuable, but that's the thing
from keeping a toxic person to your lives,
because it's important to try and help them, right?
Like, if someone's bringing your life down,
I don't know, the other way I guess maybe that's
not that much, so...
I don't, I don't have a large
sphere of people that I'm interacting with,
and almost all of them are by choice.
And the ones that I'm focusing on interacting with,
that I don't like interacting with, I interact with very little.
So, um...
Do you want pictures, yeah?
Yeah, if they want to come on.
Oh, they said this.
All right, thank you.
Oh, an amazing login says,
on net, I left my last partner at a better spot
than they were before we met, but the process
and also I did some bad things I never want to do again.
Sorry about that.
It sounds relatable,
and some situations like that too.
It's really hard, and it's not like
just a balance you can find once and get right
because it's different for every single person you meet.
And like, the thing is too,
you recognize that you did some stuff
that you don't like, and that's growth, right?
Yeah.
And I don't know, I mean, I think I've got a pretty
blas√©, I think it's about everything,
but it's pretty due outlook on like,
what are you going to do from the movie Big Lebowski?
Although he's kind of a loser, but...
You aren't ordained to do this now.
I'm an ordained minister of the Church of the Dudes,
so I don't know, like,
you've recognized something and you grew from it.
I feel really awkward giving that kind of advice.
I'm not equipped, so I'm going to just unmute
GSB and let them jump in.
So be repressionate.
Amazing login, don't worry about it.
The worst part about giving advice is that
someone might take it and then you feel like
it's your fault for whatever the outcome is.
Steve, you said when Zeke said that
he changed his life based on your advice,
you were like, I didn't want that kind of pressure.
Yeah, he was freaked out.
He said, I'm kind of freaked out by hearing that.
Yeah, Zeke Aran,
who's, I don't know if he's in the discord or not,
but he was on one of the shows
and he was in Clara's rooms.
He got into programming by like,
asking why I didn't do it, and he sent me
automated boring stuff, some Python tutorial,
which I always started people with their periods
to start programming, and it's
totally changed the life trajectory
of my
adult life.
He was freaked out that that happened,
and I'm like, I think that's just life, man.
You can all fan comment and change
yourself easily.
I guess that means try to be careful,
but it also just means that's how everyone's life is.
My wife got into social work because
her second roommate in college was a social worker.
Prior to that, she was an art major.
If they hadn't landed
in the same dorm room together,
then they wouldn't, then she probably wouldn't do
what she's doing now, so it's just,
things just happen.
You know, you want to take the driver's seat
as much as possible, but I think
you've got to take what comes out of your room
when you can, too. See, this isn't articulate.
All right, let's just be on real quick
before we call it.
Yeah.
Sonor man, thumbs up.
Howdy.
Great to be back.
We're great to be back.
I'm glad to hear you as well.
I have this problem where I try to, like,
I speak two things, and then I try to say them both.
I'm like, I'm glad you're on, and it's great to hear you,
and then go, I am.
I do that all the time.
