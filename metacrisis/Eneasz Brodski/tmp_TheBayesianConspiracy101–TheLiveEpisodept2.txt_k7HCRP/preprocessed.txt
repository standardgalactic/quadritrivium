Yeah, I wish I could schedule some doggy tags at work.
Do they allow dogs?
Like comfort dogs when they're cancer patients or anything?
Or are they not in there for very long?
No, they're there for a while.
You get to see them, right?
Yeah, you can't have animals around cancer patients generally.
It depends what regimen they're on.
Compromising new system?
There are therapy dogs at the hospital.
I work in an office.
I go to the hospital every so often.
So what do you think about the Jews Day argument?
You were sitting here listening while Stephen and me were moving around.
Honestly, I don't have a lot of opinions about it.
I don't know.
I wish I had something interesting to say about the end of the week.
It's a little bit of a Jews Day argument, but I got nothing.
So I wasn't just been listening.
Yeah, I don't have anything interesting either.
My main thing is like sort of a naive realism where I'm just like,
we're in the world, we'll figure out how later.
And I'm not, I don't burn a lot of fuel.
We're worrying about other universes or whether or not ours is going to end soon.
I worry about us wiping ourselves out.
A good deal.
But I have no, like, I'm not burning any concern on, I don't know,
some mathematical reason for why.
Yeah, exactly.
Nothing like that keeps me up at night.
I think that's the reason to be concerned about things that we ontologically
are incapable of controlling.
I don't think that stops most of us though.
Yeah, I'm very good at it.
One of my special skills in my CV.
I think, I don't know, I think it's kind of good that it's motivating.
I think a lot of the stuff rationalist, the key rationalist community does is
based at least partly on this worry about the possible coming human extinction
doing some good, right?
I mean, I'm not saying ex-risk in general is worth ignoring, but
like it has to be of the kind of thing that you can at least in principle
take action to avoid.
Like you can't avoid the ex-risk of what if you're a Boltzmann brain?
Is that what's pronounced?
Yeah, Boltzmann brain.
You can't do anything about that.
Yeah, the real weird thing about Boltzmann brain is, by the way,
if that's true, then no experiment you have ever done has actually been done.
So there's no reason to think that physics is actual physics, right?
If there are Boltzmann brains, then the probability that the universe
that we know has quantum physics and so on is the actual universe is very low.
So then the mathematics you have for Boltzmann brain is probably wrong.
Very unlikely that you are.
I don't know if that is Boltzmann brain or I think I've heard that before.
So in the quantum fluctuations, particles can come in and out of existence.
There is nothing saying that in theory it is impossible for particles to come
into existence spontaneously that form an entire brain that is in the middle
of thinking a thought or something.
I mean, it's stupid.
It's as stupid as saying like I can walk through a wall because there's nothing
saying that my particles couldn't spontaneously move through the walls particles.
But the argument being that in an infinite universe of infinite space
and infinite time, eventually somewhere that's going to happen
just because literally every possibility will be explored
across all of infinite space and time.
It's very absurd and I can't afford it.
Right, yeah.
Okay, I see Kyle.
Congrats on the episode, folks.
The worst thing is that in an expanding universe, okay,
our lives and galaxies will happen sort of once
and then after a while, galaxies will become too far away to continue happening for real
and you would only really have Boltzmann brain happening every, let's say,
10 to the 10,000 years, whatever.
But that will happen in infinite amount of time and you will only be alive once.
So it's a lot more likely that you are that single Boltzmann brain
that happened throughout time and space and infinite amount of time
than you are really that really living human being.
Which is, of course, why we don't like how the eternal inflation,
which is the theory where the universe sort of goes on forever.
Because then it's really weird.
Yeah.
That's a lot of weakness.
It's kind of funny to think about that.
It's really, I find it always very depressing to think about.
I don't.
Well, I mean.
But again, then people ask me, but why?
I'm like, ah, it's a whole thing.
Yeah.
Steve, just stole your account.
Steve, just stole your account.
I'm just on.
It's called Steve.
Steve.
So it says Steve on there.
It says Stephen on there.
How did I, this is the second time I've done this this month, isn't it?
Well, you get one more.
I'm really sorry.
I don't know what's going on with my brain.
It's a bad brain.
So I'm going to take it back and spank it.
Okay.
All right.
Do we have the next topic?
Sure.
Oh, God.
Thank you.
Watching, watching us to be like glad to meet you.
So.
Okay.
So we're going to have someone else come on now or what?
Um, well.
And so these are in email.
I should see if anybody else wants to come on.
If not, you guys can stay on.
But I want to make sure we have enough time to talk to everyone's as well.
Would anybody else like to come on and say hello or anything?
I will just say real quick.
While we decide who's coming on next that, um, at baby.
I better pronouncing it has emailed a couple of times asking us to do an episode on modern
money theory.
And I try researching that and it is some economic stuff that is well above my skillset.
So unless you guys know about it, then we'll have to have an economist on to help us talk
about to navigate that one.
Probably a good idea anyway.
Yeah.
So it sounds like a cool topic.
We did read some of the PDF age and almost all of it went over my head.
So, um, we are interested in, I'm interested in learning more, but I'm not capable of talking
about it at this point.
So.
Oh, per choise request.
Uh, April wants to talk about the sequences.
And I'm not sure wants to use the correct phrase here, but we're going to use that.
So it sounds more voluntary.
Okay.
Um, so the sequences, they are long and that makes it hard to recommend them to people.
Yeah.
Here does the thing that several times the size of the Bible.
Several being 1.75, I think.
Oh, I thought it was like somewhere between two and three.
But 1.75 is still a lot.
I listened to episode 98 like earlier today while I walk.
So.
Okay.
Yeah.
So I feel like not all of it is essential.
Like a lot of, I think we can edit it down.
Yeah.
I mean, I know they did in rationality.
Yeah.
I mean, they cut out some stuff in that, but it's still like the bulk of the content.
And I think like, I don't know, for a while, I've just sort of had the idea of trying to
write a version with like the vast majority of the content cut out and like distilled
to the base insights, I guess.
I'm not, I'm not sure exactly how effective that would be or whether like you need to
spend a lot of time really engaging the content to absorb any of it.
But I was about to say, I'm really curious how that, if that would work as effective
as it is to try with just maybe one sequel and seeing if I can summarize it without losing
enough information that it's not worthwhile.
Right.
Like I think, and there's no value in reading the whole thing, but you can still get most
of like most important stuff in a shorter work.
It might be worth doing anyway, even if you know, if somebody really doesn't have time
to read it.
Yes.
We managed to give them a few insights from it, then still a knowledge that exists where
knowledge wasn't before.
Yeah, like we rationally abridged exists, but it's like one sentence summaries of everything,
which I think is too short.
It's too abridged.
It's too abridged.
Yeah.
In up-gill or five terms.
It's weird because I've heard a successful story defined as something which is as short
as possible, but cannot be shortened more to give the same experience.
And I mean, that's just a way to explain fiction.
But in my opinion, the point of that is that you need a certain amount of experience to
give emotional valence, which is what you want out of a work of fiction.
And the sequences, like a lot of it, you can get a lot of the information without reading
all the sequences.
A lot of it has been written about before.
There's self-help books, there's textbooks on various topics, but the way it was written
gave it a sort of emotional valence to me that made it stand out where all those other things
just kind of faded into the background of my life.
So I would also like an abridged thing that can give the same sort of emotional thrust.
Yeah, without telling someone here, read this massive holy tomb that we have.
But I wouldn't have the skill to do that.
And I don't know how well it could be done and still retain that stuff.
Because you don't want to tell everybody what you really got to do is be alive in 2009
through 2012 and reading along on the internet.
Because that just doesn't work as actionable advice.
All right.
So in addition to just shortening it, I also think it can be explained in ways that reduce
inferential distance.
Okay.
I saw someone say Up Door 5, which is the book by the ex-KCD Randall Monroe, which like
explained a bunch of stuff using the most thousand, or the thousand most common words
in English.
The thing explainer.
The book is thing explainer.
The original comic was Up Door 5.
So I think a lot of these sequences is catered to the kind of nerdy people that most rationalists
are.
And that if explained using different words, it could probably reach a wider audience.
Yeah.
That's something else that I think is.
Which is, I guess it's sort of a related idea of revising sequences.
It's also a product of its time.
Like a hundred years from now, these sequences aren't going to be useful because there's
so many pop culture references and anime tropes and things that like, you know, if you're
in the culture, but you just won't after a while.
It's like how they make people read the Quran and the original Arabic.
No.
That's Arabic.
Thank you.
But I mean, even so, it's been written like what?
500 years ago, the Quran now?
People aren't going to get the same thing out of it, even written, even reading the original
language they did then.
So on the other hand, it's only been 10 years.
We can do better.
Yeah.
I think it's a bit premature to start worrying about that.
Yeah.
I would be happy if it was still around.
And in the culture.
In the future, but then.
Yeah.
1300 plus years.
Oh, okay.
But I didn't realize it was that long ago.
People are discussing the other shirts always in the XKCD forums.
Okay.
I kind of hate that abbreviation, but it caught on.
What did?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Like if people went around calling me bro, I'd be like, I'm bro.
Although you could be like original claim to it because it's better than just like the
right.
My work handle is always zoos.
Yeah.
Which isn't any short of a zoo.
Right.
But it sounds cooler.
Yeah.
A lot of people do call me he like even among my friends though.
So.
E-Pain.
E-Dog.
Not E-Pain yet.
Haven't caused quite enough pain to them.
I'll keep working on that.
Oh God.
No manual.
Please.
No.
That was a big, yeah.
Yeah.
That was fun.
Biggie.
Uh-oh.
Why are we here?
Here's no audio.
Does anyone else hear audio?
Hi.
Your audio.
I'm hearing audio.
It might have just been internet outage.
Yeah.
Just for sake.
Listen to some tube clogged between here and there.
I've always thought was he was unfairly maligned for that.
That comparison.
I mean.
What?
The Senator who said the internet isn't like a dump truck that comes to your house.
It's a series of tubes.
I think he was unfairly maligned.
Well, I mean, it was clear from context that he didn't really know what he was talking
about.
But on the other hand, a series of tubes is actually a very apt metaphor for the internet.
I mean.
That's, I love that phrase.
And it is a nice visualization, I guess.
Makes sense.
You're constantly streaming data from one node to another.
And you have YouTube.
What runs YouTube?
The tube metaphor.
Oh, okay.
Yes.
I thought I said a dump truck.
Yeah.
I mean, I just because I like stretching metaphors, I could imagine having a faucet with two million
handles.
And that's the one that you talk.
You pull the one.
Don't be one website.
Yeah.
That would be fun.
Steampunk internet.
Exactly.
That was exactly what I was thinking.
That's a series of tubes.
I was remembering steampunk internet.
It was literally a series of tubes.
Awesome.
What is that?
Sorry for getting off the topic real quick.
But what was the music like, Steampunk music?
Oh, you haven't heard of Newark?
That seems like it would give you an alley.
Maybe I have.
I don't know.
How do I describe that genre?
You know what?
I will just, I will send you some of your songs because I haven't heard time thinking
of how I would like whatever compared to you.
So April, you say there is a sequences of Bridget out there.
Okay.
I looked over it, but like I said, it's about one sentence per sequence article.
So I didn't like sit down and read it because I'd already read the sequences.
Okay.
It's a good like resource if you're trying to remember a particular article or something,
I guess, but just reading, I don't think you're, unless you're like meditating deeply on
each sentence in it, you're not going to get much out of just reading it, I think.
Okay.
Macadam says that series of tubes is actually a very bad analogy, except for through the
calculations in the model.
All right.
I am bad.
I live on bad analogies.
I like it.
There it is.
Oh, that's the link in there.
Sweet.
So, or who was it that wanted to start this project to make a more concentrated sequences?
I mentioned it.
I think Jess said that they were also interested in the idea.
Yeah, I'm going to try it.
I'm actually, I haven't said this notification because I keep getting distracted, but I'm
actually going to see if I can take a sequence and cut it down really short without losing
a lot of information or just the emotional balance.
What do you think, April, of the sequence thing, the section that we have on, I want
to say all episodes, but that's a lie, on many of our episodes?
I think it does a good job of explaining it.
I don't always listen to all the episodes all the way through, so I haven't listened
to more than like a handful of the sequence sections, so I don't know if I can give much
of a detailed feedback on them, but they're good content.
I mean, let's be honest, we probably talk about them longer than it takes to read most
of them, so that's, if you're going for...
I don't think listening to them is a replacement for actually reading the sequences, but I think
they can help you, you know, get more out of them, if that makes sense.
I mean, to me, it's almost like we want more of the sequences.
Yeah, that's a good comparison.
Which, speaking of, I am...
I don't know what the word is, I have you next to me, I can at any time go to your house
and shake you and tell me what happened when you talked to Brian, and yet I still have
to wait until Monday to find out what happened.
I am dying.
You can get it in center access if you want it.
Okay.
I don't want to bother you every week, be like, Stephen, tell me everything that I'm going
to hear every hour.
I'd be happy to go over it.
I'd be like, why did I edit this entire episode?
I'm just going to tell it to you.
Yeah, I can tell you guys that.
So he finally got back to me after getting a chance to talk about it with his daughter,
and we'll talk about it out on, I guess, not the episode that's coming out on Monday,
but the one after.
So you guys get the sneak peek.
His daughter did pass the 246 test.
Cool.
Wow.
That is impressive.
That is impressive.
Yeah.
$5.
That is impressive.
That is impressive.
It was a seven-year-old, and she did it too.
So I asked if I could help her with the research.
The insight was that Brian's daughter asked him, hey, how will I know if I'm wrong?
And I'm like, all right, that's it.
She's good enough.
Oh, the 246 test from Methods of Rationality, Phoenix.
Also, I think it's probably the sequence of somewhere.
If not, someone posted in a great link that I've got open on my other computer.
Let's do it online.
I kind of want to give it to Phoenix.
Yeah.
I want to give it to Phoenix.
Phoenix, stop listening right now.
I mean, you can call in a note.
Oh, that would be great.
Phoenix, call in.
Yeah.
We want it.
Oh, no.
No forced communications.
Well, I mean, yeah, you don't have to.
We are not going to force anything on you, but that would be awesome.
The people want it.
So I'm sure they give them the chat.
I totally agree.
Cool.
We could try to choose.
OK.
No pressure.
Just do it for us.
There's something about we want more or something else.
I get it, Robert.
Because Brian, well, please never mind.
I'll find out in two days.
One day.
Oh, my God.
It's Sunday already.
Did I tell you?
I think I did mention, yes, on the writing.
I actually was looking forward to work when I was driving in last month.
Yeah, that was so long ago.
So there was a comment on Reddit where I was reading that comment.
Or you're one about Sherlock, I think.
And it's like Stephen struggled to pronounce the name.
And actually, like, he didn't know.
He doesn't know this is his channel, right?
Yeah, that was a joke.
I can't tell if they found the wrong guy that was joking or not.
Because I don't know how much clearer I could have been.
We did a prequel episode.
And I commented that.
We're recording 100th episode of our podcast this weekend.
It's a room spin at my wedding.
I know who he is.
Who is that?
Yeah.
Oh, the best feedback that I had.
I think that just for my own, like, made me smile for this podcast,
for that we want more one.
That's from Matt Freeman, who did the We've Got Worm podcast,
the one that I consistently talked about how we worked it off for this,
with permission.
And he had said, thank you so much for doing this,
because I now get to be in the seat where I hate that we're mad at the co-host.
Because there was a lot of, like, people being mad at Scott Daly,
who played the role of Brian in their version of the podcast,
The Worm.
And he now gets to be the people who are mad at Scott.
And it was just, he's like, thank you for giving me this experience.
So why were people mad at Scott and why are people mad at Brian?
Like, you're being unfair to the protagonist kind of thing.
I think there's more nuance there, but that's the short version.
Short enough that on there is they made a emoji of it.
And it's a, like, why, but you're being unfair to Taylor.
And yes, Koi, everyone should listen to We've Got Worm,
especially if you've read Worm.
And if you haven't yet and want to read this as a companion podcast,
they do about an art per episode.
And I went through and re-listened to it.
Or rather, I didn't listen to it as it was coming out,
because I already read Worm,
but I listened to it as a standalone thing, like, six months ago,
and it was awesome.
So check it out.
So can we finish on here for the 246?
If they're down.
So yes, twice.
Okay, cool.
Then yeah.
They are down.
So they're in.
And I'm going to go ahead and, we're still bad.
Like, I don't think, like, Tay was talking a while.
So, Tay and April, we are going to let you go,
unless you had anything else to say.
Bye.
Thank you.
I haven't anything else to say.
Thank you so much.
This was a lot of fun.
Thanks for coming in.
Good night.
Yeah, thank you for calling in.
Once we work on the bugs, I want to do these more often.
Yeah, this is great.
I'd be down to talk more often.
I know.
We could do this, like, maybe every December.
Well, we could even do it, like, super frequently,
if we were just to call in from our own computers at home.
And then save a lot of this mic madness.
That's true.
All right.
I'm worried this would get old if it happened very often.
I mean, people would be just trying to do whatever they wanted.
Yeah, that's true.
All right.
Anyway, see you.
And we're going to invite Phoenix on next.
Also, I love your comments on this board.
I know that I don't post it very much,
but I do read almost everything that goes on there.
Yeah, I just talk about it.
Same.
So.
Thank you.
See you.
Cheers.
Thanks for being on.
Phoenix.
I don't even think I'm going to address the role.
Ah, there we go.
How are you doing?
I'm all right.
Excellent.
Dicking around with code things.
Cool.
That reminds me, I was going to mention about summarizing sequences.
It's just free tools for simplifying text.
You've got a really long news article.
No, they're not very good.
They're not very good.
But that might be a good place to just trim it down to.
I think a lot of what they do is find the most important paragraphs
and then just only include those.
Ah, OK.
Yeah, humans are still much better at doing this than machines.
Yeah, I'm all about the shortcuts.
All right.
Are we ready for our online 246 test?
Yes.
We should really quickly introduce Phoenix, maybe.
Do we need to?
I guess we didn't introduce anyone else.
Hi, this is Phoenix.
Hey.
That's right.
Yeah.
Did the replacing guilt thing.
Yeah.
Yeah, you've got the glare and everything.
Yeah.
So yeah, the rule is the 246 task and I don't want to screw this up.
So 246 returns a yes.
Yeah.
The end.
Go ahead again.
You've got to find out what the rule is that produces a sequence of numbers.
We give you the first sequence for free and that sequence is 246.
And you can ask us, give us any sequence of numbers and we'll tell you
whether or not the numbers follow that rule,
whether the rule would create those numbers.
And once you think you have the rule, you know what it is,
then you tell us what you think the rule is.
Cool.
Right?
Yeah.
Now, remember this, but I've never done it before.
So let's do it.
OK.
So 246 is the first sequence.
You get to ask us triplets of numbers.
We will return true or false.
All right.
1, 1, 1.
False.
1, 2, 3.
Yes.
3, 2, 1.
No.
1, 1, 1.
Yeah.
OK.
2, 2, 2.
No.
2, 3, 4.
Yes.
2, 4, 3.
No.
9, 8, 7.
No.
7, 8, 9.
Yes.
OK.
So far, it looks like an increasing thing.
1, 2, 1.
No.
3, 4, 2.
No.
OK.
So far, not generating any hypotheses other than just it's increasing.
Are multiple digit numbers allowed?
Give us a triplicate.
OK.
Sure.
10, 11, 12.
Yes.
10, 11, 9.
No.
OK.
What other patterns could possibly fit this?
1, 5, 10.
Yes.
I've never actually seen anyone do this.
I'll do it in my life when I get home.
I just hope I didn't miss something that invalidated the increasing hypothesis.
OK.
What other hypothesis could possibly fit this that I can actually test?
10, 100, 1000.
Yes.
10, 100, 101.
Yes.
10, 100, 100.
No.
Uh, negative 3, negative 2, negative 1.
Yes.
Uh, negative 3, 2, negative 1.
No.
It feels faster typing than I'm listening to.
I'm not reading the chat right now.
Should I or should I not?
No, no, you're fine.
They're just going through and finalizing or writing down every prediction, putting true or false next to it.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah.
I appreciate you.
Don't read chat.
People are talking about it.
OK.
I will continue not reading chat.
Oh, gosh.
1, 1.5, 2.
Yes.
I know.
1, 2, 5, 2.
It has to be in the news.
Oh, OK.
Hold on.
Sorry.
I mean, that's not that big of a giveaway.
Well, I think that was one of the...
I mean, it's been a while since I've read that chapter, do you think?
You've read it much more recently than I have.
I'm sorry.
The correct answer is no.
Uh, whatever.
Wait, is he on spoilers?
Because I said that.
Oh, you spoiled it.
I spoiled it.
But I didn't spoil the rule.
You corrected me.
Yeah.
How long do we want to send you guessing before we tell?
I think if you make predictions, we'll just leave your predictions right or wrong and then let you try some more.
I feel like pretty high confidence.
I don't know, a number or whatever.
That it's just increasing integers.
That is the rule.
Correct.
OK.
But what's fun is apparently 20% of adults get this wrong on their first guess.
Also, people in the Discord have been doing this with friends and they get some more...
Well, I guess it varies.
I'd have to go through and see how people did it and what their results were.
But a lot of people got varying results.
Like they offered five bucks or something.
And guys, people actually think about it.
I could have sworn when Harry did it, he said that it was any real number.
As long as it was increasing.
You said integers.
I'll just check.
Cool.
So anyway, the point that Harry was making is people rarely try to falsify their own hypotheses.
So often when people do this task, they won't try to...
They won't do anything that would...
I was right.
It's any three real numbers increasing order.
I shouldn't have questions.
I didn't even think about putting more numbers in there.
Maybe...
That's a good point.
Maybe people just don't consider non-integers to be real.
Obviously not by definition, but intuitively, if you think of 1.34, that's not a real number.
You've got 1.34 children.
You can, but...
You can probably go on, too.
I've never seen 1.34 in real life either.
I don't think I've ever seen any numbers.
Yeah, you've seen instances of numbers.
Yeah, I've seen representations of numbers.
Numbers don't really exist.
If you've seen a number written down, that counts as seeing the number, though, right?
I don't know.
I'm just hurting my own brain, though.
You need to ask a philosopher of language or a mathematician or something.
Since you're on here, was there anything you wanted to talk about?
You guys, we've got to talk about the courage to be disliked at some point.
You've got to talk about the what?
The courage to be disliked.
It's a book.
You mentioned that on the episode you were over, right?
Yeah, I did.
It's like one of the other books that I think actually, literally, everyone should read.
I'd love to do an episode on it, sometimes.
You said you were going to do that sometime and get a chance.
I think that's it.
Do you have anyone for that episode?
Yeah, let's do it.
I thought this book was going to be weird.
Yeah, now that I've done an entire book review, that is much more worth than I was expecting.
I love doing book reviews.
It's like, I'm horrible.
I do critical analyses of books for fun.
I mean, I do that with fiction books.
Every time I go to a book club, I post afterwards a book review-ish thing,
but it's really different when you have a non-fiction book making an argument.
That doesn't come naturally to me.
Jess, at some point you mentioned having saved some of your old book reviews,
and I still want to read this.
I just have to go out and read it.
Yeah, I think I showed you.
I mean, I have one of the books that we're currently reading.
Oh, yeah.
I got you.
I'm happy to show you that after we read it.
How long has this gone on?
It's on my laptop also, just as old as that.
It's like 30.
We've been going for a pretty long time.
I went a lot faster than I thought.
Your calendar says it ends at 6.
Is that actually right?
No.
I just took a random end time there.
I had to think over the time that we were doing a lot faster.
I don't think we're going to go to 6.
You're not tethered.
Yeah, when people asked in the text channel how long it was going to go,
I said, hey, it's been two hours-ish since we got over the technical problems
and started the episode.
I thought we just got tired.
I mean, some of us are getting a little bit tired.
I've been tired.
I was born tired, Stephen.
Yeah, I was a group of tired folks.
Anyway, we had the courage to do an episode on it.
It's about that variant psychology.
I think it's useful, basically, just self-help-wise, but also...
It's kind of in the same...
It's weird in that a lot of the lessons are things that...
You can describe them, but then really to understand them,
you have to chew on them for like three months.
Yeah.
That's what we've been doing.
Like a...
It has really good advice.
I guess I should say that, oh, what are you doing?
We're going to be taking one of the pictures.
Yay!
Yeah, let's do this one.
No.
We're all born with stupid smiles.
That's what we're stuck with.
Some people have not stupid smiles.
Like, Stephen's got this.
Export.
So I'm not, like, tired, tired because I'm deaf in today,
which is what we use for...
The cool kids say when they're using the daffodil.
They say I'm daffodil.
But, like, I don't want to burn out either,
nor do I want to burn out our audience.
So we should probably wrap it up, like, in the next 15 minutes or so.
I thought you said you were just dying for a turn.
Well, I didn't...
I think it's Dr. Kylie.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, talk to Kyle.
They had a philosophy thing they wanted to talk about.
Oh, yeah.
Nice.
Kylie said her name was?
They're at Happy Tortoise.
Happy Tortoise, did you want to come in?
Koi says they could do four more hours of this, at least.
It's more than I could do, man.
There.
Glad that we did this, though, because...
Yeah, I think this would be fun.
We have the live channel, and maybe I'll just jump in there
while I'm on board.
It's been a really slow week at work.
It's not uncommon in software to have, like,
basically a code freeze for, like,
basically most of December.
So we haven't been releasing features,
and I don't think I...
Let's see.
Last week, I remember there was a day where I wrote one line of code.
So there's lots of time to not do much.
Oh, man.
I'm just constantly the state of being behind at my job.
Our team is constantly the state of being ahead to the point
where it's the only complaint we have for management,
which is pretty cool, and that's a good complaint to have
because they keep doing work at us.
But they can't make work fast enough for us to do it.
It's not like we're all awesome.
It's that they keep on wrestling how hard work stuff is.
So, Kyle's not responding.
I'm taking a break.
Highly trained neural networks,
can I say how?
Alright, I think we'll let you go
and jump in with highly trained neural network.
That's it.
We're just a highly trained neural network.
Thanks, Phoenix.
See you, Rock.
Bye.
I don't know if I'm being hurt.
You are being hurt.
Yes, how are you?
Perfect.
Hey, guys.
Last week's my own robo calls.
No, it's not.
No, I am a robot.
Please just say you're not a robot.
Of course I'm a robot.
And it's sort of disarming.
But yeah,
so please say the words I'm not a robot.
Can't do that.
It was very bad quality anyway.
It may have been an outage,
but yeah, highly trained neural network disappeared.
As soon as you said, please say the words I'm not a robot.
Oh, they're gone.
That's fantastic.
Sound the robot.
I did it.
All right.
My wife, I crapped out.
Cool.
I think the amazing login just wanted to say hi.
Yeah, sounds good.
Amazing login.
Hi.
Hi, they're amazing.
Hey, I'm here.
Amazing.
Now you can rub that in your friend's faces.
Oh, yeah.
My friends that don't know what this is about.
And also,
I guess,
I literally yesterday
played in front of more people
than would ever hear this.
Like,
a concert.
A concert.
Really?
Oh, nice.
Congrats.
A big church
and about
200 people.
That's awesome.
I can't really rub this into people's faces.
All right.
What instrument do you play?
Viola.
Excellent.
The slightly large violin.
But not the really large violin.
Of course not.
The middle sized violin.
I mean,
it's the second child.
No, it's still
the other one.
It's the bigger one.
Coachella, you actually sit down on the floor, right?
It's bigger than me.
Yeah, exactly.
I can still hold mine
and stand up and play and stuff.
Oh, yeah.
The four cellos, guys, right?
There's this great band
called Apocalyptica,
which just plays on four cellos.
I know them most because
they put out a Metallica cover album.
Or they just do 10 Metallica songs on four cellos.
That sounds really cool.
And they have one cello that is basically James
that feels voice, you know?
It hits all the signals he hits.
Obviously, it's not a human voice, but it's great.
I like it.
They're really good players.
Yeah, and they're going to be here in like a week.
I know. Maybe I should go see them.
Yeah, come on. I'm thinking about it.
Thank you. Thanks for going.
Okay, random people on World of Warcraft
will just be like, hey, have you ever heard of Rasputina?
And I'm like, I've heard of Rasputina
because of my name, but I've never actually heard of Rasputina.
And since I've never heard the name,
that's your handle on some stuff.
Yeah, on World of Warcraft.
I really should go because
here are good things about them.
And I've got nothing else. The only thing is,
it's like the worst holiday.
That will make it better.
I'm not sure I want to be out
with all the people that are celebrating the worst holiday, though.
No, that's my stuff.
Aw, I hate their jobs.
Yes.
Just pretend.
I'm going to get a high-deb shot of Arya to throw everyone's face.
Just pretend it's what, sorry?
Just pretend it's newtonness.
Nailed it.
Awesome.
Sorry, we're being distracted by a cute inner-real-life doggo.
Oh, yeah.
Which is somehow even better than pictures of doggo.
Oh, my medium.
Take advantage of this.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
Do we want to answer some of the two questions?
Oh.
The document before we go?
Um, yeah.
I don't think I actually planned with it.
I don't have any notes.
Could we just unmute?
Okay.
We'll make sure to unmute everybody
or to fix the channel for future live chats.
Don't worry.
As far as the dog...
Oh.
Yeah.
I mean, immortality sounds like its own episode, doesn't it?
Yeah.
So Lucas wrote and wanted us to do one on that.
We will, I promise.
Yeah.
That's the one special address I came up with.
Okay.
This is when I go to unmute people.
Oh, because some people are server-muted
and some people are just not guests.
And so they're regular-muted.
Yeah.
So if I unmute April,
I'm not sure if they'll come back into this or not.
Oh, that's a dog.
Okay.
Are we wrapping it up then?
Um,
I was going to see if Kyle was still on
and wanted to say something.
Hey!
It's just turning into chaos here, man.
Chaos on me?
Yep.
Oh, nope. April's muted again.
Okay.
Um, yeah.
So let's...
let everybody talk and then...
All right.
We are willing
to take one more person in before we go?
That sounds good.
All right. One last person that wants to get in.
I'm not some amazing login. You wanted to say anything else.
I'm sorry. I realize we just
shuffled you off. I'm fairly in too soon.
Well, I think
dogs coming in to save the day
is good enough.
Cool.
All right. Well, thank you for joining us.
Yeah, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
Aw.
Aw, look at that, bro.
Good dogs. Good dogs.
Have a good night.
Thank you.
I know this makes me a terrible person
for half the population,
but I really prefer dogs to cats.
I mean, it's different strokes.
Yeah.
Like, the cool thing about my cat is
if I leave her alone for five hours, she's stoked.
Right.
If you leave a dog alone for five hours, they're like,
oh, my God, her never coming home.
Exactly.
Dogs are so cute.
I don't think most people's morals are quite so specific.
Yeah.
Most people like to exaggerate things.
Like, back when the PC
for smack wars were a thing.
Oh, it should be based on that.
The first thing I asked
to a Google assistant was like,
hey, Google, cats are dogs.
What did you say?
I forgot what it said.
It was like, according to Wikipedia,
dogs are more popular.
Sorry.
Hey, Alexa.
What's better? Dogs are cats.
I like both cats and dogs,
but I'm really more of a
normal person.
Alright.
I don't know if you guys can hear Alexa's super non-commodal answer.
She likes both cats and dogs,
but she's more of a narwhal person.
It's a very good way to not offend any of their customer base.
Hmm.
Respectable.
Agreed.
Yeah.
Immortality, I think, deserves its own thing.
Oh, these are like entire show things, right?
Yeah, actually.
Yeah, it's just that we're trying.
I figured that this would be slower with people calling in, so...
Yeah.
Let's save the feedback for like the next feedback episode.
Feedback for later.
Alright. Any other random stuff
that you guys have as captains of audience?
Yeah, any other questions you want us to answer?
Anybody else want to
talk?
Or just talk about narwhals?
Narwhals is the next big thing.
Great Alexa, with a degreal of conversation.
Oh, GSB wants to come in.
Why are we so lovable?
It's a steal, man.
We've been working hard on this thing.
You should have seen us ten years ago.
Honestly, like...
I was going to deny the claim.
Maybe you're saying that's a joker,
maybe not for me, that's like true.
That's actually true for me.
So, about four years ago,
I had a party at my place,
and I had gotten back in touch with someone
who I'd known in college.
I only went through the one year in college,
and I was like, oh my God, Mark is back,
because in college we were like,
we were friends, we did everything together.
We did the perfect strangers dance together,
and then you jump in my arms at the end,
and I'll catch him.
It was a lot of fun.
But anyways, he came over,
and he was the most annoying, obnoxious person
in the world,
and there wasn't even a camera around.
When he finally left,
I was like, oh thank God, he's finally gone.
Everyone was like, the door didn't close all the way yet.
He might have heard you, you asshole.
I think it would close.
But if it didn't, whatever, I wouldn't want to see him again.
But I don't think Mark is listening if he is.
I apologize.
I'm sure you're a great person, Mark.
You were just nervous that one party or something.
But anyways, after he left,
Chris, one of my friends,
who's been my friend for almost since college,
for the past 20 years or so,
was like, yeah, you were just like him, man.
That's why you guys were best friends.
Like, oh no.
How did you stay my friend?
Because apparently,
I was also one of those desperate for attention
who would do anything, including be annoying,
as long as I get people to look at you, kind of people.
I guess all that shows is character growth
from years in college, right?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I was just responding to
I like social skills in the 20s.
I was just like,
kind of, I don't know, I would just be reading books.
Did you learn to buy reading books?
No.
But playing MMOs.
Oh, that's good one.
They force you to interact with people a lot.
Don't give you much else to do while you're grinding out
the 10,000th law.
I was like anonymous.
The social anxiety of interacting with people
in real life prevented me from
taking chances, talking to strangers,
like,
saying anything that I might
I thought might be controversial at all.
You said you played one of the Korean ones, right?
Right now.
I could have that one from someone else, too.
It was pretty popular for a while.
Even better.
Devolving arcs where you see the person
getting worse and worse.
Like, uh,
let me go.
How about you, Stephen?
How are you so loveable? What happened?
I don't have a good answer for this.
I'm told that I'm nice.
Don't you practice it, actually?
Like you were saying after you watched
Mr. Chargers movie in particular, that I
Well, I have to have heard about that movie existing.
I don't know, like,
yeah, it's hard to
give an answer to that. It doesn't sound like I'm
putting myself on the back.
I'm
afraid to commit to an answer. I think
just try to be nice to people.
I recommend that everyone is doing their own thing.
For the most part, everyone's doing their best.
And, you know, to the point where they're obviously
not, they're obstructing or something, then
it's different. But
everyone's just trying to do what they can
with what they've got.
For what it's worth, you basically like this
when I met you, and when I first met you,
you were still pretty damn dumb.
So you used to have been like this most of your life.
No, mainly just since before I met you.
Maybe since before.
It would have been my early 20s.
Yeah, my
ability to make friends and my relationship
history.
I was finally freed up
from being in a relationship
for the first time in my early
20s. And then shortly after, my wife.
So, which is great.
But I also love saying my wife.
It titillates me every time I get to say that word.
And so, yeah,
I don't have much of a good answer.
So you ended up with the earlier relationship. I've been like toxic.
Oh, yeah.
That was like,
you find out how many boxes you have to check on the
this is an abusive relationship
whisper to be abusive, but you check on
all those boxes.
I think you have to check one of them.
Oh, well, okay.
I know like with some of those, you know,
diagnoses and DSM, it's like you got to click 5 of 7
or something on them.
Yeah, you're right.
That's fair. Yeah.
They hit you, but they don't put you down in public.
So yeah, something like that.
Anyway, yeah, that didn't really like,
I don't think that hurt me being a good person,
but I think just being around good people
is the other main thing.
Like finding good influences for yourself
and you never stop being influenced.
So you just try to surround yourself with
with positive folks.
Yep, that's why I'm with you.
Speaking of which,
our very first caller from Kansas,
was the handle man, forget.
History will tell us when we put it such or that.
That's true, but maybe we can also
get them to join the
Denver, you know,
rationalist trap.
Like it sounds like we might be getting GSB here.
Yeah.
It's true.
Maybe they can import other Kansas people.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, we managed to get Jesse.
That was good fun. Good job, Steve.
He didn't have to try very hard.
I was so out of the jersey.
Cool.
Who brought you here?
Oh, yeah.
I honestly, uh...
You can actually take his headphones
and listen if you want to.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
GSB, did you
still want to talk?
Yeah.
He says it's also important to try
and improve problematic people, which is
true.
And, like, there's...
The best paraphrase I've heard of it,
and this isn't quite the same thing,
but, like, you can't keep other people warm
by setting yourself on fire, right?
Right.
And I know people have done that where they run themselves
dragging and trying to make everyone else happy.
And it's tough.
Because at some point you're like,
okay, now I've got to abandon this person.
Maybe it's a mentality.
And I've been there, too.
I mean, it's a long story,
but he was just the most...
You know, we got in two jobs.
He lost both of them within three days.
This is first shift for one of them.
Just a complete, like...
All right, cool. You're not ready to be helped right now.
And at some point it was like, all right, go...
You got to go fuck up. You got, like, two days.
Get your shit out of here.
But that took a long time.
So it's...
It's a weird balance to strike, because
did you see that, um...
That back and forth, text back and forth,
I posted it on Twitter about the mom
with the trans kid
and a friend.
It was like, I expected it to be,
because it started out with, you made my child sick.
And the response was like,
I am so sorry. Does she have a cold?
What happened? I didn't have any symptoms.
And the mom was like, she wants to be a boy now.
And, uh...
And I thought it was going to go directly into
where all of these things go to,
where one person slams the other one,
side cheers, and everyone on the other side goes like,
this is what's wrong with people on the
other side, whether we left or right, right?
But no, instead the mom was...
The friend was like, really like,
compassionate and caring
and just listened to her and replied.
And like, it ended after...
After going back and forth for, I don't know
how long it must have taken them, 20, 30 minutes.
But it ended with the mom being like,
you know...
I'm glad that my, uh...
My, I guess, I don't know if she was referring...
I don't think she was using son yet,
because she wasn't, you know, quite there.
She was like, I'm glad that my child has
this friend and I will get them a binder
and thank you, I want them
just to be healthy and happy as well.
And it was like the most heartwarming thing I've ever seen.
And...
Having had conversations that are fruitful,
I think it's super valuable, but that's the thing
from keeping a toxic person to your lives,
because it's important to try and help them, right?
Like, if someone's bringing your life down,
I don't know, the other way I guess maybe that's
not that much, so...
I don't, I don't have a large
sphere of people that I'm interacting with,
and almost all of them are by choice.
And the ones that I'm focusing on interacting with,
that I don't like interacting with, I interact with very little.
So, um...
Do you want pictures, yeah?
Yeah, if they want to come on.
Oh, they said this.
All right, thank you.
Oh, an amazing login says,
on net, I left my last partner at a better spot
than they were before we met, but the process
and also I did some bad things I never want to do again.
Sorry about that.
It sounds relatable,
and some situations like that too.
It's really hard, and it's not like
just a balance you can find once and get right
because it's different for every single person you meet.
And like, the thing is too,
you recognize that you did some stuff
that you don't like, and that's growth, right?
Yeah.
And I don't know, I mean, I think I've got a pretty
blasé, I think it's about everything,
but it's pretty due outlook on like,
what are you going to do from the movie Big Lebowski?
Although he's kind of a loser, but...
You aren't ordained to do this now.
I'm an ordained minister of the Church of the Dudes,
so I don't know, like,
you've recognized something and you grew from it.
I feel really awkward giving that kind of advice.
I'm not equipped, so I'm going to just unmute
GSB and let them jump in.
So be repressionate.
Amazing login, don't worry about it.
The worst part about giving advice is that
someone might take it and then you feel like
it's your fault for whatever the outcome is.
Steve, you said when Zeke said that
he changed his life based on your advice,
you were like, I didn't want that kind of pressure.
Yeah, he was freaked out.
He said, I'm kind of freaked out by hearing that.
Yeah, Zeke Aran,
who's, I don't know if he's in the discord or not,
but he was on one of the shows
and he was in Clara's rooms.
He got into programming by like,
asking why I didn't do it, and he sent me
automated boring stuff, some Python tutorial,
which I always started people with their periods
to start programming, and it's
totally changed the life trajectory
of my
adult life.
He was freaked out that that happened,
and I'm like, I think that's just life, man.
You can all fan comment and change
yourself easily.
I guess that means try to be careful,
but it also just means that's how everyone's life is.
My wife got into social work because
her second roommate in college was a social worker.
Prior to that, she was an art major.
If they hadn't landed
in the same dorm room together,
then they wouldn't, then she probably wouldn't do
what she's doing now, so it's just,
things just happen.
You know, you want to take the driver's seat
as much as possible, but I think
you've got to take what comes out of your room
when you can, too. See, this isn't articulate.
All right, let's just be on real quick
before we call it.
Yeah.
Sonor man, thumbs up.
Howdy.
Great to be back.
We're great to be back.
I'm glad to hear you as well.
I have this problem where I try to, like,
I speak two things, and then I try to say them both.
I'm like, I'm glad you're on, and it's great to hear you,
and then go, I am.
I do that all the time.
Yeah, it's definitely a thing.
The struggle's real.
Inyash, I would add on that it's weird
to know people are taking your advice shit thing.
I recall you commenting another time
on someone saying that about the marriage episode.
Yeah.
And it seemed relevant.
I don't know. Was it you?
I don't know.
I think that you said it certainly
impacts what you're thinking.
I've been told who it was,
but I don't know.
Okay.
Oh my gosh, there's a kitty.
Sorry, that was me.
Oh, that's Zelda?
She's a big sweetheart.
She slept in our bed last night for the first time.
She's come in a couple of times to, like,
wake us up and want attention,
but she's been in our bed for a long time.
She spent the first whole first day
on the top of the cabinets
just, like, getting acclimated.
I thought that she didn't like us and she was nervous.
But, yeah, so the last night,
I didn't even notice that she slept in our bed
until I woke up this morning.
And then she was just all attention wanting
and she wanted this.
And she did that thing where she pushes her face
into your face and, like,
you know, it was just very heartwarming.
So she still doesn't like being...
doesn't want attention, she'll walk away from you,
which we totally respect.
But she hung out with us.
She actually loves us.
We've only been a week, so...
That's a good amount of news.
I appreciate that moment.
How's life back on the East Coast?
I couldn't say.
I'm headed there next week, but I'm in Minnesota.
Oh!
Okay, long trip then.
It was... it worked out pretty great.
A couple of other people, including several from this discord,
went to a rat event in New York for the solstice.
Right, aren't you going?
Yes.
I'm definitely going to try to go.
I need to figure out logistics or whatever.
That sounds like a hell of a drive,
but, you know, if you're daffin...
Oh, well...
It's true.
I've done, like, 24-hour drives.
I wouldn't want to drive that far.
I mean, aside from just the...
I thought it was going to be terrible.
I drove from here to...
Scottsdale, Arizona, for my boot camp.
But New York, that's like...
I mean, like you said, that's 24-hours?
24-hours?
26-hours.
20 if you drive on a champ.
I looked at it.
Yeah.
Actually, on the drive to...
to and from Scottsdale, I felt myself actually really enjoying it.
Like, there's something really great about it,
especially if you're a lecture-related hectic,
just kind of realizing all I have to do is drive.
Oh, yeah.
Uh-oh.
The only thing I'm responsible for doing
right now is driving.
And then you can just kind of chill.
You can look at the scenery.
You can listen to lots of podcasts or audiobooks.
I think Matt Freeman put this on one of his Duke episodes
or one of his podcasts.
But he was like, do you guys remember when you used to listen...
Excuse me.
Do you remember when you used to listen to music in the car?
I can hear myself echoing.
That was driving me crazy.
I didn't listen to music in the car.
I had to disconnect my battery
to clean the terminals and stuff on it a couple weekends ago.
And as at my parents' house, my dad was helping
because it was over Thanksgiving.
And he was like, are you sure, you know,
it's not going to ruin your radio presets or whatever?
And like, I've had this car for six years.
I don't think I have any radio presets.
Like, I have a CD in the car.
And it's the only CD I own
because it's a comedy album by Tom Segura
and signed it when I saw my comedy works.
And I also only keep it in the car in the event
of something, right? So like, I have something to listen to.
So I'm not stuck with my thoughts.
There is no worse hell.
No, that was actually a very big step in my thoughts.
Well, I don't know.
It depends on your thoughts.
I guess.
I like thinking.
So, you know, getting a lot of time to just
sit and think
and work through your life.
I've found podcasts to be a really great...
Like, not having to waste time
on my commute anymore.
Or not having my commute be completely wasted time
has been a large life improvement.
Yeah, yeah, I would agree.
But I think we aren't getting less...
This may be false, completely false.
I fear it's possible that society may be getting
less contemplated on a whole
because we just don't have as much time
to spend alone with our thoughts.
That's true.
I like the recommendations that
I forget the blog,
but there's a professional blogger
recommended people to accept us.
Yes, that was a good one.
Yeah, wasn't that the Slack thing?
Yeah.
I need to do more, like, structured thinking time.
I feel like that would be good for me
to, like, just keep my files in order, you know?
I kind of...
It's not exactly the same, but
meditation is good for that too.
It's kind of sitting there and not thinking,
but you're getting less space
that you don't know how to do it.
If you do make it just
Phoenix, I will...
I have my next project in the works
that I should have a teaser up for
on the Mega Meetup.
Oh, awesome.
Oh, yeah.
They're doing their conference again.
Oh, conference?
Cool.
Yeah, I really enjoyed the one that they did last time.
Was that the New York sources?
If you're in the New York area,
I will be there talking, giving a better
organized version of some of what
I discussed in my own episode.
The chance to sort of call the
interesting broad strokes of the book.
The book itself doesn't...
gestures that it doesn't talk about.
I'm curious to...
check that out.
And I'll give it back to the people who are with me.
Yeah, we should probably wrap it up.
It's been three hours.
Yeah, it's been a bit.
I could make some dinner now and eat.
I haven't eaten since breakfast.
Probably do that.
Yes, that is a good idea.
Human fuel is important.
Okay.
Shall we wrap it up?
Oh, okay.
I guess we will, since this is actually going to be
the episode that we put out on Wednesday as well,
I will say at this point that we're not going to have
an episode in two weeks because, as is traditional,
I'm hoping I didn't clear this with you guys,
but I've never done a Christmas episode for anything
I've ever done because I'm like, fuck it, it's Christmas.
I'm taking it off.
You guys okay with skipping the next one?
Let's get started that way.
Honestly, we probably should.
It's like four hours.
That's well, yeah.
Maybe we will do that then.
That's...
I wish I thought of something like that for what I'm doing.
Next year.
Or you can just say, you know, guys, it's Christmas.
Happy having a week off and with that podcast.
Spend some time with your own thoughts, damn you.
I mean, I guess that's an option,
but I'm not sure I want to wish that on people, necessarily.
Yeah.
Okay.
I said the interactive episode was great.
Cool.
I'm glad that people enjoyed it
and that it did actually work out.
I was a bit worried, especially in the beginning,
that we weren't going to figure out the technical elements.
We'll work the kinks out for the next one.
And as long as I see Laura and Koi are both in here,
I want to thank you both for your guys' contributions
to the We Want More podcast.
I only use the feed that Koi put together
for my own re-listening
and Laura, your art is awesome.
Oh, Laura, good to hear.
Thanks, Laura. That art is awesome.
Yeah.
And did we ever mention on the podcast
that Jess, you did the art for...
It's been too long, but Jess did the art for our show.
Yeah.
Which was amazing.
Yeah.
Inyash was like, oh, I know somebody who does art stuff,
like when we were first getting started.
And it was perfect.
And then when he came out, it would have been
even a few episodes from like, wait, you're the person
who did that? Yeah.
Sorry.
All right.
Let's say good night.
Good night, everybody. Let's wait for the YouTube.
Yeah, so 30 seconds to see us waiting.
All right.
And we'll see you guys in a month or so.
Yep. Sounds great.
Okay. Bye. Awesome. Thanks, everybody.
Good night. Thanks.
Thank you.
