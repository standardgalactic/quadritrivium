basically most of December.
So we haven't been releasing features,
and I don't think I...
Let's see.
Last week, I remember there was a day where I wrote one line of code.
So there's lots of time to not do much.
Oh, man.
I'm just constantly the state of being behind at my job.
Our team is constantly the state of being ahead to the point
where it's the only complaint we have for management,
which is pretty cool, and that's a good complaint to have
because they keep doing work at us.
But they can't make work fast enough for us to do it.
It's not like we're all awesome.
It's that they keep on wrestling how hard work stuff is.
So, Kyle's not responding.
I'm taking a break.
Highly trained neural networks,
can I say how?
Alright, I think we'll let you go
and jump in with highly trained neural network.
That's it.
We're just a highly trained neural network.
Thanks, Phoenix.
See you, Rock.
Bye.
I don't know if I'm being hurt.
You are being hurt.
Yes, how are you?
Perfect.
Hey, guys.
Last week's my own robo calls.
No, it's not.
No, I am a robot.
Please just say you're not a robot.
Of course I'm a robot.
And it's sort of disarming.
But yeah,
so please say the words I'm not a robot.
Can't do that.
It was very bad quality anyway.
It may have been an outage,
but yeah, highly trained neural network disappeared.
As soon as you said, please say the words I'm not a robot.
Oh, they're gone.
That's fantastic.
Sound the robot.
I did it.
All right.
My wife, I crapped out.
Cool.
I think the amazing login just wanted to say hi.
Yeah, sounds good.
Amazing login.
Hi.
Hi, they're amazing.
Hey, I'm here.
Amazing.
Now you can rub that in your friend's faces.
Oh, yeah.
My friends that don't know what this is about.
And also,
I guess,
I literally yesterday
played in front of more people
than would ever hear this.
Like,
a concert.
A concert.
Really?
Oh, nice.
Congrats.
A big church
and about
200 people.
That's awesome.
I can't really rub this into people's faces.
All right.
What instrument do you play?
Viola.
Excellent.
The slightly large violin.
But not the really large violin.
Of course not.
The middle sized violin.
I mean,
it's the second child.
No, it's still
the other one.
It's the bigger one.
Coachella, you actually sit down on the floor, right?
It's bigger than me.
Yeah, exactly.
I can still hold mine
and stand up and play and stuff.
Oh, yeah.
The four cellos, guys, right?
There's this great band
called Apocalyptica,
which just plays on four cellos.
I know them most because
they put out a Metallica cover album.
Or they just do 10 Metallica songs on four cellos.
That sounds really cool.
And they have one cello that is basically James
that feels voice, you know?
It hits all the signals he hits.
Obviously, it's not a human voice, but it's great.
I like it.
They're really good players.
Yeah, and they're going to be here in like a week.
I know. Maybe I should go see them.
Yeah, come on. I'm thinking about it.
Thank you. Thanks for going.
Okay, random people on World of Warcraft
will just be like, hey, have you ever heard of Rasputina?
And I'm like, I've heard of Rasputina
because of my name, but I've never actually heard of Rasputina.
And since I've never heard the name,
that's your handle on some stuff.
Yeah, on World of Warcraft.
I really should go because
here are good things about them.
And I've got nothing else. The only thing is,
it's like the worst holiday.
That will make it better.
I'm not sure I want to be out
with all the people that are celebrating the worst holiday, though.
No, that's my stuff.
Aw, I hate their jobs.
Yes.
Just pretend.
I'm going to get a high-deb shot of Arya to throw everyone's face.
Just pretend it's what, sorry?
Just pretend it's newtonness.
Nailed it.
Awesome.
Sorry, we're being distracted by a cute inner-real-life doggo.
Oh, yeah.
Which is somehow even better than pictures of doggo.
Oh, my medium.
Take advantage of this.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
Do we want to answer some of the two questions?
Oh.
The document before we go?
Um, yeah.
I don't think I actually planned with it.
I don't have any notes.
Could we just unmute?
Okay.
We'll make sure to unmute everybody
or to fix the channel for future live chats.
Don't worry.
As far as the dog...
Oh.
Yeah.
I mean, immortality sounds like its own episode, doesn't it?
Yeah.
So Lucas wrote and wanted us to do one on that.
We will, I promise.
Yeah.
That's the one special address I came up with.
Okay.
This is when I go to unmute people.
Oh, because some people are server-muted
and some people are just not guests.
And so they're regular-muted.
Yeah.
So if I unmute April,
I'm not sure if they'll come back into this or not.
Oh, that's a dog.
Okay.
Are we wrapping it up then?
Um,
I was going to see if Kyle was still on
and wanted to say something.
Hey!
It's just turning into chaos here, man.
Chaos on me?
Yep.
Oh, nope. April's muted again.
Okay.
Um, yeah.
So let's...
let everybody talk and then...
All right.
We are willing
to take one more person in before we go?
That sounds good.
All right. One last person that wants to get in.
I'm not some amazing login. You wanted to say anything else.
I'm sorry. I realize we just
shuffled you off. I'm fairly in too soon.
Well, I think
dogs coming in to save the day
is good enough.
Cool.
