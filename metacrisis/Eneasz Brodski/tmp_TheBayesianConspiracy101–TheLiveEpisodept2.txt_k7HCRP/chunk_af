All right. Well, thank you for joining us.
Yeah, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
Aw.
Aw, look at that, bro.
Good dogs. Good dogs.
Have a good night.
Thank you.
I know this makes me a terrible person
for half the population,
but I really prefer dogs to cats.
I mean, it's different strokes.
Yeah.
Like, the cool thing about my cat is
if I leave her alone for five hours, she's stoked.
Right.
If you leave a dog alone for five hours, they're like,
oh, my God, her never coming home.
Exactly.
Dogs are so cute.
I don't think most people's morals are quite so specific.
Yeah.
Most people like to exaggerate things.
Like, back when the PC
for smack wars were a thing.
Oh, it should be based on that.
The first thing I asked
to a Google assistant was like,
hey, Google, cats are dogs.
What did you say?
I forgot what it said.
It was like, according to Wikipedia,
dogs are more popular.
Sorry.
Hey, Alexa.
What's better? Dogs are cats.
I like both cats and dogs,
but I'm really more of a
normal person.
Alright.
I don't know if you guys can hear Alexa's super non-commodal answer.
She likes both cats and dogs,
but she's more of a narwhal person.
It's a very good way to not offend any of their customer base.
Hmm.
Respectable.
Agreed.
Yeah.
Immortality, I think, deserves its own thing.
Oh, these are like entire show things, right?
Yeah, actually.
Yeah, it's just that we're trying.
I figured that this would be slower with people calling in, so...
Yeah.
Let's save the feedback for like the next feedback episode.
Feedback for later.
Alright. Any other random stuff
that you guys have as captains of audience?
Yeah, any other questions you want us to answer?
Anybody else want to
talk?
Or just talk about narwhals?
Narwhals is the next big thing.
Great Alexa, with a degreal of conversation.
Oh, GSB wants to come in.
Why are we so lovable?
It's a steal, man.
We've been working hard on this thing.
You should have seen us ten years ago.
Honestly, like...
I was going to deny the claim.
Maybe you're saying that's a joker,
maybe not for me, that's like true.
That's actually true for me.
So, about four years ago,
I had a party at my place,
and I had gotten back in touch with someone
who I'd known in college.
I only went through the one year in college,
and I was like, oh my God, Mark is back,
because in college we were like,
we were friends, we did everything together.
We did the perfect strangers dance together,
and then you jump in my arms at the end,
and I'll catch him.
It was a lot of fun.
But anyways, he came over,
and he was the most annoying, obnoxious person
in the world,
and there wasn't even a camera around.
When he finally left,
I was like, oh thank God, he's finally gone.
Everyone was like, the door didn't close all the way yet.
He might have heard you, you asshole.
I think it would close.
But if it didn't, whatever, I wouldn't want to see him again.
But I don't think Mark is listening if he is.
I apologize.
I'm sure you're a great person, Mark.
You were just nervous that one party or something.
But anyways, after he left,
Chris, one of my friends,
who's been my friend for almost since college,
for the past 20 years or so,
was like, yeah, you were just like him, man.
That's why you guys were best friends.
Like, oh no.
How did you stay my friend?
Because apparently,
I was also one of those desperate for attention
who would do anything, including be annoying,
as long as I get people to look at you, kind of people.
I guess all that shows is character growth
from years in college, right?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I was just responding to
I like social skills in the 20s.
I was just like,
kind of, I don't know, I would just be reading books.
Did you learn to buy reading books?
No.
But playing MMOs.
Oh, that's good one.
They force you to interact with people a lot.
Don't give you much else to do while you're grinding out
the 10,000th law.
I was like anonymous.
The social anxiety of interacting with people
in real life prevented me from
taking chances, talking to strangers,
like,
saying anything that I might
I thought might be controversial at all.
You said you played one of the Korean ones, right?
Right now.
I could have that one from someone else, too.
It was pretty popular for a while.
Even better.
Devolving arcs where you see the person
getting worse and worse.
Like, uh,
let me go.
How about you, Stephen?
How are you so loveable? What happened?
I don't have a good answer for this.
I'm told that I'm nice.
Don't you practice it, actually?
Like you were saying after you watched
Mr. Chargers movie in particular, that I
Well, I have to have heard about that movie existing.
I don't know, like,
yeah, it's hard to
give an answer to that. It doesn't sound like I'm
putting myself on the back.
I'm
afraid to commit to an answer. I think
just try to be nice to people.
I recommend that everyone is doing their own thing.
For the most part, everyone's doing their best.
And, you know, to the point where they're obviously
not, they're obstructing or something, then
it's different. But
everyone's just trying to do what they can
with what they've got.
For what it's worth, you basically like this
when I met you, and when I first met you,
you were still pretty damn dumb.
So you used to have been like this most of your life.
No, mainly just since before I met you.
Maybe since before.
It would have been my early 20s.
Yeah, my
ability to make friends and my relationship
history.
I was finally freed up
from being in a relationship
for the first time in my early
20s. And then shortly after, my wife.
So, which is great.
But I also love saying my wife.
It titillates me every time I get to say that word.
And so, yeah,
I don't have much of a good answer.
So you ended up with the earlier relationship. I've been like toxic.
Oh, yeah.
That was like,
you find out how many boxes you have to check on the
this is an abusive relationship
whisper to be abusive, but you check on
all those boxes.
I think you have to check one of them.
Oh, well, okay.
I know like with some of those, you know,
diagnoses and DSM, it's like you got to click 5 of 7
or something on them.
Yeah, you're right.
That's fair. Yeah.
They hit you, but they don't put you down in public.
So yeah, something like that.
Anyway, yeah, that didn't really like,
