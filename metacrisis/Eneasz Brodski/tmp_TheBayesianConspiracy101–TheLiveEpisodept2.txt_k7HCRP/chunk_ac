Phoenix, call in.
Yeah.
We want it.
Oh, no.
No forced communications.
Well, I mean, yeah, you don't have to.
We are not going to force anything on you, but that would be awesome.
The people want it.
So I'm sure they give them the chat.
I totally agree.
Cool.
We could try to choose.
OK.
No pressure.
Just do it for us.
There's something about we want more or something else.
I get it, Robert.
Because Brian, well, please never mind.
I'll find out in two days.
One day.
Oh, my God.
It's Sunday already.
Did I tell you?
I think I did mention, yes, on the writing.
I actually was looking forward to work when I was driving in last month.
Yeah, that was so long ago.
So there was a comment on Reddit where I was reading that comment.
Or you're one about Sherlock, I think.
And it's like Stephen struggled to pronounce the name.
And actually, like, he didn't know.
He doesn't know this is his channel, right?
Yeah, that was a joke.
I can't tell if they found the wrong guy that was joking or not.
Because I don't know how much clearer I could have been.
We did a prequel episode.
And I commented that.
We're recording 100th episode of our podcast this weekend.
It's a room spin at my wedding.
I know who he is.
Who is that?
Yeah.
Oh, the best feedback that I had.
I think that just for my own, like, made me smile for this podcast,
for that we want more one.
That's from Matt Freeman, who did the We've Got Worm podcast,
the one that I consistently talked about how we worked it off for this,
with permission.
And he had said, thank you so much for doing this,
because I now get to be in the seat where I hate that we're mad at the co-host.
Because there was a lot of, like, people being mad at Scott Daly,
who played the role of Brian in their version of the podcast,
The Worm.
And he now gets to be the people who are mad at Scott.
And it was just, he's like, thank you for giving me this experience.
So why were people mad at Scott and why are people mad at Brian?
Like, you're being unfair to the protagonist kind of thing.
I think there's more nuance there, but that's the short version.
Short enough that on there is they made a emoji of it.
And it's a, like, why, but you're being unfair to Taylor.
And yes, Koi, everyone should listen to We've Got Worm,
especially if you've read Worm.
And if you haven't yet and want to read this as a companion podcast,
they do about an art per episode.
And I went through and re-listened to it.
Or rather, I didn't listen to it as it was coming out,
because I already read Worm,
but I listened to it as a standalone thing, like, six months ago,
and it was awesome.
So check it out.
So can we finish on here for the 246?
If they're down.
So yes, twice.
Okay, cool.
Then yeah.
They are down.
So they're in.
And I'm going to go ahead and, we're still bad.
Like, I don't think, like, Tay was talking a while.
So, Tay and April, we are going to let you go,
unless you had anything else to say.
Bye.
Thank you.
I haven't anything else to say.
Thank you so much.
This was a lot of fun.
Thanks for coming in.
Good night.
Yeah, thank you for calling in.
Once we work on the bugs, I want to do these more often.
Yeah, this is great.
I'd be down to talk more often.
I know.
We could do this, like, maybe every December.
Well, we could even do it, like, super frequently,
if we were just to call in from our own computers at home.
And then save a lot of this mic madness.
That's true.
All right.
I'm worried this would get old if it happened very often.
I mean, people would be just trying to do whatever they wanted.
Yeah, that's true.
All right.
Anyway, see you.
And we're going to invite Phoenix on next.
Also, I love your comments on this board.
I know that I don't post it very much,
but I do read almost everything that goes on there.
Yeah, I just talk about it.
Same.
So.
Thank you.
See you.
Cheers.
Thanks for being on.
Phoenix.
I don't even think I'm going to address the role.
Ah, there we go.
How are you doing?
I'm all right.
Excellent.
Dicking around with code things.
Cool.
That reminds me, I was going to mention about summarizing sequences.
It's just free tools for simplifying text.
You've got a really long news article.
No, they're not very good.
They're not very good.
But that might be a good place to just trim it down to.
I think a lot of what they do is find the most important paragraphs
and then just only include those.
Ah, OK.
Yeah, humans are still much better at doing this than machines.
Yeah, I'm all about the shortcuts.
All right.
Are we ready for our online 246 test?
Yes.
We should really quickly introduce Phoenix, maybe.
Do we need to?
I guess we didn't introduce anyone else.
Hi, this is Phoenix.
Hey.
That's right.
Yeah.
Did the replacing guilt thing.
Yeah.
Yeah, you've got the glare and everything.
Yeah.
So yeah, the rule is the 246 task and I don't want to screw this up.
So 246 returns a yes.
Yeah.
The end.
Go ahead again.
You've got to find out what the rule is that produces a sequence of numbers.
We give you the first sequence for free and that sequence is 246.
And you can ask us, give us any sequence of numbers and we'll tell you
whether or not the numbers follow that rule,
whether the rule would create those numbers.
And once you think you have the rule, you know what it is,
then you tell us what you think the rule is.
Cool.
Right?
Yeah.
Now, remember this, but I've never done it before.
So let's do it.
OK.
So 246 is the first sequence.
You get to ask us triplets of numbers.
We will return true or false.
All right.
1, 1, 1.
False.
1, 2, 3.
Yes.
3, 2, 1.
No.
1, 1, 1.
Yeah.
OK.
2, 2, 2.
No.
2, 3, 4.
Yes.
2, 4, 3.
No.
9, 8, 7.
No.
7, 8, 9.
Yes.
OK.
So far, it looks like an increasing thing.
1, 2, 1.
No.
3, 4, 2.
No.
OK.
So far, not generating any hypotheses other than just it's increasing.
Are multiple digit numbers allowed?
Give us a triplicate.
OK.
Sure.
