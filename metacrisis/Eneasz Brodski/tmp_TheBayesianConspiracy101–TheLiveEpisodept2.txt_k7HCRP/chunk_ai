but I'm not sure I want to wish that on people, necessarily.
Yeah.
Okay.
I said the interactive episode was great.
Cool.
I'm glad that people enjoyed it
and that it did actually work out.
I was a bit worried, especially in the beginning,
that we weren't going to figure out the technical elements.
We'll work the kinks out for the next one.
And as long as I see Laura and Koi are both in here,
I want to thank you both for your guys' contributions
to the We Want More podcast.
I only use the feed that Koi put together
for my own re-listening
and Laura, your art is awesome.
Oh, Laura, good to hear.
Thanks, Laura. That art is awesome.
Yeah.
And did we ever mention on the podcast
that Jess, you did the art for...
It's been too long, but Jess did the art for our show.
Yeah.
Which was amazing.
Yeah.
Inyash was like, oh, I know somebody who does art stuff,
like when we were first getting started.
And it was perfect.
And then when he came out, it would have been
even a few episodes from like, wait, you're the person
who did that? Yeah.
Sorry.
All right.
Let's say good night.
Good night, everybody. Let's wait for the YouTube.
Yeah, so 30 seconds to see us waiting.
All right.
And we'll see you guys in a month or so.
Yep. Sounds great.
Okay. Bye. Awesome. Thanks, everybody.
Good night. Thanks.
Thank you.
