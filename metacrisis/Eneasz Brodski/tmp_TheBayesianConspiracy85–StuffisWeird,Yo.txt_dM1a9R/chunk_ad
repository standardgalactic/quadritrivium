a woman by herself and then me and so again i'll plan my phone but i also like it's dark
out i don't want to be having the screen illuminating my face because i'm also at a physical
security risk being outside at night and so like i don't want to be blinding myself playing on my
phone or getting deliberately too immersed and so like i want situational awareness and there's
some level where like i'm in charge of my own security being outside so like i tend to not
be completely unarmed and i'm walking around um or if i if i am what are you carrying uh usually
mace nice um but i'm also like just primed for a physical altercation a lot of the time
so like i i mean maybe this is from a handful of them as a as a teenager or something but
and being small but like i mean i think it makes perfect sense that like if i'm worried
about being attacked i should just be kind of aware that i could be attacked and like what am i
gonna do and so um you know i i look up on mindful of threats and you know people coming or whatever
so um it's you're right it's it's a consequence of living in a society that's big enough where you
don't know all your all your neighbors but i guess that the person walking down the street
coming towards the bus stop you know what can they do to make me less nervous like i mean nothing
like just be them like just don't be aggressively scary and by that you just gotta be scared and
muscle through it yeah so i guess that's that's what i'm curious about like what's what's your
responsibility to not free people out i don't think you have a responsibility i think uh
yeah the the person who's scaring the other person has no moral obligation to do something
to calm them down but i still think that it's a good thing to do so i guess like if you want if you
want to put in some minimum good points what what can you do though because i honestly didn't know
how to answer this question like again playing on your phone not talking to them not looking at them
if you can um all those things help but like the ones that like slow down or like change direction
of where you're going or something it's like i'm often like on a schedule like i'm not gonna miss
the train because i'm trying not to startle somebody i'm also not gonna like you know john
millaney had a good bit about this and like it was one of his first things 10 years ago or so
where he was like at the subway station in new york in the middle of the night and there's this
woman ahead of him and it's like one of those like long corridors between stations and she's
kind of giving him the over the shoulder and he's like okay well you know try not to freak her out
and then she just starts running out of nowhere and he's like oh she must hear the train coming
he goes running after her and and of course it ends in a joke but um you know these things happen
right so um i don't think i've ever chased somebody but uh if to the extent that his
his anecdote is true like he accidentally scared the fuck out of somebody right so um i guess i'm
curious i don't know you could always try to make the person less of a stranger be like see like this
game thrones episode or something i feel like talking to them is a way to free people out and
plus i'm only talking to people but that's i don't mean to shut that down that could be the way to
do this i don't know right yeah you could kind of maybe just yell like hey how's your night
i don't know how's it going yeah that sounds terrible i hate the guest culturiness of a lot of
the social signaling safety things that i was talking about i really wish that we could make
it explicit oh sure yeah i'm talking about guest culture versus ask culture guest culture being um
generally what more neurotypical people do where they're playing these little games
and they have plausible deniability it's like when you're flirting with somebody and you're like
hey you want to go out for coffee instead of being like hi would you like to go on a date
i just always assume that going out for coffee is a date unless said otherwise
yeah i'm bad at that uh i would like that we could you know make things explicit like
there's some kind of code word of like hey i'm not i'm not a threat last night i asked you guys
both to coffee this morning so yeah yeah the the problem with yeah the problem with saying
i'm not a threat is that it's easy to say so anyone can say it even people who are a threat
right yeah it's a drag like and in fact that's that's how his joke ends is because like don millenni
he's like in his 20s i think now he's in his 30s but he looks like a child he looks like a tall
teenager okay and so he's like you know like what when he realized that he's freaking out like he's
like what can i do i can't like just run up and grab her and be like don't worry i'm not gonna
rape you i'm a little boy so that's that's not the way to handle a situation and you're right like
anyone can say that right and frankly if i were to go up to somebody at the train station they're
like you know 10 feet away like i'm not gonna attack you like that's something that would definitely
be said by somebody who's about to attack them right so unless there was the i don't know it would
take a very different kind of society yeah society had like already talked about and pre-arranged
this stuff i don't know yeah you're right though i feel like like the societal level that this
conversation is happening on isn't anywhere near that point yet yeah right and also you
could just fake the signal exactly yeah it's weird so what would be something that would be hard to
fake yeah i got nothing i don't know if if you're a guy and you're worried about freaking out a girl
you could always like start talking about your boyfriend or something that at the very least would
it could just aren't like yeah away some concerns about sexual assault but if you're
Ted Bundy you'd say that should anyway right just to get them to lower their guards so you
can attack them i don't know like that's the thing if you're if you're the most paranoid person
yeah that is lying that is lying yes um but if you're the most paranoid person out there and
you're terrified i guess i was just curious because some of the comments some of the replies
were from people you know i don't want to scroll down too far but um one of them was great if
you're walking your dog talk to your dog it's a nice way to do it no and then of course bonus
points if you don't have a dog and you're just talking to your dog like that's not weird begin
crab walking towards her to show you're just a goofy character with no ill intent um that another
joke but uh like yeah i mean everything makes it so much worse yeah exactly some of these are
are but if any of our listeners have suggestions we're totally up for hearing them it's more like
i don't really i'm yeah that's true too i'm more just like the question itself and how much one
should should how much effort one should put forward to avoid you know in these in any situation
just like make people more comfortable or less afraid like how much background fear you're supposed
to assume from somebody and how much like should you go out of your way um you should it's a nice
thing to do but how much like if it's if i don't typically wear a hood but if if it's raining and
i have a jacket with a hood i'll put it up right but walking you know at night with the hood it can
be spooky so like if it's if it's raining and it's i've got my hood up i'll take my hood off and let
my head get head get wet to like make somebody more comfortable that's kind of a big sacrifice for me
um i have i have a love hate relationship with hoods because they really make you warmer
but they also cut off all like your peripheral vision so you can't yeah see things from the sides
but i prefer hats i mean whatever it is it's just like you know i it this isn't really probably
face a lot again i'm i very rarely am in a situation where i'm worried about making people
uncomfortable yeah um because i do most of my traveling during daylight hours and crowds so
it's more just like kind of philosophically i don't know how to how to handle situations
like this and it was just something that was online a couple days ago so i guess fake talking to
your phone would probably help and that seems kind of like lying though yeah like a call somebody
you can call your mom more often that's that's true yeah there we go solve two problems at once
hey what are you doing nothing just don't want to freak this person out so i'm calling your mom
how's it going um yeah i don't know uh awesome if anyone's scary but looking was around was there
something you would prefer they do that might make things easier um my problem is that i tend not to
notice like things like height i don't know uh i was actually maybe this is a bit of a tangent
but i was kind of thinking about the way that i'm really bad at noticing this sort of thing
there's this unspoken social rule where if you take a seat somewhere or if someone else is sitting
somewhere you're supposed to sit like kind of across the room from them and then like the next
person to sit down is supposed to kind of divide the distance between the two people until you're
like you only sit next to each other if all the seats that are not like one seat away from people
are filled up yeah uh like when i was in college i would just sit in the same seat every day and
like what i was going for was okay i kind of want to be like up close to the front but not exactly at
the front a little bit off to the side so maybe like the second row with like three seats in that
would just be the seat i would sit in every day and if somebody was sitting like next to it i would
just go over and sit right next to them because like that's my seat and people get kind of freaked
out when you're like they've broken this rule like why are they sitting next to me all these seats
are open right i had the same same kind of situation that i liked doing too because for a lot of
people you have like you're not just there to attend you there because you have like an optimal
learning environment and i had similar goals when sitting at places i can't report what i did with
the room was if the room was uh like if it was nearly empty and the person was next to my seat
or something i don't remember running into that situation too much but you still leave a buffer
seat in movie theaters if you can i've gotten less about that actually okay um it depends
like my favorite seats in movie theaters the ones right behind the section with the bars where you
can put your feet up yeah unless the seats were primed then it doesn't really matter but if the
person is you know if i if i if there's no room to leave a buffer seat and still have the bar i'll
sit next to a person um i've even done it in relatively empty movie theaters which i sort of
now maybe feel awkward about but the the version that i run into as far as like leave the buffer is
you use the edge urinal in the men's room when you when you go in you don't you don't walk into
an empty room use the middle urinal right if there's three yeah and if somebody comes in and
there's three and you're on the right one and they take the middle one they're a psychopath right
so um you leave a buffer urinal unless you absolutely can't so maybe that's the the minimum
level of someone to take in the men's room to not make people uncomfortable there's a similar rule
around like stalls in women's rooms because uh i always just go in the first stall because that's
the one no one uses because it's closest to the door yeah huh seems most convenient yeah but now
i wonder if i'm breaking some other social rule that i didn't know about whoops i always use the
handicap stall because it's the biggest yeah i used to do that and then um i was using the
stall once and a mancap person came in and really needed it i was like i am an asshole yeah that's
what i always worry about having excited i'll do that what if a handicap person comes and now i'm
taking their spot that's a fair concern i think for me it's i mean so far i haven't earned the
situation it's different at work because i know everyone on our floor and none of them need to
use the handicap stall right so in that case i always go for that one yeah when i'm at work yeah
yeah in public it's it must be i mean it depends like for me as far as like a handicap stall my
only thing to keep in mind is that it's handicap accessible it's not handicap reserved right so
like they the like a parking spot is reserved and if you take a parking spot and you don't need it
you're an asshole the the the the stall in the bathroom is to meant meant to be accessible to a
wheelchair it's not meant to be reserved for people in wheelchairs only right so it if you're if you
are using it you're not an asshole so one of the wheelchair is waiting to use it yeah right
at least i'm not right it's up to the person to decide if they're an asshole but i don't feel
bad all right so we had more more rationality stuff to talk about right yeah yeah the first
post we're going to talk about is your rationality is my business anyone want to jump into this or
should i take it i'll read the things all right so uh if someone else chooses to buy lottery tickets
who am i to disagree or what business is it of mine if someone else chooses to believe what
is pleasant rather than what is true i believe that it is right and proper for me as a human
being to have an interest in the future and what human civilization becomes in the future
one of those interests is the human pursuit of truth which is strengthened slowly over the
generations i wish to strengthen that pursuit further in this generation i have a interjection
there to make we talked once a couple years ago about uh clifards the ethics of belief
and that was about i think that had the analogy of like the the the boat captain you know is my
ship seaworthy and stuff and there's a couple points to that to that essay slash thought experiment
but one of them is like there's no such thing really as a personal belief your beliefs to the
extent that i mean you can have personal beliefs that are very you know like preferences or something
but that's not really a belief but you know if you have this kind of like quiet personal belief
like oh um my cars sound to drive on or something right but like you don't care to validate that
it's your fault if it if you get a if it breaks on the road in a way that you could prevent it if
you just kicked your tires first right um i was wondering if we're gonna get a car metaphor car
analogy the original thing is a sea captain but not a lot of us have have practiced captains
captains it captains captaining ships it's true so um yeah the i don't know so i
will finish the the bull points at the point of the post but i agree i think that this is
it does seem like an interesting diversion from liberalism the idea that you know you can
believe your thing and i'll believe mine and we won't fight over it um uh but you know i do think
it's a good thing to be able to help people to to be better i mean that's why we have education and
we encourage people to get educated and in some cases make laws that you have to be yeah well that's
really important for the entire civilization i propose the you know not fight people over it
there's there's an important distinction let's argue against bad ideas but not set their barriers
on fire yes right yeah so it's it's to me you know it be be charitable be nice don't be an ass
or whatever don't scream at people but saying someone's got a bad idea isn't the same as saying
you're a bad person for having it and now i'm going to kill you yeah i'm gonna kick you out of
the group or now we're going to whatever fight um the difference is between making it a personal
attack like yeah your your idea is bad is different than your bed yeah and it's kind of the other
person's fault if they interpret somebody who's saying your idea is bad as you are bad i i agree
and that's partly i think a norm that a lot of people have to get out of and it's hard to do
even with me you know maybe something um personal or uh you know politically charged or something
yeah it's a hard skill to learn but uh i mean like when i was in art school
we had to go through critique and that was basically we were taught how to receive critique
same thing with writing classes um it seems like something that they should teach in school
pretty early on i told you there's a lot of things that i would like you know social skills
uh i'm blanking on other things i don't know instead of teaching the same 250 years of u.s
history over and over for 10 years they could like stop at one of those years for like here's how to
you know all the like i don't think there were philosophy classes at my high school but i mean
critical thinking there were critical thinking classes those were all electives all of the
things that were tangential to like how to like optimize your way to think those are all things
that you don't have to learn in school yeah that was the other thing i was thinking of like you
should learn how to learn in school right like why don't they teach you about spaced repetition and
the i don't know that's frustrating yeah it's because one i think the the answer is that
someone like kaplan or hanson might give us because that's not the point yeah the point is
teach you to be a good little soldier and sit in your desk and shut up and do what you're told
then then you'll be a good work you'll be a good a good uh cubicle monkey so yeah um good little
congan machine that's right so what bullet point where we on the syllogism we desire the syllogism
we desire to avoid runs i think susie said a bad thing therefore susie should be set on fire
so i'm trying to avoid the syllogism by labeling it improper to think that susie
said a bad thing no one should judge anyone ever anyone who judges is committing a terrible sin
and should be publicly pilloried for it pillory is that cool thing where you put your head and arms
in the wed stock oh cool that's a pillory i think so okay pillory was the one where they like tie
you to a post and flog you maybe that's different though i'm i think it's pillory is the thing because
there was a there's a fallout mod or extension that let you build those for settlers and stuff
so if you really hated Preston you could Preston garvey you could put him in the pillory
you're right that's the thing awesome we just looked it up well teaching you stuff listeners
as for myself i deny therefore my syllogism runs i think susie said something wrong therefore
i will argue against what she said but i will not set her on fire or try to stop her from talking
by violence or regulation okay uh the the reason he cites fire specifically is just because a little
bit earlier in the post he talked about how priests literally set people on fire for thinking the
wrong things and um i just wanted to say how interesting how interestingly times have changed
