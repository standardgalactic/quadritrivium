because when he wrote this in i think 2007 or so uh so like what 12 years ago now uh it was a common
thing for people to be like you know just let everyone be man it doesn't matter what they believe
and uh if if some other country practices female genital mutilation well that's their religion
and like the pushback was against people saying you know why why do you even care about this
about making people more rational stop being such an asshole it was often the thing done
said to the new atheists it's like why do you care what religion people have stop being such a dick
let them believe whatever they want to believe right right and now things have come like full circle
where we're at the point where everyone is like you think this political things set slightly different
from me therefore i must yell at you on facebook and you know try to get you fired and or cancel
your show or dox you or do all these things like we have come drastically around to the exact opposite
of what of what this post was supposed to address well yes and no um like totally i remember what
10 years ago i had a debate teacher that was uh um a total moral moral relativist and that was
something that showed up in the class with and she was like just letting you know everything you
guys have to say is an opinion nothing is wrong nothing is right yeah and she even used female
relation as an example oh my god and so i i didn't take clearly a monster right i mean so well yes
i'm charitably but um i liked the uh the top of the post was um you know someone asked in the
comments like why can't we choose for ourselves whether not to care about truth and he says an
obvious snappy comeback is why do you care whether i care about whether someone else cares about the
truth um and that's that's the the you know moral relativists tying their own or i guess shooting
themselves in the foot before they get their boots tied right like they don't hold up moral moral
relativism as like just another relativistic thing that you can choose whether or not to care about
they hold it up as like a moral axiom that you're an asshole if you don't follow and it's like how
can you possibly judge somebody if you're saying the judgment is wrong and not not just like out of
fairness but like just literally look at the structure of your argument um the it is interesting
that we're back around maybe it's because people are finally realizing like oh yeah look this is
what happens you get you get the alabama or the georgia heartbeat bill if you just say oh have
your own private beliefs it's fine um well i'm just been going on for a while though before
even that heartbeat thing i know but that's true since 2014 or so i think they crept back a bit
from theocracy with obama and now we're leaning back into it with trump who's not a fiocrat but
he'll do whatever he wants and he'll do whatever he thinks his supporters want him to do so sometimes
anyway um sorry yeah oh did you have a thing well i was just gonna say that it's
i think people are maybe realizing that this whole wishy washy relativism thing just doesn't
fly because like oh this is what actually happens if i if i tell people it doesn't matter what people
what people do and believe and think right yeah there's also like the the full relativist i think
sam harris put it a really nice way that was like did you come the four relativists no i said the
full relativist position okay harris's reply to that is like if you really think that like
no culture is any better or worse than any other you should just flip a coin when deciding whether
or not to send your teenage daughter to spend a year studying and you know studying or going to
school under the taliban yeah and if you're like no i wouldn't want that for it's like oh then you're
not a relativist right um or you know you're you're gonna place some gymnastics to say well i'm not
a relativist i just prefer that you stay nearby or something right um so yeah i i think it's really
awesome that the principle he laid out applies still perfectly today like back then the problem
was moral relativists and the principle was uh i will i think you said something wrong therefore
i will argue against you not set you on fire or stop you by taking uh stop you from talking
with violence regulation and nowadays we have the exact opposite problem or instead of having moral
relativism everywhere we have people you know calling for punching others in the streets and
doxing people and doing other terrible things and the advice is still if you think someone's wrong
you argue against them you will not set them on fire or try to stop them from talking by
violence or regulation or something it's it's a good principle if it works in either extreme
agreed yeah yeah it's kind of interesting that now we have the violence and regulation yeah
well i'm thinking more of um emotional violence right okay and uh the counterintuitive idea
underlying science is that factual disagreement should be fought out with experiments and
mathematics not violence and edicts this incredible notion can be extended beyond
science to a fair fight for the whole future you should have to win by convincing people
and should not be allowed to burn them this is one of the principles of rationality to which
i have pledged my allegiance i like it and i i that is a good insight that the the advice i mean
it's it's super obvious advice to anybody who i guess cares about the truth or find you know
good good discussion but like don't hit the person you're arguing with like makes sense whether or
not uh you're you're uh you're arguing against people are for that or against it right so um yeah
so speaking of you know man loose tangent feeling stuff we had all episode on on feeling
rationally i think in the first 10 i think we did um so that now we got to the post itself yeah
now we're coming coming back to it um so there's the the popular belief that rationality is excuse
me a popular belief about rationality is that rationality opposes all emotion when people
think of emotion and rationality they are opposed i suspect that they're really thinking of system
one system two which is fast deliberate judgments or excuse me fast perceptual judgments versus
slow deliberative judgments i think we get that less now but that may just be the people that i
hang out with i'm assuming people who are less versed in nerd culture and or uh rationality in
general probably still think of people who are rational like spock or something yeah i still
run into some people who kind of i don't know will be like oh you're getting really emotional about
this thing uh and that's bad oh okay and i i i think it'd probably be example by example but
that sounds like generally a pretty stupid thing to say to somebody but if you're if you're getting
emotional then this is an important part of the post that if you're getting emotional about something
that isn't true um then it's like yeah you should probably stop feeling that way if you can um or
you know at least work to quell those feelings um he uses an absurd example of like you know
believing in goblins tying your shoes but you know like a bad dream or just like a negative
intrusive thought that you have if you're you know you're sitting around and you're like no my
friends really like me and i'm gonna let that bum me out all day and uh you know i've had days where
you know i'm thinking negative thoughts like that and i'm like you know what i'm just making this
shit up yeah but still the correct way of dealing with that is not walking up to that person slapping
them and saying stop doing that no no the the correct response to doing that is to walk up to
yourself and metaphorically slap yourself in the face and say knock that shit off the correct
response is like therapy yeah and it's going to take a long time to work on it so like it's not
like i don't know i guess that's the thing that bums me out about people who kind of are like well
we you know emotions are bad we can't bring emotions into this it's like well sometimes
emotions are the problem and you have to solve them with emotions and also like emotions aren't bad
right if someone's trying to take away your society's reproductive rights you have every
right to be angry and if you're not angry then kind of you're kind of kind of you're reacting
inappropriately yeah it kind of provides your motivation yeah it's hard it's hard to do anything
if you don't feel motivated to do something about it and that feeling is often emotional
and he brings up to that curiosity is an emotion and i don't know if professional
psych psychologists or something would agree with that but to me it is it's a unique feeling
and it's it's it's exhilarating and it's got this component to it of like urgency
and that that feels you know that triggers a physiological response yeah so if you're
going to say emotions bad you say curiosity you know with any drive behind it is bad that seems
weird yeah i guess and my thing yeah obviously if you know you need to talk with somebody to help
get get the right tools to handle that but for me i i try to be at the stage on good days or if i
notice myself spiraling on an intrusive stupid thought i'm if i'm if i'm mindful enough to
notice that i'm doing that i'm okay and i can kind of just like catch myself in that whirlpool
and be like dude knock it off think about something else you know i i if you can do that that sounds
like appropriate right um and even if you're ruining anything that's true you know if you're
noticing yourself getting just swept up and it's ruining your life you know like i've had
bad things happen i'll spend i'll lay i'll lay awake trying to fall asleep thinking about it
and like you know what now's not the time to deal with that and you know a you're not equipped to
deal with it because you're tired b you should be going to sleep so you're less tired and see it's
just there there's no point in going about this in circles in your head so that's why i often read
when i'm going to bed because if i start thinking about something that i don't want to think about
it'll just take my brain over and i can't stop it but if i'm reading that distracts me
focuses all my attention on something else and yeah then i can drift off when i no longer have
that thing needling at me and it's a good use of time i should read more um yeah i think uh
um so he goes on to say i label any motion as not rational if it rests on mistaken beliefs
we kind of talked about that um there's a quote in the post that's you know we should just do one
maybe one of these times just do the 12 virtues of rationality instead of a sequence post yeah
because he quotes those a lot in these um but yeah our emotions arrived from our models of reality
if i believe that it's all sad stuff but whatever um yeah so our emotions arise from our models of
reality if i believe my dead brother my dead brother has been discovered alive i'll be happy
he'll wake up and realize it was a dream i'll be sad pc hajul said that which can be destroyed
by the truth should be my dreaming self's happiness was opposed by the truth my sadness on waking was
is rational there's no truth which destroys it um becoming more rational arriving at better estimates
of how the world is can diminish feelings or intensify them sometimes we run away from strong
feelings by denying facts by flinching away from the view of the world which gives rise to the
powerful emotion if so as you study the skills of rationality and train yourself not to deny not
to deny facts your feelings will become stronger and that's a really good point um i don't know
imagine somebody ignoring signs of a medical problem and they're just like i'm gonna you know
i'm not gonna use these words but i'm in denial i'm gonna ignore that i'm gonna just you know it
doesn't hurt whatever a lot of people do that i've done that yeah it's it's uh and i think the reason
how did i stop doing that was i guess a having these resources to try and do something about it
but b was just like you know what ignoring it isn't gonna make it just because it's scary you're
facing it and it's not worth getting into but i had a concern that i might have had cancer um i mean
whatever uh so um like i and i went this went on for like 10 years and i was like i'm like i'm
probably not dead yet so i'm not dead yet so probably i don't but let's just get this looked at
so um it's uh the the concerns like you look at it and it's like that's terrifying and kind of
just flinch away from it and part of the the training of rationalist is to you know notice
that flinch and like look back at it and say i'm not going to freak out i just need to you know
what what's there what's true and then only through examining it maybe getting a medical
examination maybe just through introspection or whatever can you decide okay this is actually
a problem or it's actually not and i can stop worrying right but the maybe the concern of like
looking into it and that it becomes an actual problem if you identify it like now you've actually
got to deal with it but the thing is this was true either way right this was going to be a problem
whether or not you you discover whether or not you discovered it early through through flinching
into the into the darkness and looking at it or not and if it were cancer it would be so much better
to discover it early and then also if it wasn't cancer it would have been better to discover that
early because then you wouldn't have been freaking out about it for 10 years totally
yeah um so he goes on to say ever since i adopted the rule of that which can be destroyed by the
truth should be i've also come to realize that quote that which the truth nourishes should thrive
unquote i love it i love it me too when something good happens i'm happy and there's no confusion
in my mind whether it's rational or not for me to be happy so i like that a lot and i think
you know there's there's still some i don't know understandable confusions about like
how elated can you be and even me like i tend to not to feel emotions that strongly and i
wish i felt them more strongly but i do i don't i don't i don't have any hang ups i never asked
myself at least out loud in my head like should i be feeling happy about this unless it's something
that i should feel guilty for feeling happy about you know like somebody don't like gets you know
crashes their skateboard or something it's like hot loser i i shouldn't feel good about that um
but if i'm feeling good about something happy happening it's the the things that are tripping
me up about whether or not i should feel good aren't related to like whether it's appropriate for me
to feel emotions it's like should i feel happy about this particular thing or sad about this
particular thing um but it's not like our emotions good or bad i'm past that which is good yeah so
to the extent that i can have an emotional range i let myself have it so yeah going back to the uh
our emotions arise from models of reality you almost didn't read that one because
you said it's about sad things um i have a couple of friends who died when they were really young
and i never got to deal with the emotions around that because everybody else would flinch away from
it and or you know they would do the whole uh well they're not dead they're in heaven
or uh oh let's not talk about that let's not think about that let's distract you from these
things and it took me a very long time to actually be able to look at it and it was actually like
kind of hard for me to be able to ask my partners and my friends like hey can we talk about this
and it's gonna be really uncomfortable for you but for me i need to talk about this and i need to
be sad about it and that's good and people and i my flinching away from it was purely me doing
what you put the post advocated not to do which was death freaks me out yeah less so than it used to um
i i'm still no fan but uh i'm able to talk sanely about it like i mean i never like would literally
freak out and leave the room but i would say like can we talk can we change the subject or i
would like tune out and not listen but um this kind of came to fruition last year in fact my niece
just had her one actually it's her first birthday today um so a couple weeks after she was born my
sister had a bunch of uh blood clots in her brain she noticed some numbness and she said actually
go get this checked out because she's good about getting her medical stuff looked into and uh there
was when she got her epidural that they had screwed something up and she had several blood clots in
her brain which is the last place you want them right so more about pregnancy being terrible yeah
well just don't yeah um in any case what she had was crazy rare so her her response to the
epidural um and it was it was because they fucked it up so just get someone's steady hands to your
epidural um okay yeah i mean the the point is we were going to the hospital to visit and i think
we got there early or like she wasn't able to receive visitors so right till now we're just
kind of walking around pretty pretty hospital uh you know with nice grounds and stuff so um
we got to talking about like you know how i would cope with this and you know how i'd
cope with you know the eventual death of my other family members and stuff and uh she was like it's
good to hear that you're like able to talk about this because last time we talked about this was
like seven or eight years ago and you were like i will completely freaking lose my shit when this
happens oh um i think my exact words were like you know this is hard to say because i still
don't like talking about it um my grandma is in her 80s you know i she won't be my grandma
and rather she probably won't be alive in 15 years right um and i'm anchoring it really far away
even though it's probably probably closer um so uh i don't like that it's that's the worst death
terrible and it freaks me out but i you know what i'm getting at is uh what am i getting at i guess
yeah that you should be at a place where you can talk about stuff and certainly if you can be with
people that uh you should be with people who allow you to experience your feelings and stuff
if it makes them uncomfortable too like you don't be an asshole and show them their throats
yeah but there's something important in noticing that discomfort because then you can kind of aim
yourself at hey death that sucks let's fix it yeah like you kind of have to have like uh
i guess like righteous anger at certain things that you want to fix yeah and we're not all gonna
this actually ties back to my little stupid advice about noticing annoyances right um you know
i don't think all of us are going to be able to have uh ideas as kind of like paradigm challenging
as death is bad um yeah but annoyances are an emotion yes but the thing is is that this is
the the hate the dislike of death that's a popular internationalist community
is the noticing annoyances writ large right yeah like it's just an accepted fact that everyone's
