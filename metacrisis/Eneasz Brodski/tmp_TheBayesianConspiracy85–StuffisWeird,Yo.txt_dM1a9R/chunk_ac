and I loved it and it was a lot of fun and then you know I've kind of given that up because I've
been into the depression thing lately and it's just not as much fun like being social and going
to parties and stuff when I'm not doing that so I'm doing those things less too I guess then if
you're if you're being mindful of it this way you can say you know what fine social sauna it is
we're going to go out and I'm going to I'm going to be the person I am when I'm being social yeah
and you can just make it happen or you can try right kind of that wag the dog's tail sort of thing
here like a fake it till you make it yeah kind of did that when I was learning social skills I was
in MMOs so but uh yeah I put on kind of a social zone of like being this kind of like hyper happy
bubbly person and people responded to it really well and then I realized it's like hey I can also
do this when I'm just interacting with people at my job or at school yeah it works it's crazy yeah I
did a lot of faking it till I made it in confidence and stuff too and I think it's less about like
having made it to like right now I feel like a confident relaxed person and more just like I just
stopped giving a shit and maybe that's maybe that's what it's supposed to be like I think it's a little
of both you know you stop giving a shit a little bit and then also you kind of uh you integrate
some of that personality into your actual persona because it's like this is fun and this is the
pattern that works in these situations and this feels like me now and it's just more relaxed like
I I think it's just the main technique that worked for me in that particular thing was just I when I
was in high school I articulated what is it a spotlight bias before I read that it was that
there was a thing called that yeah where like I was like you know what everyone's paying as much
attention to me as I am to them and I'm barely looking at people yeah and so like no one notices
anything I mean so like I can I can stutter I can not have my clothes look great or something and
no one's going to be like going home and remembering like oh Steven's shirt was stained or something
right so because nobody gives one shit about me which in one in one set in one viewing of that
sentence it's negative but in like the sense of like overcoming social anxiety it's fine and some
people do give us do care but they they're not the average person you're passing yeah generally the
person that cares is the kind of person you don't want to be friends with anyway the person that's
like looking around for stuff to criticize about people right or the people who like who do care
like they care about your well-being and like those are already your friends or something like
but like no one's going to be like oh my god look at how Steven's hair was all fucked up like
anyone who thinks that is like I don't care what you think you say it's one thing to say that and
like but it's a whole other thing to like be able to internalize that not break that way so I don't
know speaking of uh things on Facebook I'm going to jump back to that second bullet point that you
mentioned um I get the feeling that our civilization is really failing at adjusting to current
technologies and by that I mean specifically the social technologies because I think they
have displaced what used to be community and it's sort of destroying the country a bit and we
we have not managed to integrate it and I take this back to the invention of printing press
which uh helped throw Europe into hundreds a hundred years of religious warfare and lots of
murdering because now everybody could talk about religion and read the bible and have their own
interpretations and uh religion became a really important thing that people had very strong opinions
on that to the point where they had to kill people who didn't have the correct opinions
there weren't religious conquests before that there were religious conquests but the printing
press specifically threw Europe into just a hundred years of turmoil interesting let people
know that hey people over there think this thing whereas before they just didn't know and I mean
that's that's one of the specific root causes of liberalism where uh everyone decided you know what
this warfare thing sucks we are simply going to say other people are allowed to be wrong about
religion and not involve it in politics at all you can have your religion we will keep ours we
won't talk about it we won't let laws be influenced by religion I mean one of the big things was
religion was part of the laws which uh oftentimes people have a problem with laws that are contrary
to their religion ruling them anyways uh the Europe eventually managed after all this time to
find a a answer in civilization to the problem of the printing press and I don't think we in
the west have found an answer to the problem of our societies being our our communities being
crumbling away and replaced by this outlet where you only get attention when you are really outraged
and you get your people pay attention to you and compliment you and see that you are doing good
things for the community only when you're specifically attacking someone else because
you have to post on your timeline this person did this terrible thing and that is your contribution
to the group right and so it things keep spiraling worse and worse and we get today's
outrage outrage culture and I think maybe a civilization out there maybe china maybe somewhere
in europe I don't know where somewhere is going to figure out a way to deal with social technology
and not have the only way to that you can contribute to your community being attacking
someone else but uh I don't I get the feeling it's not going to be us and we will not be the
future of humanity um by us I mean specifically US western culture yeah yeah I I don't know I'm
a little bit less pessimistic about that because I think we have already and I don't mean we the
United States necessarily but um I like some of the trends that I'm seeing towards trying to moderate
uh forums comment uh boxes where there's like better filters uh there's I don't know like the
reddit system of being able to up or down vote things um kind of being used in more platforms
cracking down on fake news I'm I'm disheartened by this but I mean I I agree with everything but
like the bummer is that it took more than 15 years to get over the the backlash of of stuff and
you know social media's only been out for less than 15 years right yeah quite a bit less than
15 yeah this might take a little while on the plus side it's a good century but on the plus
side of that though technology I think has this way of accelerating how fast things happen so maybe
we'll like things that get really shitty for like five more years then we'll figure out how this
works and get together yeah I mean it's done a lot of good things to open source culture yeah yeah
and I mean just the idea that you know whatever it is that you enjoy there's an online community
that enjoys it with you yeah that's fantastic and you can research stuff that you wouldn't have been
able to um yeah I mean the the whole point of the foundation in the foundation trilogy was like
well not the whole point but what they were told was like all right everyone we're going to work
together for the next 50 years and build wikipedia and this was like this this endeavor of what hundreds
of geniuses working together on this project it's like yeah we have that now and it was
kind of like just happened and you know nobody that anyone knows worked on it on purpose um
the repository of human although let me like the beginning some people have made made contributions
every a lot of people have but isn't it david eggers that runs more or less wikipedia is that
the guy's name my point is that this wasn't like a concentrated effort like that everyone in the
herd about like the united states spent you know 10 years right two billion dollars building right
it was a volunteer effort by people who were passionate about it yeah this wasn't like cracking
the human genome where it was like this big project that the country was aware of if you're
listening to stuff um so aware of the everything you see is written by crazy people thing yes
and i think like i think that wikipedia actually falls pretty like squarely into that because i
know some people that like comment on wikipedia who uh edit things and they're purely just like
fueled by the someone is wrong on the internet i need to fix it at 3 am the everything is everything
you read is written by crazy people thing is um an observation that 99 percent of people don't put
out any content at all they're entirely consumers right and the one percent of people that do
produce stuff are driven to do so because it's basically a for free effort right are just driven
to do so out of some weird passion to do it uh which makes them yeah so it's strange compulsion which
makes them very different for most people and actually the more it's much worse than 99 percent
and one percent it's something like uh everyone uses wikipedia all the time but the overwhelming
majority of the content is produced by point zero zero zero one percent of the user base
and those people generally spend like eight to twelve hours a day on it it's just really there's
this one guy who uh makes edits someone once tracked his activity every day starts making edits about
8 am every day stops making edits about midnight that's seven days a week that's his entire life
no one knows how he makes money maybe a trust fund maybe he has to live in someone's basement
because he can't get a job because he's maniacally focused on this i would let that guy move into my
basement right i would feed him but a lot of content is done by these really crazy people and
the majority of what you read this is why that's why the the name of the the post is and uh everything
you read is written by crazy people i've definitely heard that it also sounds like something that
would have been covered by saturday morning back with serial rxp too um but that aside like if i
want to just like look up something about it a lovelace like i don't have to go to the library
and find a book that may or may not be written by some idiot and i can just find a fairly well
curtailed biography of you know it a lovelace's life and a contribution to to computer science or
something right yeah so you can yeah you can read all sorts of things how she affected the
the world going forward you can read contrary opinions to people are like well maybe there
were these other people that did yeah yeah the controversial section and as all the citations
at the end yeah it's fantastic yeah and you know there's there's accusations that place like
wikipedia has like a liberal slant or something which i think i think steven colbert put it
fast and he said that reality has a liberal slant um but you know if you're if you're uh
turned off by that then wikipedia is not for you but just the i guess that's one of the benefits
of being connected that way through the internet and um you know again the the community of less
wrong would have been really hard to get out of california if it wasn't for the internet right
yeah it would it would just be ellie isar talking at coffee shops like the few people that like
didn't like leave the room when he started when he got up there started pontificating it would be
like Paris in the 1900s just one guy with a cigarette in his coffee talking to the coffee shop
i think we're more like somebody just like standing on a stump and shouting i'd be the american version
yeah so sitting a revivalist tense all right at the very bottom you have a shuffling feet
whistling vivaldi yeah you guys can let me know if we want to touch this or not i was i think i
know what you're about to say but yeah let's do it because whistling vivaldi i think this was
something that rachel told me about when i was talking to her about this thing that made me
think of it um so uh i'm trying to think of how to go about this i read it several years ago a
i don't know where i read it somewhere on the internet i don't know if it was a
forum i was following or a post on facebook or something but it was a guy who described
himself as like large and black and that what he used to do to avoid scaring i think what he
described as like you know like white women in particular if he was like walking behind them
on the street what he had shoveled his feet loudly on purpose so as they wouldn't be surprised by
his presence and like because he was like well people are people are spooked by me i should you
know try and uh do something to make them less uncomfortable yeah which sounds nice you know whatever
but then i'm thinking so like i'm torn on it because like that sounds fine and nice but then
the downside is like why is it falling you to like change your life to make other people feel better
right and like and this happens to have a racial component too which is which is a heavy thing
large black man and so yeah when i was telling rachel about this she was because i'm still torn
on like how to solve this problem and i'll bring up the other thing about it too um but she had
said that she'd write it uh something ages ago titled whistling bivaldi which is what somebody
else's technique they'd be like oh i'm i'm whistling classical music i'm clearly not you know um a thug
right right so i've heard of some people will uh if they're walking in the same like direction of
someone else and more or less at the same pace they don't want to make them uncomfortable because
you know if someone's following behind you for a while what are they thinking are they trying gonna
mug you or something they'll pull out their cell phone and start fake talking into it
because then you know the person in front of you like okay he's distracted by something else
he's obviously not casing me trying to figure out when he's gonna mug me he's not just gonna
drop the phone and jump me so right yeah people around you feel safer when you're on the phone
and distracted and that's if you're not actually talking to talking to anyone and my technique
is i pull out my phone and i'm looking at it and i'm doing stuff even if like usually this is at
night if i'm worried about startling somebody or you know there's a few minutes i walk i don't know
maybe uh three quarters of a mile a day getting to and from work and so um you know if i'm if i'm
behind somebody or something like that i i'll bring up my phone so like i'm on this i'm not paying
attention to them and that sounds fairly unobtrusive and odds are probably on my phone anyway so
whatever um but what made me think about it was like a few couple days ago there was a post on
the ask men subreddit and it was titled what the fuck are you supposed to do when you walk past a
woman alone at night to let her know you're not a murderer right um and he says that he walks his
dog and stuff and i think walking a dog is probably one thing you can do to that he's already out that
way but the top comment i really liked which was i think this is hard to like implement as actionable
advice but it was run past them as fast as you can so it looks like you're on your way to murder
somebody else then they know they're off the hook and the guy replies should i do it clothed or
unclothed it's like you should have clothes but not be wearing them just talked over your arms
like a knife in your other arms right uh in regard to that question i was thinking um when
steven you said why does it fall on the one person to like be the one who comforts the person who's
scared um i feel like maybe definitely there is a kind of like a male female thing or a racial
component which is shitty but also um people are uncomfortable being in elevators with each other
definitely like regardless of who was behind me if i was walking alone at night and there was a
person walking behind me i would get uncomfortable if it was like an 11 year old girl i would still
be kind of uncomfortable oh i'd be especially uncomfortable as an 11 year old girl that's every
horror movie but i'm i'm kidding and i'm ruining the point i'm sorry no it's fine uh yeah i think
that there's probably an extent to which the person who is making the other person uncomfortable
is feeling very uncomfortable because of that and would like to take steps to alleviate their own
discomfort by leaving it in the other person's discomfort it's like i don't know there's a lot
of social conventions that are just around signaling safety yeah this person is commenting i mean in
his in the body of in the post in the post body it was like um walking his dog etc um yeah it's
clearly coming from a place of like i don't want them to be freaked out and that's because it's
making him uncomfortable to have them feel that way or have him have them have him perceive that
they're feeling that way right right so i guess my my thing is i'm i feel like making reasonable
accommodations in your life to make other people more comfortable makes perfect sense um but like
some of the comments were like well you could cross the street or you could and i'm like that seems
like a long way to go out of your way just to avoid spooking somebody and like i think a lot of
people who are walking around perpetually terrified of everyone around them that seems like their
problem and like it sucks because like they they have something going on but like if you can't
walk to and from you know the grocery store with like the bus stop or whatever without being terrified
of all the people near you that's like your thing that you have to deal with right but i mean this
is this is just a natural consequence of living in a reality where physical violence is possible
and where the city's so large you can't know everybody and yeah that sucks but there's a
lot of shit in life that sucks and you do what you can to make it better and one of those things
is trying not to be the scary person trying to do something to help people i mean it's it's better
in all things considered it's less traumatizing to be the person who has to make accommodations
than to be the person who is scared of being assaulted yeah no totally i guess it's like i
guess what level of background purity assume the person in front of you has right like so there's
several times in areas of the city where i've just been scared to be there you know same here
and i'm like five inches shorter than you so you know i think i i'm i'm relatively lucky in that
sense that i'm probably not walking around scaring a lot of people because i'm five eight so
like once used to be more often but you know once a month or something i'm downtown at night
and i'll walk the train stop and hit the train home and if there's it's a fairly abandoned
platform because it's you know 11 30 at night or something you know i leave as much room as possible
but like i'm still sitting next to you know in the in proximity to a stranger
and i've been mindful of this before like what do i do you know like i've been in the situation
where it's like it's a it's a single it's a it's a by their by what am i trying to say
