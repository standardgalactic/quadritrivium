Welcome to the Basin Conspiracy, I'm Yash Brotsky, I'm Stephen Zuber, I'm Jess Dickey.
Today we're just talking about various miscellaneous things. I want to start this off with something that
I don't want this to become a political podcast because that gets boring really quick, but I would
like to quickly say that Georgia and now Alabama have both passed incredibly restrictive abortion
bills. Georgia having one that says once a heartbeat can be detected, it is now considered a person
and cannot be aborted. So arbitrary. Yeah, not only is it fucking arbitrary, it's a really
stretched definition of a heartbeat because it's just kind of a valve that vibrates and will turn
into a heart eventually. Like the heartbeat at that period sounds like because it's not a heart,
but you know anything they can do to to fuck over anyone who wants an abortion is what they will do
and I know I've said this before so I will not repeat myself too much but I believe that reproductive
control and specifically the right to an abortion as part of that is our civilizations dependent on
that. Our way of life cannot exist without it and it would refer to a patriarchy if we didn't have that
for reasons of necessity really and so I think it is incredibly important that we always have these
rights and I don't know I just I would be terrified to be a woman in those states once this law goes
into effect if it does in fact go into effect. So can I I've got at least all right let me just
get this out one I want to touch on the movie Alien because that's highly relevant here for
reasons that I just learned yesterday. Yes. Two this isn't like a political subject really like
this is just like things that are happening in the world like it would be one thing if we're like
I don't know this I guess I'm gonna give us a political charged topic but yeah but it shouldn't
be I mean yeah I mean yeah you're right it is but like I was talking to somebody yesterday about
how like climate change is a politically charged topic now but like why is science politically
charged right um in any case and maybe why is why is morality politically charged we'll figure
that maybe we can touch on that later but the other thing is I don't really know the specifics of
this of the laws that are being proposed um like I've heard different things from different people
and I haven't looked into it myself so what's what's really going on let's do Georgia if you
don't know if you know each state or if they're the same or whatever but are we talking like
if you go try to get an abortion you're gonna be you know hanged for murder no um prison is the
doctor gonna go to go to prison the doctor yeah okay so I'm also curious I'm not being a lawyer
this is legal at the federal level uh this is not legal anywhere right no no excuse me abortion is
legal at the federal level oh yes so how do I mean states can pass their own laws restricting it in
various ways I feel like if it was this easy they'd have done so already so what's what's going on
well because I'm also an idiot so specifically with Roe versus Wade it was ruled unconstitutional
for states to put uh two strict limits on abortion uh and a lot of people don't like that ruling and
right now they think that with uh a republican president and the the justices that have recently
been installed uh they might be able to get the supreme court to overturn Roe versus Wade so they
are intentionally passing laws that are extremely unconstitutional is I guess the term we use when
something has been ruled unconstitutional by the supreme court right uh they're passing laws that
are inflagrant via opposition violation of the Roe versus Wade ruling so that it can go back up to
the supreme court they're hoping and get that overturned okay that's what I was thinking yeah
and oh that that was the thought process behind it because they're they're not hoping that this is
gonna like change the country they're hoping to get the conversation up to the supreme court where
yeah we've got all the well then they are also hoping that it'll get overturned and so they can
change their individual states to be horrific like this right right right I just I my my understanding
of just hearing about this from the outside was like okay their the plan is to get this back over
the supreme court because now they can win yeah um so that's that's cool so it is pretty political
well it's I'm okay with that I guess this isn't like you know we're not we're not reeling on
Chattanoah right now which again doesn't even sound political to me but whatever uh maybe I don't
have any trouble talking political stuff I get it's boring it's overdone we're not experts and
there's more entertaining and and informed podcasts talk about politics maybe but um so yeah the the
whatever the ruling is like you can't if you go get in portion in Georgia the doctor can be charged
for murder yeah okay or I think this a special uh penalty that they've put in that's not exactly
the same as the murder penalty but yes the doctor gets charged and goes to jail what about the mom
the mom does not that's cool I mean yeah at least there's that there's yeah there is that but um
there's still the fact that you won't be able to get an abortion because doctors don't want to go to
jail yeah and the other thing is that um the fetal heartbeat can be detected at about six to seven
weeks and uh most most women who are pregnant yeah I don't even know that they're pregnant it's
all about six weeks from their last period so this is kind of just a de facto ban on abortion
and the six weeks thing is a little arbitrary it's people don't have an exact date of conception so
it's measured the measurement of six weeks old is six weeks is how long it's been since the woman's
last period so I mean it might only be three weeks but yeah for for most women it's like
I missed a period okay that's weird you wait a few days and you know then you go get a test or
something so you just are barely finding out that you're even pregnant maybe after the six week period
and I guess when people live on the borders these days can you still drive across the
state line to get an abortion there or is there like weird stuff with like getting procedures out
of state I don't know it's it's hard to say because there a lot of times if you cross state lines to
commit a crime you can still be persecuted for it but the the crime committer here is the doctor
performing the procedure right yeah so if the doctor's not I guess if the doctor doesn't go into
Alabama yeah like just so like just another side of the state line north of Colorado and Wyoming
like right across the sign from welcome to Wyoming there's these big tents that sell fireworks
yeah and they're allowed to do that so like I'm assuming if a doctor practiced you know with a
Georgia license set up a tent on the other side of the state line set free abortions or something
that would be committing a crime maybe I don't know that would actually be hilarious if they
did just like set up a whole bunch of abortion clinics all along the border yeah but the downside
from the middle of the state you know like Georgia can be a seven-hour drive to leave the state
yeah not everyone has access to transportation yeah like always it'll hurt the poor the most
yeah it puts an arbitrary hardship on people to make them like figure out that they're pregnant
in time get out of state uh yeah it's not good and it's you know trying to push our country back
into the dark ages I saw a couple funny things on oh whatever the kind of dark political humor
that happens when you know every fucking week in the last four three or four years but it was an
onion headline that was like 12-year-old doesn't think that she or like sexually assaulted 12-year-old
doesn't think that she can handle being a mom on top of all the other things going on so the picture
of a sad little girl yeah the line was like with all the homework that I'm doing and the gym
practice yeah I'm like gonna fit having a kid into this yeah and then there was one that was like
I mean it's whatever this is just political humor so we can leave it out but um yeah that's
weird I don't have a lot I mean obviously it's fucked and like you know like there's
I don't even just to add other than like normal platitudes like people at work were talking about
it and they were like yeah I posted a thing on Facebook and I was asking like all right well
cool are you now gonna like pay for better you know uh like preschool and daycare in this net and
I was like turn to do you leave yeah and I was like I think you know the answer to all these
questions is like no right she's like yeah but that's the point I'm like it doesn't seem like
that adds a lot of the conversation like no the like they're not this is just like
on one hand to to be uncharitable it's like just to fuck you and keep you down because now we've
got the chance to do it and we hate women and stuff on the charitable side like if you really
think like you know for the last whatever since Roe v Wade the United States has been cool with
killing babies and now like this is your chance to like help save those lives that's the nice
motivation from it but I'm not convinced a lot of people actually believe that I've well I think
the true believers do yeah I think a lot of people actually do I don't know how many true
believers there actually are there's a lot of people who say they believe stuff but it's
hard to tell the difference from the outside right I think it's hard to tell the difference
from the inside too um can I add another fact yeah because I just was looking this out so critics
have pointed out that the term fetal heartbeat bill is a misnomer and as much as at that stage
the conceptus is still only an embryo and the heart is not yet connected to a circulatory system
yeah damn scientists when you know things like this yeah it's it's so yeah it's just an arbitrary
I always see these billboards that are like heartbeat in six weeks and like there's a picture
of a fully formed smiling baby on the billboard to like and you're like oh baby with this little
heartbeat I mean it's just really pushing the emotional narrative of this is a you know a person
and it should be treated like a person instead of this is a clump of cells that's starting to form
into something that may someday become a person every year at CSU because it's a state school
they were you know allowed to bring people like protesters were allowed to do stuff right so they
would put up these things that were like probably 10 feet tall like these gigantic signs and it would
be like this is your baby at eight weeks and they're like it's like holding this disgusting little
thing from like you ever should have like CPT that playable teaser for this on hill game in the
bathroom it's disgusting but it's like so they're holding this thing that's like I don't know the
size of like your thumb but it looks like a tiny human and like it then like their hands are covered
in blood or something because they just murdered this thing so like it's just like straight up
bullshit lies and I I have this deep frustration as somebody who cares about the truth and
rationality and and reality that if you're lying to defend your position your position is not worth
defending yeah if and that's like you know I as long as you're talking politics I don't like
Donald Trump and I'm happy to talk all the shit I can about him you know whenever someone asks me
to but what I won't do is like lie and make up stuff about him because there's so much real
ammunition there right and so I guess there's a couple things one there's enough to talk about
without lying if you're if you're complaining about something but the other thing is that
if you fall back on a lie and then someone's like oh that actually is not true
like then they're they have fairly good reason to like be highly skeptical skeptical of everything
else you've said because they've already proven that you've lied in some cases so just just be
honest if you're if I think there's there's this phrase that you know I've heard once or twice about
that that which can be destroyed by the truth should be yeah I think I've heard that yeah I
I'd also like to point out that this is literally a forcing religion into government thing which a
lot of people don't think of it as but it's specifically the evangelical Protestants that
have this beef with abortion and that made it a major thing uh back in the I don't know 50s 60s
I don't remember exactly when they went on their kick but for example uh in a Hebrew in Hebrew
in Judaism in Judaism the the person is not considered to have a soul until it takes its
first breath and usually isn't regarded as something with rights until it begins the
egress from the womb like for the first I don't know few months I don't know exactly how long
it is it's not even considered a separate thing from the woman's body yeah that that makes so
much more sense because it's true yeah yeah well yeah but you know it's there's a lot of religions
that don't think of these things as persons and uh it's specifically the evangelicals that say it is
in sold at conception so it becomes a person then and they are the ones that have pushed this into
the government so basically making their religious beliefs a part of the law one of the things that
can be skeptical of souls as a child was I'm half of a pair of identical twins and if we were in
sold at conception and souls are like this indivisible unit of like Eunice that God gives you or
something it's not clear what a soul is supposed to be but I know that like you're not supposed
to be able to cut them in half and whatever right so either my brother and I either one of us doesn't
have a soul or you share a soul or we share one which you know maybe is but that's I don't remember
reading about that at the bottom yeah but we're not supposed to talk about it okay well maybe that's
why because you're both one half of the soul that could be God has like infinite power so maybe
just copy the soul and then you know now there's two souls that diverged at that point but like
kind of like how funny this conversation is and how like pointless and how we we there's no way
we could like protest any of these things this is like the level of conversation that like I'm
assuming is is confusing high cardinals to this day like debating whether this is true in the in
the faith and like it it's just like I don't know it's like deliberating the speed of the avocados
of vodka dauvra spell right or like can it go through like stone or bugs or what like yeah it's
like how would you this whole I don't know when you would win in the fight versus Thor versus Hulk
right I mean at least that's fun to talk about and there's evidence that you can play this is kind
of fun to talk about too because I'm just like trying to imagine maybe like a 3d animation they might
show children about in soulman we're like you know there's the egg just like coming down the canal
and then like all the sperm and then like one of the sperm implants and then suddenly it just
starts glowing and angels choir you start singing it's like yeah and that's and that's how you get
a soul children I'm sure there's videos like that like oh there's all these hundreds of other
sperm that like don't make it so do they not have a wait what maybe the soul is carried in the egg
maybe yeah then that's the other thing too is what like something you need one of each because
then it's not a person because right yeah but yeah otherwise you'd be killing something every
time you menstruate it well and like and in the case of a twin there's two sperm no that depends
on the like identical twins are one yeah fraternal are two um so the there was a George Carlin joke
about you know because some large percentage of fertilized eggs are flushed out during menstruation
like they just don't latch on to the wall yeah and so like God's the biggest abortion
abortion of all in the universe yeah but of course it's okay when he does it right which we can talk
about when we talk about morality in a bit yeah quite a number of pregnancies and in miscarriage
as well that too yeah like you can get pretty far along and god kills it so it's um I don't know
from the outside this all seems patently ridiculous like more ridiculous than talking about who
went in a fight between Thor and Hulk because at least there's like there's feet evidence of what
they've accomplished in the movie as you've seen these fights right so like there's at least stuff
we can point to um it's I don't know and and you know you're talking about fake stuff you're not
talking about real stuff talking about fake stuff alien you're gonna throw in the movie alien yeah
I just listened to the wonderful doofcast episode on the alien and aliens movies and it was an older
one I think it was episode 31 I have no idea when that came out but I was driving a lot yesterday and
had had at my backlog and me being the complete idiot that I am and I've only seen an alien once
so maybe that's why but um the whole thing is an allegory for like there's tons of like aside
from aliens looking super phallic and there's like tons of like vaginas and penises everywhere on the
ships yeah and the whole thing is a not subtle metaphor for like basically the trauma of like
being scared of being and being raped and being impregnated and all that stuff yeah and it was
apparently the expressed goal of the writer or one of the writers or directors or something to be
like this will be a way to like make men like aware of what it's like to be afraid of this sort of
thing okay um and since many of us saw it as a kid's we you know that was probably lost on us
yeah you don't make any connection as a kid yeah but I'm curious to go back with that in mind
because it totally does you're assaulted by this thing and you're like this thing's pumped into
and you're like holy shit what can I do nothing it's just just gonna happen yeah that's a lot
what it's like and I and it's literal body horror when I was talking to Katrina about pregnancy like
organs are pushed out of the way weird hormones get flushed through you which actually make it
harder to think at one stage of pregnancy that all your tendons start be getting all loose and
your bone mass goes down because you're you're giving bones to this thing living inside you and
everything about it is just this horrific thing that if you don't want it I mean if you do want
it I can understand yeah I'm making the sacrifice then it's like pure magic like I'm giving this
thing part of me to grow like that sounds magical if you want it yeah if you don't it's it's pretty
horrific it's like alien right and uh babies rewire your brain forever too which is really scary
yeah which I've heard some people like which is great if you're going for it but if you're not
that's the thing I mean all right there's only so much to say that isn't said a thousand times
by people who are more eloquent than me on this but like the whole well they can just give it up
for adoption afterwards I think that's a lot easier said than done first of all you're completely
ignoring the trauma of going like just physical trauma yeah carrying and delivering a child which
