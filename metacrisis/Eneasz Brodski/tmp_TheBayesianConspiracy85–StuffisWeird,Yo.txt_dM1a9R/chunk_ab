I can only imagine I'm told right people die I'm told it's uncomfortable and that it's it's
preoccupying but the thing too is like you can't help but bond with this thing it's literally
rewriting your your neurochemistry to make you in love with this thing so giving it up isn't like
I don't know thought it's it's I don't know I mean for someone like me it'd probably be
like a lot like fostering a pet except you know time is 100 because it's being apparent but
you know you fall in love with this thing it's all right well bye forever I won't even have your
phone number and you won't have mine um that that doesn't I don't have anything to add it's just that's
that's not a serious comeback to this right um and as I'm curious is there cut off age at all in
Georgia for you know if you're raped by your stepdad and you're 11 no exceptions cool yeah that makes
perfect sense yeah or maybe it's Alabama that has no exceptions one of the two states had no
exceptions obviously I should I guess whatever caveat though all of my like cool that's awesome
are all jokes yeah the sarcasm is playing on my face but not maybe not in my voice we I just I
anyone who has the means to leave those states I really think should yeah it's it's I understand
it can be hard to leave family and stuff but oh my god get out yeah so on a happier note yes
let's talk about Stephen's noticing and solving annoyances oh yeah so then oh we can do a second
bullet point too or is that the let's jump to that one afterwards all right so this one isn't much but
we get requests fairly often from people wanting to do like an episode I'm like how do you live
like a rationalist in day to day and I think the reason we haven't done an episode like on that yet
is because it's not super straightforward like I don't have a list of things that I am aware of
that I do but now I'm trying to make an effort that when I notice things I'm gonna make a note
and we'll try and touch on them when we can if we get enough we'll do a whole episode or something
I'm sure there's people yeah I was gonna say I feel like I could make like eight episodes
good then yeah so Jess is here we can do this I couldn't I couldn't do this on my own but my my main
thing that I try to do is like just I guess I noticing problems is something that noticing
that things are problems and that they can be solved I think it's a technique all of its own
and I mean there's it's hard to think of like good examples but you know like put on minor
annoyances because I've had a handful of cases where like I'm five or 20 bucks or 20 minutes away
from solving something that I didn't really know was super annoying and so I try to make an effort
now to be every time that I feel like a feeling of like God that's annoying I'm like wait hold on
what is what is going on what exactly can we do about it and a lot of these are like super
background things and so the most recent one again I told I warned you this is super mundane
my engagement ring was too big and I was told when I got it they're like no you should have
this size because you don't want it to be too tight and one guy was like you know what happens when
you get married you can place and you put on a little weight and you'll grow into it I'm like
I feel like your like advice or like get fat enough to wear this ring is really really bad advice
so I was just like you know what finally fuck it I took it back and they tried to
try to be 40 bucks for it I think they forgot when I put it to pick it up which is great
and there's this whole hubbub but the other thing is I don't know this isn't a rationale
rationality technique and more of a bargaining technique but don't just like listen to the
people if they don't if you feel like they're not being reasonable you can argue they want
to be to give my ring up and it might be a week it might be a month before I could get the new one
back but we should and I'm like no I like wearing it I want to keep it until you get the give me
the new one we're like well then we have to call in and ask the provider because whatever I'm like
all right fine but like I don't see where the risk is like you're gonna get this back either way
and if I like destroy this before the other one gets here then you guys just get to keep it you're
not out any money in any case so like I'm not trying to be an asshole here but whatever so anyway
it fits now and now I know like this what it feels like to wear ring that fits I can close my fingers
all the way it doesn't hurt it stays on straight it doesn't fall off in the shower and like again
super small but it was I noticed the second I put this on that like oh there was a lot of like
background anxiety the other one is going to fall off and break or something and I it was
like immediately comforting so I was 20 minutes of effort well I guess if you take the drive to
and from the place twice but it was I was very little effort away from taking off a good deal
like a a noticeable background level of stress but again that's a super boring example real examples
can be things like I don't know my desk chair is uncomfortable like and you just notice like I'm
not comfortable maybe you're a $20 purchase from Amazon away from buying a backpack for that which
I've tried to do this week by two or three of those um I mean again these aren't good examples
but the general thing of like notice problems and anytime I'm annoyed at something now I'm like
what is that okay can I can I identify and fix this yeah and the answer is almost or at least
often yes or you can decide it's not that big of a problem but at least you notice the annoyance
right yeah so that's my little thing not gone yeah I like that I mean one of the things that I often do
well not often do but I like the the the when applying rationality to real life uh doing the
thing where instead of just when you notice a problem using the skills you have researching how
to solve it instead like the example I got was that actors are always when something happens
they come out and they give their opinion they're like we should change this and this and everyone's
like god shut up actors no one cares about your opinion or more dangerously everyone's like oh my
god we believe you right thanks for warning us about vaccines Jim Carrey yeah Jim Carrey's wife
he was in it for a while I will see okay but in any case Jenny McCarthy that's what it was that's
right I can remember in any case they they have this platform and so like well these are the
tools that I have so I'm gonna use them whereas a much better approach is researching what is the
problem how can it be fixed how have similar problems been fixed in the past and then going
about doing those things learning those skills gaining those resources whatever you need to fix
the problem because that's far more effective than trying to throw the few things you have at
something yeah I would also say it's worth looking into whether there's some kind of tool or service
that you can use to do the thing for you yeah that's um kind of a technique that I've been using
more recently I would even take it a step further in uh using kind of a narrow framing tool which uh
narrow framing is when you kind of limit yourself to a number of options because you your brain
doesn't want to think about or isn't creative enough to generate lots of options uh as a solution
to a problem so I like to think about uh cheating like if this were if this were if there's if there
were some way to cheat at this like what would that be like and I'm just kind of like doing a
little thought the exercise about like what are some really sneaky like bullshit ways that I could
cheat yeah and achieve this thing and sometimes you end up coming up with a good idea or at least
you uh it helps you like kind of kickstart the idea like oh okay this is a reasonable way to
maybe go about this or also like hey this actually like seems like it's not really worth my time to
try to solve yeah but uh I like for example hiring a virtual assistant to do the thing
I like uh I mean I'm I'm not a psychopath I think that's just because I read methods of
rationality but one of the things I do to kind of get those intuitions going is like occasionally
you'll have a problem like with a person or like surrounding a person not even like with the person
themselves and our brain would be like you know if they were dead this wouldn't be a problem
and I'm like okay cool thanks for thinking outside the box we're gonna move on to like
other solutions but like at least then like I guess that's not it's not helpful for like that to be
like your only outside the box point but it's nice people to like think outside of like the space of
like usual ways to solve the problem or like ways that you know if you google online like how do you
deal with a stressful whatever and they'll be like oh you know be more stoic or ask them whatever
it's like you know if those solutions aren't working then you know think of other things that
don't involve murder but the murder example is because it's like okay that's definitely outside
the box of advice people would give you right so yeah it usually causes a lot more problems
than it solves too totally you had an update on Matt Freeman spamming microintentions oh yeah
Matt Freeman friend of the show and better rationalist than me um he also writes on less wrong
and so I think several months ago we mentioned he had a post on uh something called spamming
microintentions which is just this like the technique of if you want to do something like
light exercise or finally unload the dishwasher or something kind of just like think to yourself
like think the thought over and over for like you know 45 seconds and if you have this thought
once a second you kind of like just need to do the thing now um so I was talking with him about
this a few months ago and I meant to bring this up but it was at the bottom of the notes not at the
top so I finally found it again that I told him that like the way that I've been doing this now
that I've done the microintention thing is that the second I start spamming the microintention
I just do it like like the second I decide to do the spamming thing I just do it anyway
because I know it's going to work and he's like yeah that's what I do too I think that's like just
the faster version the next level of the technique so that's awesome yeah that's out there um yeah I
think I think he publishes on less wrong under more than a mail as well so but we'll find the
spamming microintentions post and put it in the notes so read his other stuff it's really interesting
yeah that's very good very articulate I have like a lot of the stuff that I've read or heard on
his podcast I'm always like oh man that's like a thought that I had in the back of my mind and
wasn't able to like articulate it and he just said the perfect like version of the thing that I've
been wanting to exist yeah he's he's great at that and then Scott his co-host is really good at that
with uh tv and movies maybe other stuff but I don't hear him talk about that so um that reminds me
you guys finally saw endgame which we we don't want to talk about but now you guys can listen to
the episode that I was on of their podcast I did okay it was a good episode okay I was gonna ask
I don't want to I mean you don't have to flatter me but no it was awesome and I liked how you
several I think at least twice apologize for like I'm sorry about talking all the time but I got all
this stuff to say and yeah it was cool I mean so there was that but the reason I brought that up was
that during the show they were talking about if you haven't seen the movie then I'll I'll skip
exactly what they said but they made or Scott made this kind of um analysis noticing comparison
thing and I just like hey quick meta note this is exactly why I like listening to your show right
I would I didn't really notice that and I'm the kind of guy who's in this movie 10 times without
really putting that together in those words and that's that's great so there's a technique
all on its own of being able to um notice things at the level of like thematics and story yeah like
on the meta level rather than just like what's happening in the show or movie yeah and they
do that great so if you like movies and tv find their their podcast I'm pitching it over and over
but I really liked their episode on uh the sixth sense yes I did too yeah the the way they they
mentioned how the camera is used and how that reinforces the story I was like oh like I don't
I don't really notice camera work I guess when I'm watching and so that didn't occur to me but like
the whole going back and forth between the two characters to create distance never putting
them in the same frame at the same time I was like neat yeah it seems like I'm not used to be a
and now I'm I'm loving that they're doing a series on it because I'm wondering how they're
going to handle like the happening and avatar the last airbender oh god I are they doing avatar
the last airbender too they're gonna have to if they're doing M night okay they better well I
thought there was something along the lines they're only doing things that like he wrote and directed
or something I don't know maybe they're doing airbender movie as well it's gonna be so interesting
because they're one of the things I really like about their show is they're always so positive
about everything they talk about they try to pick out good things I'm sure they'll find good
stuff well Scott Scott like he says he is sick of being called a M night Shyamalan apologist
because he doesn't think there's anything that he's apologizing for but he also hasn't seen avatar
so thankfully I haven't either oh it was yet I've heard I mean it's just a bummer because
there's a lot there's a lot to work with if you like the source material and social materials
awesome I mean he even he like pronounces characters names wrong what like it's on in the movie not
weird it's like how hard is that I mean so it's it's clearly intentional for some weird reason
that I'm not enough of a movie analysis person to articulate I think what happens is like M night
wants to like be more of like himself rather than just like a good well-received director
he like wants to like weird shit like David Lynch or something about like from a different
direction because David Lynch is on flavor special magic version of weird so yeah anyway
we're not a movie podcast okay oh right so this is something that David spoke to us about he was
on our episode not on our episode on our podcast I think a dozen episodes ago talking about
rationalist magic yeah yeah I was talking with him a bit earlier on Facebook and he pointed out that
a philosopher would describe the idea of calling yourself a witch or a wizard a technology of the
self because by changing the way you view yourself and in the way you act you start setting off
different social signals like now that I think of myself as a wizard in this situation I'm going
to act differently and people will also treat you differently because just the subconscious
feeling of the subconscious signals that you send out you know in your body language and your
posture and what you're doing make a difference and people react differently to you and I saw
almost immediately thereafter someone's sharing on Facebook god I hate that I use Facebook but yeah I
do sharing this thing um hot adulting tip making a responsibility sona and role play them when you
have chores to do which is awesome and ties back into the the whole roles thing people really
take up roles very easily and can do them yeah like we usually unconsciously apply roles to
ourselves and that can be limiting but there is some power in being able to pick out from a bunch of
roles such as neurotypical Karen yes the reply to that is this is neurotypical Karen and she
enjoys having good sleep hygiene and returning phone calls and then someone else replied I find
that I'm wearing that if I'm wearing real adult business clothes my work sona can do things like
call people and check my inbox whereas pajama Helen mostly wants to shovel hamburgers into her face
and set things on fire so yeah I like it I I call like just doing adult stuff I just call it
adulting yeah like I've got adulting to do this afternoon so you know I'm gonna be busy um
I I I like David a lot I think that you know the calling it magic magic can be kind of like
duplicitous and that like a mott and bailey thing it's like oh it's not really magic you're just like
doing this but my magic symbols can cause magic number random number generators to give out the
numbers I want so well yeah it if you're calling them both magic it's it David you're great but
it's wishy washy and I have a problem with that particular framing of it but I I do like the
idea of being cognizant of the different hats and roles you can put on and saying all right cool
I'm gonna go be business Stephen for a few hours and then go back and being relaxed Stephen I often
kind of already do that um but I I never explicitly put the hats on I kind of put them on in retrospect
I never uh take advantage of our work jeans Fridays at work because I want my work persona to have
its own uniform so I always wear my khakis and my little polo shirts and I don't wear those outside
of work if I can help it yeah I've been thinking about getting scrubs mostly for that reason scrubs
huh just so I can feel like a real clinical coordinator like they said when I got hired uh
they're like yeah either like you know business casuals fine scrubs are fine and I was just like
okay cool I'm not buying scrubs I already have business casual clothes and now like my coworkers
keep wearing scrubs and I keep looking at them and I'm like they have so many pockets they have
an elastic waist they're like nurse pajamas I need these I didn't realize scrubs had pockets
yeah they have great pockets and they're comfortable they can be really soft and they come
in all kinds of fun patterns and stuff too mm-hmm and it's always cool seeing someone in scrubs in
the grocery store you're like that's a person helping save the world right um you know I'm
I'm walking back a bit on my putting on different hats I more or less trying to force all my hat
to fit at the same time like like I play mostly the same person all the time and like I notice
it different especially like visiting my family is like a bit different but I'm more just like
aware now that I'm not changing who I am when I'm around them rather than like aware that I'm changing
who I am so I don't know maybe I'm doing it wrong or maybe I'm just doing it different but there's
there's still a difference like I do talk differently to my boss than I do to my my fiance
or something but that's that's not playing a different role that's just me being the person
I'm supposed to be in the situations I know that's what it sounds like but it's not I
will not have I had I guess a social sauna if we could call that like the person I would be when
I was being social with people or going to parties or just meeting for dinner you know
