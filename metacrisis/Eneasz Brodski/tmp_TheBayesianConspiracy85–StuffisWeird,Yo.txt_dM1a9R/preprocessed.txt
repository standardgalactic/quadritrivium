Welcome to the Basin Conspiracy, I'm Yash Brotsky, I'm Stephen Zuber, I'm Jess Dickey.
Today we're just talking about various miscellaneous things. I want to start this off with something that
I don't want this to become a political podcast because that gets boring really quick, but I would
like to quickly say that Georgia and now Alabama have both passed incredibly restrictive abortion
bills. Georgia having one that says once a heartbeat can be detected, it is now considered a person
and cannot be aborted. So arbitrary. Yeah, not only is it fucking arbitrary, it's a really
stretched definition of a heartbeat because it's just kind of a valve that vibrates and will turn
into a heart eventually. Like the heartbeat at that period sounds like because it's not a heart,
but you know anything they can do to to fuck over anyone who wants an abortion is what they will do
and I know I've said this before so I will not repeat myself too much but I believe that reproductive
control and specifically the right to an abortion as part of that is our civilizations dependent on
that. Our way of life cannot exist without it and it would refer to a patriarchy if we didn't have that
for reasons of necessity really and so I think it is incredibly important that we always have these
rights and I don't know I just I would be terrified to be a woman in those states once this law goes
into effect if it does in fact go into effect. So can I I've got at least all right let me just
get this out one I want to touch on the movie Alien because that's highly relevant here for
reasons that I just learned yesterday. Yes. Two this isn't like a political subject really like
this is just like things that are happening in the world like it would be one thing if we're like
I don't know this I guess I'm gonna give us a political charged topic but yeah but it shouldn't
be I mean yeah I mean yeah you're right it is but like I was talking to somebody yesterday about
how like climate change is a politically charged topic now but like why is science politically
charged right um in any case and maybe why is why is morality politically charged we'll figure
that maybe we can touch on that later but the other thing is I don't really know the specifics of
this of the laws that are being proposed um like I've heard different things from different people
and I haven't looked into it myself so what's what's really going on let's do Georgia if you
don't know if you know each state or if they're the same or whatever but are we talking like
if you go try to get an abortion you're gonna be you know hanged for murder no um prison is the
doctor gonna go to go to prison the doctor yeah okay so I'm also curious I'm not being a lawyer
this is legal at the federal level uh this is not legal anywhere right no no excuse me abortion is
legal at the federal level oh yes so how do I mean states can pass their own laws restricting it in
various ways I feel like if it was this easy they'd have done so already so what's what's going on
well because I'm also an idiot so specifically with Roe versus Wade it was ruled unconstitutional
for states to put uh two strict limits on abortion uh and a lot of people don't like that ruling and
right now they think that with uh a republican president and the the justices that have recently
been installed uh they might be able to get the supreme court to overturn Roe versus Wade so they
are intentionally passing laws that are extremely unconstitutional is I guess the term we use when
something has been ruled unconstitutional by the supreme court right uh they're passing laws that
are inflagrant via opposition violation of the Roe versus Wade ruling so that it can go back up to
the supreme court they're hoping and get that overturned okay that's what I was thinking yeah
and oh that that was the thought process behind it because they're they're not hoping that this is
gonna like change the country they're hoping to get the conversation up to the supreme court where
yeah we've got all the well then they are also hoping that it'll get overturned and so they can
change their individual states to be horrific like this right right right I just I my my understanding
of just hearing about this from the outside was like okay their the plan is to get this back over
the supreme court because now they can win yeah um so that's that's cool so it is pretty political
well it's I'm okay with that I guess this isn't like you know we're not we're not reeling on
Chattanoah right now which again doesn't even sound political to me but whatever uh maybe I don't
have any trouble talking political stuff I get it's boring it's overdone we're not experts and
there's more entertaining and and informed podcasts talk about politics maybe but um so yeah the the
whatever the ruling is like you can't if you go get in portion in Georgia the doctor can be charged
for murder yeah okay or I think this a special uh penalty that they've put in that's not exactly
the same as the murder penalty but yes the doctor gets charged and goes to jail what about the mom
the mom does not that's cool I mean yeah at least there's that there's yeah there is that but um
there's still the fact that you won't be able to get an abortion because doctors don't want to go to
jail yeah and the other thing is that um the fetal heartbeat can be detected at about six to seven
weeks and uh most most women who are pregnant yeah I don't even know that they're pregnant it's
all about six weeks from their last period so this is kind of just a de facto ban on abortion
and the six weeks thing is a little arbitrary it's people don't have an exact date of conception so
it's measured the measurement of six weeks old is six weeks is how long it's been since the woman's
last period so I mean it might only be three weeks but yeah for for most women it's like
I missed a period okay that's weird you wait a few days and you know then you go get a test or
something so you just are barely finding out that you're even pregnant maybe after the six week period
and I guess when people live on the borders these days can you still drive across the
state line to get an abortion there or is there like weird stuff with like getting procedures out
of state I don't know it's it's hard to say because there a lot of times if you cross state lines to
commit a crime you can still be persecuted for it but the the crime committer here is the doctor
performing the procedure right yeah so if the doctor's not I guess if the doctor doesn't go into
Alabama yeah like just so like just another side of the state line north of Colorado and Wyoming
like right across the sign from welcome to Wyoming there's these big tents that sell fireworks
yeah and they're allowed to do that so like I'm assuming if a doctor practiced you know with a
Georgia license set up a tent on the other side of the state line set free abortions or something
that would be committing a crime maybe I don't know that would actually be hilarious if they
did just like set up a whole bunch of abortion clinics all along the border yeah but the downside
from the middle of the state you know like Georgia can be a seven-hour drive to leave the state
yeah not everyone has access to transportation yeah like always it'll hurt the poor the most
yeah it puts an arbitrary hardship on people to make them like figure out that they're pregnant
in time get out of state uh yeah it's not good and it's you know trying to push our country back
into the dark ages I saw a couple funny things on oh whatever the kind of dark political humor
that happens when you know every fucking week in the last four three or four years but it was an
onion headline that was like 12-year-old doesn't think that she or like sexually assaulted 12-year-old
doesn't think that she can handle being a mom on top of all the other things going on so the picture
of a sad little girl yeah the line was like with all the homework that I'm doing and the gym
practice yeah I'm like gonna fit having a kid into this yeah and then there was one that was like
I mean it's whatever this is just political humor so we can leave it out but um yeah that's
weird I don't have a lot I mean obviously it's fucked and like you know like there's
I don't even just to add other than like normal platitudes like people at work were talking about
it and they were like yeah I posted a thing on Facebook and I was asking like all right well
cool are you now gonna like pay for better you know uh like preschool and daycare in this net and
I was like turn to do you leave yeah and I was like I think you know the answer to all these
questions is like no right she's like yeah but that's the point I'm like it doesn't seem like
that adds a lot of the conversation like no the like they're not this is just like
on one hand to to be uncharitable it's like just to fuck you and keep you down because now we've
got the chance to do it and we hate women and stuff on the charitable side like if you really
think like you know for the last whatever since Roe v Wade the United States has been cool with
killing babies and now like this is your chance to like help save those lives that's the nice
motivation from it but I'm not convinced a lot of people actually believe that I've well I think
the true believers do yeah I think a lot of people actually do I don't know how many true
believers there actually are there's a lot of people who say they believe stuff but it's
hard to tell the difference from the outside right I think it's hard to tell the difference
from the inside too um can I add another fact yeah because I just was looking this out so critics
have pointed out that the term fetal heartbeat bill is a misnomer and as much as at that stage
the conceptus is still only an embryo and the heart is not yet connected to a circulatory system
yeah damn scientists when you know things like this yeah it's it's so yeah it's just an arbitrary
I always see these billboards that are like heartbeat in six weeks and like there's a picture
of a fully formed smiling baby on the billboard to like and you're like oh baby with this little
heartbeat I mean it's just really pushing the emotional narrative of this is a you know a person
and it should be treated like a person instead of this is a clump of cells that's starting to form
into something that may someday become a person every year at CSU because it's a state school
they were you know allowed to bring people like protesters were allowed to do stuff right so they
would put up these things that were like probably 10 feet tall like these gigantic signs and it would
be like this is your baby at eight weeks and they're like it's like holding this disgusting little
thing from like you ever should have like CPT that playable teaser for this on hill game in the
bathroom it's disgusting but it's like so they're holding this thing that's like I don't know the
size of like your thumb but it looks like a tiny human and like it then like their hands are covered
in blood or something because they just murdered this thing so like it's just like straight up
bullshit lies and I I have this deep frustration as somebody who cares about the truth and
rationality and and reality that if you're lying to defend your position your position is not worth
defending yeah if and that's like you know I as long as you're talking politics I don't like
Donald Trump and I'm happy to talk all the shit I can about him you know whenever someone asks me
to but what I won't do is like lie and make up stuff about him because there's so much real
ammunition there right and so I guess there's a couple things one there's enough to talk about
without lying if you're if you're complaining about something but the other thing is that
if you fall back on a lie and then someone's like oh that actually is not true
like then they're they have fairly good reason to like be highly skeptical skeptical of everything
else you've said because they've already proven that you've lied in some cases so just just be
honest if you're if I think there's there's this phrase that you know I've heard once or twice about
that that which can be destroyed by the truth should be yeah I think I've heard that yeah I
I'd also like to point out that this is literally a forcing religion into government thing which a
lot of people don't think of it as but it's specifically the evangelical Protestants that
have this beef with abortion and that made it a major thing uh back in the I don't know 50s 60s
I don't remember exactly when they went on their kick but for example uh in a Hebrew in Hebrew
in Judaism in Judaism the the person is not considered to have a soul until it takes its
first breath and usually isn't regarded as something with rights until it begins the
egress from the womb like for the first I don't know few months I don't know exactly how long
it is it's not even considered a separate thing from the woman's body yeah that that makes so
much more sense because it's true yeah yeah well yeah but you know it's there's a lot of religions
that don't think of these things as persons and uh it's specifically the evangelicals that say it is
in sold at conception so it becomes a person then and they are the ones that have pushed this into
the government so basically making their religious beliefs a part of the law one of the things that
can be skeptical of souls as a child was I'm half of a pair of identical twins and if we were in
sold at conception and souls are like this indivisible unit of like Eunice that God gives you or
something it's not clear what a soul is supposed to be but I know that like you're not supposed
to be able to cut them in half and whatever right so either my brother and I either one of us doesn't
have a soul or you share a soul or we share one which you know maybe is but that's I don't remember
reading about that at the bottom yeah but we're not supposed to talk about it okay well maybe that's
why because you're both one half of the soul that could be God has like infinite power so maybe
just copy the soul and then you know now there's two souls that diverged at that point but like
kind of like how funny this conversation is and how like pointless and how we we there's no way
we could like protest any of these things this is like the level of conversation that like I'm
assuming is is confusing high cardinals to this day like debating whether this is true in the in
the faith and like it it's just like I don't know it's like deliberating the speed of the avocados
of vodka dauvra spell right or like can it go through like stone or bugs or what like yeah it's
like how would you this whole I don't know when you would win in the fight versus Thor versus Hulk
right I mean at least that's fun to talk about and there's evidence that you can play this is kind
of fun to talk about too because I'm just like trying to imagine maybe like a 3d animation they might
show children about in soulman we're like you know there's the egg just like coming down the canal
and then like all the sperm and then like one of the sperm implants and then suddenly it just
starts glowing and angels choir you start singing it's like yeah and that's and that's how you get
a soul children I'm sure there's videos like that like oh there's all these hundreds of other
sperm that like don't make it so do they not have a wait what maybe the soul is carried in the egg
maybe yeah then that's the other thing too is what like something you need one of each because
then it's not a person because right yeah but yeah otherwise you'd be killing something every
time you menstruate it well and like and in the case of a twin there's two sperm no that depends
on the like identical twins are one yeah fraternal are two um so the there was a George Carlin joke
about you know because some large percentage of fertilized eggs are flushed out during menstruation
like they just don't latch on to the wall yeah and so like God's the biggest abortion
abortion of all in the universe yeah but of course it's okay when he does it right which we can talk
about when we talk about morality in a bit yeah quite a number of pregnancies and in miscarriage
as well that too yeah like you can get pretty far along and god kills it so it's um I don't know
from the outside this all seems patently ridiculous like more ridiculous than talking about who
went in a fight between Thor and Hulk because at least there's like there's feet evidence of what
they've accomplished in the movie as you've seen these fights right so like there's at least stuff
we can point to um it's I don't know and and you know you're talking about fake stuff you're not
talking about real stuff talking about fake stuff alien you're gonna throw in the movie alien yeah
I just listened to the wonderful doofcast episode on the alien and aliens movies and it was an older
one I think it was episode 31 I have no idea when that came out but I was driving a lot yesterday and
had had at my backlog and me being the complete idiot that I am and I've only seen an alien once
so maybe that's why but um the whole thing is an allegory for like there's tons of like aside
from aliens looking super phallic and there's like tons of like vaginas and penises everywhere on the
ships yeah and the whole thing is a not subtle metaphor for like basically the trauma of like
being scared of being and being raped and being impregnated and all that stuff yeah and it was
apparently the expressed goal of the writer or one of the writers or directors or something to be
like this will be a way to like make men like aware of what it's like to be afraid of this sort of
thing okay um and since many of us saw it as a kid's we you know that was probably lost on us
yeah you don't make any connection as a kid yeah but I'm curious to go back with that in mind
because it totally does you're assaulted by this thing and you're like this thing's pumped into
and you're like holy shit what can I do nothing it's just just gonna happen yeah that's a lot
what it's like and I and it's literal body horror when I was talking to Katrina about pregnancy like
organs are pushed out of the way weird hormones get flushed through you which actually make it
harder to think at one stage of pregnancy that all your tendons start be getting all loose and
your bone mass goes down because you're you're giving bones to this thing living inside you and
everything about it is just this horrific thing that if you don't want it I mean if you do want
it I can understand yeah I'm making the sacrifice then it's like pure magic like I'm giving this
thing part of me to grow like that sounds magical if you want it yeah if you don't it's it's pretty
horrific it's like alien right and uh babies rewire your brain forever too which is really scary
yeah which I've heard some people like which is great if you're going for it but if you're not
that's the thing I mean all right there's only so much to say that isn't said a thousand times
by people who are more eloquent than me on this but like the whole well they can just give it up
for adoption afterwards I think that's a lot easier said than done first of all you're completely
ignoring the trauma of going like just physical trauma yeah carrying and delivering a child which
I can only imagine I'm told right people die I'm told it's uncomfortable and that it's it's
preoccupying but the thing too is like you can't help but bond with this thing it's literally
rewriting your your neurochemistry to make you in love with this thing so giving it up isn't like
I don't know thought it's it's I don't know I mean for someone like me it'd probably be
like a lot like fostering a pet except you know time is 100 because it's being apparent but
you know you fall in love with this thing it's all right well bye forever I won't even have your
phone number and you won't have mine um that that doesn't I don't have anything to add it's just that's
that's not a serious comeback to this right um and as I'm curious is there cut off age at all in
Georgia for you know if you're raped by your stepdad and you're 11 no exceptions cool yeah that makes
perfect sense yeah or maybe it's Alabama that has no exceptions one of the two states had no
exceptions obviously I should I guess whatever caveat though all of my like cool that's awesome
are all jokes yeah the sarcasm is playing on my face but not maybe not in my voice we I just I
anyone who has the means to leave those states I really think should yeah it's it's I understand
it can be hard to leave family and stuff but oh my god get out yeah so on a happier note yes
let's talk about Stephen's noticing and solving annoyances oh yeah so then oh we can do a second
bullet point too or is that the let's jump to that one afterwards all right so this one isn't much but
we get requests fairly often from people wanting to do like an episode I'm like how do you live
like a rationalist in day to day and I think the reason we haven't done an episode like on that yet
is because it's not super straightforward like I don't have a list of things that I am aware of
that I do but now I'm trying to make an effort that when I notice things I'm gonna make a note
and we'll try and touch on them when we can if we get enough we'll do a whole episode or something
I'm sure there's people yeah I was gonna say I feel like I could make like eight episodes
good then yeah so Jess is here we can do this I couldn't I couldn't do this on my own but my my main
thing that I try to do is like just I guess I noticing problems is something that noticing
that things are problems and that they can be solved I think it's a technique all of its own
and I mean there's it's hard to think of like good examples but you know like put on minor
annoyances because I've had a handful of cases where like I'm five or 20 bucks or 20 minutes away
from solving something that I didn't really know was super annoying and so I try to make an effort
now to be every time that I feel like a feeling of like God that's annoying I'm like wait hold on
what is what is going on what exactly can we do about it and a lot of these are like super
background things and so the most recent one again I told I warned you this is super mundane
my engagement ring was too big and I was told when I got it they're like no you should have
this size because you don't want it to be too tight and one guy was like you know what happens when
you get married you can place and you put on a little weight and you'll grow into it I'm like
I feel like your like advice or like get fat enough to wear this ring is really really bad advice
so I was just like you know what finally fuck it I took it back and they tried to
try to be 40 bucks for it I think they forgot when I put it to pick it up which is great
and there's this whole hubbub but the other thing is I don't know this isn't a rationale
rationality technique and more of a bargaining technique but don't just like listen to the
people if they don't if you feel like they're not being reasonable you can argue they want
to be to give my ring up and it might be a week it might be a month before I could get the new one
back but we should and I'm like no I like wearing it I want to keep it until you get the give me
the new one we're like well then we have to call in and ask the provider because whatever I'm like
all right fine but like I don't see where the risk is like you're gonna get this back either way
and if I like destroy this before the other one gets here then you guys just get to keep it you're
not out any money in any case so like I'm not trying to be an asshole here but whatever so anyway
it fits now and now I know like this what it feels like to wear ring that fits I can close my fingers
all the way it doesn't hurt it stays on straight it doesn't fall off in the shower and like again
super small but it was I noticed the second I put this on that like oh there was a lot of like
background anxiety the other one is going to fall off and break or something and I it was
like immediately comforting so I was 20 minutes of effort well I guess if you take the drive to
and from the place twice but it was I was very little effort away from taking off a good deal
like a a noticeable background level of stress but again that's a super boring example real examples
can be things like I don't know my desk chair is uncomfortable like and you just notice like I'm
not comfortable maybe you're a $20 purchase from Amazon away from buying a backpack for that which
I've tried to do this week by two or three of those um I mean again these aren't good examples
but the general thing of like notice problems and anytime I'm annoyed at something now I'm like
what is that okay can I can I identify and fix this yeah and the answer is almost or at least
often yes or you can decide it's not that big of a problem but at least you notice the annoyance
right yeah so that's my little thing not gone yeah I like that I mean one of the things that I often do
well not often do but I like the the the when applying rationality to real life uh doing the
thing where instead of just when you notice a problem using the skills you have researching how
to solve it instead like the example I got was that actors are always when something happens
they come out and they give their opinion they're like we should change this and this and everyone's
like god shut up actors no one cares about your opinion or more dangerously everyone's like oh my
god we believe you right thanks for warning us about vaccines Jim Carrey yeah Jim Carrey's wife
he was in it for a while I will see okay but in any case Jenny McCarthy that's what it was that's
right I can remember in any case they they have this platform and so like well these are the
tools that I have so I'm gonna use them whereas a much better approach is researching what is the
problem how can it be fixed how have similar problems been fixed in the past and then going
about doing those things learning those skills gaining those resources whatever you need to fix
the problem because that's far more effective than trying to throw the few things you have at
something yeah I would also say it's worth looking into whether there's some kind of tool or service
that you can use to do the thing for you yeah that's um kind of a technique that I've been using
more recently I would even take it a step further in uh using kind of a narrow framing tool which uh
narrow framing is when you kind of limit yourself to a number of options because you your brain
doesn't want to think about or isn't creative enough to generate lots of options uh as a solution
to a problem so I like to think about uh cheating like if this were if this were if there's if there
were some way to cheat at this like what would that be like and I'm just kind of like doing a
little thought the exercise about like what are some really sneaky like bullshit ways that I could
cheat yeah and achieve this thing and sometimes you end up coming up with a good idea or at least
you uh it helps you like kind of kickstart the idea like oh okay this is a reasonable way to
maybe go about this or also like hey this actually like seems like it's not really worth my time to
try to solve yeah but uh I like for example hiring a virtual assistant to do the thing
I like uh I mean I'm I'm not a psychopath I think that's just because I read methods of
rationality but one of the things I do to kind of get those intuitions going is like occasionally
you'll have a problem like with a person or like surrounding a person not even like with the person
themselves and our brain would be like you know if they were dead this wouldn't be a problem
and I'm like okay cool thanks for thinking outside the box we're gonna move on to like
other solutions but like at least then like I guess that's not it's not helpful for like that to be
like your only outside the box point but it's nice people to like think outside of like the space of
like usual ways to solve the problem or like ways that you know if you google online like how do you
deal with a stressful whatever and they'll be like oh you know be more stoic or ask them whatever
it's like you know if those solutions aren't working then you know think of other things that
don't involve murder but the murder example is because it's like okay that's definitely outside
the box of advice people would give you right so yeah it usually causes a lot more problems
than it solves too totally you had an update on Matt Freeman spamming microintentions oh yeah
Matt Freeman friend of the show and better rationalist than me um he also writes on less wrong
and so I think several months ago we mentioned he had a post on uh something called spamming
microintentions which is just this like the technique of if you want to do something like
light exercise or finally unload the dishwasher or something kind of just like think to yourself
like think the thought over and over for like you know 45 seconds and if you have this thought
once a second you kind of like just need to do the thing now um so I was talking with him about
this a few months ago and I meant to bring this up but it was at the bottom of the notes not at the
top so I finally found it again that I told him that like the way that I've been doing this now
that I've done the microintention thing is that the second I start spamming the microintention
I just do it like like the second I decide to do the spamming thing I just do it anyway
because I know it's going to work and he's like yeah that's what I do too I think that's like just
the faster version the next level of the technique so that's awesome yeah that's out there um yeah I
think I think he publishes on less wrong under more than a mail as well so but we'll find the
spamming microintentions post and put it in the notes so read his other stuff it's really interesting
yeah that's very good very articulate I have like a lot of the stuff that I've read or heard on
his podcast I'm always like oh man that's like a thought that I had in the back of my mind and
wasn't able to like articulate it and he just said the perfect like version of the thing that I've
been wanting to exist yeah he's he's great at that and then Scott his co-host is really good at that
with uh tv and movies maybe other stuff but I don't hear him talk about that so um that reminds me
you guys finally saw endgame which we we don't want to talk about but now you guys can listen to
the episode that I was on of their podcast I did okay it was a good episode okay I was gonna ask
I don't want to I mean you don't have to flatter me but no it was awesome and I liked how you
several I think at least twice apologize for like I'm sorry about talking all the time but I got all
this stuff to say and yeah it was cool I mean so there was that but the reason I brought that up was
that during the show they were talking about if you haven't seen the movie then I'll I'll skip
exactly what they said but they made or Scott made this kind of um analysis noticing comparison
thing and I just like hey quick meta note this is exactly why I like listening to your show right
I would I didn't really notice that and I'm the kind of guy who's in this movie 10 times without
really putting that together in those words and that's that's great so there's a technique
all on its own of being able to um notice things at the level of like thematics and story yeah like
on the meta level rather than just like what's happening in the show or movie yeah and they
do that great so if you like movies and tv find their their podcast I'm pitching it over and over
but I really liked their episode on uh the sixth sense yes I did too yeah the the way they they
mentioned how the camera is used and how that reinforces the story I was like oh like I don't
I don't really notice camera work I guess when I'm watching and so that didn't occur to me but like
the whole going back and forth between the two characters to create distance never putting
them in the same frame at the same time I was like neat yeah it seems like I'm not used to be a
and now I'm I'm loving that they're doing a series on it because I'm wondering how they're
going to handle like the happening and avatar the last airbender oh god I are they doing avatar
the last airbender too they're gonna have to if they're doing M night okay they better well I
thought there was something along the lines they're only doing things that like he wrote and directed
or something I don't know maybe they're doing airbender movie as well it's gonna be so interesting
because they're one of the things I really like about their show is they're always so positive
about everything they talk about they try to pick out good things I'm sure they'll find good
stuff well Scott Scott like he says he is sick of being called a M night Shyamalan apologist
because he doesn't think there's anything that he's apologizing for but he also hasn't seen avatar
so thankfully I haven't either oh it was yet I've heard I mean it's just a bummer because
there's a lot there's a lot to work with if you like the source material and social materials
awesome I mean he even he like pronounces characters names wrong what like it's on in the movie not
weird it's like how hard is that I mean so it's it's clearly intentional for some weird reason
that I'm not enough of a movie analysis person to articulate I think what happens is like M night
wants to like be more of like himself rather than just like a good well-received director
he like wants to like weird shit like David Lynch or something about like from a different
direction because David Lynch is on flavor special magic version of weird so yeah anyway
we're not a movie podcast okay oh right so this is something that David spoke to us about he was
on our episode not on our episode on our podcast I think a dozen episodes ago talking about
rationalist magic yeah yeah I was talking with him a bit earlier on Facebook and he pointed out that
a philosopher would describe the idea of calling yourself a witch or a wizard a technology of the
self because by changing the way you view yourself and in the way you act you start setting off
different social signals like now that I think of myself as a wizard in this situation I'm going
to act differently and people will also treat you differently because just the subconscious
feeling of the subconscious signals that you send out you know in your body language and your
posture and what you're doing make a difference and people react differently to you and I saw
almost immediately thereafter someone's sharing on Facebook god I hate that I use Facebook but yeah I
do sharing this thing um hot adulting tip making a responsibility sona and role play them when you
have chores to do which is awesome and ties back into the the whole roles thing people really
take up roles very easily and can do them yeah like we usually unconsciously apply roles to
ourselves and that can be limiting but there is some power in being able to pick out from a bunch of
roles such as neurotypical Karen yes the reply to that is this is neurotypical Karen and she
enjoys having good sleep hygiene and returning phone calls and then someone else replied I find
that I'm wearing that if I'm wearing real adult business clothes my work sona can do things like
call people and check my inbox whereas pajama Helen mostly wants to shovel hamburgers into her face
and set things on fire so yeah I like it I I call like just doing adult stuff I just call it
adulting yeah like I've got adulting to do this afternoon so you know I'm gonna be busy um
I I I like David a lot I think that you know the calling it magic magic can be kind of like
duplicitous and that like a mott and bailey thing it's like oh it's not really magic you're just like
doing this but my magic symbols can cause magic number random number generators to give out the
numbers I want so well yeah it if you're calling them both magic it's it David you're great but
it's wishy washy and I have a problem with that particular framing of it but I I do like the
idea of being cognizant of the different hats and roles you can put on and saying all right cool
I'm gonna go be business Stephen for a few hours and then go back and being relaxed Stephen I often
kind of already do that um but I I never explicitly put the hats on I kind of put them on in retrospect
I never uh take advantage of our work jeans Fridays at work because I want my work persona to have
its own uniform so I always wear my khakis and my little polo shirts and I don't wear those outside
of work if I can help it yeah I've been thinking about getting scrubs mostly for that reason scrubs
huh just so I can feel like a real clinical coordinator like they said when I got hired uh
they're like yeah either like you know business casuals fine scrubs are fine and I was just like
okay cool I'm not buying scrubs I already have business casual clothes and now like my coworkers
keep wearing scrubs and I keep looking at them and I'm like they have so many pockets they have
an elastic waist they're like nurse pajamas I need these I didn't realize scrubs had pockets
yeah they have great pockets and they're comfortable they can be really soft and they come
in all kinds of fun patterns and stuff too mm-hmm and it's always cool seeing someone in scrubs in
the grocery store you're like that's a person helping save the world right um you know I'm
I'm walking back a bit on my putting on different hats I more or less trying to force all my hat
to fit at the same time like like I play mostly the same person all the time and like I notice
it different especially like visiting my family is like a bit different but I'm more just like
aware now that I'm not changing who I am when I'm around them rather than like aware that I'm changing
who I am so I don't know maybe I'm doing it wrong or maybe I'm just doing it different but there's
there's still a difference like I do talk differently to my boss than I do to my my fiance
or something but that's that's not playing a different role that's just me being the person
I'm supposed to be in the situations I know that's what it sounds like but it's not I
will not have I had I guess a social sauna if we could call that like the person I would be when
I was being social with people or going to parties or just meeting for dinner you know
and I loved it and it was a lot of fun and then you know I've kind of given that up because I've
been into the depression thing lately and it's just not as much fun like being social and going
to parties and stuff when I'm not doing that so I'm doing those things less too I guess then if
you're if you're being mindful of it this way you can say you know what fine social sauna it is
we're going to go out and I'm going to I'm going to be the person I am when I'm being social yeah
and you can just make it happen or you can try right kind of that wag the dog's tail sort of thing
here like a fake it till you make it yeah kind of did that when I was learning social skills I was
in MMOs so but uh yeah I put on kind of a social zone of like being this kind of like hyper happy
bubbly person and people responded to it really well and then I realized it's like hey I can also
do this when I'm just interacting with people at my job or at school yeah it works it's crazy yeah I
did a lot of faking it till I made it in confidence and stuff too and I think it's less about like
having made it to like right now I feel like a confident relaxed person and more just like I just
stopped giving a shit and maybe that's maybe that's what it's supposed to be like I think it's a little
of both you know you stop giving a shit a little bit and then also you kind of uh you integrate
some of that personality into your actual persona because it's like this is fun and this is the
pattern that works in these situations and this feels like me now and it's just more relaxed like
I I think it's just the main technique that worked for me in that particular thing was just I when I
was in high school I articulated what is it a spotlight bias before I read that it was that
there was a thing called that yeah where like I was like you know what everyone's paying as much
attention to me as I am to them and I'm barely looking at people yeah and so like no one notices
anything I mean so like I can I can stutter I can not have my clothes look great or something and
no one's going to be like going home and remembering like oh Steven's shirt was stained or something
right so because nobody gives one shit about me which in one in one set in one viewing of that
sentence it's negative but in like the sense of like overcoming social anxiety it's fine and some
people do give us do care but they they're not the average person you're passing yeah generally the
person that cares is the kind of person you don't want to be friends with anyway the person that's
like looking around for stuff to criticize about people right or the people who like who do care
like they care about your well-being and like those are already your friends or something like
but like no one's going to be like oh my god look at how Steven's hair was all fucked up like
anyone who thinks that is like I don't care what you think you say it's one thing to say that and
like but it's a whole other thing to like be able to internalize that not break that way so I don't
know speaking of uh things on Facebook I'm going to jump back to that second bullet point that you
mentioned um I get the feeling that our civilization is really failing at adjusting to current
technologies and by that I mean specifically the social technologies because I think they
have displaced what used to be community and it's sort of destroying the country a bit and we
we have not managed to integrate it and I take this back to the invention of printing press
which uh helped throw Europe into hundreds a hundred years of religious warfare and lots of
murdering because now everybody could talk about religion and read the bible and have their own
interpretations and uh religion became a really important thing that people had very strong opinions
on that to the point where they had to kill people who didn't have the correct opinions
there weren't religious conquests before that there were religious conquests but the printing
press specifically threw Europe into just a hundred years of turmoil interesting let people
know that hey people over there think this thing whereas before they just didn't know and I mean
that's that's one of the specific root causes of liberalism where uh everyone decided you know what
this warfare thing sucks we are simply going to say other people are allowed to be wrong about
religion and not involve it in politics at all you can have your religion we will keep ours we
won't talk about it we won't let laws be influenced by religion I mean one of the big things was
religion was part of the laws which uh oftentimes people have a problem with laws that are contrary
to their religion ruling them anyways uh the Europe eventually managed after all this time to
find a a answer in civilization to the problem of the printing press and I don't think we in
the west have found an answer to the problem of our societies being our our communities being
crumbling away and replaced by this outlet where you only get attention when you are really outraged
and you get your people pay attention to you and compliment you and see that you are doing good
things for the community only when you're specifically attacking someone else because
you have to post on your timeline this person did this terrible thing and that is your contribution
to the group right and so it things keep spiraling worse and worse and we get today's
outrage outrage culture and I think maybe a civilization out there maybe china maybe somewhere
in europe I don't know where somewhere is going to figure out a way to deal with social technology
and not have the only way to that you can contribute to your community being attacking
someone else but uh I don't I get the feeling it's not going to be us and we will not be the
future of humanity um by us I mean specifically US western culture yeah yeah I I don't know I'm
a little bit less pessimistic about that because I think we have already and I don't mean we the
United States necessarily but um I like some of the trends that I'm seeing towards trying to moderate
uh forums comment uh boxes where there's like better filters uh there's I don't know like the
reddit system of being able to up or down vote things um kind of being used in more platforms
cracking down on fake news I'm I'm disheartened by this but I mean I I agree with everything but
like the bummer is that it took more than 15 years to get over the the backlash of of stuff and
you know social media's only been out for less than 15 years right yeah quite a bit less than
15 yeah this might take a little while on the plus side it's a good century but on the plus
side of that though technology I think has this way of accelerating how fast things happen so maybe
we'll like things that get really shitty for like five more years then we'll figure out how this
works and get together yeah I mean it's done a lot of good things to open source culture yeah yeah
and I mean just the idea that you know whatever it is that you enjoy there's an online community
that enjoys it with you yeah that's fantastic and you can research stuff that you wouldn't have been
able to um yeah I mean the the whole point of the foundation in the foundation trilogy was like
well not the whole point but what they were told was like all right everyone we're going to work
together for the next 50 years and build wikipedia and this was like this this endeavor of what hundreds
of geniuses working together on this project it's like yeah we have that now and it was
kind of like just happened and you know nobody that anyone knows worked on it on purpose um
the repository of human although let me like the beginning some people have made made contributions
every a lot of people have but isn't it david eggers that runs more or less wikipedia is that
the guy's name my point is that this wasn't like a concentrated effort like that everyone in the
herd about like the united states spent you know 10 years right two billion dollars building right
it was a volunteer effort by people who were passionate about it yeah this wasn't like cracking
the human genome where it was like this big project that the country was aware of if you're
listening to stuff um so aware of the everything you see is written by crazy people thing yes
and i think like i think that wikipedia actually falls pretty like squarely into that because i
know some people that like comment on wikipedia who uh edit things and they're purely just like
fueled by the someone is wrong on the internet i need to fix it at 3 am the everything is everything
you read is written by crazy people thing is um an observation that 99 percent of people don't put
out any content at all they're entirely consumers right and the one percent of people that do
produce stuff are driven to do so because it's basically a for free effort right are just driven
to do so out of some weird passion to do it uh which makes them yeah so it's strange compulsion which
makes them very different for most people and actually the more it's much worse than 99 percent
and one percent it's something like uh everyone uses wikipedia all the time but the overwhelming
majority of the content is produced by point zero zero zero one percent of the user base
and those people generally spend like eight to twelve hours a day on it it's just really there's
this one guy who uh makes edits someone once tracked his activity every day starts making edits about
8 am every day stops making edits about midnight that's seven days a week that's his entire life
no one knows how he makes money maybe a trust fund maybe he has to live in someone's basement
because he can't get a job because he's maniacally focused on this i would let that guy move into my
basement right i would feed him but a lot of content is done by these really crazy people and
the majority of what you read this is why that's why the the name of the the post is and uh everything
you read is written by crazy people i've definitely heard that it also sounds like something that
would have been covered by saturday morning back with serial rxp too um but that aside like if i
want to just like look up something about it a lovelace like i don't have to go to the library
and find a book that may or may not be written by some idiot and i can just find a fairly well
curtailed biography of you know it a lovelace's life and a contribution to to computer science or
something right yeah so you can yeah you can read all sorts of things how she affected the
the world going forward you can read contrary opinions to people are like well maybe there
were these other people that did yeah yeah the controversial section and as all the citations
at the end yeah it's fantastic yeah and you know there's there's accusations that place like
wikipedia has like a liberal slant or something which i think i think steven colbert put it
fast and he said that reality has a liberal slant um but you know if you're if you're uh
turned off by that then wikipedia is not for you but just the i guess that's one of the benefits
of being connected that way through the internet and um you know again the the community of less
wrong would have been really hard to get out of california if it wasn't for the internet right
yeah it would it would just be ellie isar talking at coffee shops like the few people that like
didn't like leave the room when he started when he got up there started pontificating it would be
like Paris in the 1900s just one guy with a cigarette in his coffee talking to the coffee shop
i think we're more like somebody just like standing on a stump and shouting i'd be the american version
yeah so sitting a revivalist tense all right at the very bottom you have a shuffling feet
whistling vivaldi yeah you guys can let me know if we want to touch this or not i was i think i
know what you're about to say but yeah let's do it because whistling vivaldi i think this was
something that rachel told me about when i was talking to her about this thing that made me
think of it um so uh i'm trying to think of how to go about this i read it several years ago a
i don't know where i read it somewhere on the internet i don't know if it was a
forum i was following or a post on facebook or something but it was a guy who described
himself as like large and black and that what he used to do to avoid scaring i think what he
described as like you know like white women in particular if he was like walking behind them
on the street what he had shoveled his feet loudly on purpose so as they wouldn't be surprised by
his presence and like because he was like well people are people are spooked by me i should you
know try and uh do something to make them less uncomfortable yeah which sounds nice you know whatever
but then i'm thinking so like i'm torn on it because like that sounds fine and nice but then
the downside is like why is it falling you to like change your life to make other people feel better
right and like and this happens to have a racial component too which is which is a heavy thing
large black man and so yeah when i was telling rachel about this she was because i'm still torn
on like how to solve this problem and i'll bring up the other thing about it too um but she had
said that she'd write it uh something ages ago titled whistling bivaldi which is what somebody
else's technique they'd be like oh i'm i'm whistling classical music i'm clearly not you know um a thug
right right so i've heard of some people will uh if they're walking in the same like direction of
someone else and more or less at the same pace they don't want to make them uncomfortable because
you know if someone's following behind you for a while what are they thinking are they trying gonna
mug you or something they'll pull out their cell phone and start fake talking into it
because then you know the person in front of you like okay he's distracted by something else
he's obviously not casing me trying to figure out when he's gonna mug me he's not just gonna
drop the phone and jump me so right yeah people around you feel safer when you're on the phone
and distracted and that's if you're not actually talking to talking to anyone and my technique
is i pull out my phone and i'm looking at it and i'm doing stuff even if like usually this is at
night if i'm worried about startling somebody or you know there's a few minutes i walk i don't know
maybe uh three quarters of a mile a day getting to and from work and so um you know if i'm if i'm
behind somebody or something like that i i'll bring up my phone so like i'm on this i'm not paying
attention to them and that sounds fairly unobtrusive and odds are probably on my phone anyway so
whatever um but what made me think about it was like a few couple days ago there was a post on
the ask men subreddit and it was titled what the fuck are you supposed to do when you walk past a
woman alone at night to let her know you're not a murderer right um and he says that he walks his
dog and stuff and i think walking a dog is probably one thing you can do to that he's already out that
way but the top comment i really liked which was i think this is hard to like implement as actionable
advice but it was run past them as fast as you can so it looks like you're on your way to murder
somebody else then they know they're off the hook and the guy replies should i do it clothed or
unclothed it's like you should have clothes but not be wearing them just talked over your arms
like a knife in your other arms right uh in regard to that question i was thinking um when
steven you said why does it fall on the one person to like be the one who comforts the person who's
scared um i feel like maybe definitely there is a kind of like a male female thing or a racial
component which is shitty but also um people are uncomfortable being in elevators with each other
definitely like regardless of who was behind me if i was walking alone at night and there was a
person walking behind me i would get uncomfortable if it was like an 11 year old girl i would still
be kind of uncomfortable oh i'd be especially uncomfortable as an 11 year old girl that's every
horror movie but i'm i'm kidding and i'm ruining the point i'm sorry no it's fine uh yeah i think
that there's probably an extent to which the person who is making the other person uncomfortable
is feeling very uncomfortable because of that and would like to take steps to alleviate their own
discomfort by leaving it in the other person's discomfort it's like i don't know there's a lot
of social conventions that are just around signaling safety yeah this person is commenting i mean in
his in the body of in the post in the post body it was like um walking his dog etc um yeah it's
clearly coming from a place of like i don't want them to be freaked out and that's because it's
making him uncomfortable to have them feel that way or have him have them have him perceive that
they're feeling that way right right so i guess my my thing is i'm i feel like making reasonable
accommodations in your life to make other people more comfortable makes perfect sense um but like
some of the comments were like well you could cross the street or you could and i'm like that seems
like a long way to go out of your way just to avoid spooking somebody and like i think a lot of
people who are walking around perpetually terrified of everyone around them that seems like their
problem and like it sucks because like they they have something going on but like if you can't
walk to and from you know the grocery store with like the bus stop or whatever without being terrified
of all the people near you that's like your thing that you have to deal with right but i mean this
is this is just a natural consequence of living in a reality where physical violence is possible
and where the city's so large you can't know everybody and yeah that sucks but there's a
lot of shit in life that sucks and you do what you can to make it better and one of those things
is trying not to be the scary person trying to do something to help people i mean it's it's better
in all things considered it's less traumatizing to be the person who has to make accommodations
than to be the person who is scared of being assaulted yeah no totally i guess it's like i
guess what level of background purity assume the person in front of you has right like so there's
several times in areas of the city where i've just been scared to be there you know same here
and i'm like five inches shorter than you so you know i think i i'm i'm relatively lucky in that
sense that i'm probably not walking around scaring a lot of people because i'm five eight so
like once used to be more often but you know once a month or something i'm downtown at night
and i'll walk the train stop and hit the train home and if there's it's a fairly abandoned
platform because it's you know 11 30 at night or something you know i leave as much room as possible
but like i'm still sitting next to you know in the in proximity to a stranger
and i've been mindful of this before like what do i do you know like i've been in the situation
where it's like it's a it's a single it's a it's a by their by what am i trying to say
a woman by herself and then me and so again i'll plan my phone but i also like it's dark
out i don't want to be having the screen illuminating my face because i'm also at a physical
security risk being outside at night and so like i don't want to be blinding myself playing on my
phone or getting deliberately too immersed and so like i want situational awareness and there's
some level where like i'm in charge of my own security being outside so like i tend to not
be completely unarmed and i'm walking around um or if i if i am what are you carrying uh usually
mace nice um but i'm also like just primed for a physical altercation a lot of the time
so like i i mean maybe this is from a handful of them as a as a teenager or something but
and being small but like i mean i think it makes perfect sense that like if i'm worried
about being attacked i should just be kind of aware that i could be attacked and like what am i
gonna do and so um you know i i look up on mindful of threats and you know people coming or whatever
so um it's you're right it's it's a consequence of living in a society that's big enough where you
don't know all your all your neighbors but i guess that the person walking down the street
coming towards the bus stop you know what can they do to make me less nervous like i mean nothing
like just be them like just don't be aggressively scary and by that you just gotta be scared and
muscle through it yeah so i guess that's that's what i'm curious about like what's what's your
responsibility to not free people out i don't think you have a responsibility i think uh
yeah the the person who's scaring the other person has no moral obligation to do something
to calm them down but i still think that it's a good thing to do so i guess like if you want if you
want to put in some minimum good points what what can you do though because i honestly didn't know
how to answer this question like again playing on your phone not talking to them not looking at them
if you can um all those things help but like the ones that like slow down or like change direction
of where you're going or something it's like i'm often like on a schedule like i'm not gonna miss
the train because i'm trying not to startle somebody i'm also not gonna like you know john
millaney had a good bit about this and like it was one of his first things 10 years ago or so
where he was like at the subway station in new york in the middle of the night and there's this
woman ahead of him and it's like one of those like long corridors between stations and she's
kind of giving him the over the shoulder and he's like okay well you know try not to freak her out
and then she just starts running out of nowhere and he's like oh she must hear the train coming
he goes running after her and and of course it ends in a joke but um you know these things happen
right so um i don't think i've ever chased somebody but uh if to the extent that his
his anecdote is true like he accidentally scared the fuck out of somebody right so um i guess i'm
curious i don't know you could always try to make the person less of a stranger be like see like this
game thrones episode or something i feel like talking to them is a way to free people out and
plus i'm only talking to people but that's i don't mean to shut that down that could be the way to
do this i don't know right yeah you could kind of maybe just yell like hey how's your night
i don't know how's it going yeah that sounds terrible i hate the guest culturiness of a lot of
the social signaling safety things that i was talking about i really wish that we could make
it explicit oh sure yeah i'm talking about guest culture versus ask culture guest culture being um
generally what more neurotypical people do where they're playing these little games
and they have plausible deniability it's like when you're flirting with somebody and you're like
hey you want to go out for coffee instead of being like hi would you like to go on a date
i just always assume that going out for coffee is a date unless said otherwise
yeah i'm bad at that uh i would like that we could you know make things explicit like
there's some kind of code word of like hey i'm not i'm not a threat last night i asked you guys
both to coffee this morning so yeah yeah the the problem with yeah the problem with saying
i'm not a threat is that it's easy to say so anyone can say it even people who are a threat
right yeah it's a drag like and in fact that's that's how his joke ends is because like don millenni
he's like in his 20s i think now he's in his 30s but he looks like a child he looks like a tall
teenager okay and so he's like you know like what when he realized that he's freaking out like he's
like what can i do i can't like just run up and grab her and be like don't worry i'm not gonna
rape you i'm a little boy so that's that's not the way to handle a situation and you're right like
anyone can say that right and frankly if i were to go up to somebody at the train station they're
like you know 10 feet away like i'm not gonna attack you like that's something that would definitely
be said by somebody who's about to attack them right so unless there was the i don't know it would
take a very different kind of society yeah society had like already talked about and pre-arranged
this stuff i don't know yeah you're right though i feel like like the societal level that this
conversation is happening on isn't anywhere near that point yet yeah right and also you
could just fake the signal exactly yeah it's weird so what would be something that would be hard to
fake yeah i got nothing i don't know if if you're a guy and you're worried about freaking out a girl
you could always like start talking about your boyfriend or something that at the very least would
it could just aren't like yeah away some concerns about sexual assault but if you're
Ted Bundy you'd say that should anyway right just to get them to lower their guards so you
can attack them i don't know like that's the thing if you're if you're the most paranoid person
yeah that is lying that is lying yes um but if you're the most paranoid person out there and
you're terrified i guess i was just curious because some of the comments some of the replies
were from people you know i don't want to scroll down too far but um one of them was great if
you're walking your dog talk to your dog it's a nice way to do it no and then of course bonus
points if you don't have a dog and you're just talking to your dog like that's not weird begin
crab walking towards her to show you're just a goofy character with no ill intent um that another
joke but uh like yeah i mean everything makes it so much worse yeah exactly some of these are
are but if any of our listeners have suggestions we're totally up for hearing them it's more like
i don't really i'm yeah that's true too i'm more just like the question itself and how much one
should should how much effort one should put forward to avoid you know in these in any situation
just like make people more comfortable or less afraid like how much background fear you're supposed
to assume from somebody and how much like should you go out of your way um you should it's a nice
thing to do but how much like if it's if i don't typically wear a hood but if if it's raining and
i have a jacket with a hood i'll put it up right but walking you know at night with the hood it can
be spooky so like if it's if it's raining and it's i've got my hood up i'll take my hood off and let
my head get head get wet to like make somebody more comfortable that's kind of a big sacrifice for me
um i have i have a love hate relationship with hoods because they really make you warmer
but they also cut off all like your peripheral vision so you can't yeah see things from the sides
but i prefer hats i mean whatever it is it's just like you know i it this isn't really probably
face a lot again i'm i very rarely am in a situation where i'm worried about making people
uncomfortable yeah um because i do most of my traveling during daylight hours and crowds so
it's more just like kind of philosophically i don't know how to how to handle situations
like this and it was just something that was online a couple days ago so i guess fake talking to
your phone would probably help and that seems kind of like lying though yeah like a call somebody
you can call your mom more often that's that's true yeah there we go solve two problems at once
hey what are you doing nothing just don't want to freak this person out so i'm calling your mom
how's it going um yeah i don't know uh awesome if anyone's scary but looking was around was there
something you would prefer they do that might make things easier um my problem is that i tend not to
notice like things like height i don't know uh i was actually maybe this is a bit of a tangent
but i was kind of thinking about the way that i'm really bad at noticing this sort of thing
there's this unspoken social rule where if you take a seat somewhere or if someone else is sitting
somewhere you're supposed to sit like kind of across the room from them and then like the next
person to sit down is supposed to kind of divide the distance between the two people until you're
like you only sit next to each other if all the seats that are not like one seat away from people
are filled up yeah uh like when i was in college i would just sit in the same seat every day and
like what i was going for was okay i kind of want to be like up close to the front but not exactly at
the front a little bit off to the side so maybe like the second row with like three seats in that
would just be the seat i would sit in every day and if somebody was sitting like next to it i would
just go over and sit right next to them because like that's my seat and people get kind of freaked
out when you're like they've broken this rule like why are they sitting next to me all these seats
are open right i had the same same kind of situation that i liked doing too because for a lot of
people you have like you're not just there to attend you there because you have like an optimal
learning environment and i had similar goals when sitting at places i can't report what i did with
the room was if the room was uh like if it was nearly empty and the person was next to my seat
or something i don't remember running into that situation too much but you still leave a buffer
seat in movie theaters if you can i've gotten less about that actually okay um it depends
like my favorite seats in movie theaters the ones right behind the section with the bars where you
can put your feet up yeah unless the seats were primed then it doesn't really matter but if the
person is you know if i if i if there's no room to leave a buffer seat and still have the bar i'll
sit next to a person um i've even done it in relatively empty movie theaters which i sort of
now maybe feel awkward about but the the version that i run into as far as like leave the buffer is
you use the edge urinal in the men's room when you when you go in you don't you don't walk into
an empty room use the middle urinal right if there's three yeah and if somebody comes in and
there's three and you're on the right one and they take the middle one they're a psychopath right
so um you leave a buffer urinal unless you absolutely can't so maybe that's the the minimum
level of someone to take in the men's room to not make people uncomfortable there's a similar rule
around like stalls in women's rooms because uh i always just go in the first stall because that's
the one no one uses because it's closest to the door yeah huh seems most convenient yeah but now
i wonder if i'm breaking some other social rule that i didn't know about whoops i always use the
handicap stall because it's the biggest yeah i used to do that and then um i was using the
stall once and a mancap person came in and really needed it i was like i am an asshole yeah that's
what i always worry about having excited i'll do that what if a handicap person comes and now i'm
taking their spot that's a fair concern i think for me it's i mean so far i haven't earned the
situation it's different at work because i know everyone on our floor and none of them need to
use the handicap stall right so in that case i always go for that one yeah when i'm at work yeah
yeah in public it's it must be i mean it depends like for me as far as like a handicap stall my
only thing to keep in mind is that it's handicap accessible it's not handicap reserved right so
like they the like a parking spot is reserved and if you take a parking spot and you don't need it
you're an asshole the the the the stall in the bathroom is to meant meant to be accessible to a
wheelchair it's not meant to be reserved for people in wheelchairs only right so it if you're if you
are using it you're not an asshole so one of the wheelchair is waiting to use it yeah right
at least i'm not right it's up to the person to decide if they're an asshole but i don't feel
bad all right so we had more more rationality stuff to talk about right yeah yeah the first
post we're going to talk about is your rationality is my business anyone want to jump into this or
should i take it i'll read the things all right so uh if someone else chooses to buy lottery tickets
who am i to disagree or what business is it of mine if someone else chooses to believe what
is pleasant rather than what is true i believe that it is right and proper for me as a human
being to have an interest in the future and what human civilization becomes in the future
one of those interests is the human pursuit of truth which is strengthened slowly over the
generations i wish to strengthen that pursuit further in this generation i have a interjection
there to make we talked once a couple years ago about uh clifards the ethics of belief
and that was about i think that had the analogy of like the the the boat captain you know is my
ship seaworthy and stuff and there's a couple points to that to that essay slash thought experiment
but one of them is like there's no such thing really as a personal belief your beliefs to the
extent that i mean you can have personal beliefs that are very you know like preferences or something
but that's not really a belief but you know if you have this kind of like quiet personal belief
like oh um my cars sound to drive on or something right but like you don't care to validate that
it's your fault if it if you get a if it breaks on the road in a way that you could prevent it if
you just kicked your tires first right um i was wondering if we're gonna get a car metaphor car
analogy the original thing is a sea captain but not a lot of us have have practiced captains
captains it captains captaining ships it's true so um yeah the i don't know so i
will finish the the bull points at the point of the post but i agree i think that this is
it does seem like an interesting diversion from liberalism the idea that you know you can
believe your thing and i'll believe mine and we won't fight over it um uh but you know i do think
it's a good thing to be able to help people to to be better i mean that's why we have education and
we encourage people to get educated and in some cases make laws that you have to be yeah well that's
really important for the entire civilization i propose the you know not fight people over it
there's there's an important distinction let's argue against bad ideas but not set their barriers
on fire yes right yeah so it's it's to me you know it be be charitable be nice don't be an ass
or whatever don't scream at people but saying someone's got a bad idea isn't the same as saying
you're a bad person for having it and now i'm going to kill you yeah i'm gonna kick you out of
the group or now we're going to whatever fight um the difference is between making it a personal
attack like yeah your your idea is bad is different than your bed yeah and it's kind of the other
person's fault if they interpret somebody who's saying your idea is bad as you are bad i i agree
and that's partly i think a norm that a lot of people have to get out of and it's hard to do
even with me you know maybe something um personal or uh you know politically charged or something
yeah it's a hard skill to learn but uh i mean like when i was in art school
we had to go through critique and that was basically we were taught how to receive critique
same thing with writing classes um it seems like something that they should teach in school
pretty early on i told you there's a lot of things that i would like you know social skills
uh i'm blanking on other things i don't know instead of teaching the same 250 years of u.s
history over and over for 10 years they could like stop at one of those years for like here's how to
you know all the like i don't think there were philosophy classes at my high school but i mean
critical thinking there were critical thinking classes those were all electives all of the
things that were tangential to like how to like optimize your way to think those are all things
that you don't have to learn in school yeah that was the other thing i was thinking of like you
should learn how to learn in school right like why don't they teach you about spaced repetition and
the i don't know that's frustrating yeah it's because one i think the the answer is that
someone like kaplan or hanson might give us because that's not the point yeah the point is
teach you to be a good little soldier and sit in your desk and shut up and do what you're told
then then you'll be a good work you'll be a good a good uh cubicle monkey so yeah um good little
congan machine that's right so what bullet point where we on the syllogism we desire the syllogism
we desire to avoid runs i think susie said a bad thing therefore susie should be set on fire
so i'm trying to avoid the syllogism by labeling it improper to think that susie
said a bad thing no one should judge anyone ever anyone who judges is committing a terrible sin
and should be publicly pilloried for it pillory is that cool thing where you put your head and arms
in the wed stock oh cool that's a pillory i think so okay pillory was the one where they like tie
you to a post and flog you maybe that's different though i'm i think it's pillory is the thing because
there was a there's a fallout mod or extension that let you build those for settlers and stuff
so if you really hated Preston you could Preston garvey you could put him in the pillory
you're right that's the thing awesome we just looked it up well teaching you stuff listeners
as for myself i deny therefore my syllogism runs i think susie said something wrong therefore
i will argue against what she said but i will not set her on fire or try to stop her from talking
by violence or regulation okay uh the the reason he cites fire specifically is just because a little
bit earlier in the post he talked about how priests literally set people on fire for thinking the
wrong things and um i just wanted to say how interesting how interestingly times have changed
because when he wrote this in i think 2007 or so uh so like what 12 years ago now uh it was a common
thing for people to be like you know just let everyone be man it doesn't matter what they believe
and uh if if some other country practices female genital mutilation well that's their religion
and like the pushback was against people saying you know why why do you even care about this
about making people more rational stop being such an asshole it was often the thing done
said to the new atheists it's like why do you care what religion people have stop being such a dick
let them believe whatever they want to believe right right and now things have come like full circle
where we're at the point where everyone is like you think this political things set slightly different
from me therefore i must yell at you on facebook and you know try to get you fired and or cancel
your show or dox you or do all these things like we have come drastically around to the exact opposite
of what of what this post was supposed to address well yes and no um like totally i remember what
10 years ago i had a debate teacher that was uh um a total moral moral relativist and that was
something that showed up in the class with and she was like just letting you know everything you
guys have to say is an opinion nothing is wrong nothing is right yeah and she even used female
relation as an example oh my god and so i i didn't take clearly a monster right i mean so well yes
i'm charitably but um i liked the uh the top of the post was um you know someone asked in the
comments like why can't we choose for ourselves whether not to care about truth and he says an
obvious snappy comeback is why do you care whether i care about whether someone else cares about the
truth um and that's that's the the you know moral relativists tying their own or i guess shooting
themselves in the foot before they get their boots tied right like they don't hold up moral moral
relativism as like just another relativistic thing that you can choose whether or not to care about
they hold it up as like a moral axiom that you're an asshole if you don't follow and it's like how
can you possibly judge somebody if you're saying the judgment is wrong and not not just like out of
fairness but like just literally look at the structure of your argument um the it is interesting
that we're back around maybe it's because people are finally realizing like oh yeah look this is
what happens you get you get the alabama or the georgia heartbeat bill if you just say oh have
your own private beliefs it's fine um well i'm just been going on for a while though before
even that heartbeat thing i know but that's true since 2014 or so i think they crept back a bit
from theocracy with obama and now we're leaning back into it with trump who's not a fiocrat but
he'll do whatever he wants and he'll do whatever he thinks his supporters want him to do so sometimes
anyway um sorry yeah oh did you have a thing well i was just gonna say that it's
i think people are maybe realizing that this whole wishy washy relativism thing just doesn't
fly because like oh this is what actually happens if i if i tell people it doesn't matter what people
what people do and believe and think right yeah there's also like the the full relativist i think
sam harris put it a really nice way that was like did you come the four relativists no i said the
full relativist position okay harris's reply to that is like if you really think that like
no culture is any better or worse than any other you should just flip a coin when deciding whether
or not to send your teenage daughter to spend a year studying and you know studying or going to
school under the taliban yeah and if you're like no i wouldn't want that for it's like oh then you're
not a relativist right um or you know you're you're gonna place some gymnastics to say well i'm not
a relativist i just prefer that you stay nearby or something right um so yeah i i think it's really
awesome that the principle he laid out applies still perfectly today like back then the problem
was moral relativists and the principle was uh i will i think you said something wrong therefore
i will argue against you not set you on fire or stop you by taking uh stop you from talking
with violence regulation and nowadays we have the exact opposite problem or instead of having moral
relativism everywhere we have people you know calling for punching others in the streets and
doxing people and doing other terrible things and the advice is still if you think someone's wrong
you argue against them you will not set them on fire or try to stop them from talking by
violence or regulation or something it's it's a good principle if it works in either extreme
agreed yeah yeah it's kind of interesting that now we have the violence and regulation yeah
well i'm thinking more of um emotional violence right okay and uh the counterintuitive idea
underlying science is that factual disagreement should be fought out with experiments and
mathematics not violence and edicts this incredible notion can be extended beyond
science to a fair fight for the whole future you should have to win by convincing people
and should not be allowed to burn them this is one of the principles of rationality to which
i have pledged my allegiance i like it and i i that is a good insight that the the advice i mean
it's it's super obvious advice to anybody who i guess cares about the truth or find you know
good good discussion but like don't hit the person you're arguing with like makes sense whether or
not uh you're you're uh you're arguing against people are for that or against it right so um yeah
so speaking of you know man loose tangent feeling stuff we had all episode on on feeling
rationally i think in the first 10 i think we did um so that now we got to the post itself yeah
now we're coming coming back to it um so there's the the popular belief that rationality is excuse
me a popular belief about rationality is that rationality opposes all emotion when people
think of emotion and rationality they are opposed i suspect that they're really thinking of system
one system two which is fast deliberate judgments or excuse me fast perceptual judgments versus
slow deliberative judgments i think we get that less now but that may just be the people that i
hang out with i'm assuming people who are less versed in nerd culture and or uh rationality in
general probably still think of people who are rational like spock or something yeah i still
run into some people who kind of i don't know will be like oh you're getting really emotional about
this thing uh and that's bad oh okay and i i i think it'd probably be example by example but
that sounds like generally a pretty stupid thing to say to somebody but if you're if you're getting
emotional then this is an important part of the post that if you're getting emotional about something
that isn't true um then it's like yeah you should probably stop feeling that way if you can um or
you know at least work to quell those feelings um he uses an absurd example of like you know
believing in goblins tying your shoes but you know like a bad dream or just like a negative
intrusive thought that you have if you're you know you're sitting around and you're like no my
friends really like me and i'm gonna let that bum me out all day and uh you know i've had days where
you know i'm thinking negative thoughts like that and i'm like you know what i'm just making this
shit up yeah but still the correct way of dealing with that is not walking up to that person slapping
them and saying stop doing that no no the the correct response to doing that is to walk up to
yourself and metaphorically slap yourself in the face and say knock that shit off the correct
response is like therapy yeah and it's going to take a long time to work on it so like it's not
like i don't know i guess that's the thing that bums me out about people who kind of are like well
we you know emotions are bad we can't bring emotions into this it's like well sometimes
emotions are the problem and you have to solve them with emotions and also like emotions aren't bad
right if someone's trying to take away your society's reproductive rights you have every
right to be angry and if you're not angry then kind of you're kind of kind of you're reacting
inappropriately yeah it kind of provides your motivation yeah it's hard it's hard to do anything
if you don't feel motivated to do something about it and that feeling is often emotional
and he brings up to that curiosity is an emotion and i don't know if professional
psych psychologists or something would agree with that but to me it is it's a unique feeling
and it's it's it's exhilarating and it's got this component to it of like urgency
and that that feels you know that triggers a physiological response yeah so if you're
going to say emotions bad you say curiosity you know with any drive behind it is bad that seems
weird yeah i guess and my thing yeah obviously if you know you need to talk with somebody to help
get get the right tools to handle that but for me i i try to be at the stage on good days or if i
notice myself spiraling on an intrusive stupid thought i'm if i'm if i'm mindful enough to
notice that i'm doing that i'm okay and i can kind of just like catch myself in that whirlpool
and be like dude knock it off think about something else you know i i if you can do that that sounds
like appropriate right um and even if you're ruining anything that's true you know if you're
noticing yourself getting just swept up and it's ruining your life you know like i've had
bad things happen i'll spend i'll lay i'll lay awake trying to fall asleep thinking about it
and like you know what now's not the time to deal with that and you know a you're not equipped to
deal with it because you're tired b you should be going to sleep so you're less tired and see it's
just there there's no point in going about this in circles in your head so that's why i often read
when i'm going to bed because if i start thinking about something that i don't want to think about
it'll just take my brain over and i can't stop it but if i'm reading that distracts me
focuses all my attention on something else and yeah then i can drift off when i no longer have
that thing needling at me and it's a good use of time i should read more um yeah i think uh
um so he goes on to say i label any motion as not rational if it rests on mistaken beliefs
we kind of talked about that um there's a quote in the post that's you know we should just do one
maybe one of these times just do the 12 virtues of rationality instead of a sequence post yeah
because he quotes those a lot in these um but yeah our emotions arrived from our models of reality
if i believe that it's all sad stuff but whatever um yeah so our emotions arise from our models of
reality if i believe my dead brother my dead brother has been discovered alive i'll be happy
he'll wake up and realize it was a dream i'll be sad pc hajul said that which can be destroyed
by the truth should be my dreaming self's happiness was opposed by the truth my sadness on waking was
is rational there's no truth which destroys it um becoming more rational arriving at better estimates
of how the world is can diminish feelings or intensify them sometimes we run away from strong
feelings by denying facts by flinching away from the view of the world which gives rise to the
powerful emotion if so as you study the skills of rationality and train yourself not to deny not
to deny facts your feelings will become stronger and that's a really good point um i don't know
imagine somebody ignoring signs of a medical problem and they're just like i'm gonna you know
i'm not gonna use these words but i'm in denial i'm gonna ignore that i'm gonna just you know it
doesn't hurt whatever a lot of people do that i've done that yeah it's it's uh and i think the reason
how did i stop doing that was i guess a having these resources to try and do something about it
but b was just like you know what ignoring it isn't gonna make it just because it's scary you're
facing it and it's not worth getting into but i had a concern that i might have had cancer um i mean
whatever uh so um like i and i went this went on for like 10 years and i was like i'm like i'm
probably not dead yet so i'm not dead yet so probably i don't but let's just get this looked at
so um it's uh the the concerns like you look at it and it's like that's terrifying and kind of
just flinch away from it and part of the the training of rationalist is to you know notice
that flinch and like look back at it and say i'm not going to freak out i just need to you know
what what's there what's true and then only through examining it maybe getting a medical
examination maybe just through introspection or whatever can you decide okay this is actually
a problem or it's actually not and i can stop worrying right but the maybe the concern of like
looking into it and that it becomes an actual problem if you identify it like now you've actually
got to deal with it but the thing is this was true either way right this was going to be a problem
whether or not you you discover whether or not you discovered it early through through flinching
into the into the darkness and looking at it or not and if it were cancer it would be so much better
to discover it early and then also if it wasn't cancer it would have been better to discover that
early because then you wouldn't have been freaking out about it for 10 years totally
yeah um so he goes on to say ever since i adopted the rule of that which can be destroyed by the
truth should be i've also come to realize that quote that which the truth nourishes should thrive
unquote i love it i love it me too when something good happens i'm happy and there's no confusion
in my mind whether it's rational or not for me to be happy so i like that a lot and i think
you know there's there's still some i don't know understandable confusions about like
how elated can you be and even me like i tend to not to feel emotions that strongly and i
wish i felt them more strongly but i do i don't i don't i don't have any hang ups i never asked
myself at least out loud in my head like should i be feeling happy about this unless it's something
that i should feel guilty for feeling happy about you know like somebody don't like gets you know
crashes their skateboard or something it's like hot loser i i shouldn't feel good about that um
but if i'm feeling good about something happy happening it's the the things that are tripping
me up about whether or not i should feel good aren't related to like whether it's appropriate for me
to feel emotions it's like should i feel happy about this particular thing or sad about this
particular thing um but it's not like our emotions good or bad i'm past that which is good yeah so
to the extent that i can have an emotional range i let myself have it so yeah going back to the uh
our emotions arise from models of reality you almost didn't read that one because
you said it's about sad things um i have a couple of friends who died when they were really young
and i never got to deal with the emotions around that because everybody else would flinch away from
it and or you know they would do the whole uh well they're not dead they're in heaven
or uh oh let's not talk about that let's not think about that let's distract you from these
things and it took me a very long time to actually be able to look at it and it was actually like
kind of hard for me to be able to ask my partners and my friends like hey can we talk about this
and it's gonna be really uncomfortable for you but for me i need to talk about this and i need to
be sad about it and that's good and people and i my flinching away from it was purely me doing
what you put the post advocated not to do which was death freaks me out yeah less so than it used to um
i i'm still no fan but uh i'm able to talk sanely about it like i mean i never like would literally
freak out and leave the room but i would say like can we talk can we change the subject or i
would like tune out and not listen but um this kind of came to fruition last year in fact my niece
just had her one actually it's her first birthday today um so a couple weeks after she was born my
sister had a bunch of uh blood clots in her brain she noticed some numbness and she said actually
go get this checked out because she's good about getting her medical stuff looked into and uh there
was when she got her epidural that they had screwed something up and she had several blood clots in
her brain which is the last place you want them right so more about pregnancy being terrible yeah
well just don't yeah um in any case what she had was crazy rare so her her response to the
epidural um and it was it was because they fucked it up so just get someone's steady hands to your
epidural um okay yeah i mean the the point is we were going to the hospital to visit and i think
we got there early or like she wasn't able to receive visitors so right till now we're just
kind of walking around pretty pretty hospital uh you know with nice grounds and stuff so um
we got to talking about like you know how i would cope with this and you know how i'd
cope with you know the eventual death of my other family members and stuff and uh she was like it's
good to hear that you're like able to talk about this because last time we talked about this was
like seven or eight years ago and you were like i will completely freaking lose my shit when this
happens oh um i think my exact words were like you know this is hard to say because i still
don't like talking about it um my grandma is in her 80s you know i she won't be my grandma
and rather she probably won't be alive in 15 years right um and i'm anchoring it really far away
even though it's probably probably closer um so uh i don't like that it's that's the worst death
terrible and it freaks me out but i you know what i'm getting at is uh what am i getting at i guess
yeah that you should be at a place where you can talk about stuff and certainly if you can be with
people that uh you should be with people who allow you to experience your feelings and stuff
if it makes them uncomfortable too like you don't be an asshole and show them their throats
yeah but there's something important in noticing that discomfort because then you can kind of aim
yourself at hey death that sucks let's fix it yeah like you kind of have to have like uh
i guess like righteous anger at certain things that you want to fix yeah and we're not all gonna
this actually ties back to my little stupid advice about noticing annoyances right um you know
i don't think all of us are going to be able to have uh ideas as kind of like paradigm challenging
as death is bad um yeah but annoyances are an emotion yes but the thing is is that this is
the the hate the dislike of death that's a popular internationalist community
is the noticing annoyances writ large right yeah like it's just an accepted fact that everyone's
okay with because while it happens everybody and there's nothing we can do about it there's
nothing till you say no this fucking sucks let's actually see if we can't do something about it
that we're able to actually address the problem and this doesn't have a 20 five minute solution
but it does probably have a solution it does have solutions and it's just whether or not
they're easy to attain and how how hard it'll be to get there but until you're willing to like you
know notice a that it's a problem and then b be motivated by you know anger or fear or whatever
to actually solve it um you know it's going to just stay a problem so yeah all right uh we also
did not cover the post called consolidated me consolidated nature of morality thread
because there i mean there wasn't that much to talk about unless we wanted to actually
dig into all his questions that he posted but the point of the thread was
i'm about to say some things that relate to morality i think this was just before the
the not setting people on fire post and he's just said i don't want the comments and those
other posts to get all clogged up with people arguing over ethics and morality questions
because those tend to take over any thread and anything else that was said in the post gets
completely buried under morality arguments so please post all your morality arguments in this
as as replies to this thread instead so we avoid that failure mode and he started it off with
10 questions about morality which you know they were interesting i love how he did a stealth
assassination of the is odd fallacy in there but um unless we're going to do a whole post about
those i just you know there wasn't there wasn't anything to do to do aside from
acknowledge it because this and then continue onward yeah i actually really like these they're
fun to talk about and i think it would be fun to do an episode about at some point yeah i don't
know if you guys are up for that then we have a two-thirds majority because i wanted to as well
all right why didn't you guys say this when i asked about it in signal maybe because i
never get it until this morning you say the bitches i'm sorry but also this this i mean
there's 10 good questions here this will be a long discussion okay um but yeah it's mainly just
some things he asks you to consider um to ponder about the nature of morality and mainly
i think to hopefully stop some questions in their tracks like to avoid i think he says this reinventing
the wheel like let's not start from bedrock on all of these we can we can at least call some of the
questions by saying you know like if your question is um again is odd distinction which we really
should talk about this more at length i think this is this is a fun post we'll talk about it okay
let's put that on the back burner all right yay our posts for next time are universal fire universal
law and think like reality so we'll cover that next cool uh we can cover this video game thing next
time because it's already three o'clock and maybe just like a really one or two quick feedbacks um
before we do feedback we should thank our listener or our supporter yeah and then i do have a quick
feedback that i think was in the subreddit that i or maybe an email but i didn't we'll get there so
um who gets to think this week's patron uh it's either i think you did it last time so it's either
my turn or jess's turn uh go ahead because i can't navigate the document okay well this week we would
like to thank our patron james loner for helping keep the show going for helping making us feel
appreciated and loved and uh yeah you you're great thank you to everyone and thank you specifically
this week to james yeah thanks james and this is james and this this should be something that
we really should have put at the top years ago or a year ago when we said that patron
patreon but if you don't want to be thanked if you have a if you have a prefer if you have a
preferred pronunciation of your name or something because when you go to patreon when you when you
whatever support somebody it gives them whatever name you use to the patreon so and that is public
you know if you go to our page you can see our list of patrons but if you don't want it on the air
or something just say so and if you like you know what call me this or something that'd be great um
if you have a preference so and we'll be sure to honor that yeah actually like i wonder about
you know how podcasts i'm thinking particularly adventure zone do like a jumbo tron it might be
kind of cool if you uh donate to the patreon and you had something you want us to say
hmm yeah let's doable yeah totally i could try that um i i never know what to say when it comes
to the thank the patron fire so i think that would be a little bit more fun because i was like hey thanks
they could do like the jeopardy guy shout out a happy birthday to their knees or something yeah
yeah or make us like say something goofy all right steven you had a feedback yeah we had a
post on the reddit from a simula crumpet um which i like the name because i was thinking of
ashley birch this is a tangent but whatever uh she's a voice actress for video games and she
does other stuff but she did tiny tina in borderlands and all she it was crumpets okay because my
brother was when i saw him yesterday he was playing um horizon zero dawn which ashley birch
does the voice for the main character which i didn't know at all until i saw the credits at the end
of the game yeah because i've only ever heard her do like her goofy childish voice in both her
web series hey ash what you playing and as tiny tina so the fact that she could play like an adult
with range like we want to mine so um anyway good name simula crumpet so frivolous question
if you make it to the transhuman future what form would you take oh i love this question
man what form wouldn't i take i had it since i already answered this i think in the subreddit
i've got a quick answer ready i think do it my first thing was like i probably would start
like something very close to my physical body that i have now with minus some of the bullshit that it
has um but like the the short story utopia lull that you've directed me towards a couple years
ago yeah um they do everything from like floor tiles to birds to uh whatever other random shit
right so token us elves yeah that that might be something worth trying i mean i but yeah first
things it also depends is this like a vr environment or is this meat space where we just have different
bodies it's a transhuman future man you can do whatever well whichever one we're in i think would
we could tell this a bit because maybe rep you know commissioning a robot body that was you know more
like a bird would be a lot more work than it would be just to like you know go to the same save menu
in the virtual reality and change that way right so regardless of whether it's more work i'd still
do it all right so my answer is that i'm boring i'd start i'd start small and then think about
what i want to do from there but uh i'm curious to hear what you guys have to say yeah i want one
that flies and one that swims and one that is a quadruped i don't know i yeah i like i don't
know want to be like a transformer that shifts or uh yeah if it's in a vr environment be able to
just switch it up whenever i feel like it be able to kind of like morph as you go first thing i would
do is go um be a woman for a while because i think that would be really interesting and i really
want to see what sex is like as a woman because yeah i don't know it just seems so different
and uh from i don't know from this end anyway i'm like wow that's really i want to try that that
looks really cool and also just a completely different sensation right so i would start with
that i would like to see what it's like to be treated as a woman by society as well because
you know people people are treated differently you could do that now it's not very reversible
and also yeah it it would be very very hard for me to pull off i i'm i'm five two i have you know
this is six two sorry six six i'm five two yes sorry i'm six it would be very hard for for me to
pull it off um but then after that i think my final form i would set settle on uh something furry
with a tail with like ears like i want to be yeah i want to be like some kind of foxy creature like
robin hood or something because oh my god that'd be that'd be the best i would live my entire life
like that and be happy forever so you're a furry uh i don't know what the definition of furry is
i don't like i love fairies there's nothing wrong with that okay i mean like i don't have a body
suit or anything and i kind of i don't know no no i'm not because i can't be a anthropomorphic
animal i i'm stuck into this body so no i'm not a furry every now and then i put on a tail when i
go out dancing because it's a really fun to shake a tail on the dance floor it just it's something
cool to work with um but if i could be a furry person animal thing then i would or we're low on
time but you're a thing of you know becoming a woman for a while i i was at a barbeque with
a handful of rationalists last weekend and one of the things that happened to come up was like
uh i guess oh it was like gender stuff like you know where where are you at on that sort of thing
and since i don't really have one well we're going to talk about this at length at some point but
i don't my my impression is anyway that i don't really feel like i have anything there but like
and i think if i if i could take a pill that would make you a woman and i'd probably take it yeah um
that's called being non-binary that's fine i don't i mean there's my understanding is there's like
26 letters in this like accurate in this uh what do you call it uh quilt bag lgbtqa plus yeah there's
like so the full wikipedia list has like 26 or seven of those and frankly i feel like you're
dividing it too small but i'll learn more about that later but the um like yes as far as that being
an option now it technically is i could spend years and a fortune making this happen and like
that frankly i don't care not to do it that way right like it's it's not something i'm dying to do
so i'm not i'm not really in it but the other thing too that i talked about like taking a pill
the switch would be like it would be annoying to explain to my family and stuff so like if there's
a way to like kind of twilight zone-esque rewrite history um where like all the memories just changed
but all mine stayed um that could be something to do what why would it be that bad to explain to
your family like if it was literally just an easy convenience thing like swapping your car
i'd be like hey mom yeah i'm woman now gonna try this out for a few months yeah i guess you're right
if there's something that everyone had i've kind of pictured a genie coming to me with a pill
oh okay this wasn't like available at you know the doctor's office yeah that was a thing that'd be all
over it yeah um certainly if it was reversible people would be doing it all the time so uh and
then it'd be really hard to keep track of criminals and stuff because you'd just take a
polygous potion go go commit a crime and then change back but um oh man this is like a fun
premise for a sci-fi story but i mean at this point we're in the transhuman future so anyone
could switch on the little microcam that was floating in the air at that time and see who it
was that did it yeah track them backwards so anyway yeah what i'm gonna get though is if i if i
guess i thought if i thought to put more effort into that answer i would have thought something
like that as well but eh i guess it depends i'm you know where we're at i i didn't really know
how to interpret the question because the transhuman future since there isn't just one and like are we
are we talking again like full robots that we're just talking like make what up augmentations you
want like talk about organs and or make growth grow new bodies that are all fully organic or
something um i mean because if we all looked like iron man i feel like it wouldn't like make that
much be that much different but then of course that'd be we wouldn't be we'd be so far transhuman
at that point that we would be fairly recognizable as we'd have human ancestors we wouldn't be human
ourselves right right so um yeah something to toss around there i think a lot of stuff and
where i think right at times so yeah i think i'd get going here in a few minutes all right um
oh one quick uh feedback that i wanted to get to as well while it's still fresh uh ravenous badgers
and a subreddit says to clear up the basketball analogy it was a problem we had last time
a layup is a simple shot where you relatively lightly throw the ball against the backboard
and let it fall in the net an alley oop is the play where someone throws the ball towards the net
for someone else to grab and dunk it so yeah thank you yes thank you for clearing that up
and it sucks because i think i knew that because i think they mentioned an alley oop and an episode
of scrubs so oh well now we know and now now basketball is solved uh yeah now that i know that
reader or listeners are gonna just like answer random shit i'm so bad about this like uh if i
come up with an idea that i don't know i'm just like hey google's my pocket i'm gonna look this
up but i'll just like pause the conversation and then since my friends are all nerds they'll often
do the same thing so we'll all be on our phones trying to out google each other we do that at
meetups but i think we don't do that in the air because it's like dead air and it's yes we sometimes
will do that but but seldom so it's more just like i felt like at the time was going to jump
the float and then i forget i'm talking about like hold on to google that but yeah all righty well
thank you for being here with us for this episode and i guess we'll see you all again in two weeks
awesome bye everybody
