okay with because while it happens everybody and there's nothing we can do about it there's
nothing till you say no this fucking sucks let's actually see if we can't do something about it
that we're able to actually address the problem and this doesn't have a 20 five minute solution
but it does probably have a solution it does have solutions and it's just whether or not
they're easy to attain and how how hard it'll be to get there but until you're willing to like you
know notice a that it's a problem and then b be motivated by you know anger or fear or whatever
to actually solve it um you know it's going to just stay a problem so yeah all right uh we also
did not cover the post called consolidated me consolidated nature of morality thread
because there i mean there wasn't that much to talk about unless we wanted to actually
dig into all his questions that he posted but the point of the thread was
i'm about to say some things that relate to morality i think this was just before the
the not setting people on fire post and he's just said i don't want the comments and those
other posts to get all clogged up with people arguing over ethics and morality questions
because those tend to take over any thread and anything else that was said in the post gets
completely buried under morality arguments so please post all your morality arguments in this
as as replies to this thread instead so we avoid that failure mode and he started it off with
10 questions about morality which you know they were interesting i love how he did a stealth
assassination of the is odd fallacy in there but um unless we're going to do a whole post about
those i just you know there wasn't there wasn't anything to do to do aside from
acknowledge it because this and then continue onward yeah i actually really like these they're
fun to talk about and i think it would be fun to do an episode about at some point yeah i don't
know if you guys are up for that then we have a two-thirds majority because i wanted to as well
all right why didn't you guys say this when i asked about it in signal maybe because i
never get it until this morning you say the bitches i'm sorry but also this this i mean
there's 10 good questions here this will be a long discussion okay um but yeah it's mainly just
some things he asks you to consider um to ponder about the nature of morality and mainly
i think to hopefully stop some questions in their tracks like to avoid i think he says this reinventing
the wheel like let's not start from bedrock on all of these we can we can at least call some of the
questions by saying you know like if your question is um again is odd distinction which we really
should talk about this more at length i think this is this is a fun post we'll talk about it okay
let's put that on the back burner all right yay our posts for next time are universal fire universal
law and think like reality so we'll cover that next cool uh we can cover this video game thing next
time because it's already three o'clock and maybe just like a really one or two quick feedbacks um
before we do feedback we should thank our listener or our supporter yeah and then i do have a quick
feedback that i think was in the subreddit that i or maybe an email but i didn't we'll get there so
um who gets to think this week's patron uh it's either i think you did it last time so it's either
my turn or jess's turn uh go ahead because i can't navigate the document okay well this week we would
like to thank our patron james loner for helping keep the show going for helping making us feel
appreciated and loved and uh yeah you you're great thank you to everyone and thank you specifically
this week to james yeah thanks james and this is james and this this should be something that
we really should have put at the top years ago or a year ago when we said that patron
patreon but if you don't want to be thanked if you have a if you have a prefer if you have a
preferred pronunciation of your name or something because when you go to patreon when you when you
whatever support somebody it gives them whatever name you use to the patreon so and that is public
you know if you go to our page you can see our list of patrons but if you don't want it on the air
or something just say so and if you like you know what call me this or something that'd be great um
if you have a preference so and we'll be sure to honor that yeah actually like i wonder about
you know how podcasts i'm thinking particularly adventure zone do like a jumbo tron it might be
kind of cool if you uh donate to the patreon and you had something you want us to say
hmm yeah let's doable yeah totally i could try that um i i never know what to say when it comes
to the thank the patron fire so i think that would be a little bit more fun because i was like hey thanks
they could do like the jeopardy guy shout out a happy birthday to their knees or something yeah
yeah or make us like say something goofy all right steven you had a feedback yeah we had a
post on the reddit from a simula crumpet um which i like the name because i was thinking of
ashley birch this is a tangent but whatever uh she's a voice actress for video games and she
does other stuff but she did tiny tina in borderlands and all she it was crumpets okay because my
brother was when i saw him yesterday he was playing um horizon zero dawn which ashley birch
does the voice for the main character which i didn't know at all until i saw the credits at the end
of the game yeah because i've only ever heard her do like her goofy childish voice in both her
web series hey ash what you playing and as tiny tina so the fact that she could play like an adult
with range like we want to mine so um anyway good name simula crumpet so frivolous question
if you make it to the transhuman future what form would you take oh i love this question
man what form wouldn't i take i had it since i already answered this i think in the subreddit
i've got a quick answer ready i think do it my first thing was like i probably would start
like something very close to my physical body that i have now with minus some of the bullshit that it
has um but like the the short story utopia lull that you've directed me towards a couple years
ago yeah um they do everything from like floor tiles to birds to uh whatever other random shit
right so token us elves yeah that that might be something worth trying i mean i but yeah first
things it also depends is this like a vr environment or is this meat space where we just have different
bodies it's a transhuman future man you can do whatever well whichever one we're in i think would
we could tell this a bit because maybe rep you know commissioning a robot body that was you know more
like a bird would be a lot more work than it would be just to like you know go to the same save menu
in the virtual reality and change that way right so regardless of whether it's more work i'd still
do it all right so my answer is that i'm boring i'd start i'd start small and then think about
what i want to do from there but uh i'm curious to hear what you guys have to say yeah i want one
that flies and one that swims and one that is a quadruped i don't know i yeah i like i don't
know want to be like a transformer that shifts or uh yeah if it's in a vr environment be able to
just switch it up whenever i feel like it be able to kind of like morph as you go first thing i would
do is go um be a woman for a while because i think that would be really interesting and i really
want to see what sex is like as a woman because yeah i don't know it just seems so different
and uh from i don't know from this end anyway i'm like wow that's really i want to try that that
looks really cool and also just a completely different sensation right so i would start with
that i would like to see what it's like to be treated as a woman by society as well because
you know people people are treated differently you could do that now it's not very reversible
and also yeah it it would be very very hard for me to pull off i i'm i'm five two i have you know
this is six two sorry six six i'm five two yes sorry i'm six it would be very hard for for me to
pull it off um but then after that i think my final form i would set settle on uh something furry
with a tail with like ears like i want to be yeah i want to be like some kind of foxy creature like
robin hood or something because oh my god that'd be that'd be the best i would live my entire life
like that and be happy forever so you're a furry uh i don't know what the definition of furry is
i don't like i love fairies there's nothing wrong with that okay i mean like i don't have a body
suit or anything and i kind of i don't know no no i'm not because i can't be a anthropomorphic
animal i i'm stuck into this body so no i'm not a furry every now and then i put on a tail when i
go out dancing because it's a really fun to shake a tail on the dance floor it just it's something
cool to work with um but if i could be a furry person animal thing then i would or we're low on
time but you're a thing of you know becoming a woman for a while i i was at a barbeque with
a handful of rationalists last weekend and one of the things that happened to come up was like
uh i guess oh it was like gender stuff like you know where where are you at on that sort of thing
and since i don't really have one well we're going to talk about this at length at some point but
i don't my my impression is anyway that i don't really feel like i have anything there but like
and i think if i if i could take a pill that would make you a woman and i'd probably take it yeah um
that's called being non-binary that's fine i don't i mean there's my understanding is there's like
26 letters in this like accurate in this uh what do you call it uh quilt bag lgbtqa plus yeah there's
like so the full wikipedia list has like 26 or seven of those and frankly i feel like you're
dividing it too small but i'll learn more about that later but the um like yes as far as that being
an option now it technically is i could spend years and a fortune making this happen and like
that frankly i don't care not to do it that way right like it's it's not something i'm dying to do
so i'm not i'm not really in it but the other thing too that i talked about like taking a pill
the switch would be like it would be annoying to explain to my family and stuff so like if there's
a way to like kind of twilight zone-esque rewrite history um where like all the memories just changed
but all mine stayed um that could be something to do what why would it be that bad to explain to
your family like if it was literally just an easy convenience thing like swapping your car
i'd be like hey mom yeah i'm woman now gonna try this out for a few months yeah i guess you're right
if there's something that everyone had i've kind of pictured a genie coming to me with a pill
oh okay this wasn't like available at you know the doctor's office yeah that was a thing that'd be all
over it yeah um certainly if it was reversible people would be doing it all the time so uh and
then it'd be really hard to keep track of criminals and stuff because you'd just take a
polygous potion go go commit a crime and then change back but um oh man this is like a fun
premise for a sci-fi story but i mean at this point we're in the transhuman future so anyone
could switch on the little microcam that was floating in the air at that time and see who it
was that did it yeah track them backwards so anyway yeah what i'm gonna get though is if i if i
guess i thought if i thought to put more effort into that answer i would have thought something
like that as well but eh i guess it depends i'm you know where we're at i i didn't really know
how to interpret the question because the transhuman future since there isn't just one and like are we
are we talking again like full robots that we're just talking like make what up augmentations you
want like talk about organs and or make growth grow new bodies that are all fully organic or
something um i mean because if we all looked like iron man i feel like it wouldn't like make that
much be that much different but then of course that'd be we wouldn't be we'd be so far transhuman
at that point that we would be fairly recognizable as we'd have human ancestors we wouldn't be human
ourselves right right so um yeah something to toss around there i think a lot of stuff and
where i think right at times so yeah i think i'd get going here in a few minutes all right um
oh one quick uh feedback that i wanted to get to as well while it's still fresh uh ravenous badgers
and a subreddit says to clear up the basketball analogy it was a problem we had last time
a layup is a simple shot where you relatively lightly throw the ball against the backboard
and let it fall in the net an alley oop is the play where someone throws the ball towards the net
for someone else to grab and dunk it so yeah thank you yes thank you for clearing that up
and it sucks because i think i knew that because i think they mentioned an alley oop and an episode
of scrubs so oh well now we know and now now basketball is solved uh yeah now that i know that
reader or listeners are gonna just like answer random shit i'm so bad about this like uh if i
come up with an idea that i don't know i'm just like hey google's my pocket i'm gonna look this
up but i'll just like pause the conversation and then since my friends are all nerds they'll often
do the same thing so we'll all be on our phones trying to out google each other we do that at
meetups but i think we don't do that in the air because it's like dead air and it's yes we sometimes
will do that but but seldom so it's more just like i felt like at the time was going to jump
the float and then i forget i'm talking about like hold on to google that but yeah all righty well
thank you for being here with us for this episode and i guess we'll see you all again in two weeks
awesome bye everybody
