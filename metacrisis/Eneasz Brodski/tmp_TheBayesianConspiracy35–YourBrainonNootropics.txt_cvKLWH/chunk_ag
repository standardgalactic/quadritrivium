like that's not what when we ask if someone is brain dead are are they still conscious
we're not asking will they vibrate if we beat on no but they're saying will they still respond
that's what we're saying we're saying will they still respond and in that sense
that's what i mean by vibe not necessarily vibrate but respond it took an input which was my force
and it responded with an output which was vibration no it didn't do anything the input could be
photons in that case my fingernails are as conscious as my brain is yeah i know and that's a totally
valid argument no it's not just a great that's redefining the word consciousness to be useless
that that's redefining the word consciousness simply to mean exists as matter yeah okay well
yeah you know no it when when in doubt since we've once we've hit this level of obfuscation
with the word like that's again that's why i call it the c word because it draws attention to it
it's the impossible problem no we should just i don't know the word exactly so i think yeah
exactly instead of using consciousness or any obvious like synonyms we just will change it out
for i'll change it out for subjective experience yeah i don't think that my fingernails have
a tragic experience and so then in that case sensory experience
i would even say subjective specifically like again what it's like to have that experience
so like sensory experience you know the the self-driving cars with their with their radars
have subjective experience or they have sensory they have sensory experience in that they perceive
and respond to external stimuli but i don't think there's anything that's like to be a radar right
if if consciousness is is a process and not a thing you know i mean that that's that's the easy
way to look at like ai and stuff like that is that consciousness isn't necessarily like a single point
in their system but it's just through going through the process of like calculating and
stuff like that if that were what consciousness like this is why it's such the hard problem to say
like oh an ai is unconscious it's because we just have nowhere to start we we we haven't even started
to make this has been the biggest problem since people have started talking everything's been
the biggest problem since we said that said this sounds like a great conversation for
a not post two hours episode yeah i didn't mean i didn't mean to jump us into this no this is a
whole episode this this is like a thousand year episode right here if you really wanted to get
into it yeah it is fun stuff but i do think that we are over time even though we don't have a hard
limit we have a soft limit that we've probably passed all right you railed you a little bit
i like rabbit holding at least i like it probably more than most people but once in a while we're
totally fine so so we would like to end by saying first of all thank you to our wonderful sound
