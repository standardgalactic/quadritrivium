days yeah we're just reading off of a script we you're talking about your cyberpunk characters
in the LPG that you play a friend of a friend we both know possible deniability maintained
great caller is it still maintained if you point out that you're maintaining possible
deniability I'm gonna go with yes yeah for my own gratification so what other things do you take
I really honestly don't take much of anything right now I think I think modafinal it really
is a lot more time efficient as far as the amount of research you have to do into it
the amount of balancing you have to do whatever you're doing like the smaller things you have to
do like one at a time for weeks on end until you add another thing and then you have to see
how those synergize and so like you know if you're just doing two that's not a lot but if you're
doing like 14 or something like that a day it's just a ridiculous time investment and then
measuring out each day and dosing and modafinal really condenses that down and just like cut this
pill in half and and pop that and you get most of it I'm hoping to start micro dosing soon
so what is this micro dosing that you speak of so micro dosing is where you take typically
they're done with psychedelics but other other people are doing them with like mdma and stuff
like that but you take a psychedelic like lsd and you cut it down to about a tenth of a typical
dosage so so like 10 micrograms which is which is incredibly small and and then you'll you'll
take that on on some sort of regular schedule and it's supposed to improve quite a bit I think
that's that's where a lot of the community is moving towards now that we've gotten out of the
whole like this needs to be all super safe like we're guinea pigging ourselves so we have to
just like have everything incredibly safe and we're starting to branch out because things like
modafinal open that door and they say hey we can be safe and get like a one or two percent increase
in our performance or we can be less safe and get like 10 or 20 percent increases in our performance
and that's I mean it's just incredibly valuable so the micro dosing you would do on a daily basis
I don't know yet I haven't it would certainly be something that I mean with all of these
always listen to your body and and you have to be very in tune with with where you're at
and it is certainly so you haven't tried any micro dosing yet I haven't tried any micro dosing yet
okay you said micro dosing of lsd yes what does that do so because I'm assuming a micro
dose wouldn't give you like the hallucinations and stuff this is all sub perceptual okay it
should be you shouldn't notice any difference in colors anything you shouldn't get any hallucinations
or enhancements it should just be generally like modafinal where it just things go easier and you
get a slight performance increase how do you how do you measure something like that because you
can have random variation performance increase just on based on whether you slept okay or if
you're fighting off some minor bug or something totally as far as like dosage with with lsd typically
well it's harder if you're getting street lsd because you don't know if it's going to be evenly
laid on on the tabs the lsd comes on like little pieces of paper I mean you don't know if it's
going to be evenly laid and then if you cut that up to divide it then you can get one piece that
just has all of the lsd and then 10 pieces that have none of it but with like the black markets
and stuff like that it's made drugs a little bit better and safer because there's accountability
you know and and there's rating systems and stuff like that so you can know that you're
going to get a pretty good laid thing and then you can also instead of cutting it up what some
people will do is they will just drop it in water and then drink a portion of that water
because it dissolves and and in the water fully and does it like is the lsd supposed to make you
more creative or more alert or yeah on both both it's supposed to be it would be kind of like
modafinil except instead of it increases your performance in a similar way except it is leaning
a little bit more towards that creative side where modafinil is is a little bit more of like a
structured side like a hyper focus i i don't know really how to explain the differences
probably because i haven't experienced micro dosing okay yet but the anecdotals out there are pretty
good so and it's kind of hard to ignore is it supposed to be just a little micro dose on when
you want a good creative day or is this like a daily sort of thing i think different people
do it differently um i've heard of a lot of people that will do
one day initially where they're taking the full effect and then three days off where it's like
one the second day they're still feeling it a little bit or like some of the positive effects
and then the third and fourth day they let burn in days so days where they like have to
you know reflect on on what happened and kind of how it was and then there's people that do it
every day and you know people that aren't really micro dosing and they're just going through their
days tripping balls um so there's there's a whole gamut of of people that are doing this
and they have all these conversations at longevity longevity yep dot com i i think the reddit
has a lot more on on the the micro dosing and stuff like that um long city longevity is more
focused on like the longevity and and just like more typical drugs more legal drugs than lsd
okay so go with the the uh new tropic sub reddit then i mean go with whichever one you well you
would want to right but if you want to like read about that kind of stuff and talk with people
better doing reddit yeah is a much less monitored community okay interesting have you done any
micro dosing no i mean not unless you count 100 milligrams of caffeine as opposed to the
two or six that most people are running on every day you sir you disappoint me with your definition
of micro dosing no i i you mean a full dose yeah chest hair you mean sweater i i haven't uh i haven't
micro dosed or full dosed with any illegal substances like i said i've i've used marijuana
a few times and i say it that way because i don't typically smoke it and i got someone laughing
like you use marijuana you dweeb like you know you don't say it you're supposed to you smoke it
or whatever i typically don't smoke it but that's like less than i don't know 10 times a year if
that it's been two three months since the last time i had any any sort of illegal anything
because i've been in the job market so but i i totally get where you're feeling we're like yeah
i am doing marijuana today or i'm using marijuana today rather than smoking or whatever it's i'm
taking a substance exactly those people that micro dose marijuana too really and that's yeah
what would they report are the effects of micro dosing so it can reduce social anxiety
quite a bit which is which is really interesting because it's kind of countering what marijuana
does at a larger scale if you take like a full dose you get a paranoid paranoid but yeah micro
dosing marijuana sometimes brings people's anxiety level down and and that you know there's the
different drugs do different things there is a lot of people that don't look for those things that
allow them to say remember an extra digit in a string and more focus on like fear reduction
and anxiety reduction and that can give you just so much better performance than just being able to
to remember an extra number on a phone number or something like that you know make a much bigger
difference in your life it can make a huge difference especially if you're crippled by
stuff like that yeah in colorado marijuana is legal and you can get it in various forms and
various types at dispensaries every six feet of the state there are more marijuana dispensaries
in denver than there are starbucks really yeah at least that's what i read a couple years ago
which i mean it sounds crazy until i realized that like just on the drive from my place
like in the three and a half miles to the interstate i pass no less than half a dozen yeah
and i pass i think only three starbucks so i see some like gas stations and stuff now that are
like gas stations slash dispensaries damn yeah there's also a lot of places in colorado where
you can't sell marijuana because the local little communities are like nope not in our area and so
i think they probably get all crammed into these the few places that will let you do it i don't
know how they all stay in business when they're competing with people that are literally across
the street maybe it's like a gas station thing you know brand or like this is booming yeah i think
right now it's in the whole you know the boom cycle and eventually the the people who are less
competitive will get weeded out and bought up by everyone else weeded out i did not intend that
so because i hate puns oh pun puns are the best anyway um we will fight after this as far as
different ways to take it i've seen i haven't been i've been in a few of these stores like i've been
shopping for the stuff twice since i moved to denver like three years ago but i remember one
of them had pills yeah of what is that not thc ingredient cbd cbd cbd is incredible it's it's
it's an amazing it's most of the health stuff that you associate with with marijuana without
all the psychoactive high okay you know our our descendants you know 50 hundred years on the line
they're gonna owe us a lot of thank yous a lot of us guinea pig ourselves mechardism with usd and
cbd and ten dollars a day worth of of neutropics just so and in you know a generation or two
they're going to be taking the daily pill and they're going to be operating at 180 percent of
what the grandparents operated at yeah we're right here in descendants we are the spark of the neosapiens
well this is in nick bostrom's book the super intelligence book he was he was talking about
like one of the ways that they could do is through you know drug alt augmenting a society with drugs
and and stuff like that or just having the general population being smarter and not
necessarily doing it through like you know agis and stuff like that so it could be incredible
what some of these things lead to but then also like like we said earlier you're inserting
something that increases performance into a system that judges you on your performance and
that can always have just like crazy societal effects yeah and society in general has been
you've heard of flin effect right no oh so uh the flin effect is the effect that has been measured
that society in general western society has i'm not sure if it extends to everywhere in the world
but i know definitely in the u.s and in europe people have just been getting smarter over the past
five seven or eight decades yeah where where uh iq tests have had to be adjusted every few years
to take into account the fact that the average person is simply smarter nowadays and i mean
there's a lot of hypotheses as to why this is better nutrition better hygiene taking lead out of
stuff yeah but yeah yes but i mean no one really knows exactly what has caused it but people have
just been getting in general low level smarter for a number of decades where at this point i think
the average person is 40 to 50 smarter than someone was seven decades ago which is amazing
keeping in mind though too that the maybe part of the reason that society is less violent now i don't
know just my own personal prejudice there that there might be some correlation there i mean so
i think it depends on what parts of iq tests and i i only know this because a i was listening to
something about this earlier and b it's something that i think about but there are different portions
of an iq test you know part of it is you know this as to this or this is x as to y as b is to or as
a is to blank or whatever but then there are like parts where it's like all right what would this
structure of squares look like from viewed from the top because you can kind of see it from the side
well viewing it from the side and then imagining it from the top might be more difficult 60 years
ago because there weren't 3d rotating objects that you saw all the time on a flat surface like a tv
or a video game screen oh but you know now all the time you know on loading screens for fallout
you're sitting there rotating the little pins or items or whatever while you're waiting for things
to load so you're getting a lot of practice with some of these things but that's true uh flint effect
is a real thing it has its own wikipedia page and this is kind of just like turning a spotlight on
it and it's saying like we're getting smarter now let's figure out how to get smarter at getting
smarter yeah you know and if we could turn that up and keep society getting smarter i i'm all for
that and it seems to be having good effects there is there is the concern that like turn it alluded
to like in the first few minutes of you know some some disparity between and you used to just a minute
again that if if it's if some people have access to this and it makes them better at being productive
people well then those people are gonna it you know could kind of just take off for them and not for
the rest of us yeah but it's it's a positive feedback loop you know you you make more money
so you can afford more pills that make you more money right like those bastards that only sleep
for four hours right god i do wonder though like so that's it's not clear to me how that could
how that might work out in the future because i mean so for example i don't think it's clear
to anybody and that's well exactly i want to give out a couple of examples so like if smartphones
cost eight thousand dollars and almost nobody had them but you know the top two percent could afford
it and they have the wealth of the universe or the world's information at their fingertips all the
time and the rest of us had to go to you know physical buildings and look at books oh yeah
libraries i forgot what they're not kidding but yeah i mean i have all the libraries on my phone
right now i think when phones are first being pushed into the market they were kind of seen
like as this toy for rich people and i forget who put it this way it was somebody ages ago that i
heard on a tv or podcast or something they were like i mean yes this this was pushed out as a toy
for the rich and then now like dock workers in Somalia are using them to coordinate like this
is something that everybody or like you know everyone that's not the body and billion of people
on earth have access to and i'm wondering you know if depending on how these drugs worked or how
this feature turned out it could be that oh cool we'll just put modafinil's super awesome great
grand cousin into the water supply and everyone's gonna have some or if it's gonna be yeah it's
awesome it's like that movie limitless but it's a thousand dollars a pill enjoy right well everything
always starts out as a thousand dollars a pill but then it gets cheaper over time like the first
computers were massive and cost billions of dollars maybe not billions but millions at least
equivalent of billions probably okay yeah yeah fair point i mean i don't know and i yeah obviously
i'm speculating i was just that is the one thing i hear kick back a lot for any sort of transhumanist
progression is that like well yeah but then the society will just all skew towards the first
people to get access to it and i don't know if that the rich always have these advantages yes it's
that's always going to be the case that the people with the most money will get the most advantage
soonest and then it'll slowly spread to everyone else and if we're talking about like a five or
10 20 increase we're not talking about tripling your iq right so if it was the case that being
20 if it was if it was the case that being a center deviation ahead meant that you had all
of this extra sway and all this extra power the world's most powerful people would be the world
smartest people and they're often not oh yeah 20 percent is huge though it is 20 percent is gargantuan
you would you would be the best performing person that you know at 20 increase if nobody else was
doped up well i mean if you're having iq of 100 and you know somebody that iq of 120 that disparity
is not gargantuan oh it's huge pretty big yeah 100 120 is is gargantuan for sure um i don't know if
it's life changing but it's it is a lot yeah it's quite a bit it would be a noticeable sometimes
here this is this is the way that i would say it at least has affected me in my life there are there
are times whenever i take modafin l that i feel like i'm cheating where you just feel like you know
i get such a crazy advantage with it but i don't want to like tell everybody else that this advantage
is out there because it wouldn't it would make me a lot less you know extraordinary or or abnormal
you know i know that feeling you're talking about but i feel like that might be one of the one of
the effects of the drugs or which is one of the effects of having a great day right i mean
because like i said it never put me in a stage in a mindset that i've never been in before
it just it it got me there artificially yeah and immediately rather than you know
throwing the dice every day i work with my job i'm directly compensated based on performance
like i have a commission plan and so it does make it like and and my statistics versus all my
peer statistics is all tracked right next to each other and so it does for for my situation
specifically it definitely makes me feel like i'm cheating and and just gives me an unfair
advantage i think got a question usually the advantages you can get but i guess i do want
to say that i've been pushed back i thought that 20 points wouldn't make wouldn't make or break the
world but it seems like you guys are saying it might it's it's a lot i got a question if everyone
in your workplace knew about modafin l and used it would you support regulation to be like okay guys
let's all just quit it and we'll be you know nothing will change in our relative performance
or would you want to keep using it because you like the performance that you get out of it i think
that i i would like to see something where it's just like you know you you're showing that you
are enhanced you know competing with the non-enhanced though i that way people could differentiate
and then people could choose you know if someone if your boss were to say like hey i understand
you'll perform less you're not going to be judged based on that you'll be judged against the people
who are also not doping and and then you know the people who really want to like you know if the
commission structure if it's all commission and the commission structure were the same the people
that just want to like you know burn really hot 24 seven they can do that and then the people that
don't would do that um but the current state i probably wouldn't vote for uh for getting it taken
