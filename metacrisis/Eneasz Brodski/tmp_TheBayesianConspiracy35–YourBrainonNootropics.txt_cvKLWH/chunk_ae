away just because i get such a distinctive advantage from it for that reason for the first
reason and in your response there is exactly why i would love a separate league for people
that could be openly on all the steroids i think that'd be awesome to watch football with people
that yes this guy's on all these drugs this guy's all these drugs let's watch these monsters clash
and go my god dude they would turn themselves a lot of doping if you did something like that i
mean i mean you have to that you got to keep that in mind if you want to get into into uh
performance boosting competitive sports yeah you realize your life expectancy will take a hit
and you know your body is going to be destroyed because you're going to be fighting with people
you know that can go toe to toe with silverback guerrillas but i think that it would just be
awesome watching you know a baseball game with super dopers like oh we had to up this up the density
of the balls and bats because they kept destroying these things like they pushed what they pushed
left field out to a thousand yards because like it's too it's too tight but but then you know i
mean would you like if i was going out at my work and i was saying like hey i'm doping people would
see my performance and they would say oh that's that's a lot less impressive now okay you know
and so i think that that would have that effect if if we were to say like hey you can be really open
about these things people would just say well i'm not going to do it because of the negative
effects and i don't feel like i need to constantly one up them would you so would you like to work
on a team where everyone was doping just because the team would be so much more effective you'd
hate that because you wouldn't shine well not just that just because it would be you'd be
having to burn hot to stay competitive but what if you'd like there was a limit of only doing it
two or three times a week yeah i think that'd be fine i would i would be fine with that but
something on mondays but yeah if it were just like allowed whenever and there wasn't a limit on
to on it then it's just it would be such a rat race that that would be really unenjoyable i feel
like it would take away a lot of what life is supposed to be about and it's not always about
just like constantly getting ahead sometimes it's like slowing down smother roses so if you were on
a team where it was twice a week but everyone doped then that would be cool i would i would be
fine with that i would i think that would be a lot of fun yeah you would you would be able to see
some really amazing things societally i think if if this was more widespread yeah do we want to
wrap it up because we are now at an hour and a half yeah i think we've hit just about everything
i'm trying to think of i mean we we sort of focused on a handful but i guess this is we focus on a
handful of new tropics but i guess you know the the point is that this is a
subject of inquiry and and active investigation that's out there that you know if you want to look
into um i mean the sort of the general idea that if you can get a couple percent boost and it's
not all that costly and it's pretty safe that sounds pretty cool yeah look check it out it's
fun do your homework read around it's fun stuff definitely do your homework even if it's just
check the academic i mean for the most part this this is the main takeaway too is like hey will
these drugs make me smarter make me you know better at this or that the answer is who we don't
know yeah not just three of us but the the industry as a whole doesn't like hey if i take
you know 300 milligrams of this 200 of this and 10 of that what's gonna happen well we're not really
sure not because uh you know there's a there's not a ton of research done but b you know your bodies
everyone's bodies work different some people like you said are non-responders to things that
it's weird that they're not responders too because it's pretty intense oh man that would suck if
society was based on people doing that because a non-responder yeah they'd be screwed so yeah i mean
it's it's one of those things that there's a lot of of up in the air still that's why i said our
descendants are gonna owe us for doing all the the guinea pigging down the road so it is it is
genuinely unknown what we don't know what the negative effects of a lot of these things are
on large timescales some of its stuff that you know pharmaceutical companies have even said you
know we just don't feel like it's worth it researching that anymore because the risk profile
we have found is so high and then the the Neutropics community has said you know we don't mind so much
you know so it is there's a lot of genuinely dangerous stuff in this space so just do all
of your research and definitely try and stay as safe as possible i would say and be okay with
knowing that we don't know the long-term effects yet so you might die in 20 years yeah totally and
that's something to accept there's there's a lot of stuff that has happened Sunni Fieram is one that
i think there was somebody who died on it and and it was just what is Sunni Fieram it's it's
called an ampakine it's just one of those various drugs i mean there's hundreds of them out there
but it was one of those ones that turned out to be you know kind of bad for you and and people
were doing it so it is guinea pigging there is real risks involved i think there was somebody who
who was using caffeine but they were using an importer just because it's so incredibly cheap
in powder and you know he took like a tablespoon of it thinking um thinking he'd be fine and his
heart exploded or something like wait you know somebody this happened to i don't know them
no but but i know of of them yeah i remember when think geek uh this this website that
sells just hilarious little geeky toys they were selling like caffeine that came in a salt shaker
and like to add it to your french fries your pizza or whatever totally it's incredibly dangerous
that was my exact first thought i was like i can't wait to i can't wait but i i wonder how
long it's going to be before someone dies doing a line of this on youtube right jeez yeah like i mean
what were they thinking they were thinking oh i bought this from thinking it's not dangerous what
is geek set thinking that like people are gonna i mean i guess they can sell whatever they want
people can be dumb or whatever but like there's no way but they're gonna use that responsibly
in a i mean well it's because when you're selling it in a novel way like that people don't understand
that it's something that needs to be used responsibly yeah you know we think about coffee
and we're like oh shit i've had so much coffee in my life this isn't a bad thing and then some kid
takes a teaspoon dies you know so it is genuinely dangerous you definitely have to do your research
on it and no one's been taking it long enough to know that if it's going to maybe give you
Parkinson's or Alzheimer's or something down the line yeah i take my caffeine in pre-measured
pill form but i don't measure it myself i have it packaged and sets me that way because i'm not
again it's just so incredibly cheaper right well it's cheaper but also like as far as not even
just buying the powder and packaging my own because i also like knowing exactly how much i'm
getting you know even with a cup of coffee you're getting some wide variants if you're doing this
without a scale if you're jumping into any of these no tropics without a scale then you're
doing it wrong anybody who tells you you can eyeball this stuff i mean we're talking about
milligrams and and micrograms and stuff like that you can eyeball it just simple as that right on
i could go on and on but i feel like we are we're hitting that upper time limit so do you
want to move on to listener feedback okay actually not going to listen to feedback just
yet because taren had one more thing um well i just wanted to bring up that it's kind of interesting
in the way it changes how you think it's not necessarily always faster so they did studies
on chest players and they used modafinil in this study and they found out that actually the chest
players were taking longer per move they were making better moves they were getting a net positive
but it wasn't necessarily by like going through it easier or faster it's just they were able to see
more per move um so i just thought that was something interesting to kind of throw in there
it is very interesting that is that wasn't it wasn't my experience at all that things seemed
like they went fast if anything it seems like things are going the same speed and i was going
faster which is probably you know something like this the subjective experience of these chest
players who were like you said running through more moves in their head before they made their
actual one i would be fun to see how they performed on aterol if they're if they made faster moves
that were you know on on average worse yeah that would be a really interesting thing to to cross
exam i know that if it were me that's how it would be on i mean or like on just too much caffeine
you're just speeding through you're not you're not a sharper better thinker you're just a faster one
yeah you're also faster at i guess implementing your ideas before you know having the chance to
run through them all yeah and so i don't know crap we never got to aterol i mean they're
that's the biggest portion of it if you look at like schools and stuff there's some schools that
have like 35 usage of performance enhancing drugs as far as like schoolwork in terms of aterol in
terms of like aterol and riddling riddling is huge and mommy's a little helper yeah and that
with modafinil you don't have a big you have a big risk profile but compared to things like
amphetamines you don't really um aterol is basically speed yeah yeah it is it is and it
hyper focuses you right mm-hmm i call it speed of the pg-13 rating speed legal and packaged for
you right for children yeah for children yeah so i know i hear it just like really narrows you in
on exactly what you're focusing on you don't change your focus to anything else yeah so aterol
now that i'm posing the question this way to myself would be like combining all of the bad
things of caffeine with all of the i guess with too much of the good things from modafinil
so like you said it's it's like with modafinil like i said i spent a day playing skyrim but
i wasn't setting out to anything productive that day anyway i just know that it is kind of easy to
get caught up in doing whatever it is you're doing just like it is when you're able you know if
you're feeling super focused that day anyway that might happen but without at all yeah you're gonna be
you know you're gonna be that kid at recess counting blades of grass right just because
this is super interesting and oh my god like but i don't know in your whole house because you have
to right yeah so i mean i took aterol two or three times during call during my first couple
years at college so like i don't know jesus i'm old like seven or eight years ago yes so old
steven over me currently the oldest i've ever been that's true uh actually my as far as impacting
my sleep this is interesting both times that i took it i stopped fine that night the night after
i was up all night just laying there trying to fall asleep both times i'm not sure if the second
time was i also had more insomnia issues back then but this was just i remember i think the
second time i took it i tried i just laid in bed until i you know i saw my window kind of
light up a little bit and i could hear birds singing and it's like well that's it i'm up for the day
five thirty in the morning the last psychiatrist back when he was still blogging
wrote a post about okay kids listen if you're gonna take aterol at college here's how to do it right
because i see a lot of you fucking it up and it's a really interesting post but one of the big
things that he said is it changes your mental state enough that you want to be in the same
state when you're taking tests as you were when you were studying so if you study on aterol take
your test on aterol as well and if you don't study on aterol then don't take it before a test
yeah state dependent memory is a real thing for everything and that's that's why i mean everything
i'm also kind of super nitpicky with a lot of things that i do but i like sitting in the exact
same seat and whatever like when i was and i'm in a classroom setting i like studying and test
taking in that seat and there was one really hard class when it's getting my undergrad that
was sort of designed as like the senior class fail or like drop out test to see like if you're
really serious about getting this degree you're going to pass this class with like a 25 fail rate
the test room was always different than the lecture room and that drove me insane we would
go to a completely different building and because it was a class with like i think it ran three times
a day or three times a week with different times but it was three classes running concurrently
with like 200 people per class so that but they would all test in the same day so they kind of
just spread out rooms throughout the campus to get people to take this test and i'm convinced
i would have tested a little better in the real in the in the lecture room
anyway adderall experiences i didn't mean to jump in there did you i i haven't had very many
with adderall and i don't see it as particularly i think it is great for mindless tasks
to keep your mind from wandering yeah yeah just for like cleaning and stuff like that but
i don't see much value for it whenever you compare it to things like madaphanel that are
you know a quarter of the price and effective in more of the ways that you want this type of
drug to be effective and doesn't have as many of the side effects that you want that you wouldn't
want from these types of drugs madaphanel is just miles above where adderall is for the
new tropics community i'm wondering my memory of of my time using it adderall like i said is
almost 10 years old and but if i'm remembering correctly or if i'm not just you know inventing
the memory right now i feel like there was more of the uncomfortable mental effects like when i took
afedra a couple years ago um and less of the physical effects although there was still
de jitteriness the heart rate and stuff but it wasn't as bad and maybe the mental effects were
more pronounced but the in the physical effects less pronounced but it wasn't a positive experience
yeah again people take it your mileage varies if you have 80 80 or 80 hd definitely it helps
you out a lot and it doesn't it's not speed for you it's one of those weird things where it
does actually just chill you out if your brain chemistry is different so but it is something
like without the big difference i would say with adderall like you take or vivans or riddolin or
any of those amphetamines you take those and you think like it hits you hard enough to where you
think i'm definitely on a drug whereas madaphanel there's tons of times throughout your day
whenever you can completely forget that you took it just because it feels so much just like you're
in your normal state of consciousness everything is just easier for me i don't know everybody's
everybody's chemistry is is different you know so i for one have been convinced to turn into a
drug using hippie because of you guys or at least experiment with it cool all righty yeah fun stuff
all right i think we're ready for listener feedback for realsies okay listener feedback for
realsies uh the first two things i have are both just corrections so i'll just read them there's
not really much to reply to unless you guys want to jump in uh first mr oliva says in regards to
our episode when we were talking about ai with shan uh when you talk about neural networks
overfitting the data inyash likens it to seeing faces in clouds but that is exactly the opposite
of overfitting overfitting is like only recognizing the faces that the neural network was trained on
as actual faces because the neural network had so much training on those it essentially made them
a limited set of correct inputs rather than trying to find the common traits for faces
this occurs when you train more than once on a single data set because the neural network is
reinforcing its previous beliefs it can also not show up in a test if you reuse training data as
test data to see how accurate it is so i was wrong it is not it is not seeing the data everywhere
it is having such a limited pool that you only see it from from these very specific examples
to make sure i understand so like it'd be like if you train this neural network to recognize
chairs and you only train it on like four legged backed chairs it wouldn't recognize arm chairs
couches lazy boys spinny computer chairs is that sort of what what you're saying yes that's what
it sounds like from from what i gleamed maybe if it's bad enough it might not even recognize the
same chair in a slightly different position gotcha but what you were saying was kind of the opposite
word it was everything with a flat surface as a chair yeah got you okay yeah cool i got it wrong
the exactly wrong direction that's that's right that you get exactly wrong right go cool not without
incident says a quick alpha go clarification alpha go uses neural networks but it isn't really
accurate to say that alpha go is a neural network alpha go uses a search tree like deep blue did
but uses two neural networks to reduce the prune and search space to reduce and prune the search
space so yeah when sean said it is a neural network that wasn't technically correct that
makes sense i remember during the episode that which reminds me i well i don't know if this is
worth mentioning this was the first episode i actually re-listened to in like six eight months
and i think we turned that okay yeah but i do remember when he said that about alpha go and
that uh he says something about a brute forcing the maybe this is before the show but i remember he
says something about a brute forcing the solution which i remember was exactly how it didn't work
unless like i mean it brute forces it but then uses neural network or neural net algorithm
magic to prune down the immense search space with go moves so it's not just like chess or
actually this is an interesting related point i remember reading sometime like a year ago
why there wasn't chess or excuse me checkers championships so the way that there are chess
championships it's because checkers is a solved game yeah it's too easy it's like tic-tac-toe
well it well exactly but the fun thing about it was that i remember it was either in 1868 or
1968 or somewhere in one of those decades probably 1868 and 1968 are a century part i know somewhere
in so it doesn't matter the point is during some of the last times the tried doing checkers tournaments
