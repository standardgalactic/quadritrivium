don't I'm not a very sweaty person so like the fact that like I'm wiping my forehead and noticing
that I'm sweating was like I said if I didn't know that I was to expect this I would have gone
straight to the hospital it was like a four-hour panic attack it was I mean you know well the
shortness of breath was I mean panic attack might be too severe but it was like a very mild panic
attack for four hours it was a nightmare I can see the benefit if you're trying to push through
that last eight hours and a 56 hour shift or something insane if you're driving cross country
and want to put on and go but I can't imagine using that at anything like a regular that was the
one time and I'll never buy it crazy so as far as medofinal being a non-stimulant this this was
I don't remember the cognitive benefits of the fedrics the physical ones were so bad
just remember crappy time yeah it was it was my mirror and I don't remember what the hangover
was like either I'm sure there's one of those I don't really experience a hangover with medofinal
either yeah but I take it moderately isn't really any hangover they're like I said they're totally
is um if if you're abusing it if you're skipping sleep yeah totally if you're skipping sleep like
the hangover is is your sleep essentially so if you skip that out so what do you guys use it for
I use it to have good cognitive days should I have the need to have a good cognitive day and
like not be able to since I've never been able to pin down over the years what factors lead me to
have a great day this is just one on demand so you know whatever it is crunch time at you know
work or school or whatever but I don't know what is your yeah yeah the the same thing it's just
a good day in a pillow I won't usually take it on days that I'm not working one of the nice things
that separates medofinal and most of the other neotropics is that those are going to be kind of
like a rolling better like you're just kind of kind of always be a little bit better um whereas
medofinal you can flip it on and off so if I want to have a day like go to the botanical gardens
or something and really just enjoy something like that obviously you don't want to be like
trying to count how many flowers there are in the botanical gardens that's not really the point
but but for a work advantage it's just a crazy distinct advantage often do you guys use it probably
two or three times a week somewhere around there um usually on like the weekends or
like my really busy days um but then some days I'll just or some weeks I'll just take the entire
week off you know I'm sure there's been like a month at least where I didn't do it at all
it just kind of depends I haven't used in at least over a month uh it's a I don't have that much and
b it is the sort of thing where since I'm not doing anything currently that demanding that
taxing it just feels like a waste yeah um definitely but there's one more thing I was going to say
about medofinal and it's not coming to my oh this should be I guess disclaimer this is a prescription
drug yes that you can only get prescribed for for a couple of the you know the reason that we
mentioned otherwise you know and the this use is off-label it's not like you can't go to your
doctor and be like I want to feel good all the time great here's some endorphinil um let's have
a really cool doctor but and and and just but loads of cash um this is it's incredibly expensive okay
so um I've heard that it's incredibly expensive if you get it through the prescription round like
between two and twelve dollars a pill or something yeah but I've also heard that India does not really
give a shit about the copyright claims on the medofinal molecule and that is where most people
get it how much how much does it cost when you're willing to you know hit the gray markets speaking
purely hypothetically of course because you know that right from from the people you've talked to
from the people I've talked to it it's about a dollar a pill um and a pill would would for
people like Stephen and I being about uh two doses okay so about fifty cents fifty cents a
dose um but yeah if you were expected what it's still more than I expected yeah I thought it was
in the order of sense well I guess fifty cents I mean fifty it's if if you experience that it's
totally worth it fifty cents a pill or a fifty cents a dose I would say that if I if it if I'm
you know weighing it out and I was taking it you know how many times a year I'd probably five
bucks a pill sounds at least fair oh yeah like I mean when you think I'll pay you know five bucks
for a cup of Starbucks I mean this is this is a whole different level of different performance so
yeah and and I would certainly even if it wasn't so ridiculously cheap I would still probably be
doing it on the same usage schedule that I use now because it's so helpful yeah oh definitely
but yeah it's it's about fifty cents or a dollar a pill on on the gray markets
and then like four hundred dollars about for thirty of them on on a prescription
I've heard that if you get your prescription useful that Costco is way cheaper for whatever
that's worth and I believe people can just google biomedafinal and it'll bring them to places where
they can get that right yeah okay so I've heard is there anything any places they should avoid
I would I would say avoid getting midafodil unless it's prescribed to you by a doctor
probably it is something or unless you're willing to be a guinea pig but but you definitely need to
know full well going into it that you're guinea pigging yourself this is something we literally
don't know how it works we don't even know how to begin we think that maybe it has something
to do with dopamine but it's just there's so little that we know about it but it's effective
enough that people are like you know screw it I'd rather just be a you know make a lot of money and
then pay for whatever problems that would arise from biomedafinal usage so do do you get it in
pill form because I've heard a lot of people just buy the raw powder really cheap and cap it themselves
yep there is other analogs to medafinil that are completely legal you can buy the the doses are a
little bit higher and it's so much less predictable and I think that's really where that at least has
has a big con but denture question I've never heard of buying powdered medalfinil of you
yeah yeah there's I mean there's the the afanil's little asterisk afanil's family there's
tons of them there's at least 10 I thought powdered a draffinil before yeah a draffinil's the
the analog specifically moda the the stuff that you can describe medafinil I'm sure you can get it
but there's I mean there's flow medafinil or flow daffinil a more daffinil like flow there's
just a bunch of different afanil's are you guys familiar with Guern at all
Guern okay so Guern has some notoriety some level of fame in the community for
writing really long data heavy intense posts on things that he gets interested in just a
treasure trove of data and too much for a noob like me to hack through in an afternoon but
he did a whole thing on new new new tropics and he has special sections for modafinil and for
melatonin specifically because he says those two are amazing needed a whole lot more on them
but when I was reading through his new tropics post he said that the adafinil is just really
kind of hit and miss and so not nearly close to modafinil that you're better off not even
bothering with it yeah oh I wouldn't I would never bother with it it has to be metabolized
before it can actually turn into the modafinil and that's the part where it gets really unpredictable
is you don't know how long it's going to take for it to hit like your liver and stuff like that
and so it's just it's really hard to know what to expect whenever you take that that said a
drawfinil is perfectly legal you can buy it at licensed distributors online totally like new
tropics depot or other places and I took one this morning 300 milligram pill but the thing is
they're like a buck a pill too yeah not a bite in powder form mainly because the powder is pretty
expensive and the little mechanism that I used to have when I did pack my own pills with powder
is it's slightly wasteful and all of those were like basically small crystals too this is just
straight powder that I knew I was going to get all over my keyboard all my all over my desk or
carpet wherever it ended up so I figured that you know I'd save the time and no doubt wasted
product and just get it in pill form that said I get an effect from modafinil and I do get an effect
from or I do get an effect from modafinil I wonder if there's a one-to-one or a near one-to-one
relationship there because I know the same person that I know who doesn't reflect reacts to moda
all this doesn't moda is short for modafinil because alpha nil sounds A it's hard to say and
B it sounds the same in all of them but the edgrafinil didn't affect her either yeah so totally
edgrafinil is just an analog for modafinil so what happens is you ingest that drug it goes into
your your body and then once it hits your liver it actually just turns into modafinil that's like
a really simplified explain it like I'm five version but essentially yeah so she just is
a non-responder to modafinil and then once it turns into that it's not hitting her just the same
for sure I guess what I was getting at too is that if you wanted to guinea pig yourself without
breaking the law this would be a way to try it yes oh definitely but you know side effects you
know are there you may waste your money you know it use responsibly all that I hate to
put out stuff and then have someone you know write in and be like oh my god this was the
worst thing ever you know I lost my job or you know like I was chewing my fingernails and whatever
freaked out you know like I don't think that'll happen you know the rush from these things is
pretty small but you know just just use responsibly you know like it would any you know if someone
came to you at a party and you're like hey I've got this cool new drug you want to try some
dual you know what would you do you do homework you would you know use small if you're to use
some after your homework you know you'd start low and then you know whatever so just be smart and be
safe I can't I can't not trust that technically illegal to have it without having a prescription
as well apparently some guy got was in his car he'd been drinking a lot I don't know he shouldn't
have been in his car if he'd been drinking a lot right but the cop stopped him and he had some
Madafnil on him and I mean it's it's basically a harmless drug right but he got a slap Madafnil
or Draftnil Madafnil oh okay but he got slapped with a felony charge yeah totally yeah for
holding it and I thought well that sucks so I guess don't carry it with you yeah in your house
yeah it's a prescription drug yeah Madafnil is a Draftnil the stuff I was talking about
that you can get online is not so not technically like there is there is chemical analog laws
that would probably if I mean somebody really wanted to argue it they could they could do that
unfortunately that's the case with almost everything right totally like you know if you
get a judge you know who really wants to fuck you you're gonna be fucked whether they have to make
up charges or not so so this new tropics depot is there like a community there people that talk
about the stuff um that was just I mean I was googling around for places to buy stuff and that
came up I don't know if I I'm not prepared to plug that as the best place to go to maybe Taren has
a better better resource I've heard that slash our new tropics people talk about their experiences
there a lot yeah there's a subreddit they probably have great links so there is a
longevity it's like longevity but the viddy is changed to city and that I think is is very much
an informed and they take a very scientific approach to testing this out so that's what I
would say if you're looking to really get into like get into the woods of this stuff that would
be a good research to or a good resource to to learn a lot I wanted to mention I haven't taken a
I haven't taken a draw for nil for at least over a month either but I took one today because I wanted
to have some very fresh in my mind conversation things to hit so and you know I also woke up
tired this morning so it was like perfect let's do this are you feeling the effect yeah this one
is much more of I mean it's almost placebo like like especially once you've had the real deal
it's this sounds like you know this sounds like you're talking you know waltz or white meth versus
whatever but like it's like yeah I guess you know it I mean it's kind of like double caffeine tea
you know like you probably won't notice the big difference you know just because it's well you
know it's still my usual thing this one it's hard to say probably a bit but it's not as pronounced
so it's I mean if you get anything from this you'll probably get something from from madalphanel
but you know again your mileage may vary are there any things that you would warn people
away from doing I'd say if you if you're looking at this field you made a pretty compelling argument
for nicotine yeah stay stay away I would stay away from the stuff with the with the higher risk
profiles anything specifically about madalphanel in general anything specifically about madalphanel
that people should avoid since that's probably the really popular one so if you're going to do it
if you're if you're absolutely like you're dead set on it your water intake is just incredibly
important like I was saying sleep and actually making sure you're getting the right amount of
good sleep and not just like closing your eyes for eight hours those are the two big things that
I would say to really watch out for and then take it lightly like it is a very good experience
for most people so you will want to just live there and and you know that can get unhealthy
really fast in quaren's article he mentioned a poker player who would use it almost daily
two to three hundred milligrams and he said after about a year his body simply adapted
and it doesn't do things for him anymore maybe I did read that post because that exact sentence
sounds very familiar okay maybe I read a synopsis or synopsis of it somewhere um the other thing
with madalphanel is take a first thing in the morning oh yeah I don't think we spelled that out
the half life is like 15 hours it'll be with you the whole day okay for a lot of people if you if
you do like like he was talking about doing a 300 I bet you probably wouldn't sleep if you did that
yeah and then you'd be going through a work day the next day just kind of screwed that's why I
would do it soon because I don't have I don't start my job for a month so congratulations by the way
Steven is now gainfully employed again
but yeah so a hundred milligrams you know I always take I always take my nitropics
after breakfast yeah because I eat first thing you know 10 minutes after waking or not 10 minutes
but whatever ish should you take it with food that I think people's that's gonna my my impression
Taryn went no more is that with just about everything it's you're gonna get like a slower
reaction a slower and a softer hit if you take it after food then if you take it you know before
you eat just because then it's working with everything else you've taken in do you want
the slower thing to to space it out or I found just for the only reason I did it this way is
because I if I take caffeine pills before I have I take my coffee with caffeine pills I don't know
if I've I think I mentioned that but the reason is because I can control my dose I take it with
L the alanine which reacts nicely with caffeine to help with the performance boostings that caffeine
gives you and I found that if I did that before breakfast I would just kind of feel nauseated for
a few hours you know for a period of time so I don't want the hard hit with that I don't know
what you're just standing with my Dauphinil or not see tongue twister if you say it eight times
in a row I think L theanine is also a really good thing to have on hand um yeah that that
definitely does calm the jitters if you do overdo it but it's it's not so what is this thing
L theanine it's it's what's in tea it's the other psychoactive substance in tea that a lot of people
don't talk about but our society consumes just as much um as L theanine um and it basically is
is a relaxant is it in uh coffee as well or just in tea I don't think it's in coffee I think it's a
tea thing okay and so that helps counteract the the the the jitters if you take too much
a little bit but certainly not to any level where I would say oh you take a 300 and you take a
little bit L theanine you'll be fine like um it's it might take the edge off it might if you just
barely go over if you go over a lot it's it's just there's not too much that'll help you okay so for
waiting it out is can you get L theanine in like pill form okay illegal um you can get it I I'm a
big fan of bulk supplements um I think that you know this entire hobby is extremely expensive
and and so bulk supplements really bring costs down so what other uh supplements and
new tropics do you take really quick I wanted to interject it correct me two more things with
with medallionel one I usually take one or two of your profan throughout the day
just to kind of act any possible headaches coming in and anticipate that your pee will smell weird
kind of like sulfur which it's I mean that sounds like a scary symptom but it's just since it's
going through your body but if you're if you're you're in is a very dark color that's a scary
sign of liver damage and some people do have an adverse reaction that can lead to that so
keep in mind that it's never not worth going to the hospital if you're very sick so if you have
to explain yes I broke the law but I don't want to die it's worth it I did that just occurred to me
but yes I wanted to ask about you said you take you did take or do take about eight a day um no I
did at my height uh I want to get back to that though that is all stuff that like you really
should be at least doubling water intake whenever you're taking one of these things at least doubling
it really makes your body learn burn really hot so you have to you have to certainly compensate
for that with water and none of this conversation is a comprehensive summary of all the stuff that
you should know do do your own homework spend you know at least half an hour an hour reading on
this stuff and be like okay avoid the pros and cons I'm not going to do it or I'm going to do it
but don't don't take this as the full package nor do we like condone use none of us would ever do
this sort of thing it's all hypothetical yeah tearing our both lying about our legal drug
