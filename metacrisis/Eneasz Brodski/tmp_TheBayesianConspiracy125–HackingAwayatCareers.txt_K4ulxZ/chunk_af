but um other than that there is kind of there there used to be how you got a job like and I
guess they would post like you know help wanted sections in the newspaper and stuff but before
the internet it was very much sort of and when you're you know a teenager without job skills
you're just going from door to door being like here's my resume and if you're gonna or can I fill
out an application yeah and if you're doing that sort of thing you can't be picky you gotta be like
does anyone need a body to do any sort of work and then you can find a job that way it didn't
like make any sense to be picky because it was all kind of the same jobs although the soap shop was
a lot cooler than working in a restaurant you know bus and tables or making breakfast sandwiches
um because I did get to like run the front of the shop and also make all the products
and making the products was so fun but also working the front the desk was really great
because um I'd just been used to you know I'd worked a bunch of cashier jobs but people grumpy
when when it comes to the part where they have to part with their money
uh except for like if they're going in to buy a gift for like for someone which usually they were
like buying themselves some like you know getting some self-care like or like buying gifts for people
and then and they're like oh these are so nice oh can you can you make a gift basket you know we
make gift baskets here we can make them whatever color you're like oh my god you know let me tell
you about my daughter all right we just took a few minute break because we needed to stretch
we've been here for a while and we were talking in the sequences about uh word count and information
ratio and I've had a lot of fun but people aren't here to hear about our career paths
although I think there's that's the thing is there's information to glean there on how we
did what we did um you know none of us are I think uh with the possible exception of jace who's been
doing I don't know 10 12 things over the last decade something like that like you're probably
the exception of the person who's like actually done cool shit with like chasing interests but
the rest of us have kind of just done not so off the beaten path things um what was I going to say
oh but if if people are looking for like okay that's fine that's all cool hearing about your guys
that stuff but how do I do stuff yeah we're gonna jump ahead to some of that um look how good Steven's
got in that segue so proud of you last practice I guess yeah I noticed like you know I've been
listening to I've been catching up on all my podcasts and I've like just been able to watch
you like getting better at it in that podcast and then like see you doing it and like I'm like
yeah the trick there is that usually I've got like a minute where we've been derailed long enough
and then Brian's talking I'm like all right let's think boy lead this back to where I was trying to
go so I just look for an opening and then I shove it in speaking of yeah like awkwardly um
and that podcast is we want more yeah um listen to that one too if you like this one you might
like that one um how I yeah so I said about how I got this soup job and like all the other jobs
before that was literally just walk in the door go harass the manager some of the advice I got from
like my parents and other people in my parents generation which they like would tell everybody
like this was this was the thing you're supposed to do oh yeah like so make your application and
then call them the next day and then keep calling them and keep like come in if they don't answer
you like I was like you want like so you're like harassing them giving you a job basically but this
was the advice that everybody gave wait so you're seeing that actually worked to get you the jobs
though yeah I mean all right it's it I haven't done it yet about that when I worked at the ice cream
shop I remember the manager going through and he had just a stack of applications and I was watching
him he's like this person called back this person called back this person called this person called
and these ones didn't just threw them the trash without looking at him wow but he was also an
idiot so take that with a grain of salt no that was like what they would um tell you like the
explanation for that is like oh you'll show that you're committed to the job if you call and like
you know and that you're like able to be business-like and professional on the phone and stuff like
that it was just like kind of the thing where it was a signal on both sides of I guess conscientiousness
and like career suitability where yeah but like it's just I don't know it's it would be so weird
to do now um I think at least I think it would be I don't know seems like maybe still work um so
yeah as I was like going through college I was still working so okay and it was a continuation
of random weird jobs um eventually yeah like internet uh like I don't know monster I think
was the first one I used monster.com and indeed and all those started existing and at that point
then I guess that was like sort of me growing and watching the career like standards changed
so that was interesting um but I was working as a sous chef um at the end of college when
this was actually really cool the the boss's wife who worked uh at a like finance industry was like
hey you're like majoring in art uh there's this guy who just took out a loan to do uh something
with video games and I mentioned that like you're in school for art and he might want to hire you
so that was how I like got into the video games industry and it's one of those um sort of networking
to you know it's who you know again and but um and it's also like jumping on opportunities so this was
that is a big one yeah like putting yourself in positions where you might run into opportunities
is and saying yes to everything yeah absolutely yeah I really like uh Derek Stivers actually has
good career advice he's the guy that made cd baby back in the day and now he like writes books and
music and stuff um what were some of his uh oh yeah like one of his like catchy things that I
enjoy is say yes to everything and then like once once you've like hit your sort of goal or your
success goal say uh fuck yeah or no yeah that's that's I mean just having luck is really important
but a lot of people don't seem to realize that luck a lot of it is being in positions where you
can run into opportunities and that requires things like you know going out being social saying yes to
any sort of requests and then yeah jumping on them when they do appear so let me yeah let me just
tell you how sketchy this was um can I with one sentence interject yeah speaking of being sketchy
that's how I fell into being a pi for a year okay was I mean that's it that that's the one sentence
version you were just a really sketchy dude and no no no I was fine on people I was not I did
insurance stuff it was less follow my ex-girlfriend or something it was uh insurance fraud but it was um
I was in a situation where the idea was presented to me and I was like you know what I hate what I'm
doing being a teller let's just see what it takes to get licensed and do this and uh then it happened
to be right after I got licensed I bumped into somebody uh at like a vape shop and like I was
just he was like what are you doing it's like well I just got licensed to be a pi no way a friend of
mine's a pi and I was like give him my number and I worked for that guy for a month he sucked but
like that's how I got in so it is just placement and seizing every opportunity too right so that
was all I brought it up for and it looks I mean um I don't know uh it sounded like you did a little
bit of research there too yeah to get started for sure like or at least you know know what it is
and get the interest but um yeah yeah I'll get to that with the library job I just want to like
real quick just because this is hilarious so uh yeah she's like here's this guy's phone number
and I call and it's his personal cell and it was just like hey yeah yeah I'm looking for
I just come by my house it's like this address just let yourself in oh bring your portfolio I'll
show you some of the stuff we're working on I was just like okay this is fine I brought like a knife
in my back pocket my portfolio and literally like I got to his house I call him he's like I'm down in
the basement yeah the front door's open here's the the code for my garage just um walk in door on
your left goes down to the basement just let yourself in I was like okay go to the basement now
my friends let them know where I'm at oh yeah but um it was legit it was that was yeah it's kind of
crazy trusted you with the code to his garage too this was the kind of person this guy was um he was
like creative genius very add and very like he was so good at doing um pitches for projects we got
so many projects because he would just like get so fucking excited about whatever it was we were
pitching that like he was practically like bouncing up and down and it was infectious cool um not so
good at like the organizational side of things that was what I was doing a lot of uh library so after
being in the games industry for like six years getting really disillusioned with it changing
like getting laid off it's building a new company getting bought by another company like uh um I
wanted to I realized that like I my goals changed to wanting to do something values oriented where
if I had gone back like to me in school I um kind of you know was like I guess I'll you know get this
art degree and probably become some graphics designer and be making ads or some shit and then
like I never really could have imagined that I would have been like working in the video games
like I worked for Disney at one point and it was just like if I went and told my past self that I'd
be like away and um then like doing it I was like actually I don't like this it was I don't know um
there was a point where like the love of video games and art like stopped being motivating um I think
we could touch on a little bit of hacking like you said I worked at Disney for at one point
which most people be like holy shit how did that happen yeah by like you know the the same
thing of like you know take a chance on creepy guy in the basement and eventually uh you know we
got hired um we were working for Microsoft originally and making like web-based MMOs and then
we just like we pitched a project to Disney and a bunch of it was one of those like um bunch of
people are pitching to be the ones hired for the specific project and we were the ones hired
and so like I never had like a goal of working for Disney and uh but then I like ended up there
and I was like hey cool um so the library though I was hanging out like a real lot in this library
um and after yeah like the the period where like the the rest of my employee like uh fellow
employees and my boss were trying to like form a new startup and getting and I was just like I'm
sick of this um I was hanging out this library a lot and I was like attending a bunch of their
events and at one like point you know um I like helped them fix their projector and like so like
people who were working there knew me and I was reading uh like I was I was into Paris at the
time and so I think that in particular I'll have to see if I can find it in link it but there was
this one article that was um a guest that was posting on his blog and probably someone he
didn't interview with was talking about backdoors into careers and he said that he wanted to like
work at this one radio company like be a radio host I think it was and he just um like I called
there called the place was like hey like could I talk to the manager and then like I think just
asked him like hey what would it take to get a job you know in radio and I forget if he didn't um he
might not have even like led up with that but like he just sort of became friends with this dude
and I think maybe helped him with like something else that he was like consulting or advertising
or something and then like by building that rapport with the person then they were willing
to be like you know rather than I don't know if any of these employees are qualified but like this
one has a degree and this one doesn't it's like oh this one has a degree oh but that one's Dave
we love Dave or whatever his name was um and there were some other suggestions about like
backdoor ways of finding your way into a career and I started actually like trying to put that
into practice I was like this is this library is a good opportunity I remember as a kid I
was like talked out of being a librarian real early because I did hear the stuff that any
ash was saying like oh yeah like well you need a master's degree and it's really competitive
and there's not like you know there wasn't a robust library system in New Jersey because
Governor Christie slashed library funding boo um but so you hung out at the library a lot yeah
hung out there made friends with the director and you helped when they needed things done
yep and yeah I like did I did some volunteers I did volunteer I made them a logo and helped them
like do some graphics for their website awesome and then like eventually I was like you know hey
what would it take to get hired here and I didn't have any background in library science but they
were like oh yeah like Jason's been here you know like it was again like uh you were bringing
bringing up the thing of like being someone that people want to work with yeah and especially like
with the logo and the website you did something for them that they couldn't do on their own you
weren't just like a grunt landing a hand you were like for them to do this would take special training
or hiring someone and you were like hey I have these skills and then they remember you for that
yep and and then I just um did the the other thing that I was talking about before where I kind of
okay I learned how to like run the sequel database and like run run the circulation desk
and then do like interlibrary loans like all that you know that on the job yeah um so you were just
like you know just following people around being an extra pair of hands until I like learned how
to do a thing and then I would be like okay what else can I help with eventually I was doing like
all the things yeah and it started with I'm here a lot of help a lot is there any way I can get a
job yep it's like yeah you know you're hiring somebody part-time you need some extra help for
the summer and then like eventually it was uh I then you were already there to
eventually I was like saying hey like um what if I got my library masters and like could I be hired
on as a librarian because I was like a library assistant uh although I they'd like promoted
me to a job that didn't really exist but it was like a media specialist library media specialist
which is a name that we made up and sort of crafted by looking at job postings
so they could justify giving me a promotion um and the director was like oh well like
you could go get your masters but you already know everything that they're gonna teach you
and I was just like um uh something else that I think was in that same Tim Ferriss article
uh since after he said that were you able to just go straight to librarian then no um
there's another one of those you have to have it yeah there um there is the you know the degree
barrier so they can I guess justify the high salary and but like yeah it was kind of I thought
that was kind of bullshit where it's like what if you do you know like start as an entry-level
employee and work your way to the point where it's like at least your company um offered to like help
pay for the college this was me just saying hey what if I take my own money and like go do this
but um yeah the I think it was I forget if it was a different Tim Ferriss article I have to see
if I can find these two I tried searching for them and they didn't come up as readily as before
but maybe I just need to tinker with my search terms uh there yeah and I'm sure I can find
it I think with this quote there's a guy said like oh this standard paces for chumps and he was
talking about uh how he went I forget if it was when he went to college originally or when he went
back to college but he realized that you can test out of classes so he was just like oh this is like
a superpower like so he just made himself a boot camp crammed for the stuff and then tested out of
each subject nice like you um he like had to I think talk it over with the professors or the
school faculty but it's like basically yeah if you can submit these three projects and then like
pass the final exam that'll prove that you know the the subject matter well enough that we can just
like be like yeah you get those credits so he like I forget how much um faster he got through
college that way but that's like whether that's more of a education hacking I guess but uh
I really strongly agree with the uh standard paces for chumps thing I think we've touched on this
several times but like way back in the day used to be you got the one job you would get promoted
slowly over time and eventually you retired from that same job you started at 40 years ago
and now you just don't do that that's stupid yeah you can't do that most places like just don't even
have the higher level jobs to offer or yeah or they don't care about giving you like I mean they're
not like helping you accelerate your career or or or incentivize you to stick around you know like
this was an off year for my company anyway but I was given a 1.5 percent raise which and I'm close
to a manager so I was able to say this when he delivered that number I was like oh that's almost
inflation and so like I mean if they were to give me 1.5 percent every year for the next 10 years
I'd be fucked right uh now I have a friend who's been in the industry for over 20 years
and this is the first job he's been at long enough to get a raise what industry programming yeah
programming and so like he's he's jumped so frequently over the last 20 years that he's like
yeah I just got my first raise yeah I think programming is definitely much more supercharged
than jobs in general but even so you should but not that much more yeah I think yeah you should
be looking to transfer to a different department if your company is large enough or just get you
know moved to a different job that's high of better placed every three years or so at the
very least I think for other industries you want a title change yeah like you don't want to be the
same you don't want to be library assistant you want to be media specialist right if you have a
business card or not but whatever your job title is listed as you want that to change every few
years because then then the company can justify their higher ups why they're giving you a 15
percent raise right and it looks much better on your resume when you go to you know when you are
shopping around for the other job you're like look I started out as an accountant I went to
accountant two uh two two years later three years after that they put me to account supervisor you
