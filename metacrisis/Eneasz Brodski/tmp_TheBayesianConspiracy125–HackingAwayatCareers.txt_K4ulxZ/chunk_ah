childhood home he built it and then like it's it was kind of hilarious by the time like my parents
you know all their kids moved out they finally sold it but it was just like excessively large and
my dad just like built like a tiki hut in the back and then he put it in ground pool and then he
put like a a waterfall like he just like couldn't stop adding stuff and it was kind of that it was
like all this stuff to manage uh yeah anyway that's let's see what else um we talked about yeah we
talked about optimal income back doors 80 000 hours uh and yeah i just want to like i didn't
actually say this directly but i want to like reiterate um google has its own like job search
feature where they'll just scrape from indeed a monster and all that so i always just google now
like clinical research jobs near me and it'll just brighten the you know search results like
populate you know some links to the the different postings that are on those sites so that's a handy
to trick if you're looking for a job and um if you don't know what you want to do and want to explore
more jobs uh try like googling things you're interested in or just look for like jobs near
me entry level and maybe like paid training um or for uh training included you know um think
you're like think around with the search results and like maybe just uh just throw an application
out a bunch of things and try it out for a bit you can quit and it's like much less stigmatized
now that was one of the things that i uh kind of was frustrated at my i like i went to clinical
research fast track which is the bootcamp i recommend them a lot like the education was
really high quality but um i remember that the director at the time uh one of her like advice
to students thing what was uh like even if okay you're gonna land your first job maybe it won't
be a great job maybe the people kind of suck like you know maybe they like maybe it doesn't pay great
but like stick with it for a few years just like grate your teeth and stick with so you can like
you know put it on a resume and then you won't be one of those like people that are just like
wishy washy jumping job jumping and i was just like oh no as soon as i heard that okay boomer but
yeah that i was like oh she's like my parents age so that's like i think just like most industries
know that that's not how the world works anymore and they've like you know they're taking advantage
of it you might as well yeah get a job if you hate it leave go get another one yeah i think that's
that's a mindset mentality that's switched with our generation that like the idea of gritting your
teeth for a few years is a complete fuck you it's like no why would i hate my life for seven years
when i could go do something else exactly and like unless you know that's what you're doing on purpose
like oh yeah this is going to take me 10 years to get to where i'm you know planning to end up then
you know that's different then you're gritting your teeth for a known end not just because
you feel like you need to for five or six years like that's that's terrible um i uh i can't imagine
um well actually now i can't imagine what point i was trying to make there other than i think that's
a generational shift that i'm in favor of like don't be deliberately unhappy of if you can avoid it
well then you're not being deliberately unhappy right yeah so unless a fan of the like the companies
aren't going to try to support your career anymore because people know that like like the the businesses
know that that's not like how the market works anymore so they can just you know shuffle you
know they can hire they can over hire and then lay off if they need to uh they can not promote people
well that's why you gotta move around a lot yeah but that's why you gotta you know it's it's not like
they're not going to take it personally and if they do don't work for them uh i do find it weird
how sometimes people like get attached to their jobs i don't know if i'm like an unfeeling monster
or something but at my last job i'd been there for six years and then i got laid off and uh like i
knew was coming my my company had been laying off people every uh december for i think four years
that like period i went through that so many times with the games industry because that's
just part of part and parcel but that like period where you know the layoffs are coming but you're
still like you know clocking in every day it was always when's it gonna be me when's it gonna be me
yeah but uh when i got laid off i was like okay cool i can you know go right full time now for a
while while i'm on unemployment and uh my boss when she called me in to tell me like was crying
out of like just frustration and anger and she was she was upset that i was getting laid off and i
was like oh my god it's it's a job like i i don't care about you that much i certainly didn't
yeah have emotional i didn't have emotional attachment to this job every single one of you
i'm gonna miss this potted plant it must be different in the situation where you're saying i'm
sorry i'm taking away your livelihood you know that for for her being upset that's just her not
being an unfeeling monster she was just telling me that upper management was you know but she's
delivering the news i guess yeah it sucks to be the one delivering people to get laid off and they
like cry and they get upset and i'm like what what did you expect it's a company it's a profit
maximizing endeavor when you are no longer maximizing profit they will fix that those people probably
are thinking that it's the previous um paradigm where like the companies did companies did used
to look out for their people but like i don't know if i like that it's a big thing in japan uh yeah
different cultures too but i'm kind of like going back and forth between like yeah the the um
the way it is now is like more efficient i guess it like improves capitalism it like makes individual
people's lives a bit crappier though and then like but it's like is it is it really good to keep
somebody around because of loyalty i mean i guess like it's not a reliability and like knowing this
person and their capabilities i guess could be good but like but then it could also you know
incentivize people that just keep they just stay in the company everybody knows this person you
know who's like in some upper management position and they suck at their job and the only reason
they're still there is because they've been there for so long that you can't fire them oh and you
know it also means that companies lose a lot of human capital because their employees are changing
every two to three years yeah and then that means they got to retrain people and they lose that
institutional knowledge that that person had on the other hand that can be a good thing too you
drew out drawing new blood you shake things up but it also comes with costs like when i leave my
position i i know that my uh my company's gonna be kind of fucked because they they have a hard
time hiring people especially right now in denver accountants are just hard to find really yeah
weird you feel like a lot of people my age we're going into accounting because they had all read
the same books that said that that was going to be a big growth error okay i think they were wrong
because nobody really accounted for like internet uh what accounted for was that a pun or i guess
no one did the accounting yeah okay i'm i'm trying to remember i mean i still get twice a month
emails from recruiters being like hey you want to go to this other accounting job i'm like no
no not for a long time now they just wait they just find you yeah well because you know they're
like oh here is someone who is working at an accounting position let's see if we can poach him
to these kinds of hours yeah that's i guess um career hack is you can like find recruiters and
be like hey do you want to recruit me for things uh they they i found that some recruiters do like
kind of want to work as your advocate um so in some words it's desperate to land you in a position
but that means that you got a job their job is to like get jobs for other people so yeah or like
you know if you're in school there's career counselors that can help you too um but the
career counselors don't get a paycheck every time they find someone a career whereas the recruiters
do yeah uh resources um i'm right on that steam uh i think we should maybe we could revisit it
sometime but i think i oh yeah one final thing um so uh i have a friend who wanted to work at miri
and she was just you know she did the thing of uh contacting like you know went to the bay um
just socialized a lot found people that knew people that knew people and uh was eventually
able to like find somebody who worked there in order to ask like hey what do i what do i need
in order to work at miri and uh this is someone who i think she did not go to college or like
do well at school um due to like depression issues or like life things but they're like okay you need
like this level math you should be able to do x y and z she was like cool all right and then just
did it just or it's still in the process of like okay uh now i'm gonna go back through you know
college math back to this like higher level math now okay and then like you know i'm at this level
in programming now so like you can check that one out just you know like got a spreadsheet and just
like systematically is like okay learn that thing learn that thing learn that thing so like you could
also shoot for the moon for like whatever your dream job is or whatever really prestigious thing
you want to do help with and and just do the research figure out what it takes like steven
was saying earlier about like yeah what does it take to be a private investigator i mean like
that seems like a cool movie job it's a cool like even if like the actual reality of it turned
out that it wasn't that great that like being able to tell people that you're a private investigator
is pretty sweet man but your point's taken um or it looks cool on a resume or whatever you know
i don't put it on my resume but but i hear what you're saying like in general yeah i think the
only piece about your your friend's story that i think is cautionary is i wouldn't move out to the
part of the country that your job is in unless you have something lined up for it like i feel like
she may have just been able to spam everyone who worked there with an email saying how do i get a
job there from the safety and comfort of where she's already lived without having to live in the
bay area i don't know it's not the same as meeting yeah face-to-face interactions but just if you're
asking just what it takes to get the job yeah well um but she had to like figure out how to get in
touch with one of the people that worked there in order to ask the question that's why everyone who
wants to act has to move out to the hollywood you really got to be where the where the action
is happening where the people are yeah um what what what's next what's what's on our uh do we have
anything else any feedback or do you want a thing just in time for the holidays oh yes uh
silly us gifts to get somebody yes so i mentioned before that jace made our beautiful uh basing
conspiracy logo we now have one of those internet store things where you can buy stuff that has our
logo on it uh things like um what is it coffee mug mouse pads for people who still use mouse pads i
don't know i use a mouse pad do you yeah i've got an optical mouse it kind of needs a pad to see what
it's doing i also have a glass desk i was gonna say i've got a glass desk all right yeah i found
optical mice work perfectly on everything except i guess reflective surfaces uh phone cases yes
that's right phone cases technically t-shirts i personally do not advocate anyone buy clothes
that they can't try on first because cuts are you know important and you got to see what they look
like but if you would like to buy a t-shirt anyway or a hoodie or something with our logo on it you
can do that and stickers and stickers yes lots of stickers um the it's maybe the first time i put a
sticker on my car yeah maybe i don't know there's there's a whole load of options for things that
you can buy that have our logo on them and uh we get a cut of you know anything that you purchase
because otherwise why would we do this i know we got cut i thought i when you you showed us this
like a month ago and i was like oh that's cool i thought it was just a service that somebody did
for us i didn't know we got no no with a small part of that goes into our bank account and then we
get that you know at the end of the year oh well that's interesting i'm buying a phone case and i
didn't know that i was somehow putting a quarter of a dollar back in my own pocket but whatever um
yeah the um i have no idea what the ratio is on that but we'll have a link to that on the
episode description and i'm assuming on the website prominently displayed somewhere at this point
oh uh yes i will do that all right perfect we'll well yeah we'll find somewhere to put it
on the website as well link to the store yeah hey now i feel like i need to make more graphics
or maybe this will finally motivate me to make more graphics if you want to that'd be cool
i love the one we have but and at this point it's iconic that's true yeah okay cool all right we
should uh who's our patron for this episode our patron do we remember whose turn it is i'm gonna
give it to you because i we're not keeping track we'll start doing that okay our patron this week
is beth smith thank you yes thank you beth smith because of you uh we are having slightly better
careers in the podcasting world is that it you know it's not it's not about that it's about uh the
the support again it's about us getting to do this thing we like yeah and it's nice to know that
people you know uh another people enjoy it enough to to be willing to pay for it yeah i have a hard
time just saying that every time but it does it always makes me happy to i don't know see that
now you know the other thing that this has always done for me too is i now donate more to patreon
stuff of things that i enjoy um the second i open that we opened up our own and like oh yeah why aren't
i giving financial support to uh derrick bannis that you know makes a coding tutorials on youtube
why don't i give bingy with babish money every month like i love watching his shows and they come
out so um my life is measurably improved by these things and i'm willing to you know give a little
bit of money for for that because that's time that people aren't pursuing their careers and hacking
them exactly i basically give like to um give well or like individual creators like i i don't
know it's just i like to either be i like to either be giving to the most effective charity or like
specifically to a person who made a thing that i like yeah that's kind of cool because like you
know if you're a writer you get and and you're going the traditional publishing route uh that's
not accessible to everybody um and also like by the time you get your royalties like everybody
along in the process has taken a chunk out of it whereas if you are a writer supported by patreon
you get all that money except for the amount patreon takes yes uh but that's not as much as
how much the publishing industry take yeah but hey that's another career hack uh do something cool
make a patreon although i don't know because a lot of a lot of patrons i think don't really pay
enough to be like your full-time thing but at least you can support somebody's like side thing that
might eventually turn into an outside thing yeah i think almost none of them pays enough yeah the
super majority probably doesn't pay enough to pay your pay your bills on but it pays enough to
keep you in some device to keep going yeah and you know if it off all it does is pay your cable
bill that's you know more than nothing and i will say there have been some weeks where i've been like
oh god i just i don't want to do it let's call it off but you know having that financial incentive
really helps as well oh good well if you're if you know your friendship and camaraderie to us
isn't enough i'm glad i'll screw you guys all right well that's it for this one we have a
couple of fun episodes lined up but i'm not sure which one's coming up next so just stay tuned
knowing that i'm excited about at least if it's not the next two it'll be the next three or four
if we've been contacted by some people that i'm excited to do episodes with so yeah hold on to
your seats they should be fun excellent all right thanks everyone and have a great uh no
thanksgiving's ready over happy holidays there we go there it is bye
you
