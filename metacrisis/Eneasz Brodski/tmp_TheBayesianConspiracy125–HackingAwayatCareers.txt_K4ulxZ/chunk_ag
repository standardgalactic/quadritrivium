know that kind of thing yeah we're senior account or whatever just like always get even if it doesn't
come with like a pay raise especially because jobs change over time they're like the stuff you
originally hired on to you often do less and less and they give you more of other work so
eventually once you're like look I do a lot of stuff now I didn't do before can I get a different
title for it even if it doesn't come with a pay raise you get a different title on your uh CV
or um what's the other word for CV resume yeah and that looks better to the next people you're
showing it to you like well I get the title beats the hell out of accountant 2004 to present
yeah um I mean if you're ready to wrap up we can no well yeah I had more uh subjects to hit
like maybe we can go more quickly over some of the things the I mean we definitely should
yeah we talked about boot camps we talked about um accelerated learning and so there's also the
option to take like the especially now you know that everyone's working from home going to school
from home online courses um are blowing up there's online courses for like just about everything
and some of them offer certifications and I think MIT and or maybe I could have it's MIT
or Stanford um and maybe some other bigger universities but they offer their courses
for free not with the you don't get the degree if you didn't pay for the course but if you just
want to learn the material um so like depending on how much rapport you have with whoever's maybe
going to hire you you could also just like you know tell them well I took the you know I took
this course I don't have the like ability to prove it but I can like talk to you improve
that I know the material maybe you can at least put it on a resume um and you can yeah like skill up
by doing things that like yeah you could stick on a resume you could go volunteer um say that you
wanted to like work at a non-profit I mean um or like an NGO uh you can definitely go like take a
volunteer um stint and you can put that on a resume as experience uh there's I want to talk about
80,000 hours oh okay um which is it's rationalistic Jason it might I don't know if it um I think the
professed goal is to like not just get you into a job but get you into a hiring industry that you're
equipped to do yeah and uh with the understanding that you'll probably give a lot of that money to
charity yeah so yeah like 80,000 hours is roughly the amount of working hours you get in a currently
healthy adult human uh working span um I it's interesting I maybe and I'm curious about your
take on this I'm only jumping in just because I had a question about this like my immediate thought
shortly after learning about 80,000 hours was that like if you get into a high paying industry
just to give away a bunch of money whether or not that's actually you can put that on one side
like if you're if you're optimizing for income there's a good chance you'll find a job that you
don't love yeah or that you don't even really like that much and that my understanding was that the
burnout rate was kind of high have that I'm sure they've actually calibrated that in though this
was 10 years ago when I first heard about this yeah I think the yeah the goal is you know just to
make big books and then do what you want I guess but you could donate a bunch of it to charity
and you don't have to like live that life forever you know like if you don't like being a stock trader
you could work as a stock trader for a bit if you have the ability to do it and maybe it kind of
sucks but then like then you got a bunch of money that you can not only give to charity but also
like invest or use to like float you to your next thing while you take a coding boot camp yeah
exactly 80,000 hour hours also very much about like um not just making money although that was
like one option for people but specifically about making an impact with your career yeah so I'm
changing the future I was talking about like values oriented um and it's kind of yeah like
people are gonna have different goals for what they want to do in their career like do you just
want to make money do you want to travel do you want to just learn stuff are you like motivated
by helping others 80,000 hours um yeah has the goal of optimizing the job search for like highly
skilled or like highly motivated candidates so there's like job advice and job training opportunities
there um if you're a young person in the rationalist community uh probably or not even a young person
they started out um if they said explicitly like we're mostly gearing our advice and stuff towards
like college grads because we have to you know pick a place to focus on now and that's like the
people that have the most years to give to the cause but they've started from what I've heard
expanding a lot more of their advice to be applicable to so if you're already you know
are in a career and you want to change or whatever uh I think that they have stuff for you and I
also intended to check that out and I haven't done it yet so it's a reminder to myself I think
that's good I like I said I imagined that they had optimized a bit over the last decade because I
remember when I first looked into it it was it might have been in the earlier days of it well
it definitely was because it was 10 years ago but it might have been in the early days of it
not just the earlier days and the fact that they're iterating and improving the process is reassuring
um you know I'm trying to think of like any general advice that I could think of and it's
kind of just like my same advice for everything which is like don't be afraid to take a leap for
something but the downside of that is that like calculated risks right calculated risks and uh
you know not just like take a leap and like I'm gonna quit and you know start painting and sell
that like that's that's a great ambition but I would start something like that that isn't like
a and a waged job I would start that as a side project yeah like I wouldn't bank your mortgage
on uh like you're suddenly taking off as an artist it's like writing or podcasting right uh you
know there's there's no uh you know when there's not a guaranteed minimum that you're making then
that tends to be a lot scarier but the other thing about even like the uh the the general leap of faith
that I'm talking about that's safe or more calibrated like even that comes with some like I
don't throw this word around a lot but some level of privilege like I'm lucky enough that
I have parents that continue to care about me and that if I was ever like I'll never be homeless
right like if I needed it I could move back into their house at any time and so you know if my
adventure into programming had taken a complete shit and I'd never got anywhere well they would I
wouldn't you know end up homeless right so like I I have that safety net um if you don't have that
obviously you have to be more careful about the the risks you take but I'm you know can I speak
briefly about the first uh career hacking from less wrong that I'm familiar with yeah uh this was
I guess back in the day 2009 2010 maybe um someone posted on less wrong about this uh opportunity
in Australia yeah I was gonna bring that up optimized income there does out the name of the
post optimal income okay yeah we can find it it was a thing in Australia where you could go uh
as with a temporary visa and get a job basically a low skill job um out in the far lesser populated
places and you would get paid a decent amount due to the fact that they had nationwide minimum wage
laws and uh yeah they recommended like working at a hotel and they're like you will get like three
meals a day and a free room so you can go there you can just save all the money you make cost of
living was very low out in these remote remote areas you still got paid a good amount because
the minimum wage is calibrated for cities rather than these areas and the government uh it will take
a fair chunk of money and taxes for the government retirement program or whatever but when you left
the uh country after a year or however many months you got uh they would give all that back to you
and basically it was just a large chunk of cash for going out having a really cool unique experience
in a foreign country for a year and uh that money could then be used to fund all sorts of things
like for example going into a coding bootcamp for a long period of time or putting down a
down payment on a house or whatever uh i know thomas uh who we've had on this podcast before
thomas elliott uh did that thing in australia yeah and he said it was fucking awesome it was
how he got started uh with a lot of things including uh funding his own board game making uh business
six pence games yes yeah so i'd recommend looking at that and i also helped uh kick start his
book the translation of the enchiridion um it's a human translatable human trend the modern human
translated version of uh was it um it's one of the greats at the curis yeah yeah yep yeah i like
wait hold on i got to hear the rest of the this cliffhangers there's still an option you said
i'm sure it's not right now because of covet uh i don't know if it will be again afterwards
uh so that would be great to look into but uh one of the things that this brings up is
is finding areas uh where people really need people to come work because there aren't a lot
of people there are things like this in the us they will pay you extra to go out to remote areas
being a teacher in uh remote areas can often pay very well because no one wants to go teach there
yeah especially um english is the second language yep that's what i was going to mention is that i
know that there are programs that'll pay you to come out and live in vietnam or japan or whatever
to come teach english mm-hmm uh really any place where there's government resources being uh put
into propping up in industry is also a good place to go to look for jobs uh i it's kind of scummy
because you know the i don't like the government funneling money away from one place to another
place that they do you have examples of this well the the one that comes to mind immediately because
i do it is the government in the us props up home buying a lot which is why it's such a good idea to
buy uh places here and renovate them yeah because the amount of support government gives to the
homeowners here in the us is crazy i have been like i even though i'm doing the coding boot camp
now i'm kind of i was laughing a little earlier because you said it but like i'm kind of just
doing it so i have a thing to do right now like it's like i'm in school so not just i'm being
unimpulled but like one of the things i was thinking about was like uh kind of be cool to flip
houses yeah that's like one of those sort of like taking a risk thing where either like either it
works out or it doesn't and then you just like kind of are screwed and like take advantage of these
kind of programs i know someone who uh got into a boot uh coding boot camp and said specifically
you know they are in lots of high-tech companies they're looking for female programmers because
they want to get that ratio yeah well i could be the trans program exactly i think you feel
some sort of demographic yeah but the the they're trying to uh get that ratio closer to 50 50 and
so female programmers are just in greater demand in a lot of these companies and she was like i
think i can get a decent job uh pretty easily because of that so she went right for it i worked
with a couple recruiters uh at my last job and well they trained they i like to make the drug
that they made the ultimate recruiting decision and recruited themselves into programming um
so they wound up on my team over the my years there and uh they both said something similar where
like and it's just a you know sexism whatever all the the implications or whatever aside the
fact is that when they would sort resumes female resumes were on top right if you happen to belong
to some minority like non-english speaking yeah version of color disabled or queer and i think
it was easiest for them to do female because that was obvious in the name and so like they
didn't necessarily get like the you know when you apply for a job and it says check your race check
your whatever a lot of those don't get translated or don't get transferred to the recruiter themselves
but your actual resume does with your name and if your name is yeah but there's that that's um totally
a thing though where there's various like government programs you can look for um i remember when i was
actually looking into possibly getting a library masters i was like i wonder if there's like
financial programs that i could apply for like and there was the like single women grant or something
since i wasn't married and it was just like transition uh it was like those are like single
mothers but it was just single women in general uh i am trying to remember what it was but uh
but you don't have kids i think it was um like single women that were making under a certain
amount of money or something like that nice uh i did not end up applying for it but i recommend
i don't know if you if you can think of yeah some way to fund a thing or like some uh exemption like
that exemption is not really the word i want but and it really does depend on the industry there's
some that are trying to uh close perceived gaps and or actual gaps and uh you know there's others
that just don't give a fuck yeah this isn't i wasn't making any like actual advice on mine i was just
relating one anecdote that backed up what you said like if you're trying to get a construction job
that'll probably be and you're less likely to get one if you're uh of the female persuasion
yeah i mean uh that's probably true i guess um the female persuasion i don't know how these
gender words work anymore yeah if your name makes it sound like you were born with a vagina then
they won't pick you to fix roofs or something right yeah um oh my uh i had a friend who got
hired at GameStop and it was because they thought he was a girl oh really because um i think he
well he was it was trans but he had to apply under his legal name because he hadn't changed it legally
and like because he had a like stereotypically female name even though he had come in and like
intro like he had you know had a deep voice facial hair like like looked like a cis guy because he
transitioned early like fuck it um but like it handed his resume to the guy the guy i just forgot
or something and was just like oh like uh female name yeah like put a chick at the counter give
more like the gamer guys in here and then like they were like disappointed when he actually came in
and they're like it's like oh we thought like i don't know we thought i wanted to hire a girl
but like they already hired it so it was like just this really awkward he didn't like stay at that
job for very long because it's very awkward well plus like for someone to say i meant to hire someone
else is definitely a weird thing to hear on your starting day also i have a friend who worked at
GameStop she was or she is a girl um and she hated it apparently and she's everyone hates it she's
big into video games and i also thought that like oh it'd be fun to work at a video game store because
i like video games and i met her actually at the coding bootcamp who went to and she was like oh no
it's a fucking nightmare like it sucks all the fun out of it i'm like oh well that's good to know
because i wouldn't expect that well it's not like you get to play the video games for your job it's
just another shitty retail job but it's your job to you know maybe spend categorize them and then
like talk them up to people yeah you know be like hi i played that one it was whatever and yeah you
get to read the the reviews of whatever demon souls remake and talk to the oh do you get an
employee discount probably yeah but also i lost all my my enjoyment of GameStop when they stayed
open way late into the pandemic so that they could sell doom and animal crossing in stores yeah
yeah it's i don't know i i've i've often heard do what you love for a living but i've also heard
never ever try to make what you love into a job because then you won't love it anymore yeah i mean
do it for the love when i and if you get paid for it cool right that's how i that's how i treat
you know the podcast and the writing exactly you don't get paid very much but you get paid
something and i do it not for the money but because i love doing it right it um is worth noting i think
that like you might find out that you don't actually love the thing you loved like uh working in the
games industry i like you know started out like designing levels and coming up with game design
documents and then like eventually by the end i was social media manager and doing analytics um like
search engine optimization and like it was just all marketing bs and i was not into it anymore
they just needed somebody to do those things and you know that's the downside to being the person
of like give me more tasks i want to learn anything like oh you want to learn how to do like
social media management and i was like nah really like well we really need someone to do okay
and they're like oh well jace is really good at that so like you know that oh you can make
it and i was like no you say yes to things yeah don't don't say yes to things that you know you'll
hate or like that you suspect you'll hate but like also um yeah kind of your sort of your goals
might change every time you might start out just looking to do get a job that'll make money and
realize like oh actually you know i'm more motivated for helping people or learning stuff i also
totally want to walk back what i just said i would not do this podcast if i was not getting paid for
it so yeah i mean i'm saying that with a smirk nope it's totally true working in the games industry
like i was i was not playing video games when i came home like and i loved video games and it was
like actually kind of this wake-up call of like oh sometimes doing what you love can wreck your love
of the thing my brother worked for a few months ish at a donut place and it was like you make you
make all the donuts at night and then they sell them all first thing in the morning and now he
doesn't like donuts yep yeah and it's like yeah it ruins donuts for him and donuts are a treasure
so that's i think maybe it's been enough time where you can enjoy them again but for years he was
like oh no fuck that i'm i'm good um yeah i think seeing how the sausage is made uh can take some of
the the energy out of something that you might otherwise enjoy especially to i mean i'm trying
to think like you know you mentioned um carpentry and stuff and i was like oh you know make a beautiful
table that's different than pumping out a dozen tables a day for a job right and so like if you
did that then like you don't want to go home and work on your your uh your product your table project
that you've been working on for the last few months like no i just spent my whole day you know covered
in sawdust and and like you know doing all this shit like now i hate doing it so but that people's
mileage varies there probably yeah my dad comes home and just continues building stuff like my
