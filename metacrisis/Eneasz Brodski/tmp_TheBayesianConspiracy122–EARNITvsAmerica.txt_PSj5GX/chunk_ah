And all this should actually happen.
It was by the same people who made the show Veep.
Okay.
Starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus, that's all fictional,
but it's apparently just about how the government actually operates
from, you know, like they ask people on the inside,
is this, you know, which show is the closest?
It's not West Wing, it's Veep.
Now that I know that the Death of Stalin people made Veep,
I have to watch Veep because, God, that movie was good.
And it's funny, but it's also like depressing.
It's less depressing because it's a fictional setting,
but well, it's whatever, historical fiction, right?
Modern historical fiction, whatever you call that.
For which Veep?
Yeah.
Okay, okay.
I mean, it's supposed to be the modern government,
right, in the US, but whatever.
Yeah.
Anyway, Veep is funny.
You can watch that while you're-
See, we found a broadside.
Recoiling from all this news.
All right.
I don't have anything else to add on this one.
No.
Yes, we should probably leave off there
before we get into more depressing things.
Chase, do you have anything?
Definitely not.
This is more in-depth than even I.
Well, I want to thank you for coming on
and helping us and talking about this with us.
Yeah, man, you totally nailed it.
We would have been flandering like morons without you, so.
And also for bringing this attention to the first place.
Sure, thank you for having me.
Yeah.
All right.
Before we go, we would like to thank our patron, yes?
Yes.
Cool.
Our patron this week is Nick.
Nick, thanks so much.
We really appreciate it.
You are a total badass, and I can't think of a joke
that ties into today's episode.
Sorry.
I want to say that thanks to Nick, as well as all our patrons,
but this week specifically, Nick, we are not beholden
to content companies like YouTube to monetize us
or not monetize us.
You guys directly are funding us,
so we can tell you about these things.
And I mean, I guess YouTube wouldn't stop us right now either,
but maybe someday.
Right.
If we mentioned the word child porn or something,
this episode couldn't go out.
You just mentioned it.
Oh, no.
Oh, damn it.
We were critical of YouTube taking down that video
of Dobby being born.
Oh, like the house elf.
Right.
They named the guy after the house elf,
the giraffe after the house elf.
That's so cute.
We got to feed Dobby when he was still
like shorter than the average giraffe.
They do like, I think they let four people on at a time.
It's a polite little thing where it's not,
you know, freaks him out, but it's really cute.
Was there a fence between you and him?
Yeah, you're up on like on the actual feeding stand.
That's at head height for the adult giraffes
and Dobby's down here.
So you got to lean down and feed him.
How long ago was this?
At least two or three years ago, maybe four or five.
So, okay, he's adolescent now, if not adult.
He's probably adult sized.
Yeah.
But you can feed the adults too.
So.
Cool.
But they won't be as cute.
Yeah, they're plenty cute.
They do have like really long black tongues, the bizarre.
Yeah, that's how they get the stuff.
They reach it out and like wrap it around the whatever
you're feeding them.
It was like lettuce leaves or something.
Giraffes are all bizarre.
They're bizarre top to bottom.
But unicorns are the fictional creature.
Well, yeah.
Truth is stranger than fiction.
Alrighty, thank you everyone for listening to us.
Thank you, Nick, specifically for helping us out this week.
And thanks, Chase, for joining us.
Yeah, thanks, Chase.
You're on.
Cool.
Bye, everybody.
