So now the blog is gone.
So that's kind of a fucked up bully move of you guys to poll.
So yeah, three cheers for Scott Alexander.
I hope you continue to, you know, create stuff for the world.
But if you want to lay low for a while, we totally get it.
And, you know, the, I am prepared to guess, I was going to say speak for, but I'm prepared to guess that the entire rationalist community is 100% behind you.
And, you know, I imagine right now is just kind of like a PR storm over at the New York Times trying to figure out how do we defuse this without saying we did anything wrong.
So when they finally come forward with their conciliatory but non guilt expressing statement, then we all come out winners.
Hell yeah.
We'll see how it shakes out.
I'm very curious to see how it shakes up.
All right.
Well, I think that's the end of the episode unless anyone has anything else.
No, just reminders that we're doing my wild and reckless youth and failings learned from history and do check the show notes for some stuff this episode.
We're going to link at least to the Dave Chappelle special and the Yudkowsky media mess a on police reform and probably whatever else we can think of.
Check the show notes.
Oh, and I need to mention once in a while during the episodes, the link to our discord is in the show notes for every episode.
Once in a while, you know, rarely, but totally worth enough to mention it on the air.
I'm asked like, how do I find the discord?
It is in the show notes for the episode.
So if you want to have these conversations with people and not just listen to people talk about it every couple of weeks, you can find us live and find dozens of active people and hundreds of lurkers on our discord.
So hang out with us there.
It's also linked right at the top of our webpage, the basin conspiracy dot com.
There we go.
All right.
Thanks for joining us, everybody.
And we'll see you in a couple of weeks.
Everybody.
Bye.
See you.
Yeah.
