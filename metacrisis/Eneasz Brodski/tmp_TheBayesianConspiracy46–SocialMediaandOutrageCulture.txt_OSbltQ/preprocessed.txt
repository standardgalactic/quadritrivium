Welcome to the Basin Conspiracy. I'm Minyash Brotsky. And I'm Stephen Zuber. And today
it's just the two of us. Today is just the two of us because we couldn't get a guest
and are recording shortly after our last recording. So we've been falling behind schedule lately
where some of you may have noticed some of our episodes are you know a few hours maybe
a day late. And we were just like, yeah, we really got to get on it. So this one is almost
back to back with the previous one in recording. So this should fix that problem will never
be late again. That's our promise to you. Wait, no, I do not make promises that I don't know
for sure I can keep like that. We'll try really hard not to be late again. Okay, all right.
Yeah. So what we are talking about today is a bit of a hobby horse of mine is hobby horse
right term. I've heard it in the terms of like political hobby horse like this is like the
one like maybe it's like single issue voters or something. This is like the one thing you
care about. Okay. So what is your interested thing that you wanted to talk about my interested
thing is who it is an aspect of Malik and we have referred to Malik before on this podcast and
we should probably explain very briefly what Malik is comes from a post by Scott Alexander
Meditations on Malik where he explains the concept. But in to boil it down and simplified
bit. Malik is incentive systems that push people towards bad optima. It is the sort of racing
towards the bottom the always cutting more and more to get more efficient. I guess the the
transhumanist version of Malik is you see it sometimes in science fiction is we are in a
situation where all our resources are strained simply for survival really inhospitable planet
or war with an alien race or maybe just war amongst each other on earth. And we have to give
up things we love in order to not die. And so you first you strip out things like art because we
don't have any money to spend on art. But since we're transhumanists eventually we start doing
things like stripping out our need for leisure because we must spend all our time working and
being efficient. And then we strip out things like our need to connect with other people and have
meaningful emotional relationships because those take away from being productive until
eventually you don't really have humans anymore you just have these constant producers and consumers
that are working in an economy in order to like have more stuff or be better at warfare or not
get killed by their environment but it doesn't really matter anymore because there's nothing human
left there's just production optimizers. So two quick things one you made it sound like to somebody
who wasn't familiar Scott Alexander didn't invent the idea of Malik this goes way back in the way
that we use it. Yes. But yeah the Malik figure of like I run on sacrifices kind of has been there
forever. One of his earlier examples of this which I really liked was the two income trap where
before only men could work and that was horrible for women. Yes. But once women entered into the
workforce then now you could have families where both people in the family worked and instead of
households having twice the income and twice the leisure and twice the fun. Now just all the prices
went up primarily for housing near good schools. And so now if you want your children to not be in
a shitty neighborhood you both have to work all the time never see your children in order by really
expensive housing near the best schools where they won't get shot and will get taught things correctly
and really everyone's back in the same position they were before except now everyone works more
and the children don't get to see either parent. I think another good example of Malik gone wild
is Hanson's age of M right. That's kind of like what your allude if you followed your track further
down you're like instead of just being shut down humans you just have productive workers running
a million you know times the speed to get all the stuff done and you strip all the things that they
would want to do otherwise and reset them every day and all that weird shit so good or bad I think
is not really Hanson's point he's just speculating but yeah that's certainly I think a good example
of Malik gone nuts. So what specifically are we talking about with today's Malik? Today I am
talking about media in general and social media more specifically because the way we do internet
is kind of fucked in that it is driven entirely almost entirely by ad revenue. Television cable
news networks have had a similar thing happen which means that the most important thing is to get
eyeballs. You want to engage people's attention and there is actually a metric now which I believe
Tristan was it? Tristan Tristan Harris. Tristan Harris has been talking about and there I've
been a number of articles that came out recently about by people who used to work for Google people
who used to work for Facebook the guy who invented the like button for Facebook has jumped on this
as well and is really regretful about what he has done with his life in the past but the there is
now metrics called engagement which measure how long a user stays on a site and how much they
engage with the content and the the race for all these companies who are in competition with each
other for our attention is to get as much of your attention as they can and they are relentlessly
greedy if they could keep you up 24 hours a day and do nothing but looking at their feed all the time
they would because that is how they get revenue that is their incentive the better the more
engagement the better and and there are a lot of things that go into doing this there is the
when you scroll down the endless feed thing you don't like get to a bottom and click on next page
it just keeps scrolling forever the there was one person who was talking about how he invented the
like on your gmail you swipe down to refresh instead of having like a refresh button
that was because when he was making an app it reloads when you pull down the refresh
and it does like the little whirling thing at the top and that is like watching the slot machine
roll yes and like it's even the pull down action like you're pulling down the slot machine arm
and he said that like at the time it was a technical constraint because he didn't have
room on the screen for a reload button so he used that but nowadays you can things can reload
constantly like several times per second without a problem and yet they keep that feature in because
it gives you that little rush of dopamine the am i going to get something new or am i not
the on your notifications the little red dot that's you know there's new things they
used to be blue they turned it to red because it gets attention and the little red dot you
never know what it's going to be is it going to be just uh you know more ads or something or is
it actually going to be cool content is it going to be likes and people are responding to your stuff
it is this constant variable reward which has been shown to be one of the best ways to train
people to want to do something over and over when the reward is not uh not you can't predict it
completely the the sporadic intermittent reward yes yeah um so like uh bf skinner the 1900 psychologist
he had those pigeons that he trained to do really weird things by doing that it's like they got like
to be superstitious like they would do quick three left turns and like then a pellet would fall
or like so they basically and they would fall randomly but the pigeons develop their own
weird superstitions about how to get it to work and so they would think well you know
it happened to have the last time i turned left and i'll keep turning left and we'll keep coming back
and you know then it does and then we'll still keep doing it um so uh two quick things one so on
the train right home as i mentioned already oh before we started recording i wrote home with
one of the other uh senior developers and uh he pulled up his google news and one of the first
things that was on his feed was like yellowstone is showing volcanic activity two hours ago and
he's like he read the headline he's like well shit and he clicks it and he skims through and
he's reading it and the last line was geologists aren't very concerned um and i'm like was this
like buzz feed or whatever and then he found it uh i think on uh it wasn't the new york post it was
some actual reputable web reputable website also posted the same article um but the the headline
got him in and because you know hey the headlines basically you and everybody know is going to die
yeah so uh you know how long do you have click here to find out um at the bottom just the
normal amount of volcanic activity for yellowstone well and i don't know if this is the article
or not but i'm not a geologist but if i had correct me if i'm wrong but i'm pretty sure a
little light activity is probably good news because then you you know you release the stress
before it gets big and that's what we want we wanted to stay you know nice and mostly chill
so just an example of that kind of grab your attention thing um the only thing the only thing
that this didn't have in that recipe was it didn't show up on his lock screen on his phone
you know he had to open his news feed for it to be the first thing there yeah but
the other thing was that you mentioned if they could keep you at your you know staring at your
keyboard until you you know for 24 hours a day they would they isn't necessarily like evil
mustache twirling uh people who are capitalizing on this revenue right yeah in fact right now with
facebook it's just a black box ai that wants to keep you on facebook right um so like yeah
someone's still making money on the ad revenue yeah but this this didn't happen by somebody
saying all right let's be as manipulative as possible let's keep them in let's keep them
engaged let's uh right do whatever it takes it was just a malachian race to the bottom
that nobody had to make the decision to make this happen yeah they they need ad revenue to
stay alive they introduce something which helps get them a little more attention and then every
competitor in the marketplace has to either copy them and start doing these addictive things as
well or be competed out of existence and go bankrupt and it keeps going it's why they have the
fucking autoplay uh on things that as soon as you scroll it starts playing or if you end a video
the next one will start playing after five seconds yes because they want you to stay on there and
it's it's because you get what you measure what they measure is engagement how many clicks how
long are you on site and so that is what you measure that is what you optimize for you keep
finding ways to increase that and increase that even though you're not doing it with any evil
intent it is your measure and you're maximizing your measure right and now now that it's the
the name of the game it can be done the evil intent if someone you know wants to get their
stuff done this isn't this isn't an evil intent example and i might have mentioned this before
but did i ever mention like diablo three i think you have i think twice actually okay so forget it
some people some people have died playing this game because it's really addictive and they've
calculated it to be like almost perfectly addicting and that you get rewarded just often enough to
keep engaged you know your buff wears down and then it's like 30 seconds before you see the next
thing oh wait double experience for two minutes i gotta keep going so uh while i was never enough
into it to you know miss uh yeah to die i probably did hold my bladder or something playing right
because you're you're stucked in so um so all that all that is pretty bad i mean that's also how
you get the fucking click bait headlines like 21 things that something number four will shock you
or number six made me cry crap like that yeah i now have a policy of never clicking on anything
that has number x will make you why number x will make you why like or in general listicles are just
bad things that i avoid but listicles i like that word yeah it's not new to me i read it somewhere
but especially things that have at the end number x will make you why i'm like fuck you not clicking
through yeah that and if the headline is the form of a question i think the answer is always no
yes and there's there's a law of journalism which i don't remember what it is now but yeah yeah
something like that um there's a separate that i like called saved you a click okay and it'll give
you like the bullshit headline like what happens to this actress and like then they'll put a bar
and then they'll be like you know nothing or like whatever this actress looks so different it won't
believe it and it's like she looks like you would expect her to look 20 years later 67 clicks for
them to get and so they'll put in parentheses how many clicks took them to get to the answer
holy crap and often it's one or two but sometimes it's dozens where you so that's the other thing
that you'll see on some pages i don't go to the like most of these websites i saw links through
from facebook and i haven't been on facebook that much lately but partly because of some of the
perverse things i that will probably get into but yeah you'll go to the page and it'll have
whatever 10 bullshit things they're not on a one page you click the next button to get to the next
number two number three and then they get all new ads in your face and you know most almost nobody
clicks these things but people still want to pay to be seen there so it's still money making even
if there isn't that much money going back into the advertisers pocket so the this whole thing by
itself is already really annoying and it is bringing down all of the discourse because all of it
happens is now something that has to shock you and get your attention and keep you in right
but the really bad part about it and the thing
i consider this aside from existential issues like artificial intelligence or or genetic altering
i consider this the most important issue of the day today the most important thing that
happens in modern life short of actual existential issues like nuclear war or ai development the fact
that there is a strong incentive to turn people against each other to generate outrage because
if you see something that pisses you off you tend to engage immediately and so there is this
incentive now for uh for the spreading of memes and and other ideas which is fracturing society
because people will jump onto one side or another and they're very divisive and just there to get
you riled up i think the most i shouldn't i don't think i should comment on the most recent thing i
thought it just a outrage generating shin machine oh yeah well and that's the thing too is part of
you know the the machine gets kick started with that article but then we'll do the rest by uh
having these weird competitions to see you can be the most loudly outraged yeah you can't be like
well well well let's draw the line of violence like are you shitting me here with them we talked
about that with the whole nazi thing we did right so it happened also with the the google memo thing
yeah where uh was it google the where that guy put out that yeah yeah yeah where i mean he he said
some questionable things he said he also had some sort of argument to make it wasn't the greatest
argument but it quickly turned into you know either you are a crazy feminist nazi or you
are the racist uncle right there is no in between you have to be one or the other and both sides
hate each other after it's all over yeah it's one of those fun things where like you can piss off
both sides by disagreeing with both of them yeah so it's like no no you know don't get wrong i
don't like the nazis either but i don't want to set everyone i've never met on fire and so like
you can really piss off everybody yeah and it doesn't matter both sides now think you're on
the other sides yeah it's and sometimes you are sometimes you aren't but the whole drive is to
make things as outrage generating and as hating of the people that are on your friends list as
possible because that drives engagement that will get you coming back to facebook for the next three
hours madly pounding away on the comment section of someone's thread and the engagement number goes up
but all it does is result in this deterioration of society i think it's a large part of the
reason that trump got elected the the continual outrage of both sides against each other and
one side said you know what fuck you all we're tired of your hippie liberal bullshit we're going
to elect this guy because he is not part of the system yeah i mean definitely
it's like trump was giant a giant middle finger to everyone who was on the left right it's true
that example just still hits too close to home um this will all be funny in five years if we make
it that far right um so uh yeah i think you're right there there wasn't anybody five years ago
saying man i wish that donald trump character would run so that we could get a reasonable person
in our side right yeah this just turned into like we the the i mean we're pissing off trump
supporters but don't get me wrong i i said what if your trump supporter who wanted donald trump
to run in the 2004 election you write in and let us know what your reasoning is what your reasoning
was i will say that they it's not that they don't have an argument when you get attacked when your
side gets attacked a lot by these people that you think are obviously just the most pampered people
who are writing and calling for their colleges to to fire professors when they're in the most liberal
and safe and accepting place in the world and you're like what the fuck is wrong with you and
you do want to you know flip them off and be like yeah take this this is the guy that stands for
everything you hate eat a dick i i totally like felt i i i felt i don't want to say agreement with
them but like when i first heard about trump and didn't know about him at all for like a week i was
like i could maybe vote for this guy because i am kind of sick of some of this bullshit and and then
i realized who he actually was what he was doing i was like oh oh god no it would have been a great
throwaway vote to give a fuck you yeah right so like if he didn't make the candidacy and it would
be you know like there's the joke i think the numbers were inflated but probably one idiot wrote in
harambe as the president right so it would have been great for like you know uh to make a social
statement to your facebook friends or whatever and say i voted for trump because fuck you guys
it turned out not to be so great you know like when they said you know eat a dick everyone now we
all have to eat that dick and it's and it's horrible so this is not like one of those primo
Dwayne the rock johnson dicks this is like fucking gross ass what's his name uh donald trump
zing um super zing so all right this is getting a little far field but yeah i have a good
shit now now someone's gonna feel bad about me describing ugly dicks all dicks are beautiful
hashtag all dicks new text message noise for enyosh i'm gonna cut that sound bite um so where
were we um oh yes uh the response to outrage and so i think i felt some of the i never felt
inclined maybe to vote for trump but i did see where they were coming from in that like you
guys are being dicks and you know i'm on the left your your left of center i think uh i think i
know i just don't want to out you as a liberal sorry i admit the shame of being a liberal yes
but even i can be like a gas that some of my my compatriots behavior right and so
you know it's it's my social circle that i see sharing the memes of like set these strangers
on fire right yeah if you're the person that they say that they want to set on fire yeah you're
gonna feel inclined to respond to that pretty viscerally and so i can totally see where this
happened and then you throw in some awesome propaganda machines and uh some other manipulations
that probably happened and things got really bad really fast and it really disgusts me because
these i mean the corporations live in this system too they are seeing it go down they
they are like the uh i don't know the animals that start eating themselves because there's
it's just the incentive our line it's it's literally malachian the incentives are aligned
to destroy the world around you and you are watching it burn and you know you're dying too
but the incentives are still there generate outrage get that engagement rating or else the
whole thing is or else you're going out of business that's it right so it's it doesn't
have to be unfortunately this fits great for someone who wants to use this for a bad purposes
because it's a great uh machination for bad purposes like google and facebook both have a lot
of money that they send into various altruistic and research causes they care about the world
and yet this is driving them to burn down the society we live oh for sure so i'm saying that
there are the somewhat benevolent people like mark zuckerberg and google i'm sure i don't know a lot
about zuckerberg but i get the impression he's somewhat chill i've seen headlines for him wanting
to be for uh minimum basic income and stuff like that so how bad can he be right um someone's gonna
write in and say here's the 50 reasons he's bad click here to find out um by the way he mergers
children right but anyway um they can be you know whether fully nice or awesome or just like
indifferent to their the outcome of whatever but the system also works great for deliberate
misuse so uh you know if you want to write a twitter bot that um will share i don't like the
vernacular of like fake news yeah um but they share literally false articles of look at the um
it's almost as if you were an enemy of the us you have this ready-made system that all you have
to do is interject a few things into and it runs for you yeah and so luckily our system has got this
weird enough uh um our system already has these lost aligned lost purposes with uh what we want out
of the system like we want the news we don't want to be you know mind fucked until we're you know
engaged for three hours right so that works great if you want to inject in some bullshit and uh
just stir this pot because the pot's already pretty messed up right yeah anyway i was thinking
specifically of russian twitter bots because reading about those lately and you know they don't
have to be based out of russia but some of them are which is pretty uh awesome if you're into that
sort of thing if you're into espionage and uh you know cool stuff like that if you're into not dying
it's sort of terrifying i'm actually kind of thankful to russia now because when i see these
sorts of things that are obviously just meant to piss off people like i recently saw one about
people sitting down uh for the anthem playing in their home while they're like watching football
on the on the tv which basically everyone does you know does anyone ever stood for the anthem at
their house while they're watching football like apparently i heard someone who had a friend of a
friend whose parents did that or something but no you don't stand up when you're watching football
in your house are you kidding me it's it's no i've never seen anyone do that uh but there was this
picture of like this is you when the anthem plays every sunday while you're watching the game
and then below it is like captain america this is you when someone kneels at the national anthem
acting like you're the biggest damn patriot in the world and for a long time i i just didn't
understand what the fuck they were talking about i eventually figured out that it was supposed to
be a diss on the people who are saying people shouldn't yielding the anthem which i mean it
was just confusingly done especially because captain america is a liberal it's you you are
really mixing up your messages here but captain america is a patriot sir he's neither liberal
nor conservative i'm not sure i'm not sure what he is depends on what what captain america you're
looking at the the marvel universe captain so like i'm the current the mcu one i mean
probably ish i mean he's liberal dude well he also you didn't see civil war did you i did not see
civil war he's much he's likely less liberal i guess it depends on who your definition of liberal
and your definition of authoritarianism and whatever yeah uh he doesn't want to sign the
paperwork that says all right this government body can tell the avengers what to do right so which um
first i don't know i would just trust a small government you know yeah i mean so that sounds
pretty conservative to me oh really because i can i think conservatives would be the the one who'd
be more like along the lines of oh i see now now it's up for debate yeah and i'm sure that i'm
probably wrong i bet i mean i don't know i think it is a good debate to to be had and i'm having it
specifically to be kind of trolley i don't really uh well i mean because it's specifically
after what happened in winter soldier where he realized that he couldn't trust uh certain authorities
well it was more just like we should be in charge of ourselves because we know what we're doing even
though we fuck up sometimes you know we don't want like what if they tell us not to do something we
feel like we should yeah and uh the other side of that was this is really not relevant but the other
side of that was tony stark was dealing with the guilt of having made ultron and uh having a
high body count on his shoulders so he was like no i want to push the responsibility off on to
somebody else you know then that way if we go do stuff and fuck up at least it's their fault not
ours um anyway fun movie should check it out uh so regardless of whether captain america is liberal
or not the the the meme was posted entirely just to infuriate people on the other side that would
see it and the people who would be sharing it is everyone who saw that is like on the liberal side
who wants to fight they're like yeah they repost it on their timeline and like maybe they're two or
three uh more right-leaning friends would see it and get pissed off and that's how the fucking thing
spreads and creates hate even though it's stupid and poorly done and everything about annoyed me
anyways uh now that the russians are in things i can say people hey you are on the side of the
russians you are helping to destroy our culture they probably made this meme themselves and and
the fact that the russians are involved now is i don't know i kind of think it's like a thing to
get people to stop and take a step back and say am i being manipulated by an enemy who wants to see
me die for some people i heard people pre-election saying you know i saw some stuff on the news about
like you know they'd interview people in russia like on the ground and just say you know what
would you think what happened to hillary became president oh i think should start world war three
and they're using that as a motive or as a uh bottom as a like you know they they basically
i'm gonna vote republican what reasons can i put above it they were bottom lining that decision to
vote but they're using that as ammunition against uh voting for hillary clinton um because look at
how the russians would feel about it uh you know we're already getting that and uh i don't know if
i could find this number again so i'm probably wrong on the specifics but something like in the
early 2000s the number of or the percentage of favorable opinions on russia on on the uh
conservative party members was something like 10 percent wait like 10 percent of republicans
15 years ago felt favorable about russia okay now that number is at like 35 oh so instead of jumping
back and saying our enemy is pushing this way it's like oh our enemy agrees with us they must not be
so bad so it's going both ways and i think it's going more the other way instead of instead of
people saying holy shit the enemies has the same position i do i should revaluate my position it's
like oh my anyways my enemy has the same position i do they must not be so bad after all okay i think
is the way that it's going well that's disappointing yeah so it would have been great if it worked
out the other way right yeah but uh man all we need to do is for like isis to come on endorse
trump and somebody maybe that will wake people up a little bit but i was i don't know i think
i'm still gonna try and see what results i get i haven't actually done it yet but i'm gonna
next time i see something obviously just meant as outrage bait post how are you how sure are you
that you're not working for the russians to bring down our society by sharing this and see oh that's
just fake news are you shitting me you're one of those libtards that's the that's the feedback you
might receive okay i don't think they would use the term libtards probably not because i would
be generally only talking to liberals and you're probably talking to people and oh okay i see um
then yeah they then they probably won't be using the phrase fake news either yeah um yeah uh i mean
that's that's an aspect of this malachian nightmare that's sort of there right so you see something
like yellowstone's going to explode in the headline and then it's like oh geologists aren't worried
i didn't read the whole article so i'm not sure what the specifics were maybe they rounded their
estimate down from you know 250 million years 240 million years right um so i'm happy that's
hypothetical i'm not sure what the article actually said but the point is that like the fake news
article of you know the things about to explode got clicks they got a really smart guy to click it
because it sounds like serious news but it's not so that's not i think the common usage of the
phrase fake news but it's the only one i'm willing to get behind um the alternative is just like
lying and there's no reason to you know dress it up with other fancy words um you know so if you're
saying oh yeah when it's impossible for me not to think of political related examples because that's
where this uh terminology really sprung from in the last few months so i don't know if it's going to
bring us back to the politics stuff but uh trump tweeted last week that the president of well i don't
think he's the president uh other people have been saying the president of Puerto Rico um and in fact
this was on uh i don't i'm not on the subreddit the donald but i'm on subreddits that make fun of
that subreddit and someone shared one of their top posts for like the day it was and it got thousands
of upvotes about like the president of Puerto Rico is being a fucking idiot oh shit and people on
you know subreddits like resist and that sort of thing uh we're like yeah the president of Puerto
Rico is a fucking idiot the president of Puerto Rico is donald trump um so they meant like the
governor or whatever who's that guy i don't know what his office is and i sound like an idiot um
anyway yeah this i feel like this is not the best example to make to not scare people away
even if it's reality it's whatever you want to just skip it then yeah let's well uh he said something
along the lines of how i forget the guy's name the the leader of Puerto Rico that's not trump uh was
we were gonna we got along great till the dems got to him and turned him against us now he's saying
all these things and it's like no he was pissed the entire time because you guys's response was
terrible like they were being hurricaneed and uh you know you were playing golf and you dedicated
the trophy to them even though you didn't win um so like you know weird shit like that wait he didn't
get the trophy i have heard actually mixed things about that need to verify because you're right
speaking of you know people sharing outrage that's a that's a great thing to make it sound more
outrageous i know i did i know he in in his response he played golf for a week and then
dedicated the trophy to the people of Puerto Rico and then traveled there and threw paper towels at
them um you saw that video of him throwing paper towels people right i did see the video i thought
that the people were exaggerating oh it was ridiculous well i i also saw a meme were the last
three presidents bush uh obama and the bush before that was it bush before that uh clinton
was it clinton okay but all three of them like after major disasters hugging people in the disaster
area right and then trump in the back throwing paper towels and and my response to the meme was
now the real question is is this meme ableist because supposedly donald trump may have germophobia
sort of thing and doesn't like touching people and so are we making fun of a disabled person
who is unable to touch humans we're making fun of a disabled person for sure
sick burn um that might be unfair to disabled people i'm sorry yeah i wouldn't want to
wouldn't want to put anyone in the same camp no it sounds like i'm being super unreasonably hard
on trump i'm willing to uh like defend a lot of my criticism here and yes i'm being hyperbolic
by saying he's mentally disabled um there's some speculation that he might be having cognitive
deterioration but now we're getting way too far yeah so yeah uh are they being ableist who knows
right uh you know i do wonder even if that's your thing you don't like just lob paper towels at
people no well i mean i mainly post that comment to troll oh i know but but what i i mean so i'm
just saying even if we took that you know as much as we could that's not the best response no matter
what right yeah unless they unless someone spilled a glass then you toss them up some paper towels
that's the only circumstance in which case it's okay to toss something at somebody like a dog
yeah i mean you can hand them the paper towel yeah without even touching them yeah all right let's
let's tie this back to uh social media stuff yes okay i'm gonna grab tristan harris's article here
um we'll link to tristan harris's article how technology hijacks people's mind
excuse me how technology hijacks people's minds from a magician and a google design ethicist
so that was his position at google was google design ethicist which is a fun position to have
and only the and i think it was also like and ux philosopher or something um which the only kind
of job title you could have at a place like google um no one else hires philosophers they're 10
companies but anyway uh he talks about the various exploits that they use and he kind of takes them
you know like how james randy dissects bullshit from his magician's background um he talks about
the the kinds of things magicians do to grab your attention and how uh these tie into the things
that social media does and some of them get less magicianity as you go down the line but the first
and foremost is if you control them hijack number one if you control the menu you control the choices
yeah so like this is one of the reasons that i didn't like facebook is that there's no downvote
button or any way to disagree without studying an argument although i mean downvoting might be
seen as an argument because your name is attached to your likes right so if you like my picture
i see that you like to i don't see that has a like right um so you can't even downvote without uh
you know opening the discussion for argument but the idea that uh what you presented with
really limits your options um oh god the facebook in general is just absolutely horrible i strongly
recommend to everyone to get facebook purity which is actually called fluff buster purity
because facebook did not like them using their name uh but yeah if you go to fb purity i think
you can highly optimize your facebook browsing experience get rid of almost all the ads and
get rid of that annoying background color that people can do on their posts that makes it so
it's much harder to tell ads from actual posts uh it's i wonder if that was deliberate i that's
because then you spend more time looking at ads because you think i wonder if this is some friends
colored pose yeah huh that that was my assumption the day that they rolled it out i was like oh i see
what they're doing fuck them yeah that is what actually caused me to finally get facebook purity
was that and i should have done it much much earlier than that unfortunately i don't think
there's a option for phones but i don't have facebook on my phone anyway because i do not
need to have heroin around me all the time i want to at least only have the access to it when i'm
sitting down yeah the uh but definitely get that facebook will not even allow you to share it on
facebook if you try to share a link to it they say oh it looks like you're trying to link to uh
malicious content awesome we will we will help flee avoid you you know poisoning your friends
feeds with this you're welcome you're like yeah fuck you facebook that's hilarious uh so it gets
rid of ads and gets rid of some of the other stuff that makes it hard to tell ads from content
yeah lets you optimize a lot of what you're doing with your on facebook with your feed and so forth
right on i think i also i'm not sure if it's part of my youtube plugin that i have on chrome or if
it's uh part of if you can go into the features or in the settings on your regular youtube but you
can disable autoplay yes i do that uh instantly with every single service that has an autoplay the
first thing i do as soon as i know is there's an autoplay is go and turn that off because
fuck that bullshit i only i will tell you when i want to see more i like leave it on a netflix
because i tend to binge netflix okay um the only other time actually this would have been a good
excuse to leave it on if i could leave but you can just click yes it'll play the next one the
difference though is that on my xbox the remote goes off after 20 minutes and the average episode
is like 21 minutes and 30 seconds right so then you gotta spend 15 seconds turning the remote
back on yeah well even it's just five but then it's just there for 20 more minutes and burns
its battery till it turns off just in time we're gonna turn it on again okay um but whatever uh
what was i gonna say um autoplay is actually another thing that keeps people engaged obviously
that's why they do it um another thing that i uh so like i i haven't left facebook in the sense
that i've deleted my account but i love i've left facebook in the sense that i haven't posted in over
a year um and i'll occasionally get on and like like stuff um but i only have it on to coordinate
the less wrong meetings and stuff yeah um facebook is really good for coordinating events yeah it's
it's quite a good calendar option and also a pretty decent messenger i like their messenger
quite a bit um well certainly like because google's social thing never really took off so like you
have google circles and stuff but no one ever friended someone on google right um but if you
have the option and you can do google hangouts that works just like facebook messenger except a
little more smoothly and you can seamlessly put in videos and stuff um or rather video feed of the
person um but and calendars on google are great but since it doesn't have the same adoption for
that feature as facebook does facebook still is probably the best way to coordinate for stuff
until you have that one friend who deleted their facebook and now you've got to text him to be like
hey jankins are you coming to the thing because we changed the place um that's on you jankins uh
i guess we're we're talking about mitigation strategies now how we can deal with this shit
yeah i mean we can talk we can kind of oscillate back and forth into how it gets in your face and
how to get away from it i mean i i didn't i didn't take her hercules and steps to get away from it
i do feel like deleting your account completely does cut you off quite a bit it does and so props
to jankins for doing that i find it sometimes a little harder to yeah it is harder to connect
with some people when they aren't on facebook they're it just it's a good event coordinator
it's horrible as an archive and as a way to have conversations absolutely like the anti of those
things if you wanted to destroy relationships and you wanted to destroy an an archive of what
has happened on the internet you would use facebook right because it's good for those things uh
or terrible for those things i guess but uh but it's good for recording events and for text messaging
yeah and for sharing photos and for malthusian nightmares and for malthusian nightmares yeah
but uh or malachian nightmares right well kind of similar yeah but for malachian nightmares you're
right i i mean there's just the opt out option i have opted out of twitter almost entirely
i tweet maybe once or twice a year just to say hey here's a new thing that i got published in
i don't know you're on twitter i have a twitter account oh do you i haven't used it since 2012
but i have one yeah i use it literally just to say hey i'm publishing something here you go
nice uh i have every now and then i post something but i was like once a year i have never done the
snapchat i'm like fuck that i know it's v who i'm following much more closely now uh his blog
has opted out of facebook entirely which i think is a harsh step but there there are some i mean
the guy who did the facebook who worked for facebook and created the likes he has entirely
opted out of facebook and doesn't let his family use it either which i don't know if that really
works your kids are probably going to be using it at school or something well and like they can put
it on their phones unless you're going to just full on you know yeah you know own their phones and
ensure that you're gonna lock everything and all that right um i'm on snapchat but it's less of a
social thing and more of its way for me to you know send and receive pictures of animals um so
it and it doesn't take up memory you know other than like the app but you don't have to like you
know like why if someone texts me the image it's saved in my history and i have to go through and
clear out my messages once in a while because it ends up taking up gigs of data after a few months
but snapchat you know friend of mine has a bangle cat that sends me a video of like
three times a week and i like that um but there's uh it's hard to see the well it's
they have news on there in that uh if you don't know a lot about snapchat it's kind of
pointless but basically the newest isn't thrown on your face and it's super easy to ignore um it's
not like you have to watch it to get to the content you want like on youtube or something
i know scott alexander once posted about uh how awful tumblr is for uh i believe his post was
called the taxal plasma of rage where tumblr is optimized just to get people upset as well
but i mean he still uses it too so i tried being on tumblr for like two months and got
to some argument with somebody who was completely insane i defend she probably thought i was insane
and i was like okay this is the the rumors were true this is the level of discourse here i'm out
plus it's just not a great way to to optimize for what you want like a subreddit works a lot
better um yes if you like it but if that means you have to tolerate reddit so if you if you
don't like the the weird jokes there then you're not going to like it but there's a few tumblers
i follow which i really like i mean if you create your experience you can do it well and i think
that's i mean that is the more important way to deal with things like on facebook i still use
facebook a bunch but now i limit my time on it and i have very strict rules about what i will
engage there's certain things that when i see i just like i'm gonna keep scrolling i may have an
opinion but you know what i know what's gonna happen so just fuck this keep going it's not worth it
i've done that where like i sometimes i'll even think of a response and i could be like man this
would be a good way nope nope i'm out you're like am i actively contributing to the malachian
nightmare yes that would be contributing to the nightmare i'm not going to do that well i would
like to think that like i remember after the uh the result of the election people were like
man it was you third party voters that's why clinton won and he's lost excuse me yeah if only
ferdy and slip um uh people were like people were showing articles or at least statuses of
like blaming people who voted for third parties that's why clinton lost and uh i have sensible
friends who pointed out it's like actually those numbers wouldn't have won her the election it was
the failure of turnout that lost her the election um those people were shat on for like you know
fuck if you're disagreeing with me um but they weren't like trying to engage in a fight they
were just like oh you're actually a little wrong about this which likes to be corrected um whereas
like some people would like to be corrected and not be spreading misinformation some people don't
they were just pissed and i get that so one of the things i did with facebook way before i stopped
being on it and actually it's probably streamlined by a way to do it is i disabled notifications for
my phone cool so i still have the app because at this time i didn't really have a computer that
i was on all that often i have an old mac or i had an old mac that i you know hate using because
it's old yeah three gig is ram and it's now 11 years old um no wait 10 anyway so i was on the
desktop version that much so i had on my phone and yeah lock screen notifications that red badge
that you're talking about and i'm the kind of guy who can't ignore the red badge i've seen
people's phones they have 2600 unread emails and uh these are the same people who i think
their desktops on their computers are just like no folders icons on the yeah yeah like for now i
mean my phone i have a facebook i have a message in my social folder and messenger i have you know so
like um i'm i check those pretty compulsively so i deleted the thing that puts the badges on
facebook at all so now i don't even see notifications and what's fun is it's still trying to get like
so when i go back on once a month ish to make a an event for less wrong i'll get like 15 notifications
and what a lot of them are just pointless random things like oh this person posted a new status
and so this person posts on facebook three times a day you're just trying to like maybe it doesn't
it must know but it maybe it's trying to hope that i'll see the notification thing down there
when i open the app and be you know why is there 15 what's happening what's blowing up why i want
to get down on this but it's just thinking of excuses to get me to get notifications you know
things that it doesn't bug people about who i think we're on every day maybe it is doing this people
now i don't know do you get notice do you get notifications that someone posted a status uh i
get enough notifications every day that facebook doesn't have to do that to give me more status
updates yeah so i was wondering if every now and then i'll see that like maybe once a month or
something but it's usually for people that like haven't posted in a long time and facebook will
let me know they posted okay so i was wanting i wasn't wanting to be too like you know shakesperian
and assuming this was something that they only did to people who are ignoring the app maybe it's a
new feature they they they they do target people who ignore their stuff more yeah so part of what
we were talking about this a little earlier with google circles that makes uh something like facebook
kind of insidious makes it sound like they're being deliberately bad but whatever um is that there
isn't really a competitor right um oh i don't use facebook you know try linked in it's like that's
not a social network to get together and in fact i don't even know there's an events thing on linked
in there definitely is actually i think okay um but it's mainly for like hey denver startup week
is happening you know next month um but it's not for like want to grab a beer um so uh there isn't
a competitor there isn't a competitor to youtube that anyone really uses like people try to get
stuff off the ground but you know youtube is pretty big and monolithic at this point there's
just no i mean there's sometimes vimeo um daily motion yeah but i mean you know you basically
youtube stuff and i don't have vimeo or daily motion bookmarked right like if i go to type in
vim it doesn't bring up vimeo on my taskbar or my url because i don't go there often enough
i only go there if something links me there that youtube didn't host or they didn't post to youtube
for whatever reason i you know i consider social media to be a new technology basically at the
same level as alcohol the what i mean is that they both are extremely addictive they make people feel
good in the short term which is why they're addictive but they have very bad long term consequences
and they're very easy to abuse and i i don't remember where i heard this and i tried to look
it up recently and couldn't find it so maybe it's bullshit i remember hearing once that uh
every culture when they first discovered or were introduced to alcohol had about a hundred year
period where they stopped doing anything useful that's amazing yeah where uh they you know they're
going along they're being fine they're having normal culture alcohol enters the picture and
then for the next hundred years they're basically going to the shitter nothing is working well
and eventually the culture figures out how to adapt to alcohol and integrate it and now people
can use it like with some level of moderation and uh and china had a similar thing happen with opium
although that was also due in large part to the british pushing it on them for profit's sake
but again new technologies like that can really fuck things up for a while before we invent
social technologies to deal with it ways to uh have some alcohol in moderation
ways that we we deal with this disruption and i feel like we are still in the
area where we have not figured out how to deal with this disruption and it's currently
fucking up our society beyond you know all recognition maybe not all recognition but
it's fucking up pretty bad and it has had disastrous consequences that have increased
the chances of nuclear war on the planet and so that's sort of what bums me out like you know if
we took a decade or if we took a few decade dip a hundred years ago that would have been a drag
right now everyone could die and i think i think we'll get there and i think people just really
do need to start being much more serious and considerate about how they use it and treat it
like a drug like alcohol the when do you want to use it make sure you're using facebook make sure
you're using social media responsibly don't facebook and drive or whatever the new thing would
be don't facebook angry i don't know there's another uh analogy to alcohol there in that
people tend to enjoy their time on facebook and then subsequently regret their time they
spent on facebook yes and also the the analogy that when this first shows up uh the immediate
reaction is to ban it that this is horrible and it's destroying things and we should just
opt entirely like the people that are leaving all social media but it's not a long-term
sustainable option people like it enough that it'll always be there so you have to find some
other way to deal with it rather than just opting out entirely which is why i'm trying to push for
more moderation things like don't respond to things that make you angry or unfriend the people who
always share or at least unfollow the people who always share outrage baby stuff well interest in
harris makes a point like this too that even just disabling the the lock screen notifications
so that it's not you know because you check your phone i think 150 times a day was the number he
threw out in his paper um which is probably low for some people um and i'm not sure what a check
counts like if i open it again to do the thing i was finishing earlier i don't know you know whatever
but yeah if if you go to look at your phone and check the time or whatever and oh look new facebook
thing and you open up facebook um that pulls you back in too and you know i don't want to be like
the old comrade and the old man who's like facebook's bad and you shouldn't you shouldn't be on the
social media you get out there and meet people um well i mean that's that's first of all i do
agree that it's much better to go out and meet people but on the other hand you know people
say alcohol is bad and sure alcohol is bad but everyone still drinks alcohol so facebook's the
same kind of way yeah it's bad but there's also some good aspects to it don't fucking overdo it
yeah and kind of like aware of what's happening kind of like drinking too much people don't look
back on a three hour facebook binge and say that was time well spent yeah i think keeping it
from jumping down your face all the time by by having lock screen notifications enabled is one
thing that people could do um you know but i guess maybe we haven't made a sufficient case for why
they should bother doing that so one thing that did and i could find a reference for this if we
need to um i feel like it might be popular not only but i'm not sure um facebook contributes
to people's depressive tendencies in that you get sampling bias from looking at your facebook feed
because people aren't sharing their boring mundane lives they're sharing the times they're doing
exciting stuff look at me i went hiking look at me i got married look at me i uh got a new dog
what other other stuff people talk about um so you're not seeing the 16 hours a day that they
or whatever um you're not seeing the boring times you're only seeing the highlights and so because
that's what you see as you're scrolling through you see everyone up to the cool stuff and you're
like i'm just scrolling through facebook right now i'm not doing anything cool another good reason to
limit your time on facebook or or at least moderate how you use facebook i'm willing to
bet that over 90 percent of our listeners maybe over 95 percent of our listeners who have been
on facebook for at least three years have leased out have lost at least one friend they're like a
person who is a good decent person that you like hanging out with something happened on facebook
and you guys couldn't be friends anymore because of some bullshit blow up that's probably happened
yeah i i know it's happened to me i'm trying to think if that ever happened to me i never got
that involved in a lot of facebook flame wars um but i i know people has happened to um
but i also didn't have that many facebook friends so uh but just finishing the last thing i was
gonna say was that uh no you're good um you get a sampling bias and so people don't uh especially
if you already are predisposed predisposed to depressive tendencies you just you get this idea
that everyone else up to all this cool stuff and you're not and that bums people out uh we do have
uh i matt i remember when he heard that we were going to talk about this
had a thing to say when i was going to say that social media is awful and really is destroying
our society uh matt wanted to point out that social media can also be great and wonderful
if you are isolated uh someplace without a lot of people who think like you and that is what keeps
you sane uh and can get you through a hard part in your life and i wanted to say that i guess
that's true when i was in high school like facebook didn't exist yet because i'm very very old but uh
i had i had very few people in my life that i could actually relate to and being on certain
internet forums really i don't know if it saved my life but it it made my life much more bearable
it would have been awful without it and i think matt had similar experiences where
it was the thing that kept him sane to be able to talk with other people who who felt like he did
and i think that was probably also a experience of a lot of atheists in the uh early 2000s as well
because there weren't a lot of out atheists yet and it was still very taboo and when you could
find people on the internet who said no you're not insane and you're not an immoral monster
this really is crazy bullshit these people are spewing and you could talk with them about it it
it helped and that wasn't really social media the same way that it was social media nowadays
but if people spend a lot of time on facebook and it helps them i think that's good too that is one
of the ways you know that the knowing yourself and knowing what you can tolerate and the moderation
is the key like are you making society worse off by spreading outrage or are you making your life
better by connecting with people and having an outlet for for the socialization that you
can't get where you are unless you're connecting over outrage and then you're in this weird
interest between it's bad um but yeah i mean that's a good point and there i mean there are other
avenues to doing that but certainly like um you know going to the bar and asking like hey who
else believes this weird thing that i believe is not the way to do that because you could get your
ass kicked right depending on where you are yeah yeah so there's there's definitely i mean there's
obviously perks i mean the other perks is that you know it lets you keep in touch with people and
there's all kinds of reasons that this got popular um but uh i think certainly tristan harris's point
you know he he points out that just there's a lot built into this that doesn't have your goals
your goals aren't its goals um drastically not yeah so that's the that's the downside right
i mean its goals is to keep you on there forever and take everything from you yeah and like reddit
has a lot of things that suck um a lot of people suck a lot of like the culture sucks
but man if you want to get on and talk about you know uh your favorite sports team or uh
your favorite video game or movie or whatever subreddits i'm on like random video games or
i don't know other random things those people go to those subreddits talk about those things
and yeah you're not making because it's more it's way more anonymous than facebook um in the
fact that you can't post personal information or personal identifiable information um unless you're
celebrity but you're at least there with like-minded people but going on to your facebook feed and
saying who likes the broncos uh you'll probably get people like fuck the broncos and i like the
broncos but that's that's not the best way to get that sort of like you know friendship chamber
is that really people get that upset about sports i have no idea okay i never posted i can say with
pretty oh wait no i posted a sports thing once i shared an smbc comic or wasn't smbc it was some
little webcomic of like a sports announcer it might have been the oatmeal of like yeah they went out
there we tried to sports hard than them and we got the ball to the point zone more times than they
did and that's you know whatever uh that's the closest i went to a sports post i guess mainly
what i'm saying is if you see something that makes you outraged ask yourself first am i contributing
to the downfall of society through maloch malochian nightmarish means and then don't do that and when
other people do do that i don't know like maybe i don't know how to say to someone politely
i think you might be destroying society yeah that wouldn't be the way i'd put it
i liked your way of saying you know have you considered that you're working for the russians
by sharing this but i don't know what kind of responses you get to that that's interesting
i've been remembering for like 10 minutes okay do we want to do we want to move on then i don't
feel like we've covered this that well but i don't know what else to say articulately yeah i think
once we've run out of the articulate things to say we may be done all right let's try this really
quick i'll jump through and i'm gonna read the uh the essay is not that long on tristan harris's
website which is tristan harris dot com pretty catchy name i can run through and read the the
top like the 10 hijack things okay so the you know it's the hijacks that take over your mind yeah
so we talked about hijack one we can just respond to these or run past them if you want but i thought
it'd be fun hijack two put a slot machine in a billion pockets we kind of talked about that we
did where you never know what you're gonna get and that refresh is nice and a lot of the refreshes
are calculated so like the like you said the one on uh was uh gmail was an accident at first but
that's how you reload your twitter and uh according to tristan when you refresh your twitter account
or your twitter feed and it spins for a second it doesn't take a second um that's there to get you
focused and ready a lot of this thing has come off like you know again grumpy old men
you know facebook's ruining the world kind of thing but it's more just like you might not be
aware of all the ways that it's calculated to keep your to maximize your time on screen and that's
not what you want out of facebook but that's what facebook wants out of you yeah it's not just facebook
it's everything which you know is part of the problem hijacked number three fear of missing
something important right and that definitely kept me on for a while too oh really um i have come i have
come to accept that there is nothing super important on facebook if it's important enough
to actually be important i'll find about it in some find out about it in some other way
and i no longer expect anyone to see anything that i put on facebook like if they do great
that's why i put it on facebook but i do not assume that just because i put it on facebook it's now
common knowledge yeah well i think that's part of it the other thing maybe is just defining like what
you know the important part means like you know i would certainly hope that if like a family member
was in the hospital i wouldn't hear about it on facebook right um i hope someone would call me yeah
so or text me who's their phone is a phone um i do want to also right now uh i don't think i've
ever said this before but i would like to come out very strongly in favor of seeing people in meat
space there is something very different about actually feeling like the vibrations as they speak
the the actual feeling sounds hitting your eardrums of like smelling them and being able to touch
them and interact with them and reading all their body language i think that is just vastly
important and a hugely deep psychological need that we have which facebook kind of mimics and
pretends to to um to fulfill but it really doesn't you still feel kind of empty afterwards
almost all the time and i think if people were able to take that time that they use on facebook
and somehow you know put it all in a row i mean that's the problem with facebook right you can't
spend that time socializing because it's like on a train you check it for 10 minutes or something
but if you could somehow take all that time and just stick it together at one end of your
meek and weak and meet people face to face just so much higher quality of interaction to see people
in meat space i enjoy in-person conversations more too there's something to be said about like a good
text conversation like via instant messenger because then i can articulate myself better
i sound better in typing than i do in in speech less things through exactly uh but
i'm tempted to throw in this really quick because we uh we were gonna have shelly on as a guest and
she talked about uh you know like simulation stuff now she's in favor does simulation meet space count
as meat space i mean depends on high enough i guess yeah all right fair enough if it's indistinguishable
from real life then yeah it counts fair enough all right so missing something important um social
approval uh is the fourth hack and i mean i'm i'm skimming and it's i don't feel like social
approval is the best name for this category um he talked about how you know like when you
are tagged in pictures it's less of like uh someone you know jagging a square over your face and typing
in steven dot zuber or steven zuber or whatever to tag me facebook knows what my face looks like
and says actually facebook doesn't know my face looks like for some weird reason whenever rachel
posts pictures of me and and her together uh it asks if she wants to tag scott my twin brother
who hasn't posted on facebook since high school huh and who looks a lot less like me than i look
even though we're identical twins um and like something in facebook's algorithm is missing the
fact that rachel and i like live together and have been dating for seven years or six years
over the longest been so um maybe it's just trying to sneakily get scott to come back on facebook
that variable might actually be part of it um because it auto generates who do you want to tag
let's see here number five was i think tit for tat where was it yep social reciprocity so poke
and your fuel obligatory supergate a poke um i think i read that bullshit certainly like happy
birthdays um you know those that even has the feature where uh you don't have to go to their
page you can just do it from like the top of your feed i like that feature if that's your thing yeah
let's see number six bottomless bowls infinite feeds and autoplay we talked about autoplay a bit
but i mean the cool thing about autoplay though is if i'm watching nothing if i'm watching
binging with babish my one of favorite youtube channels i one of my newer favorite youtube
channels he makes uh food from tv and movies and video games it's really fun and if you haven't seen
an episode i strongly recommend it he uh just has this fun presentation delivery and you know he
posts the full recipe on the on the description if you want to make it um and he has this cool
voice and a great beard um anyway uh if i'm watching binging with babish and i finish the
six minute episode it'll play the next one for me and it's like what's cool though is that like
it doesn't show me keeping up with the kardashians or whatever bullshit right it shows me something
i probably would have wanted to watch anyway but you could click like oh i know but i'm just saying
like it's not like it's throwing nonsense in my face yeah it's throwing you know i guess if you
can skip the ads between videos um but it's it's it's showing what i want to watch that's part of
what makes it kind of again insidious makes it sound more deliberately sinister than it is
it's part of what makes it so um addictive yeah addictive and sneaky it's because you know it is
showing stuff you want and that's not you know it's not a feature that uh people would be super
pissed about because it's like why am i you'd be more pissed if it was showing you uh you know
whatever insane shit you hate right if it was showing you that after everything you watched
that you liked that would be super i might be one degree more pissed but i'm i i you you underestimate
how pissed i get i think when my computer plays something and i did not specifically tell it to
play that fair enough number seven instant interruption versus respectful delivery okay
so we talked about that with the notifications popping up and stuff um respectful delivery might
be like a nice way of saying all right it's like when you check your email yeah um you decide when
you want to email jumps up and shows you uh you know some of my accounts do that my most annoying
one doesn't um but it would be kind of cool and this is not the kind of feature you can expect
because it doesn't fit with the mouth using or the malachian trap of how facebook and other
social networking has worked out but if you could say okay cool facebook uh show on my lock screen
at 11 30 because i want to take my lunch break so that'd be kind of cool show me the top five
things you think i want to look at yeah but it won't do that you if you if you haven't enabled
it's there all the time not just for certain time slots so that's the kind of respectful delivery
hijack eight uh bundling your reasons with their reasons and we kind of talked about the
the alignment problem with you want to get on facebook to talk with your friends and see the
news and they want you to be on facebook to be on facebook um but the example that he gives quickly
is you know in the in the physical world of grocery stores uh you know you go to the grocery
store to get to go to the pharmacy or get milk but they don't want you just running out so they put
that shit at the back right and i'm like oh that's true um so that's kind of funny uh they make the
customers they make the thing that the customers want inseparable from what the business wants
which is spending more time in the store um so that's actually man again a lot of it sounds so
sinister but it's just an accident of how it came out right um number nine inconvenient choices uh
we talked about that there's no like alternatives um you know if you don't like it you can always
unsubscribe or you can always leave the product or whatever but it's like there isn't there are
things that do what facebook does the parts that you might like like if you like the social stuff
there's meetup and meetup i not on it that much but i think it's probably less in your face than
facebook is um and i'm not super i assume so i'm not super anti facebook it sounds like i'm
because i'm railing on it but that's just sort of the point of the episode i yeah i use facebook
a lot like multiple hours a day every day so but i feel like i do not use it as irresponsibly
i i sacrifice my time to it but at least i do not sacrifice my friendships and
spread outrage to to the people i care about
yeah i mean if you're if you're aware of what's going on that's you know at least you're aware
of it kind of like moderating your drinking right or planning not to bring your car keys if you're
planning on getting wasted or whatever it's like drinking but then not being a rude asshole while
you're drunk uh the last one is uh forecasting errors and foot in the door strategies um so foot
in the door is like uh this was in that book i keep insisting that you read um influence science
and practice yeah but the the general idea is that if you get someone to agree to something
small they're more likely to agree to something big okay um and it's all kinds of fun wacky
experience people did on people to prove this people don't know like the full cost of what
they agree to when they sign into facebook or something but yeah so you get on and you know
if you delete your account i think unless there's some new way around this but at least for a while
you uh couldn't like say all right facebook i want you to delete my pictures in my posts
facebook's like nope they'll post those those are ours forever okay um so certainly a lot of the
content that you put out there is available for everybody so you can make your stuff private
but if you comment on someone's page who there's isn't private people can see your comments yeah
and so you know even like a lot of people i know meet you know have their facebook set to private
for you know whatever reason that they don't want their employers know that they drink or
are atheist or something right um but you know you uh rsv rsvp to a skeptics conference or an
atheist conference and they don't the conference probably isn't private so if someone wants to
search what what events did this guy go to boom it shows that you went to these uh so uh i think
people might not be aware what they're giving up when they sign up um and that's going to be true
for everything right uh i'm sure there's i mean certainly with google uh and i i have none of these
problems with google because google isn't in my face as much and when they are i kind of appreciate
it and i think that's kind of what they're going for um but i mean like google i mean unless you
tell the app not to track you unless you're using it um but uh you know it knows where you are all
the time and so does your uh your iphone maps app um and it uses that information unless there's
some other sinister motives involved put on these foil hats um but for like traffic uh so you know
i know how long it'll take to get to your place from the uh light rail station because everyone
else who's taking that route well and there's enough people with their phones in their cars
they don't have to have the maps open but it knows how how congested traffic is because
these cars are moving really slow so giving accurate time distance not a if the roads are empty
you can get there in 10 minutes it gives me 26 minutes or whatever right so you know there
are good things behind a lot of these but you know you might not know that hey uh my location is
always available for people i don't know if it's available to a person to get on and see where you
are um maybe but who knows i don't know uh probably those russian hackers or the chinese hackers
or those american hackers that hacker for chan right i think that was his name yeah all right i
think we've come full circle okay um we need a guest i think to keep us rained in yeah i had fun
i did too i hope you guys had fun we're gonna move on to listener feedback yes actually before that
we want to do i want to do like a sort of in-depth co-host feedback thing let's do it okay so uh
shelly who has been a co-host a couple times was talking to me about a earlier episode it was the
emotionally charged conversations episode where i made the claim that someone shouldn't be judged
morally bad because they are factually wrong about something and shelly had pushback with that
and she said that no i think there are many cases where you can judge someone to be morally bad
if they are factually wrong about things and i wanted to like address that for a while because
i think i sort of think she has a point uh i mainly go back to my um my days on the atheist forums
where every now and then you would be talking about the at the time it was evolution you would be
talking about uh evolution stuff with people with theists and they this was back when there was no
you know god directed evolution thing yet well it wasn't it wasn't popular yet anyway uh and they
would make these really absurd claims which were just gross misrepresentations like uh if i were
to go and fuck my dog there wouldn't be a half human half dog hybrid that pops out of that which
is what evolution says should happen right so just something really stupid but then uh
that gets pointed out to them as not being true and they don't update and for a normal person on
the internet that's really just infuriating but there are like professional debaters uh
dwayne gish comes to mind ken ham who will go and not i mean they aren't professional debaters they
are professional bullshitters and they debate occasionally yeah they're professional clergy
in some some manner and they debate people occasionally and they will make certain claims
that are factually incorrect but sound like they could be plausible to the people who are not educated
about uh evolution and the people they're debating with will set them straight they will explain the
situation to them they will sometimes after the fact if it's like an online debate or you know
just afterwards if they remain in contact they will send them evidence and and uh citations and
all this and they will say oh okay great thank you for setting me straight and then continue to repeat
what they said over and over uh the stuff that's wrong and i believe those people really are morally
culpable for spreading falsehoods right i didn't hear shelly's full uh position here i just heard
what you said um but it sounds to me like the distinction could be if they're lying or not
yeah not if they're spreading misinformation like if you're accidentally wrong and someone
points it out then oh my bad i'll stop saying that yeah i don't think you know depending on
the damage you did you'd have to go back and try and put out fires but um it's like like ken ham
knows that he's that uh he can't say scientists are all he can't say sciences on his side right
yeah and every time he does he's lying and um what but see i want to i want to like now take
this to someplace where people could be plausibly wrong um by by that i want to say at burning man
i got to introduce grover norquist before he spoke at a event which was really cool uh who that is
oh grover norquist he's probably most uh well known for being the guy who organized the uh pledge
that all republican sign now saying they will not raise taxes uh he has sort of a right wing
think tank that he heads up and he mainly hates uh the expansion of government power
and he wants to reign in government and reduce the size and the power of the federal government
and one of his major tools for that has been to have this pledge that all republican sign saying
we will not raise taxes which has been responsible for huge amount of gridlock over the past decade
two decades uh which a lot of people dislike him for but he's basically a political big political
guy anyways i introduced him i was like oh my god i am talking to someone who has talked to like
every president personally so far i am now two degrees separated this is awesome uh i don't
know if he's talked to trump actually but you know he he talks to congresspeople often on the
first name basis with them and someone near the end pulled out a gotcha question about global warming
and here is where i say that if you are going to try to gotcha someone
you should be at least as intelligent and read up on the subject as they are
because he's a global warming denialist but he's extremely intelligent and he has read a lot about
it and when he explained why he is a denialist i was like i can see his point he has there is
a lot of misinformation out there and even like just semi plausible doubts that you can create
if that is your industry to create doubt about things like whether tobacco causes cancer or
whether carbon is warming the globe and so once you're i mean well who was it uh Richard Feynman
said the most important thing is not to be fooled and you are the best person at fooling yourself
something along those lines right i think your first formulation was close enough was close
enough okay right uh and so he when you're really smart and know a lot about researching issues
that doesn't make you impervious to wrong opinions it just means you're even better at finding ways
to justify your wrong opinions and he is terrified of large government he wants to cut it down
he doesn't want government in his business and telling him who he can or can't marry or
who he can what drugs he can or can't do or whatever it is and he views this global warming
thing as a thing that will expand government power which i mean it will the government's
going to have to regulate things like how much carbon you can burn it's it's a thing that just
gives them more power when they regulate it but it's also really important to regulate this so
that we don't have horrific climate change yeah so that is why he is strongly motivated to seek
out reasons why it's not a big deal and we shouldn't give the government this power and
and that was when i was like oh i see trying to change things purely through politics is
really hard because there will always be smart people like this who are on the wrong side but
is he morally negligent for since he pushes the levers of policy and speaks publicly
and yet he did a lot of research and got the wrong answer how how morally culpable is he
for having that wrong answer i want to kind of take that in order but i wanted to get
clarification on something that you said right at the beginning of that which was that
if you're going to ask a gotcha question to somebody you need to be as informed as they are
do you mean that in just the case of gotcha questions if you're going to say whatever this
guy's name is wrong about climate change do i need to be more informed about climate change than
he is for me to say that just to say that he's wrong no but if you're going to try to engage him
in a public forum you're going to end up looking bad and scoring points for him absolutely okay
in that context i totally agree i like everything something much more egregious that i was going
to kick back on and saying that i have to be i have to know all the ins and outs of intelligent
design theory to call ken ham a bullshit artist no just don't try to engage with him in public
about it because he's going to make you look bad if you haven't read up as much as he has okay i
thought you were challenging the epistemological standing of the person making the question
because they weren't as informed as he was but you were just saying don't if you do it this way
you're going to cause bad fallout stop that's what you're saying yeah okay cool so um how
culpable is he i'm tempted to say still a lot i especially the question like climate change i feel
like uh yes he's very intelligently wrong but not exclusively wrong okay he thinks that he knows
more than 97 percent of scientists and like those three percent are kind of like the i imagine many
of them are like people who you know the evolutionary biologists who have phd's in biology but have
an younger creasonous their whole life where they just go to school you know often with funding
to get a phd's they can say i'm a scientist and this is all bullshit and they had he had some
arguments as to why that 97 percent number is inflated even if it's 90 even if it's 90 right
what if it's something more like 47 um i would be curious how he got that number and i'm sure
he could give me a really awesome reason because this is his job to argue this yeah um but i don't
think it's 47 but he has reasons that he thinks it may be drastically lower than 97 yeah i mean
so that particular this is why you're right in order for me to engage him personally i'd have to
know more i'd have to be at least as intelligent on subjects he is because i couldn't respond to
that point yeah um but in general how culpable is he that's like i mean to pick a another example
we were talking before the air about like anti-vaxxers these people go online they read a lot they
find uh wakefield's paper and they find everything talking about it and they go to their nutritionist
and nutritionist degrees with them they've in a sense done their due diligence right um but
they're still like killing kids as a result yeah and so like just when you tell your society back
into the dark ages of fucking communicable diseases that kill children that don't have to yeah um so
like the utilitarian answer is pretty easy like they're doing harm um so yes they've done a bad thing
but uh like as far as the character of the person are they a bad person um they've made a
somewhat honest mistake but i i guess i don't know i would like to think i've never been
that egregiously wrong about something i mean uh and i i i've believed stupid things but i've never
like stood my ground on them i've been slow to move but like i've never uh i think i've never dug
my feet in and you know made it a fight i'm trying to think of and you've known me for a while is
there anything stupid that i've changed my mind on that i took too long to do i don't know alonso
fife remember when we had him on a while ago the the moral yeah uh the ethicist guy uh he has this
thing this analogy he makes that if you are a truck driver and you are carrying a heavy load
out onto you know a highway you have a moral responsibility to make sure it is secured and
there there he well i don't want to say too much about his past but people have died because
truck drivers did not take the time to secure a load that should have been secured came off
their truck in the highway killed someone and he makes the comparison that uh there there is a
certain moral responsibility to make sure that your intellectual load is secured as well if you
are going to believe things like the jews are destroying society you have a strong responsibility
to make sure that those opinions are very firmly supported by something that is true uh as opposed
to just wishful thinking and some bullshit that you heard online yeah so that's similar to i think
i mentioned ages ago on the podcast cliford's ethics of belief uh where he talked about like the
boat captain you know is my ship seaworthy exactly that sort of thing yeah but the difference between
the boat captain and presumably the truck driver is that they didn't give themselves a bunch of
sophisticated arguments to you know yes my load really is tied down i'm good um they just did they
just didn't put in the work yeah but the argument is that if you didn't put in the work you are
morally culpable for not having done that because we expect you to do that so i think more closely
with alonso's to tie it into alonso's analogy though would be what if the truck driver
tied what they thought were good knots because their friend showed them these knots and their
friend you know as a boy scout or whatever knew all these and either they missed a knot
or their friend didn't show to them right or whatever but they thought they tied it down
really well and they're like looks good to me and like they they actually put in the work
but they did it badly and then someone died as a result right that's nothing more akin to uh this
climate change denialist's position yeah and i don't know how to hit that yeah i i i mean the
the topic we were talking about on that episode was the google memo guy and i mean he made some
claims with some level of backup but probably not it's still a little bit controversial and
he was not the right obviously not the right person to say him but he also wasn't making a
public argument when he made this memo yeah i mean you know can you make a bad argument in
private i think i think you're much more uh less culpable if you make a a bad argument in private
instead of just going to the microphone and screaming this at people right yeah um but
anyway yeah so i don't know i mean especially on things that are tricky that aren't entirely
settled yet it's can are you allowed to have an opinion without knowing everything and researching
everything meticulously first he he read some things there are some people who agree with him
that uh it's not a wrong on the face of it position it he some of the things he said could
have some evidence for them and could very well end up being true is evolution settled
well what how much of it i mean yes we know evolution happens the central
thesis of evolution yeah yeah very much so but there are clever
arguers who would disagree right and they'd give you all these reasons so like i i don't know if
climate change is as settled as evolutionary science um but to say that humans have had no
impact on global climate over the last two centuries i think is like saying evolution never
happened um at least to say they have no impact you know you can you can you can you can i think
intelligently debate the fallout and how much or whatever um but like i guess i'm hung up because
like anyone who wants to say oh yeah settled questions we're not gonna argue about of course
gravity is real but evolution that that that is still you know there's three percent of scientists
who disagree with evolution so i don't i wouldn't i don't want to leave that door open to fall back
on but only because i'm worried about being misused but in the sense of it's being honestly
used that's a very good point you know like uh are eggs good or bad for you there's some
disagreement right yeah um and turns out human dietary science is really hard and i don't think
i think that is an open question um maybe there's somebody you know with a good book out there who
has proved that they're awesome or bad for you but i don't think that uh that consensus has made
made the rounds yet so and i think if you read the book that proves that they're awesome or the
book that proves that they're bad holding that opinion even if you're wrong i mean at least it was
understandable but that's a truly unsettled issue right yeah like that's that's one where like you
can't point to you know the human foundation of knowledge like the last century disagrees with
you but there there are some people who would disagree with some of the things that the google
memo guy said as strongly as we disagree that evolution and climate change is you know up in
the air and they would say if you if you are saying that he has some possibly good scientific
points rather than just saying he is as stupid as ken ham or a climate denialist then you are as
morally bad as those people are like what do you say to that i say never actually read his memo
i'm not sure i'm not sure what claims he made uh i know one of them was like that women go for more
people oriented positions and men go for more thing oriented positions yes um that that is that
is the main one that i'm talking about right now and so that uh i don't know how subtle that is
that strikes me as vaguely possible or at least vaguely plausible actually i mean
you know there might be something to do that and i totally i could think of examples that fit that
yeah but there are some people who would say that if you even are entertaining that possibility
you are as deluded as someone who says that evolution doesn't happen and and by not having
you know researched and accepted all the the people who say that that is the case you are a
sexist pig well then they're losing me right away right you don't win people over by calling them
names that's if they had said hey look steven i don't think your uh position on this i don't think
that your um your tacit endorsement that this is a valid line of inquiry is as valid as you think
it is have you read this and they link me that and i'm like oh shit you're right i've completely
changed my mind and then i'll say that so that's the that's the difference between like being you
know honestly mistaken or you know at least uh understandably mistaken versus being outright
dishonest um you know so i guess it varies on how how well supported the thing actually is and how
much of an impact that belief has on the world in combination this is actually a really tough
question because like i mean you could you can and have people you haven't but people have written
books on how 911 wasn't inside job and how couldn't have happened this way and yet like the official
story is almost definitely certainly mostly true so like or uh another good one like the
kennedy assassination is actually pretty settled and it's been settled for decades but even people
today are still he couldn't have done it by himself even and one of my favorite this never go to
pen and tellers bullshit for anything like remotely demonstrating proof of anything because
they made it to be funny they didn't mean it to be super serious okay um but in one of the episodes
they you know they talk about one of the arguments is like that this guy couldn't have fired those
three rounds that quickly and pen jolette who you know he's like i don't think i've ever held this
gun before he fires off three rounds in less time than that and so like it that clearly isn't one of
the things that would have slowed this down right um but you know like how much harm are you doing
if you say that what who was it li harvey oswald that shot kennedy um if you say that he didn't
act alone like all right whatever you have fun talking about that but you know if your claim
is something again like vaccines are bad yeah um like then you're you're literally killing children
yeah so part of it's the fallout but like as far as like your epi epistemological integrity
um you're right i don't want to blame people who make an honest effort and do the wrong thing
even if bad stuff happens that maybe you're not bad people your bad people
if after having the alternative put before you in a friendly way and uh
you know or if you refuse to engage if you're a bad person like if you know if this is now
your sacred cow and you won't touch your uh your anti-vax beliefs because you're afraid that you
might be proven wrong because i'm just not going to read your paper you lying big pharma shill right
um like that i think speaks poorly of your integrity um you know i really wish i knew
what unit of caring would say about this the the unit of caring is my favorite tumblr by far
just an amazing tumblr always interesting and a genuinely good person that that runs it and
one of their big things is not calling people good or evil just uh evaluating situations
and saying this is a bad situation i wish it were to be better as opposed to
you know you are a bad person maybe i should send in an ask see what they have to how they
would respond to this is tumblr easy to find old stuff i don't think it is it's so if they
talked about this before you really have no way of finding it easily and yeah i think you can google
it okay cool that makes sense but you can't search within tumblr's interface because it just you
can scroll through their history and you go to the archive where it shows pictures of the post
yeah you know what as long as you can google it i don't care yeah i think that's one of the reasons
facebook is such a horrible archive because you cannot google things post on a facebook now every
every couple months every single link that i've ever put on facebook i go and i copy onto my blog
just so that i can search because i've had a number of times or a few months later like
something came up and i was like oh yeah let me link you to oh shit that was on facebook scroll
scroll ah fuck i can't find it so i've done that so i can google search the things that i have posted
on facebook nice um but anyway so this might be out there um yeah i like there's something
that i like about that i mean i like saying that people can be good people i'm not a huge
round of saying people are bad people i do think that like you can say it's unfortunate that you're
this way but that's depending on how you're saying it that's super like pretentious right um but like
the fact of the matter is that like you know the anti-vaxxer down the street we could get a lot
we could have gotten along great if they hadn't been exposed to the wrong ideas and of course
they're thinking the same thing about me you know if only this guy wasn't some brainwashed big pharma
idiot you would stop poisoning children with mercury yeah so uh but like so maybe that's part
of it you know the the specific claims that they make um you know so like if the if this i forget
the guy's name by burning man the a uh global warming denialist bro from norquist uh if he had
said um you know the temperature hasn't gone up in the last 50 years then he's lying um but if he
if that's not one of his arguments then you know then there's a discussion to be had so like an
anti-vaxxer who keeps insisting that there's mercury in vaccines even though they removed
timerosal the mercury derivative well it's it's mercury in the same way that like uh
it's the same way that salt is sodium or yeah yeah or the same way water is hydrogen yeah so um
they moved that what in the 90s and autism rates continued to go way up mainly because like the
noticing of spectrum disorders has been expanded and uh you know possibly other reasons too possibly
other reasons but i think it's largely because like you know 50 years ago the kids just slow
was the was the diagnosis right yeah well slow was basically the diagnosis right i have no idea
what it was i don't think slow was thrown on paper they wrote like literally mentally retarded if
it was that bad but like you know if the kid you know had social quirks or uh learning challenges
i think slow was the what your doctor would say even if that's not what the diagnosis was um
or at least depending on some parts of the country i don't know uh but now we've articulated more
of what slow in that context means to mean a variety of different things and so like now that we
have better understandings of them we can give them better labels and better treatment options and
stuff um if treatments options are necessary so uh that's probably the main reason i think
diagnoses have gone way up because we have a broader understanding of these conditions so
i don't have a good answer for if uh what was his name ornfeld ornstein or quest or quest yeah
i was close um i don't know if he's a bad guy or not uh i don't even know if i can say he's
honestly mistaken because he's done a lot of work right but he's done a lot of like echo
chambering but of course that's basically what i would do if i wanted to if i wanted to argue
with him i'd go to like why global warming is true and you know grab their frequently asked
questions or something right yeah so i don't know maybe we can do a subject do an episode on
honest inquiry okay i mean certainly part of that would be being open to being challenged
and being open to engage and if this guy's doing that then he's you know got two good points um
but i don't actually know if that counts because i haven't seen this guy's demeanor how he conducts
himself but like i did watch a debate between dinesh jesuza and peter singer and jesuza was the
most intellectually dishonest arguer i think i've and i i think i've ever seen because i didn't
watch the ken on ham debate okay um or excuse me the ham on nigh that's what i call it uh so i
don't call it that i read the ham on rye yeah okay that's right that's a that's a good term actually
because i couldn't bear to watch ken ham i watched it for like the first 10 minutes
and i just i generally watching theists is just a clusterfuck it was so bad i can't think of a
good example other than like if someone cringes like watching tom cruise down on a chair and
scream about stuff oh that is far more enjoyable because at least he is not obviously representing
a lot of people who are similarly insane it's like watching richard spencer get in front of a
microphone and talk about whatever nazi bullshit that he talks about or something right um or
someone more egregious than him that's how i feel watching ken ham so i couldn't i couldn't bear it
but anyway dinesh jesuza wasn't he engaged but not really he pretended to engage just for the
sake of arguing so it's it's easy to play the role of someone being honest but they're not
they're not the key and i think this is probably from less wrong isn't to do it as a show it's
and not even something you need to do in public you do it to yourself and you actually do it and you
you uh fully uh model what it would be like to be wrong well i don't think debates are good ways
to seek truth personally i mean maybe they might help the public discourse i don't know maybe they
make it worse but if you want to seek truth you do it in private uh debates i like debates
for the same reason that i like boxing matches because i like seeing people beat the shit out
of each other intellectually i'm like oh that was a damn good punch it oh man you just took
that right in the nose dude should have deflected this way and i consider it a sport it's fun to
watch but it is no way to find the truth it's just a way to see who's better at slamming their
opponent which i consider fun but yeah i haven't watched the debate in a while i need to find a
good one and get back into it because you're right that is fun yeah um that's one of the reasons
i loved hitch oh my god he could come out swinging it was eloquent yeah did you ever see any of his
intelligent square debates where he had steven fry yeah um good stuff mm-hmm that was actually one
of the reasons i followed uh before the show we talked about peasy mires a bit that was one of
the main reasons i followed him peasy mires was a great intellectual boxer mm-hmm eventually he
just like went off the rails but he could throw those punches man yeah should we go on to listen
to feedback yeah we have any quick ones okay yes we do so first thing we have to do is think our
supporters on patreon or our supporters we only think one a week we have more than one though i
promise uh so this week we would like to thank uh thank you henry tenon for uh supporting the podcast
you are great and you help bring this to all the wonderful people who listen to it
like yourself you rock yeah but you know really they should be thanking you too um
for some quick listener feedback we just did our latest episode our latest episode just went up
yesterday so don't have a lot yet but do have a couple things uh did you want to hit the first
one or should i um you go right ahead okay um google plex bite informs me that i was wrong
about georgia's taxes on intellectual property uh they are set to a percentage of the value
so no one would be able to own pervasive concepts as value of a monopoly no one would be able to
own pervasive concepts as value of a monopoly on them would be more than the revenue a company is
capable of making uh he gives some examples how for example the intellectual rights to comedy films
in the us is if they are ten billion dollars every five years a ten percent georgia's tax on the
intellectual property of comedy film would cost the holder a billion a year which is roughly equal
to the gross revenue that warner brothers takes each year so it'd be simply too expensive for
even the biggest companies in the world to own such generic intellectual property uh the intellectual
property whose value has grown large enough such as disney properties would reach the point where it
would be financially infeasible to keep holding them and the people who are holding on these ip
would only be able to cover their taxes if they're actively using them to generate a new revenue
covering it that is interesting um i i don't know a lot about georgia's taxes so apparently
i should read up on this or more likely have someone on the podcast to discuss them someday
that would be interesting sounds cool yeah i i certainly think that uh it sounds like it it
anticipated my reducto out of certain of like you know what if high fantasy is my ip and you
can't write in that universe or in any universe that has magic right what if somebody said like
nope you know magic is my domain you have to you have to give me a dollar for every page you write
that you know isn't a magic book or something so that seems like it would be handled in this framework
which is awesome i think the thing that um most jumps out at me is that where did this number
of ten billion come from like who knows how much comedy films are worth why did we assign the value
ten billion maybe comedy films done well distributed to people who know how to do them very well
it could be worth 200 billion in a year or maybe they make every year uh no he said warner brothers
has a gross revenue of one billion a year but roger brothers covers a lot of things and there's
a lot more companies than just warner brothers so who knows if it's ten billion and also maybe it's
only a one billion dollar idea like how how do you estimate ten billion that sounds like very quickly
you get into questions of this is impossible to put a number on yeah that maybe we'll have to
look more into that to get a better idea that's interesting like how do you estimate the value
of mickey mouse maybe disney can get x amount of dollars from him but if he was open to the public
and anyone could make disney stuff or mickey mouse stuff could be worth tenfold more how how
are you going to argue to disney you know what you say that mickey mouse is worth ten billion
dollars to you but it's actually worth a hundred billion in real real terms like how are you going
to argue that yeah plus like you can't just say i have an idea that's worth a billion dollars right
right um well you wouldn't want to because then you'd have to pay ten or a hundred million a year in
tax even if you're not making the billion dollars off your idea uh huh oh yeah then screw that yeah
keep your billion dollar ideas to yourself right exactly okay right on and i think we talked about
this but i will read it just in case we didn't athator says in the context of ea there's a huge
example that pops into my mind with cryptocurrencies the remittance market and the unbanked consider
that 600 billion gets transferred from migrant workers to support their families in their home
country each year many transfer operators take exorbitant fees for transfer up to 20 percent
allowing people to use um cryptocurrencies for transferring rather than going to these
organizations is basically a direct money transfer to the poorest individuals who need it
and direct money transfers are considered an effect uh ea thing that all sounds great but
i don't i'm curious where those numbers come from 600 billion dollars are moved from migrant
workers to back to the families over a year that is linked to uh wikipedia article on remittance
seems reasonable across the entire world that's just a lot i was just surprised um okay cool
and maybe some places charge more i was thinking like western union or like your bank will charge
you like 40 bucks to do an international wire of however much you want right so uh it's not a percent
cut to i when i was it depends on where what you're using that's true maybe going across well no i did
one international wire and worked at the bank i don't think it was a percent but maybe that was
just the credit union i worked at also both of them had bank accounts right oh yeah yeah lots of
times you don't have a bank account on this side where you're sending it from they don't have a bank
account on that side where they're getting it from either oh i wouldn't even know how you would
move money in that case no wonder it's no wonder someone could charge some crazy fee for that yeah
exactly yeah my bad i shouldn't have quite i shouldn't have uh well no i'm glad i was skeptical
yeah sticking to my guns damn straight thanks for thanks for uh backing yourself up though who was
the commenter etheter nice yeah says that this this basically could increase uh is the equivalent
of a net donation to the poorest families in the world by billions per year through the use of
cryptocurrency that's super awesome and if uh uh rice wasn't aware of that figure he definitely
needs to be made aware of it because that sounds like the kind of thing he should be pointing out
yeah we'll tell him uh also um consider he says etheter consider that there are still over two
billion people on this planet who do not have a bank account imagine the wealth transfer to
those individuals who are probably living in a barter economy uh if they have increasingly
gained access to the internet and they can utilize global currency like bitcoin i wonder how you
cash out your bitcoin in the third world because you can't probably groceries with it you maybe you
could if people start accepting it if everyone else else in your village is like yeah sure i'll take
bitcoin okay i mean it's a fiat currency that's all you need to do is get everyone on board with
accepting it well as long as there's an adoption rate that's i'm saying yeah yeah yeah cool that's
awesome i mean certainly you know if it's a barter thing where you know i want to buy stuff from you
i can give you bitcoin so certainly like you know you don't have to like go to put a down payment on
something with bitcoin or whatever if you're just doing between people that's exactly the kind of
circumstance that i think it works great for and you don't have to be banking fees you don't have to
deal with a lot of banks where if you don't have a minimum down payment or a amount that you direct
deposit every month they charge you money there's all sorts of late fees and other things that a lot
of people get trapped into not late fees but overdraft fees yeah all these things that could
be avoid with direct transfers via bitcoin uh i think that's everything i think that's everything
we've got to give a big shout out to uh kyle more our sound editor who makes everything awesome
yeah um we have uh subreddit the bayesian conspiracy uh the bayesian conspiracy podcast
at gmail.com and the bayesianconspiracy.com yes and uh itunes reviews are always awesome itunes
reviews help us quite a lot they help get this word out to other people you can even just leave
a reviewed rating without having to write one it doesn't it doesn't make it obvious that you can
save and leave at that point but i think you can okay so keep that in mind cool um at least you
can do that in the app store i'm not sure if you can do that on the podcast or not yeah so yeah
anyway thanks for listening yeah we'll see you all in two weeks cool bye bye
