zing um super zing so all right this is getting a little far field but yeah i have a good
shit now now someone's gonna feel bad about me describing ugly dicks all dicks are beautiful
hashtag all dicks new text message noise for enyosh i'm gonna cut that sound bite um so where
were we um oh yes uh the response to outrage and so i think i felt some of the i never felt
inclined maybe to vote for trump but i did see where they were coming from in that like you
guys are being dicks and you know i'm on the left your your left of center i think uh i think i
know i just don't want to out you as a liberal sorry i admit the shame of being a liberal yes
but even i can be like a gas that some of my my compatriots behavior right and so
you know it's it's my social circle that i see sharing the memes of like set these strangers
on fire right yeah if you're the person that they say that they want to set on fire yeah you're
gonna feel inclined to respond to that pretty viscerally and so i can totally see where this
happened and then you throw in some awesome propaganda machines and uh some other manipulations
that probably happened and things got really bad really fast and it really disgusts me because
these i mean the corporations live in this system too they are seeing it go down they
they are like the uh i don't know the animals that start eating themselves because there's
it's just the incentive our line it's it's literally malachian the incentives are aligned
to destroy the world around you and you are watching it burn and you know you're dying too
but the incentives are still there generate outrage get that engagement rating or else the
whole thing is or else you're going out of business that's it right so it's it doesn't
have to be unfortunately this fits great for someone who wants to use this for a bad purposes
because it's a great uh machination for bad purposes like google and facebook both have a lot
of money that they send into various altruistic and research causes they care about the world
and yet this is driving them to burn down the society we live oh for sure so i'm saying that
there are the somewhat benevolent people like mark zuckerberg and google i'm sure i don't know a lot
about zuckerberg but i get the impression he's somewhat chill i've seen headlines for him wanting
to be for uh minimum basic income and stuff like that so how bad can he be right um someone's gonna
write in and say here's the 50 reasons he's bad click here to find out um by the way he mergers
children right but anyway um they can be you know whether fully nice or awesome or just like
indifferent to their the outcome of whatever but the system also works great for deliberate
misuse so uh you know if you want to write a twitter bot that um will share i don't like the
vernacular of like fake news yeah um but they share literally false articles of look at the um
it's almost as if you were an enemy of the us you have this ready-made system that all you have
to do is interject a few things into and it runs for you yeah and so luckily our system has got this
weird enough uh um our system already has these lost aligned lost purposes with uh what we want out
of the system like we want the news we don't want to be you know mind fucked until we're you know
engaged for three hours right so that works great if you want to inject in some bullshit and uh
just stir this pot because the pot's already pretty messed up right yeah anyway i was thinking
specifically of russian twitter bots because reading about those lately and you know they don't
have to be based out of russia but some of them are which is pretty uh awesome if you're into that
sort of thing if you're into espionage and uh you know cool stuff like that if you're into not dying
it's sort of terrifying i'm actually kind of thankful to russia now because when i see these
sorts of things that are obviously just meant to piss off people like i recently saw one about
people sitting down uh for the anthem playing in their home while they're like watching football
on the on the tv which basically everyone does you know does anyone ever stood for the anthem at
their house while they're watching football like apparently i heard someone who had a friend of a
friend whose parents did that or something but no you don't stand up when you're watching football
in your house are you kidding me it's it's no i've never seen anyone do that uh but there was this
picture of like this is you when the anthem plays every sunday while you're watching the game
and then below it is like captain america this is you when someone kneels at the national anthem
acting like you're the biggest damn patriot in the world and for a long time i i just didn't
understand what the fuck they were talking about i eventually figured out that it was supposed to
be a diss on the people who are saying people shouldn't yielding the anthem which i mean it
was just confusingly done especially because captain america is a liberal it's you you are
really mixing up your messages here but captain america is a patriot sir he's neither liberal
nor conservative i'm not sure i'm not sure what he is depends on what what captain america you're
looking at the the marvel universe captain so like i'm the current the mcu one i mean
probably ish i mean he's liberal dude well he also you didn't see civil war did you i did not see
civil war he's much he's likely less liberal i guess it depends on who your definition of liberal
and your definition of authoritarianism and whatever yeah uh he doesn't want to sign the
paperwork that says all right this government body can tell the avengers what to do right so which um
first i don't know i would just trust a small government you know yeah i mean so that sounds
pretty conservative to me oh really because i can i think conservatives would be the the one who'd
be more like along the lines of oh i see now now it's up for debate yeah and i'm sure that i'm
probably wrong i bet i mean i don't know i think it is a good debate to to be had and i'm having it
specifically to be kind of trolley i don't really uh well i mean because it's specifically
after what happened in winter soldier where he realized that he couldn't trust uh certain authorities
well it was more just like we should be in charge of ourselves because we know what we're doing even
though we fuck up sometimes you know we don't want like what if they tell us not to do something we
feel like we should yeah and uh the other side of that was this is really not relevant but the other
side of that was tony stark was dealing with the guilt of having made ultron and uh having a
high body count on his shoulders so he was like no i want to push the responsibility off on to
somebody else you know then that way if we go do stuff and fuck up at least it's their fault not
ours um anyway fun movie should check it out uh so regardless of whether captain america is liberal
or not the the the meme was posted entirely just to infuriate people on the other side that would
see it and the people who would be sharing it is everyone who saw that is like on the liberal side
who wants to fight they're like yeah they repost it on their timeline and like maybe they're two or
three uh more right-leaning friends would see it and get pissed off and that's how the fucking thing
spreads and creates hate even though it's stupid and poorly done and everything about annoyed me
anyways uh now that the russians are in things i can say people hey you are on the side of the
russians you are helping to destroy our culture they probably made this meme themselves and and
the fact that the russians are involved now is i don't know i kind of think it's like a thing to
get people to stop and take a step back and say am i being manipulated by an enemy who wants to see
me die for some people i heard people pre-election saying you know i saw some stuff on the news about
like you know they'd interview people in russia like on the ground and just say you know what
would you think what happened to hillary became president oh i think should start world war three
and they're using that as a motive or as a uh bottom as a like you know they they basically
i'm gonna vote republican what reasons can i put above it they were bottom lining that decision to
vote but they're using that as ammunition against uh voting for hillary clinton um because look at
how the russians would feel about it uh you know we're already getting that and uh i don't know if
i could find this number again so i'm probably wrong on the specifics but something like in the
early 2000s the number of or the percentage of favorable opinions on russia on on the uh
conservative party members was something like 10 percent wait like 10 percent of republicans
15 years ago felt favorable about russia okay now that number is at like 35 oh so instead of jumping
back and saying our enemy is pushing this way it's like oh our enemy agrees with us they must not be
so bad so it's going both ways and i think it's going more the other way instead of instead of
people saying holy shit the enemies has the same position i do i should revaluate my position it's
like oh my anyways my enemy has the same position i do they must not be so bad after all okay i think
is the way that it's going well that's disappointing yeah so it would have been great if it worked
out the other way right yeah but uh man all we need to do is for like isis to come on endorse
trump and somebody maybe that will wake people up a little bit but i was i don't know i think
i'm still gonna try and see what results i get i haven't actually done it yet but i'm gonna
next time i see something obviously just meant as outrage bait post how are you how sure are you
that you're not working for the russians to bring down our society by sharing this and see oh that's
just fake news are you shitting me you're one of those libtards that's the that's the feedback you
might receive okay i don't think they would use the term libtards probably not because i would
be generally only talking to liberals and you're probably talking to people and oh okay i see um
then yeah they then they probably won't be using the phrase fake news either yeah um yeah uh i mean
that's that's an aspect of this malachian nightmare that's sort of there right so you see something
like yellowstone's going to explode in the headline and then it's like oh geologists aren't worried
i didn't read the whole article so i'm not sure what the specifics were maybe they rounded their
estimate down from you know 250 million years 240 million years right um so i'm happy that's
hypothetical i'm not sure what the article actually said but the point is that like the fake news
article of you know the things about to explode got clicks they got a really smart guy to click it
because it sounds like serious news but it's not so that's not i think the common usage of the
phrase fake news but it's the only one i'm willing to get behind um the alternative is just like
lying and there's no reason to you know dress it up with other fancy words um you know so if you're
saying oh yeah when it's impossible for me not to think of political related examples because that's
where this uh terminology really sprung from in the last few months so i don't know if it's going to
bring us back to the politics stuff but uh trump tweeted last week that the president of well i don't
think he's the president uh other people have been saying the president of Puerto Rico um and in fact
this was on uh i don't i'm not on the subreddit the donald but i'm on subreddits that make fun of
that subreddit and someone shared one of their top posts for like the day it was and it got thousands
of upvotes about like the president of Puerto Rico is being a fucking idiot oh shit and people on
you know subreddits like resist and that sort of thing uh we're like yeah the president of Puerto
Rico is a fucking idiot the president of Puerto Rico is donald trump um so they meant like the
governor or whatever who's that guy i don't know what his office is and i sound like an idiot um
anyway yeah this i feel like this is not the best example to make to not scare people away
even if it's reality it's whatever you want to just skip it then yeah let's well uh he said something
along the lines of how i forget the guy's name the the leader of Puerto Rico that's not trump uh was
we were gonna we got along great till the dems got to him and turned him against us now he's saying
all these things and it's like no he was pissed the entire time because you guys's response was
terrible like they were being hurricaneed and uh you know you were playing golf and you dedicated
the trophy to them even though you didn't win um so like you know weird shit like that wait he didn't
get the trophy i have heard actually mixed things about that need to verify because you're right
speaking of you know people sharing outrage that's a that's a great thing to make it sound more
outrageous i know i did i know he in in his response he played golf for a week and then
dedicated the trophy to the people of Puerto Rico and then traveled there and threw paper towels at
them um you saw that video of him throwing paper towels people right i did see the video i thought
that the people were exaggerating oh it was ridiculous well i i also saw a meme were the last
three presidents bush uh obama and the bush before that was it bush before that uh clinton
was it clinton okay but all three of them like after major disasters hugging people in the disaster
area right and then trump in the back throwing paper towels and and my response to the meme was
now the real question is is this meme ableist because supposedly donald trump may have germophobia
sort of thing and doesn't like touching people and so are we making fun of a disabled person
who is unable to touch humans we're making fun of a disabled person for sure
sick burn um that might be unfair to disabled people i'm sorry yeah i wouldn't want to
wouldn't want to put anyone in the same camp no it sounds like i'm being super unreasonably hard
on trump i'm willing to uh like defend a lot of my criticism here and yes i'm being hyperbolic
by saying he's mentally disabled um there's some speculation that he might be having cognitive
deterioration but now we're getting way too far yeah so yeah uh are they being ableist who knows
right uh you know i do wonder even if that's your thing you don't like just lob paper towels at
people no well i mean i mainly post that comment to troll oh i know but but what i i mean so i'm
just saying even if we took that you know as much as we could that's not the best response no matter
what right yeah unless they unless someone spilled a glass then you toss them up some paper towels
that's the only circumstance in which case it's okay to toss something at somebody like a dog
yeah i mean you can hand them the paper towel yeah without even touching them yeah all right let's
let's tie this back to uh social media stuff yes okay i'm gonna grab tristan harris's article here
um we'll link to tristan harris's article how technology hijacks people's mind
excuse me how technology hijacks people's minds from a magician and a google design ethicist
so that was his position at google was google design ethicist which is a fun position to have
and only the and i think it was also like and ux philosopher or something um which the only kind
of job title you could have at a place like google um no one else hires philosophers they're 10
companies but anyway uh he talks about the various exploits that they use and he kind of takes them
you know like how james randy dissects bullshit from his magician's background um he talks about
the the kinds of things magicians do to grab your attention and how uh these tie into the things
that social media does and some of them get less magicianity as you go down the line but the first
and foremost is if you control them hijack number one if you control the menu you control the choices
yeah so like this is one of the reasons that i didn't like facebook is that there's no downvote
button or any way to disagree without studying an argument although i mean downvoting might be
seen as an argument because your name is attached to your likes right so if you like my picture
i see that you like to i don't see that has a like right um so you can't even downvote without uh
you know opening the discussion for argument but the idea that uh what you presented with
really limits your options um oh god the facebook in general is just absolutely horrible i strongly
recommend to everyone to get facebook purity which is actually called fluff buster purity
because facebook did not like them using their name uh but yeah if you go to fb purity i think
you can highly optimize your facebook browsing experience get rid of almost all the ads and
get rid of that annoying background color that people can do on their posts that makes it so
it's much harder to tell ads from actual posts uh it's i wonder if that was deliberate i that's
because then you spend more time looking at ads because you think i wonder if this is some friends
colored pose yeah huh that that was my assumption the day that they rolled it out i was like oh i see
what they're doing fuck them yeah that is what actually caused me to finally get facebook purity
was that and i should have done it much much earlier than that unfortunately i don't think
there's a option for phones but i don't have facebook on my phone anyway because i do not
need to have heroin around me all the time i want to at least only have the access to it when i'm
sitting down yeah the uh but definitely get that facebook will not even allow you to share it on
facebook if you try to share a link to it they say oh it looks like you're trying to link to uh
malicious content awesome we will we will help flee avoid you you know poisoning your friends
feeds with this you're welcome you're like yeah fuck you facebook that's hilarious uh so it gets
rid of ads and gets rid of some of the other stuff that makes it hard to tell ads from content
yeah lets you optimize a lot of what you're doing with your on facebook with your feed and so forth
right on i think i also i'm not sure if it's part of my youtube plugin that i have on chrome or if
it's uh part of if you can go into the features or in the settings on your regular youtube but you
can disable autoplay yes i do that uh instantly with every single service that has an autoplay the
first thing i do as soon as i know is there's an autoplay is go and turn that off because
fuck that bullshit i only i will tell you when i want to see more i like leave it on a netflix
because i tend to binge netflix okay um the only other time actually this would have been a good
excuse to leave it on if i could leave but you can just click yes it'll play the next one the
difference though is that on my xbox the remote goes off after 20 minutes and the average episode
is like 21 minutes and 30 seconds right so then you gotta spend 15 seconds turning the remote
back on yeah well even it's just five but then it's just there for 20 more minutes and burns
