anti-vaxxer who keeps insisting that there's mercury in vaccines even though they removed
timerosal the mercury derivative well it's it's mercury in the same way that like uh
it's the same way that salt is sodium or yeah yeah or the same way water is hydrogen yeah so um
they moved that what in the 90s and autism rates continued to go way up mainly because like the
noticing of spectrum disorders has been expanded and uh you know possibly other reasons too possibly
other reasons but i think it's largely because like you know 50 years ago the kids just slow
was the was the diagnosis right yeah well slow was basically the diagnosis right i have no idea
what it was i don't think slow was thrown on paper they wrote like literally mentally retarded if
it was that bad but like you know if the kid you know had social quirks or uh learning challenges
i think slow was the what your doctor would say even if that's not what the diagnosis was um
or at least depending on some parts of the country i don't know uh but now we've articulated more
of what slow in that context means to mean a variety of different things and so like now that we
have better understandings of them we can give them better labels and better treatment options and
stuff um if treatments options are necessary so uh that's probably the main reason i think
diagnoses have gone way up because we have a broader understanding of these conditions so
i don't have a good answer for if uh what was his name ornfeld ornstein or quest or quest yeah
i was close um i don't know if he's a bad guy or not uh i don't even know if i can say he's
honestly mistaken because he's done a lot of work right but he's done a lot of like echo
chambering but of course that's basically what i would do if i wanted to if i wanted to argue
with him i'd go to like why global warming is true and you know grab their frequently asked
questions or something right yeah so i don't know maybe we can do a subject do an episode on
honest inquiry okay i mean certainly part of that would be being open to being challenged
and being open to engage and if this guy's doing that then he's you know got two good points um
but i don't actually know if that counts because i haven't seen this guy's demeanor how he conducts
himself but like i did watch a debate between dinesh jesuza and peter singer and jesuza was the
most intellectually dishonest arguer i think i've and i i think i've ever seen because i didn't
watch the ken on ham debate okay um or excuse me the ham on nigh that's what i call it uh so i
don't call it that i read the ham on rye yeah okay that's right that's a that's a good term actually
because i couldn't bear to watch ken ham i watched it for like the first 10 minutes
and i just i generally watching theists is just a clusterfuck it was so bad i can't think of a
good example other than like if someone cringes like watching tom cruise down on a chair and
scream about stuff oh that is far more enjoyable because at least he is not obviously representing
a lot of people who are similarly insane it's like watching richard spencer get in front of a
microphone and talk about whatever nazi bullshit that he talks about or something right um or
someone more egregious than him that's how i feel watching ken ham so i couldn't i couldn't bear it
but anyway dinesh jesuza wasn't he engaged but not really he pretended to engage just for the
sake of arguing so it's it's easy to play the role of someone being honest but they're not
they're not the key and i think this is probably from less wrong isn't to do it as a show it's
and not even something you need to do in public you do it to yourself and you actually do it and you
you uh fully uh model what it would be like to be wrong well i don't think debates are good ways
to seek truth personally i mean maybe they might help the public discourse i don't know maybe they
make it worse but if you want to seek truth you do it in private uh debates i like debates
for the same reason that i like boxing matches because i like seeing people beat the shit out
of each other intellectually i'm like oh that was a damn good punch it oh man you just took
that right in the nose dude should have deflected this way and i consider it a sport it's fun to
watch but it is no way to find the truth it's just a way to see who's better at slamming their
opponent which i consider fun but yeah i haven't watched the debate in a while i need to find a
good one and get back into it because you're right that is fun yeah um that's one of the reasons
i loved hitch oh my god he could come out swinging it was eloquent yeah did you ever see any of his
intelligent square debates where he had steven fry yeah um good stuff mm-hmm that was actually one
of the reasons i followed uh before the show we talked about peasy mires a bit that was one of
the main reasons i followed him peasy mires was a great intellectual boxer mm-hmm eventually he
just like went off the rails but he could throw those punches man yeah should we go on to listen
to feedback yeah we have any quick ones okay yes we do so first thing we have to do is think our
supporters on patreon or our supporters we only think one a week we have more than one though i
promise uh so this week we would like to thank uh thank you henry tenon for uh supporting the podcast
you are great and you help bring this to all the wonderful people who listen to it
like yourself you rock yeah but you know really they should be thanking you too um
for some quick listener feedback we just did our latest episode our latest episode just went up
yesterday so don't have a lot yet but do have a couple things uh did you want to hit the first
one or should i um you go right ahead okay um google plex bite informs me that i was wrong
about georgia's taxes on intellectual property uh they are set to a percentage of the value
so no one would be able to own pervasive concepts as value of a monopoly no one would be able to
own pervasive concepts as value of a monopoly on them would be more than the revenue a company is
capable of making uh he gives some examples how for example the intellectual rights to comedy films
in the us is if they are ten billion dollars every five years a ten percent georgia's tax on the
intellectual property of comedy film would cost the holder a billion a year which is roughly equal
to the gross revenue that warner brothers takes each year so it'd be simply too expensive for
even the biggest companies in the world to own such generic intellectual property uh the intellectual
property whose value has grown large enough such as disney properties would reach the point where it
would be financially infeasible to keep holding them and the people who are holding on these ip
would only be able to cover their taxes if they're actively using them to generate a new revenue
covering it that is interesting um i i don't know a lot about georgia's taxes so apparently
i should read up on this or more likely have someone on the podcast to discuss them someday
that would be interesting sounds cool yeah i i certainly think that uh it sounds like it it
anticipated my reducto out of certain of like you know what if high fantasy is my ip and you
can't write in that universe or in any universe that has magic right what if somebody said like
nope you know magic is my domain you have to you have to give me a dollar for every page you write
that you know isn't a magic book or something so that seems like it would be handled in this framework
which is awesome i think the thing that um most jumps out at me is that where did this number
of ten billion come from like who knows how much comedy films are worth why did we assign the value
ten billion maybe comedy films done well distributed to people who know how to do them very well
it could be worth 200 billion in a year or maybe they make every year uh no he said warner brothers
has a gross revenue of one billion a year but roger brothers covers a lot of things and there's
a lot more companies than just warner brothers so who knows if it's ten billion and also maybe it's
only a one billion dollar idea like how how do you estimate ten billion that sounds like very quickly
you get into questions of this is impossible to put a number on yeah that maybe we'll have to
look more into that to get a better idea that's interesting like how do you estimate the value
of mickey mouse maybe disney can get x amount of dollars from him but if he was open to the public
and anyone could make disney stuff or mickey mouse stuff could be worth tenfold more how how
are you going to argue to disney you know what you say that mickey mouse is worth ten billion
dollars to you but it's actually worth a hundred billion in real real terms like how are you going
to argue that yeah plus like you can't just say i have an idea that's worth a billion dollars right
right um well you wouldn't want to because then you'd have to pay ten or a hundred million a year in
tax even if you're not making the billion dollars off your idea uh huh oh yeah then screw that yeah
keep your billion dollar ideas to yourself right exactly okay right on and i think we talked about
this but i will read it just in case we didn't athator says in the context of ea there's a huge
example that pops into my mind with cryptocurrencies the remittance market and the unbanked consider
that 600 billion gets transferred from migrant workers to support their families in their home
country each year many transfer operators take exorbitant fees for transfer up to 20 percent
allowing people to use um cryptocurrencies for transferring rather than going to these
organizations is basically a direct money transfer to the poorest individuals who need it
and direct money transfers are considered an effect uh ea thing that all sounds great but
i don't i'm curious where those numbers come from 600 billion dollars are moved from migrant
workers to back to the families over a year that is linked to uh wikipedia article on remittance
seems reasonable across the entire world that's just a lot i was just surprised um okay cool
and maybe some places charge more i was thinking like western union or like your bank will charge
you like 40 bucks to do an international wire of however much you want right so uh it's not a percent
cut to i when i was it depends on where what you're using that's true maybe going across well no i did
one international wire and worked at the bank i don't think it was a percent but maybe that was
just the credit union i worked at also both of them had bank accounts right oh yeah yeah lots of
times you don't have a bank account on this side where you're sending it from they don't have a bank
account on that side where they're getting it from either oh i wouldn't even know how you would
move money in that case no wonder it's no wonder someone could charge some crazy fee for that yeah
exactly yeah my bad i shouldn't have quite i shouldn't have uh well no i'm glad i was skeptical
yeah sticking to my guns damn straight thanks for thanks for uh backing yourself up though who was
the commenter etheter nice yeah says that this this basically could increase uh is the equivalent
of a net donation to the poorest families in the world by billions per year through the use of
cryptocurrency that's super awesome and if uh uh rice wasn't aware of that figure he definitely
needs to be made aware of it because that sounds like the kind of thing he should be pointing out
yeah we'll tell him uh also um consider he says etheter consider that there are still over two
billion people on this planet who do not have a bank account imagine the wealth transfer to
those individuals who are probably living in a barter economy uh if they have increasingly
gained access to the internet and they can utilize global currency like bitcoin i wonder how you
cash out your bitcoin in the third world because you can't probably groceries with it you maybe you
could if people start accepting it if everyone else else in your village is like yeah sure i'll take
bitcoin okay i mean it's a fiat currency that's all you need to do is get everyone on board with
accepting it well as long as there's an adoption rate that's i'm saying yeah yeah yeah cool that's
awesome i mean certainly you know if it's a barter thing where you know i want to buy stuff from you
i can give you bitcoin so certainly like you know you don't have to like go to put a down payment on
something with bitcoin or whatever if you're just doing between people that's exactly the kind of
circumstance that i think it works great for and you don't have to be banking fees you don't have to
deal with a lot of banks where if you don't have a minimum down payment or a amount that you direct
deposit every month they charge you money there's all sorts of late fees and other things that a lot
of people get trapped into not late fees but overdraft fees yeah all these things that could
be avoid with direct transfers via bitcoin uh i think that's everything i think that's everything
we've got to give a big shout out to uh kyle more our sound editor who makes everything awesome
yeah um we have uh subreddit the bayesian conspiracy uh the bayesian conspiracy podcast
at gmail.com and the bayesianconspiracy.com yes and uh itunes reviews are always awesome itunes
reviews help us quite a lot they help get this word out to other people you can even just leave
a reviewed rating without having to write one it doesn't it doesn't make it obvious that you can
save and leave at that point but i think you can okay so keep that in mind cool um at least you
can do that in the app store i'm not sure if you can do that on the podcast or not yeah so yeah
anyway thanks for listening yeah we'll see you all in two weeks cool bye bye
