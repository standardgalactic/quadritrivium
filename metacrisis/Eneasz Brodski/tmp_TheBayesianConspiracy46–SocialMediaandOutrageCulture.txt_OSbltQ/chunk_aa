Welcome to the Basin Conspiracy. I'm Minyash Brotsky. And I'm Stephen Zuber. And today
it's just the two of us. Today is just the two of us because we couldn't get a guest
and are recording shortly after our last recording. So we've been falling behind schedule lately
where some of you may have noticed some of our episodes are you know a few hours maybe
a day late. And we were just like, yeah, we really got to get on it. So this one is almost
back to back with the previous one in recording. So this should fix that problem will never
be late again. That's our promise to you. Wait, no, I do not make promises that I don't know
for sure I can keep like that. We'll try really hard not to be late again. Okay, all right.
Yeah. So what we are talking about today is a bit of a hobby horse of mine is hobby horse
right term. I've heard it in the terms of like political hobby horse like this is like the
one like maybe it's like single issue voters or something. This is like the one thing you
care about. Okay. So what is your interested thing that you wanted to talk about my interested
thing is who it is an aspect of Malik and we have referred to Malik before on this podcast and
we should probably explain very briefly what Malik is comes from a post by Scott Alexander
Meditations on Malik where he explains the concept. But in to boil it down and simplified
bit. Malik is incentive systems that push people towards bad optima. It is the sort of racing
towards the bottom the always cutting more and more to get more efficient. I guess the the
transhumanist version of Malik is you see it sometimes in science fiction is we are in a
situation where all our resources are strained simply for survival really inhospitable planet
or war with an alien race or maybe just war amongst each other on earth. And we have to give
up things we love in order to not die. And so you first you strip out things like art because we
don't have any money to spend on art. But since we're transhumanists eventually we start doing
things like stripping out our need for leisure because we must spend all our time working and
being efficient. And then we strip out things like our need to connect with other people and have
meaningful emotional relationships because those take away from being productive until
eventually you don't really have humans anymore you just have these constant producers and consumers
that are working in an economy in order to like have more stuff or be better at warfare or not
get killed by their environment but it doesn't really matter anymore because there's nothing human
left there's just production optimizers. So two quick things one you made it sound like to somebody
who wasn't familiar Scott Alexander didn't invent the idea of Malik this goes way back in the way
that we use it. Yes. But yeah the Malik figure of like I run on sacrifices kind of has been there
forever. One of his earlier examples of this which I really liked was the two income trap where
before only men could work and that was horrible for women. Yes. But once women entered into the
workforce then now you could have families where both people in the family worked and instead of
households having twice the income and twice the leisure and twice the fun. Now just all the prices
went up primarily for housing near good schools. And so now if you want your children to not be in
a shitty neighborhood you both have to work all the time never see your children in order by really
expensive housing near the best schools where they won't get shot and will get taught things correctly
and really everyone's back in the same position they were before except now everyone works more
and the children don't get to see either parent. I think another good example of Malik gone wild
is Hanson's age of M right. That's kind of like what your allude if you followed your track further
down you're like instead of just being shut down humans you just have productive workers running
a million you know times the speed to get all the stuff done and you strip all the things that they
would want to do otherwise and reset them every day and all that weird shit so good or bad I think
is not really Hanson's point he's just speculating but yeah that's certainly I think a good example
of Malik gone nuts. So what specifically are we talking about with today's Malik? Today I am
talking about media in general and social media more specifically because the way we do internet
is kind of fucked in that it is driven entirely almost entirely by ad revenue. Television cable
news networks have had a similar thing happen which means that the most important thing is to get
eyeballs. You want to engage people's attention and there is actually a metric now which I believe
Tristan was it? Tristan Tristan Harris. Tristan Harris has been talking about and there I've
been a number of articles that came out recently about by people who used to work for Google people
who used to work for Facebook the guy who invented the like button for Facebook has jumped on this
as well and is really regretful about what he has done with his life in the past but the there is
now metrics called engagement which measure how long a user stays on a site and how much they
engage with the content and the the race for all these companies who are in competition with each
other for our attention is to get as much of your attention as they can and they are relentlessly
greedy if they could keep you up 24 hours a day and do nothing but looking at their feed all the time
they would because that is how they get revenue that is their incentive the better the more
engagement the better and and there are a lot of things that go into doing this there is the
when you scroll down the endless feed thing you don't like get to a bottom and click on next page
it just keeps scrolling forever the there was one person who was talking about how he invented the
like on your gmail you swipe down to refresh instead of having like a refresh button
that was because when he was making an app it reloads when you pull down the refresh
and it does like the little whirling thing at the top and that is like watching the slot machine
roll yes and like it's even the pull down action like you're pulling down the slot machine arm
and he said that like at the time it was a technical constraint because he didn't have
room on the screen for a reload button so he used that but nowadays you can things can reload
constantly like several times per second without a problem and yet they keep that feature in because
it gives you that little rush of dopamine the am i going to get something new or am i not
the on your notifications the little red dot that's you know there's new things they
used to be blue they turned it to red because it gets attention and the little red dot you
never know what it's going to be is it going to be just uh you know more ads or something or is
it actually going to be cool content is it going to be likes and people are responding to your stuff
it is this constant variable reward which has been shown to be one of the best ways to train
people to want to do something over and over when the reward is not uh not you can't predict it
completely the the sporadic intermittent reward yes yeah um so like uh bf skinner the 1900 psychologist
he had those pigeons that he trained to do really weird things by doing that it's like they got like
to be superstitious like they would do quick three left turns and like then a pellet would fall
or like so they basically and they would fall randomly but the pigeons develop their own
weird superstitions about how to get it to work and so they would think well you know
it happened to have the last time i turned left and i'll keep turning left and we'll keep coming back
and you know then it does and then we'll still keep doing it um so uh two quick things one so on
the train right home as i mentioned already oh before we started recording i wrote home with
one of the other uh senior developers and uh he pulled up his google news and one of the first
things that was on his feed was like yellowstone is showing volcanic activity two hours ago and
he's like he read the headline he's like well shit and he clicks it and he skims through and
he's reading it and the last line was geologists aren't very concerned um and i'm like was this
like buzz feed or whatever and then he found it uh i think on uh it wasn't the new york post it was
some actual reputable web reputable website also posted the same article um but the the headline
got him in and because you know hey the headlines basically you and everybody know is going to die
yeah so uh you know how long do you have click here to find out um at the bottom just the
normal amount of volcanic activity for yellowstone well and i don't know if this is the article
or not but i'm not a geologist but if i had correct me if i'm wrong but i'm pretty sure a
little light activity is probably good news because then you you know you release the stress
before it gets big and that's what we want we wanted to stay you know nice and mostly chill
so just an example of that kind of grab your attention thing um the only thing the only thing
that this didn't have in that recipe was it didn't show up on his lock screen on his phone
you know he had to open his news feed for it to be the first thing there yeah but
the other thing was that you mentioned if they could keep you at your you know staring at your
keyboard until you you know for 24 hours a day they would they isn't necessarily like evil
mustache twirling uh people who are capitalizing on this revenue right yeah in fact right now with
facebook it's just a black box ai that wants to keep you on facebook right um so like yeah
someone's still making money on the ad revenue yeah but this this didn't happen by somebody
saying all right let's be as manipulative as possible let's keep them in let's keep them
engaged let's uh right do whatever it takes it was just a malachian race to the bottom
that nobody had to make the decision to make this happen yeah they they need ad revenue to
stay alive they introduce something which helps get them a little more attention and then every
competitor in the marketplace has to either copy them and start doing these addictive things as
well or be competed out of existence and go bankrupt and it keeps going it's why they have the
fucking autoplay uh on things that as soon as you scroll it starts playing or if you end a video
the next one will start playing after five seconds yes because they want you to stay on there and
it's it's because you get what you measure what they measure is engagement how many clicks how
long are you on site and so that is what you measure that is what you optimize for you keep
finding ways to increase that and increase that even though you're not doing it with any evil
intent it is your measure and you're maximizing your measure right and now now that it's the
the name of the game it can be done the evil intent if someone you know wants to get their
stuff done this isn't this isn't an evil intent example and i might have mentioned this before
but did i ever mention like diablo three i think you have i think twice actually okay so forget it
some people some people have died playing this game because it's really addictive and they've
calculated it to be like almost perfectly addicting and that you get rewarded just often enough to
keep engaged you know your buff wears down and then it's like 30 seconds before you see the next
thing oh wait double experience for two minutes i gotta keep going so uh while i was never enough
into it to you know miss uh yeah to die i probably did hold my bladder or something playing right
because you're you're stucked in so um so all that all that is pretty bad i mean that's also how
you get the fucking click bait headlines like 21 things that something number four will shock you
or number six made me cry crap like that yeah i now have a policy of never clicking on anything
that has number x will make you why number x will make you why like or in general listicles are just
bad things that i avoid but listicles i like that word yeah it's not new to me i read it somewhere
but especially things that have at the end number x will make you why i'm like fuck you not clicking
through yeah that and if the headline is the form of a question i think the answer is always no
yes and there's there's a law of journalism which i don't remember what it is now but yeah yeah
something like that um there's a separate that i like called saved you a click okay and it'll give
you like the bullshit headline like what happens to this actress and like then they'll put a bar
and then they'll be like you know nothing or like whatever this actress looks so different it won't
believe it and it's like she looks like you would expect her to look 20 years later 67 clicks for
them to get and so they'll put in parentheses how many clicks took them to get to the answer
holy crap and often it's one or two but sometimes it's dozens where you so that's the other thing
that you'll see on some pages i don't go to the like most of these websites i saw links through
from facebook and i haven't been on facebook that much lately but partly because of some of the
perverse things i that will probably get into but yeah you'll go to the page and it'll have
whatever 10 bullshit things they're not on a one page you click the next button to get to the next
number two number three and then they get all new ads in your face and you know most almost nobody
clicks these things but people still want to pay to be seen there so it's still money making even
if there isn't that much money going back into the advertisers pocket so the this whole thing by
itself is already really annoying and it is bringing down all of the discourse because all of it
happens is now something that has to shock you and get your attention and keep you in right
but the really bad part about it and the thing
i consider this aside from existential issues like artificial intelligence or or genetic altering
i consider this the most important issue of the day today the most important thing that
happens in modern life short of actual existential issues like nuclear war or ai development the fact
that there is a strong incentive to turn people against each other to generate outrage because
if you see something that pisses you off you tend to engage immediately and so there is this
incentive now for uh for the spreading of memes and and other ideas which is fracturing society
because people will jump onto one side or another and they're very divisive and just there to get
you riled up i think the most i shouldn't i don't think i should comment on the most recent thing i
thought it just a outrage generating shin machine oh yeah well and that's the thing too is part of
you know the the machine gets kick started with that article but then we'll do the rest by uh
having these weird competitions to see you can be the most loudly outraged yeah you can't be like
well well well let's draw the line of violence like are you shitting me here with them we talked
about that with the whole nazi thing we did right so it happened also with the the google memo thing
yeah where uh was it google the where that guy put out that yeah yeah yeah where i mean he he said
some questionable things he said he also had some sort of argument to make it wasn't the greatest
argument but it quickly turned into you know either you are a crazy feminist nazi or you
are the racist uncle right there is no in between you have to be one or the other and both sides
hate each other after it's all over yeah it's one of those fun things where like you can piss off
both sides by disagreeing with both of them yeah so it's like no no you know don't get wrong i
don't like the nazis either but i don't want to set everyone i've never met on fire and so like
you can really piss off everybody yeah and it doesn't matter both sides now think you're on
the other sides yeah it's and sometimes you are sometimes you aren't but the whole drive is to
make things as outrage generating and as hating of the people that are on your friends list as
possible because that drives engagement that will get you coming back to facebook for the next three
hours madly pounding away on the comment section of someone's thread and the engagement number goes up
but all it does is result in this deterioration of society i think it's a large part of the
reason that trump got elected the the continual outrage of both sides against each other and
one side said you know what fuck you all we're tired of your hippie liberal bullshit we're going
to elect this guy because he is not part of the system yeah i mean definitely
it's like trump was giant a giant middle finger to everyone who was on the left right it's true
that example just still hits too close to home um this will all be funny in five years if we make
it that far right um so uh yeah i think you're right there there wasn't anybody five years ago
saying man i wish that donald trump character would run so that we could get a reasonable person
in our side right yeah this just turned into like we the the i mean we're pissing off trump
supporters but don't get me wrong i i said what if your trump supporter who wanted donald trump
to run in the 2004 election you write in and let us know what your reasoning is what your reasoning
was i will say that they it's not that they don't have an argument when you get attacked when your
side gets attacked a lot by these people that you think are obviously just the most pampered people
who are writing and calling for their colleges to to fire professors when they're in the most liberal
and safe and accepting place in the world and you're like what the fuck is wrong with you and
you do want to you know flip them off and be like yeah take this this is the guy that stands for
everything you hate eat a dick i i totally like felt i i i felt i don't want to say agreement with
them but like when i first heard about trump and didn't know about him at all for like a week i was
like i could maybe vote for this guy because i am kind of sick of some of this bullshit and and then
i realized who he actually was what he was doing i was like oh oh god no it would have been a great
throwaway vote to give a fuck you yeah right so like if he didn't make the candidacy and it would
be you know like there's the joke i think the numbers were inflated but probably one idiot wrote in
harambe as the president right so it would have been great for like you know uh to make a social
statement to your facebook friends or whatever and say i voted for trump because fuck you guys
it turned out not to be so great you know like when they said you know eat a dick everyone now we
all have to eat that dick and it's and it's horrible so this is not like one of those primo
Dwayne the rock johnson dicks this is like fucking gross ass what's his name uh donald trump
