its battery till it turns off just in time we're gonna turn it on again okay um but whatever uh
what was i gonna say um autoplay is actually another thing that keeps people engaged obviously
that's why they do it um another thing that i uh so like i i haven't left facebook in the sense
that i've deleted my account but i love i've left facebook in the sense that i haven't posted in over
a year um and i'll occasionally get on and like like stuff um but i only have it on to coordinate
the less wrong meetings and stuff yeah um facebook is really good for coordinating events yeah it's
it's quite a good calendar option and also a pretty decent messenger i like their messenger
quite a bit um well certainly like because google's social thing never really took off so like you
have google circles and stuff but no one ever friended someone on google right um but if you
have the option and you can do google hangouts that works just like facebook messenger except a
little more smoothly and you can seamlessly put in videos and stuff um or rather video feed of the
person um but and calendars on google are great but since it doesn't have the same adoption for
that feature as facebook does facebook still is probably the best way to coordinate for stuff
until you have that one friend who deleted their facebook and now you've got to text him to be like
hey jankins are you coming to the thing because we changed the place um that's on you jankins uh
i guess we're we're talking about mitigation strategies now how we can deal with this shit
yeah i mean we can talk we can kind of oscillate back and forth into how it gets in your face and
how to get away from it i mean i i didn't i didn't take her hercules and steps to get away from it
i do feel like deleting your account completely does cut you off quite a bit it does and so props
to jankins for doing that i find it sometimes a little harder to yeah it is harder to connect
with some people when they aren't on facebook they're it just it's a good event coordinator
it's horrible as an archive and as a way to have conversations absolutely like the anti of those
things if you wanted to destroy relationships and you wanted to destroy an an archive of what
has happened on the internet you would use facebook right because it's good for those things uh
or terrible for those things i guess but uh but it's good for recording events and for text messaging
yeah and for sharing photos and for malthusian nightmares and for malthusian nightmares yeah
but uh or malachian nightmares right well kind of similar yeah but for malachian nightmares you're
right i i mean there's just the opt out option i have opted out of twitter almost entirely
i tweet maybe once or twice a year just to say hey here's a new thing that i got published in
i don't know you're on twitter i have a twitter account oh do you i haven't used it since 2012
but i have one yeah i use it literally just to say hey i'm publishing something here you go
nice uh i have every now and then i post something but i was like once a year i have never done the
snapchat i'm like fuck that i know it's v who i'm following much more closely now uh his blog
has opted out of facebook entirely which i think is a harsh step but there there are some i mean
the guy who did the facebook who worked for facebook and created the likes he has entirely
opted out of facebook and doesn't let his family use it either which i don't know if that really
works your kids are probably going to be using it at school or something well and like they can put
it on their phones unless you're going to just full on you know yeah you know own their phones and
ensure that you're gonna lock everything and all that right um i'm on snapchat but it's less of a
social thing and more of its way for me to you know send and receive pictures of animals um so
it and it doesn't take up memory you know other than like the app but you don't have to like you
know like why if someone texts me the image it's saved in my history and i have to go through and
clear out my messages once in a while because it ends up taking up gigs of data after a few months
but snapchat you know friend of mine has a bangle cat that sends me a video of like
three times a week and i like that um but there's uh it's hard to see the well it's
they have news on there in that uh if you don't know a lot about snapchat it's kind of
pointless but basically the newest isn't thrown on your face and it's super easy to ignore um it's
not like you have to watch it to get to the content you want like on youtube or something
i know scott alexander once posted about uh how awful tumblr is for uh i believe his post was
called the taxal plasma of rage where tumblr is optimized just to get people upset as well
but i mean he still uses it too so i tried being on tumblr for like two months and got
to some argument with somebody who was completely insane i defend she probably thought i was insane
and i was like okay this is the the rumors were true this is the level of discourse here i'm out
plus it's just not a great way to to optimize for what you want like a subreddit works a lot
better um yes if you like it but if that means you have to tolerate reddit so if you if you
don't like the the weird jokes there then you're not going to like it but there's a few tumblers
i follow which i really like i mean if you create your experience you can do it well and i think
that's i mean that is the more important way to deal with things like on facebook i still use
facebook a bunch but now i limit my time on it and i have very strict rules about what i will
engage there's certain things that when i see i just like i'm gonna keep scrolling i may have an
opinion but you know what i know what's gonna happen so just fuck this keep going it's not worth it
i've done that where like i sometimes i'll even think of a response and i could be like man this
would be a good way nope nope i'm out you're like am i actively contributing to the malachian
nightmare yes that would be contributing to the nightmare i'm not going to do that well i would
like to think that like i remember after the uh the result of the election people were like
man it was you third party voters that's why clinton won and he's lost excuse me yeah if only
ferdy and slip um uh people were like people were showing articles or at least statuses of
like blaming people who voted for third parties that's why clinton lost and uh i have sensible
friends who pointed out it's like actually those numbers wouldn't have won her the election it was
the failure of turnout that lost her the election um those people were shat on for like you know
fuck if you're disagreeing with me um but they weren't like trying to engage in a fight they
were just like oh you're actually a little wrong about this which likes to be corrected um whereas
like some people would like to be corrected and not be spreading misinformation some people don't
they were just pissed and i get that so one of the things i did with facebook way before i stopped
being on it and actually it's probably streamlined by a way to do it is i disabled notifications for
my phone cool so i still have the app because at this time i didn't really have a computer that
i was on all that often i have an old mac or i had an old mac that i you know hate using because
it's old yeah three gig is ram and it's now 11 years old um no wait 10 anyway so i was on the
desktop version that much so i had on my phone and yeah lock screen notifications that red badge
that you're talking about and i'm the kind of guy who can't ignore the red badge i've seen
people's phones they have 2600 unread emails and uh these are the same people who i think
their desktops on their computers are just like no folders icons on the yeah yeah like for now i
mean my phone i have a facebook i have a message in my social folder and messenger i have you know so
like um i'm i check those pretty compulsively so i deleted the thing that puts the badges on
facebook at all so now i don't even see notifications and what's fun is it's still trying to get like
so when i go back on once a month ish to make a an event for less wrong i'll get like 15 notifications
and what a lot of them are just pointless random things like oh this person posted a new status
and so this person posts on facebook three times a day you're just trying to like maybe it doesn't
it must know but it maybe it's trying to hope that i'll see the notification thing down there
when i open the app and be you know why is there 15 what's happening what's blowing up why i want
to get down on this but it's just thinking of excuses to get me to get notifications you know
things that it doesn't bug people about who i think we're on every day maybe it is doing this people
now i don't know do you get notice do you get notifications that someone posted a status uh i
get enough notifications every day that facebook doesn't have to do that to give me more status
updates yeah so i was wondering if every now and then i'll see that like maybe once a month or
something but it's usually for people that like haven't posted in a long time and facebook will
let me know they posted okay so i was wanting i wasn't wanting to be too like you know shakesperian
and assuming this was something that they only did to people who are ignoring the app maybe it's a
new feature they they they they do target people who ignore their stuff more yeah so part of what
we were talking about this a little earlier with google circles that makes uh something like facebook
kind of insidious makes it sound like they're being deliberately bad but whatever um is that there
isn't really a competitor right um oh i don't use facebook you know try linked in it's like that's
not a social network to get together and in fact i don't even know there's an events thing on linked
in there definitely is actually i think okay um but it's mainly for like hey denver startup week
is happening you know next month um but it's not for like want to grab a beer um so uh there isn't
a competitor there isn't a competitor to youtube that anyone really uses like people try to get
stuff off the ground but you know youtube is pretty big and monolithic at this point there's
just no i mean there's sometimes vimeo um daily motion yeah but i mean you know you basically
youtube stuff and i don't have vimeo or daily motion bookmarked right like if i go to type in
vim it doesn't bring up vimeo on my taskbar or my url because i don't go there often enough
i only go there if something links me there that youtube didn't host or they didn't post to youtube
for whatever reason i you know i consider social media to be a new technology basically at the
same level as alcohol the what i mean is that they both are extremely addictive they make people feel
good in the short term which is why they're addictive but they have very bad long term consequences
and they're very easy to abuse and i i don't remember where i heard this and i tried to look
it up recently and couldn't find it so maybe it's bullshit i remember hearing once that uh
every culture when they first discovered or were introduced to alcohol had about a hundred year
period where they stopped doing anything useful that's amazing yeah where uh they you know they're
going along they're being fine they're having normal culture alcohol enters the picture and
then for the next hundred years they're basically going to the shitter nothing is working well
and eventually the culture figures out how to adapt to alcohol and integrate it and now people
can use it like with some level of moderation and uh and china had a similar thing happen with opium
although that was also due in large part to the british pushing it on them for profit's sake
but again new technologies like that can really fuck things up for a while before we invent
social technologies to deal with it ways to uh have some alcohol in moderation
ways that we we deal with this disruption and i feel like we are still in the
area where we have not figured out how to deal with this disruption and it's currently
fucking up our society beyond you know all recognition maybe not all recognition but
it's fucking up pretty bad and it has had disastrous consequences that have increased
the chances of nuclear war on the planet and so that's sort of what bums me out like you know if
we took a decade or if we took a few decade dip a hundred years ago that would have been a drag
right now everyone could die and i think i think we'll get there and i think people just really
do need to start being much more serious and considerate about how they use it and treat it
like a drug like alcohol the when do you want to use it make sure you're using facebook make sure
you're using social media responsibly don't facebook and drive or whatever the new thing would
be don't facebook angry i don't know there's another uh analogy to alcohol there in that
people tend to enjoy their time on facebook and then subsequently regret their time they
spent on facebook yes and also the the analogy that when this first shows up uh the immediate
reaction is to ban it that this is horrible and it's destroying things and we should just
opt entirely like the people that are leaving all social media but it's not a long-term
sustainable option people like it enough that it'll always be there so you have to find some
other way to deal with it rather than just opting out entirely which is why i'm trying to push for
more moderation things like don't respond to things that make you angry or unfriend the people who
always share or at least unfollow the people who always share outrage baby stuff well interest in
harris makes a point like this too that even just disabling the the lock screen notifications
so that it's not you know because you check your phone i think 150 times a day was the number he
threw out in his paper um which is probably low for some people um and i'm not sure what a check
counts like if i open it again to do the thing i was finishing earlier i don't know you know whatever
but yeah if if you go to look at your phone and check the time or whatever and oh look new facebook
thing and you open up facebook um that pulls you back in too and you know i don't want to be like
the old comrade and the old man who's like facebook's bad and you shouldn't you shouldn't be on the
social media you get out there and meet people um well i mean that's that's first of all i do
agree that it's much better to go out and meet people but on the other hand you know people
say alcohol is bad and sure alcohol is bad but everyone still drinks alcohol so facebook's the
same kind of way yeah it's bad but there's also some good aspects to it don't fucking overdo it
yeah and kind of like aware of what's happening kind of like drinking too much people don't look
back on a three hour facebook binge and say that was time well spent yeah i think keeping it
from jumping down your face all the time by by having lock screen notifications enabled is one
thing that people could do um you know but i guess maybe we haven't made a sufficient case for why
they should bother doing that so one thing that did and i could find a reference for this if we
need to um i feel like it might be popular not only but i'm not sure um facebook contributes
to people's depressive tendencies in that you get sampling bias from looking at your facebook feed
because people aren't sharing their boring mundane lives they're sharing the times they're doing
exciting stuff look at me i went hiking look at me i got married look at me i uh got a new dog
what other other stuff people talk about um so you're not seeing the 16 hours a day that they
or whatever um you're not seeing the boring times you're only seeing the highlights and so because
that's what you see as you're scrolling through you see everyone up to the cool stuff and you're
like i'm just scrolling through facebook right now i'm not doing anything cool another good reason to
limit your time on facebook or or at least moderate how you use facebook i'm willing to
bet that over 90 percent of our listeners maybe over 95 percent of our listeners who have been
on facebook for at least three years have leased out have lost at least one friend they're like a
person who is a good decent person that you like hanging out with something happened on facebook
and you guys couldn't be friends anymore because of some bullshit blow up that's probably happened
yeah i i know it's happened to me i'm trying to think if that ever happened to me i never got
that involved in a lot of facebook flame wars um but i i know people has happened to um
but i also didn't have that many facebook friends so uh but just finishing the last thing i was
gonna say was that uh no you're good um you get a sampling bias and so people don't uh especially
if you already are predisposed predisposed to depressive tendencies you just you get this idea
that everyone else up to all this cool stuff and you're not and that bums people out uh we do have
uh i matt i remember when he heard that we were going to talk about this
had a thing to say when i was going to say that social media is awful and really is destroying
our society uh matt wanted to point out that social media can also be great and wonderful
if you are isolated uh someplace without a lot of people who think like you and that is what keeps
you sane uh and can get you through a hard part in your life and i wanted to say that i guess
that's true when i was in high school like facebook didn't exist yet because i'm very very old but uh
i had i had very few people in my life that i could actually relate to and being on certain
internet forums really i don't know if it saved my life but it it made my life much more bearable
it would have been awful without it and i think matt had similar experiences where
it was the thing that kept him sane to be able to talk with other people who who felt like he did
and i think that was probably also a experience of a lot of atheists in the uh early 2000s as well
because there weren't a lot of out atheists yet and it was still very taboo and when you could
find people on the internet who said no you're not insane and you're not an immoral monster
this really is crazy bullshit these people are spewing and you could talk with them about it it
it helped and that wasn't really social media the same way that it was social media nowadays
but if people spend a lot of time on facebook and it helps them i think that's good too that is one
of the ways you know that the knowing yourself and knowing what you can tolerate and the moderation
is the key like are you making society worse off by spreading outrage or are you making your life
better by connecting with people and having an outlet for for the socialization that you
can't get where you are unless you're connecting over outrage and then you're in this weird
interest between it's bad um but yeah i mean that's a good point and there i mean there are other
