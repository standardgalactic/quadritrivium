knows that he's that uh he can't say scientists are all he can't say sciences on his side right
yeah and every time he does he's lying and um what but see i want to i want to like now take
this to someplace where people could be plausibly wrong um by by that i want to say at burning man
i got to introduce grover norquist before he spoke at a event which was really cool uh who that is
oh grover norquist he's probably most uh well known for being the guy who organized the uh pledge
that all republican sign now saying they will not raise taxes uh he has sort of a right wing
think tank that he heads up and he mainly hates uh the expansion of government power
and he wants to reign in government and reduce the size and the power of the federal government
and one of his major tools for that has been to have this pledge that all republican sign saying
we will not raise taxes which has been responsible for huge amount of gridlock over the past decade
two decades uh which a lot of people dislike him for but he's basically a political big political
guy anyways i introduced him i was like oh my god i am talking to someone who has talked to like
every president personally so far i am now two degrees separated this is awesome uh i don't
know if he's talked to trump actually but you know he he talks to congresspeople often on the
first name basis with them and someone near the end pulled out a gotcha question about global warming
and here is where i say that if you are going to try to gotcha someone
you should be at least as intelligent and read up on the subject as they are
because he's a global warming denialist but he's extremely intelligent and he has read a lot about
it and when he explained why he is a denialist i was like i can see his point he has there is
a lot of misinformation out there and even like just semi plausible doubts that you can create
if that is your industry to create doubt about things like whether tobacco causes cancer or
whether carbon is warming the globe and so once you're i mean well who was it uh Richard Feynman
said the most important thing is not to be fooled and you are the best person at fooling yourself
something along those lines right i think your first formulation was close enough was close
enough okay right uh and so he when you're really smart and know a lot about researching issues
that doesn't make you impervious to wrong opinions it just means you're even better at finding ways
to justify your wrong opinions and he is terrified of large government he wants to cut it down
he doesn't want government in his business and telling him who he can or can't marry or
who he can what drugs he can or can't do or whatever it is and he views this global warming
thing as a thing that will expand government power which i mean it will the government's
going to have to regulate things like how much carbon you can burn it's it's a thing that just
gives them more power when they regulate it but it's also really important to regulate this so
that we don't have horrific climate change yeah so that is why he is strongly motivated to seek
out reasons why it's not a big deal and we shouldn't give the government this power and
and that was when i was like oh i see trying to change things purely through politics is
really hard because there will always be smart people like this who are on the wrong side but
is he morally negligent for since he pushes the levers of policy and speaks publicly
and yet he did a lot of research and got the wrong answer how how morally culpable is he
for having that wrong answer i want to kind of take that in order but i wanted to get
clarification on something that you said right at the beginning of that which was that
if you're going to ask a gotcha question to somebody you need to be as informed as they are
do you mean that in just the case of gotcha questions if you're going to say whatever this
guy's name is wrong about climate change do i need to be more informed about climate change than
he is for me to say that just to say that he's wrong no but if you're going to try to engage him
in a public forum you're going to end up looking bad and scoring points for him absolutely okay
in that context i totally agree i like everything something much more egregious that i was going
to kick back on and saying that i have to be i have to know all the ins and outs of intelligent
design theory to call ken ham a bullshit artist no just don't try to engage with him in public
about it because he's going to make you look bad if you haven't read up as much as he has okay i
thought you were challenging the epistemological standing of the person making the question
because they weren't as informed as he was but you were just saying don't if you do it this way
you're going to cause bad fallout stop that's what you're saying yeah okay cool so um how
culpable is he i'm tempted to say still a lot i especially the question like climate change i feel
like uh yes he's very intelligently wrong but not exclusively wrong okay he thinks that he knows
more than 97 percent of scientists and like those three percent are kind of like the i imagine many
of them are like people who you know the evolutionary biologists who have phd's in biology but have
an younger creasonous their whole life where they just go to school you know often with funding
to get a phd's they can say i'm a scientist and this is all bullshit and they had he had some
arguments as to why that 97 percent number is inflated even if it's 90 even if it's 90 right
what if it's something more like 47 um i would be curious how he got that number and i'm sure
he could give me a really awesome reason because this is his job to argue this yeah um but i don't
think it's 47 but he has reasons that he thinks it may be drastically lower than 97 yeah i mean
so that particular this is why you're right in order for me to engage him personally i'd have to
know more i'd have to be at least as intelligent on subjects he is because i couldn't respond to
that point yeah um but in general how culpable is he that's like i mean to pick a another example
we were talking before the air about like anti-vaxxers these people go online they read a lot they
find uh wakefield's paper and they find everything talking about it and they go to their nutritionist
and nutritionist degrees with them they've in a sense done their due diligence right um but
they're still like killing kids as a result yeah and so like just when you tell your society back
into the dark ages of fucking communicable diseases that kill children that don't have to yeah um so
like the utilitarian answer is pretty easy like they're doing harm um so yes they've done a bad thing
but uh like as far as the character of the person are they a bad person um they've made a
somewhat honest mistake but i i guess i don't know i would like to think i've never been
that egregiously wrong about something i mean uh and i i i've believed stupid things but i've never
like stood my ground on them i've been slow to move but like i've never uh i think i've never dug
my feet in and you know made it a fight i'm trying to think of and you've known me for a while is
there anything stupid that i've changed my mind on that i took too long to do i don't know alonso
fife remember when we had him on a while ago the the moral yeah uh the ethicist guy uh he has this
thing this analogy he makes that if you are a truck driver and you are carrying a heavy load
out onto you know a highway you have a moral responsibility to make sure it is secured and
there there he well i don't want to say too much about his past but people have died because
truck drivers did not take the time to secure a load that should have been secured came off
their truck in the highway killed someone and he makes the comparison that uh there there is a
certain moral responsibility to make sure that your intellectual load is secured as well if you
are going to believe things like the jews are destroying society you have a strong responsibility
to make sure that those opinions are very firmly supported by something that is true uh as opposed
to just wishful thinking and some bullshit that you heard online yeah so that's similar to i think
i mentioned ages ago on the podcast cliford's ethics of belief uh where he talked about like the
boat captain you know is my ship seaworthy exactly that sort of thing yeah but the difference between
the boat captain and presumably the truck driver is that they didn't give themselves a bunch of
sophisticated arguments to you know yes my load really is tied down i'm good um they just did they
just didn't put in the work yeah but the argument is that if you didn't put in the work you are
morally culpable for not having done that because we expect you to do that so i think more closely
with alonso's to tie it into alonso's analogy though would be what if the truck driver
tied what they thought were good knots because their friend showed them these knots and their
friend you know as a boy scout or whatever knew all these and either they missed a knot
or their friend didn't show to them right or whatever but they thought they tied it down
really well and they're like looks good to me and like they they actually put in the work
but they did it badly and then someone died as a result right that's nothing more akin to uh this
climate change denialist's position yeah and i don't know how to hit that yeah i i i mean the
the topic we were talking about on that episode was the google memo guy and i mean he made some
claims with some level of backup but probably not it's still a little bit controversial and
he was not the right obviously not the right person to say him but he also wasn't making a
public argument when he made this memo yeah i mean you know can you make a bad argument in
private i think i think you're much more uh less culpable if you make a a bad argument in private
instead of just going to the microphone and screaming this at people right yeah um but
anyway yeah so i don't know i mean especially on things that are tricky that aren't entirely
settled yet it's can are you allowed to have an opinion without knowing everything and researching
everything meticulously first he he read some things there are some people who agree with him
that uh it's not a wrong on the face of it position it he some of the things he said could
have some evidence for them and could very well end up being true is evolution settled
well what how much of it i mean yes we know evolution happens the central
thesis of evolution yeah yeah very much so but there are clever
arguers who would disagree right and they'd give you all these reasons so like i i don't know if
climate change is as settled as evolutionary science um but to say that humans have had no
impact on global climate over the last two centuries i think is like saying evolution never
happened um at least to say they have no impact you know you can you can you can you can i think
intelligently debate the fallout and how much or whatever um but like i guess i'm hung up because
like anyone who wants to say oh yeah settled questions we're not gonna argue about of course
gravity is real but evolution that that that is still you know there's three percent of scientists
who disagree with evolution so i don't i wouldn't i don't want to leave that door open to fall back
on but only because i'm worried about being misused but in the sense of it's being honestly
used that's a very good point you know like uh are eggs good or bad for you there's some
disagreement right yeah um and turns out human dietary science is really hard and i don't think
i think that is an open question um maybe there's somebody you know with a good book out there who
has proved that they're awesome or bad for you but i don't think that uh that consensus has made
made the rounds yet so and i think if you read the book that proves that they're awesome or the
book that proves that they're bad holding that opinion even if you're wrong i mean at least it was
understandable but that's a truly unsettled issue right yeah like that's that's one where like you
can't point to you know the human foundation of knowledge like the last century disagrees with
you but there there are some people who would disagree with some of the things that the google
memo guy said as strongly as we disagree that evolution and climate change is you know up in
the air and they would say if you if you are saying that he has some possibly good scientific
points rather than just saying he is as stupid as ken ham or a climate denialist then you are as
morally bad as those people are like what do you say to that i say never actually read his memo
i'm not sure i'm not sure what claims he made uh i know one of them was like that women go for more
people oriented positions and men go for more thing oriented positions yes um that that is that
is the main one that i'm talking about right now and so that uh i don't know how subtle that is
that strikes me as vaguely possible or at least vaguely plausible actually i mean
you know there might be something to do that and i totally i could think of examples that fit that
yeah but there are some people who would say that if you even are entertaining that possibility
you are as deluded as someone who says that evolution doesn't happen and and by not having
you know researched and accepted all the the people who say that that is the case you are a
sexist pig well then they're losing me right away right you don't win people over by calling them
names that's if they had said hey look steven i don't think your uh position on this i don't think
that your um your tacit endorsement that this is a valid line of inquiry is as valid as you think
it is have you read this and they link me that and i'm like oh shit you're right i've completely
changed my mind and then i'll say that so that's the that's the difference between like being you
know honestly mistaken or you know at least uh understandably mistaken versus being outright
dishonest um you know so i guess it varies on how how well supported the thing actually is and how
much of an impact that belief has on the world in combination this is actually a really tough
question because like i mean you could you can and have people you haven't but people have written
books on how 911 wasn't inside job and how couldn't have happened this way and yet like the official
story is almost definitely certainly mostly true so like or uh another good one like the
kennedy assassination is actually pretty settled and it's been settled for decades but even people
today are still he couldn't have done it by himself even and one of my favorite this never go to
pen and tellers bullshit for anything like remotely demonstrating proof of anything because
they made it to be funny they didn't mean it to be super serious okay um but in one of the episodes
they you know they talk about one of the arguments is like that this guy couldn't have fired those
three rounds that quickly and pen jolette who you know he's like i don't think i've ever held this
gun before he fires off three rounds in less time than that and so like it that clearly isn't one of
the things that would have slowed this down right um but you know like how much harm are you doing
if you say that what who was it li harvey oswald that shot kennedy um if you say that he didn't
act alone like all right whatever you have fun talking about that but you know if your claim
is something again like vaccines are bad yeah um like then you're you're literally killing children
yeah so part of it's the fallout but like as far as like your epi epistemological integrity
um you're right i don't want to blame people who make an honest effort and do the wrong thing
even if bad stuff happens that maybe you're not bad people your bad people
if after having the alternative put before you in a friendly way and uh
you know or if you refuse to engage if you're a bad person like if you know if this is now
your sacred cow and you won't touch your uh your anti-vax beliefs because you're afraid that you
might be proven wrong because i'm just not going to read your paper you lying big pharma shill right
um like that i think speaks poorly of your integrity um you know i really wish i knew
what unit of caring would say about this the the unit of caring is my favorite tumblr by far
just an amazing tumblr always interesting and a genuinely good person that that runs it and
one of their big things is not calling people good or evil just uh evaluating situations
and saying this is a bad situation i wish it were to be better as opposed to
you know you are a bad person maybe i should send in an ask see what they have to how they
would respond to this is tumblr easy to find old stuff i don't think it is it's so if they
talked about this before you really have no way of finding it easily and yeah i think you can google
it okay cool that makes sense but you can't search within tumblr's interface because it just you
can scroll through their history and you go to the archive where it shows pictures of the post
yeah you know what as long as you can google it i don't care yeah i think that's one of the reasons
facebook is such a horrible archive because you cannot google things post on a facebook now every
every couple months every single link that i've ever put on facebook i go and i copy onto my blog
just so that i can search because i've had a number of times or a few months later like
something came up and i was like oh yeah let me link you to oh shit that was on facebook scroll
scroll ah fuck i can't find it so i've done that so i can google search the things that i have posted
on facebook nice um but anyway so this might be out there um yeah i like there's something
that i like about that i mean i like saying that people can be good people i'm not a huge
round of saying people are bad people i do think that like you can say it's unfortunate that you're
this way but that's depending on how you're saying it that's super like pretentious right um but like
the fact of the matter is that like you know the anti-vaxxer down the street we could get a lot
we could have gotten along great if they hadn't been exposed to the wrong ideas and of course
they're thinking the same thing about me you know if only this guy wasn't some brainwashed big pharma
idiot you would stop poisoning children with mercury yeah so uh but like so maybe that's part
of it you know the the specific claims that they make um you know so like if the if this i forget
the guy's name by burning man the a uh global warming denialist bro from norquist uh if he had
said um you know the temperature hasn't gone up in the last 50 years then he's lying um but if he
if that's not one of his arguments then you know then there's a discussion to be had so like an
