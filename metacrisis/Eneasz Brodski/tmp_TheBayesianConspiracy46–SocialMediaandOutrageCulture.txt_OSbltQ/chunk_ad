avenues to doing that but certainly like um you know going to the bar and asking like hey who
else believes this weird thing that i believe is not the way to do that because you could get your
ass kicked right depending on where you are yeah yeah so there's there's definitely i mean there's
obviously perks i mean the other perks is that you know it lets you keep in touch with people and
there's all kinds of reasons that this got popular um but uh i think certainly tristan harris's point
you know he he points out that just there's a lot built into this that doesn't have your goals
your goals aren't its goals um drastically not yeah so that's the that's the downside right
i mean its goals is to keep you on there forever and take everything from you yeah and like reddit
has a lot of things that suck um a lot of people suck a lot of like the culture sucks
but man if you want to get on and talk about you know uh your favorite sports team or uh
your favorite video game or movie or whatever subreddits i'm on like random video games or
i don't know other random things those people go to those subreddits talk about those things
and yeah you're not making because it's more it's way more anonymous than facebook um in the
fact that you can't post personal information or personal identifiable information um unless you're
celebrity but you're at least there with like-minded people but going on to your facebook feed and
saying who likes the broncos uh you'll probably get people like fuck the broncos and i like the
broncos but that's that's not the best way to get that sort of like you know friendship chamber
is that really people get that upset about sports i have no idea okay i never posted i can say with
pretty oh wait no i posted a sports thing once i shared an smbc comic or wasn't smbc it was some
little webcomic of like a sports announcer it might have been the oatmeal of like yeah they went out
there we tried to sports hard than them and we got the ball to the point zone more times than they
did and that's you know whatever uh that's the closest i went to a sports post i guess mainly
what i'm saying is if you see something that makes you outraged ask yourself first am i contributing
to the downfall of society through maloch malochian nightmarish means and then don't do that and when
other people do do that i don't know like maybe i don't know how to say to someone politely
i think you might be destroying society yeah that wouldn't be the way i'd put it
i liked your way of saying you know have you considered that you're working for the russians
by sharing this but i don't know what kind of responses you get to that that's interesting
i've been remembering for like 10 minutes okay do we want to do we want to move on then i don't
feel like we've covered this that well but i don't know what else to say articulately yeah i think
once we've run out of the articulate things to say we may be done all right let's try this really
quick i'll jump through and i'm gonna read the uh the essay is not that long on tristan harris's
website which is tristan harris dot com pretty catchy name i can run through and read the the
top like the 10 hijack things okay so the you know it's the hijacks that take over your mind yeah
so we talked about hijack one we can just respond to these or run past them if you want but i thought
it'd be fun hijack two put a slot machine in a billion pockets we kind of talked about that we
did where you never know what you're gonna get and that refresh is nice and a lot of the refreshes
are calculated so like the like you said the one on uh was uh gmail was an accident at first but
that's how you reload your twitter and uh according to tristan when you refresh your twitter account
or your twitter feed and it spins for a second it doesn't take a second um that's there to get you
focused and ready a lot of this thing has come off like you know again grumpy old men
you know facebook's ruining the world kind of thing but it's more just like you might not be
aware of all the ways that it's calculated to keep your to maximize your time on screen and that's
not what you want out of facebook but that's what facebook wants out of you yeah it's not just facebook
it's everything which you know is part of the problem hijacked number three fear of missing
something important right and that definitely kept me on for a while too oh really um i have come i have
come to accept that there is nothing super important on facebook if it's important enough
to actually be important i'll find about it in some find out about it in some other way
and i no longer expect anyone to see anything that i put on facebook like if they do great
that's why i put it on facebook but i do not assume that just because i put it on facebook it's now
common knowledge yeah well i think that's part of it the other thing maybe is just defining like what
you know the important part means like you know i would certainly hope that if like a family member
was in the hospital i wouldn't hear about it on facebook right um i hope someone would call me yeah
so or text me who's their phone is a phone um i do want to also right now uh i don't think i've
ever said this before but i would like to come out very strongly in favor of seeing people in meat
space there is something very different about actually feeling like the vibrations as they speak
the the actual feeling sounds hitting your eardrums of like smelling them and being able to touch
them and interact with them and reading all their body language i think that is just vastly
important and a hugely deep psychological need that we have which facebook kind of mimics and
pretends to to um to fulfill but it really doesn't you still feel kind of empty afterwards
almost all the time and i think if people were able to take that time that they use on facebook
and somehow you know put it all in a row i mean that's the problem with facebook right you can't
spend that time socializing because it's like on a train you check it for 10 minutes or something
but if you could somehow take all that time and just stick it together at one end of your
meek and weak and meet people face to face just so much higher quality of interaction to see people
in meat space i enjoy in-person conversations more too there's something to be said about like a good
text conversation like via instant messenger because then i can articulate myself better
i sound better in typing than i do in in speech less things through exactly uh but
i'm tempted to throw in this really quick because we uh we were gonna have shelly on as a guest and
she talked about uh you know like simulation stuff now she's in favor does simulation meet space count
as meat space i mean depends on high enough i guess yeah all right fair enough if it's indistinguishable
from real life then yeah it counts fair enough all right so missing something important um social
approval uh is the fourth hack and i mean i'm i'm skimming and it's i don't feel like social
approval is the best name for this category um he talked about how you know like when you
are tagged in pictures it's less of like uh someone you know jagging a square over your face and typing
in steven dot zuber or steven zuber or whatever to tag me facebook knows what my face looks like
and says actually facebook doesn't know my face looks like for some weird reason whenever rachel
posts pictures of me and and her together uh it asks if she wants to tag scott my twin brother
who hasn't posted on facebook since high school huh and who looks a lot less like me than i look
even though we're identical twins um and like something in facebook's algorithm is missing the
fact that rachel and i like live together and have been dating for seven years or six years
over the longest been so um maybe it's just trying to sneakily get scott to come back on facebook
that variable might actually be part of it um because it auto generates who do you want to tag
let's see here number five was i think tit for tat where was it yep social reciprocity so poke
and your fuel obligatory supergate a poke um i think i read that bullshit certainly like happy
birthdays um you know those that even has the feature where uh you don't have to go to their
page you can just do it from like the top of your feed i like that feature if that's your thing yeah
let's see number six bottomless bowls infinite feeds and autoplay we talked about autoplay a bit
but i mean the cool thing about autoplay though is if i'm watching nothing if i'm watching
binging with babish my one of favorite youtube channels i one of my newer favorite youtube
channels he makes uh food from tv and movies and video games it's really fun and if you haven't seen
an episode i strongly recommend it he uh just has this fun presentation delivery and you know he
posts the full recipe on the on the description if you want to make it um and he has this cool
voice and a great beard um anyway uh if i'm watching binging with babish and i finish the
six minute episode it'll play the next one for me and it's like what's cool though is that like
it doesn't show me keeping up with the kardashians or whatever bullshit right it shows me something
i probably would have wanted to watch anyway but you could click like oh i know but i'm just saying
like it's not like it's throwing nonsense in my face yeah it's throwing you know i guess if you
can skip the ads between videos um but it's it's it's showing what i want to watch that's part of
what makes it kind of again insidious makes it sound more deliberately sinister than it is
it's part of what makes it so um addictive yeah addictive and sneaky it's because you know it is
showing stuff you want and that's not you know it's not a feature that uh people would be super
pissed about because it's like why am i you'd be more pissed if it was showing you uh you know
whatever insane shit you hate right if it was showing you that after everything you watched
that you liked that would be super i might be one degree more pissed but i'm i i you you underestimate
how pissed i get i think when my computer plays something and i did not specifically tell it to
play that fair enough number seven instant interruption versus respectful delivery okay
so we talked about that with the notifications popping up and stuff um respectful delivery might
be like a nice way of saying all right it's like when you check your email yeah um you decide when
you want to email jumps up and shows you uh you know some of my accounts do that my most annoying
one doesn't um but it would be kind of cool and this is not the kind of feature you can expect
because it doesn't fit with the mouth using or the malachian trap of how facebook and other
social networking has worked out but if you could say okay cool facebook uh show on my lock screen
at 11 30 because i want to take my lunch break so that'd be kind of cool show me the top five
things you think i want to look at yeah but it won't do that you if you if you haven't enabled
it's there all the time not just for certain time slots so that's the kind of respectful delivery
hijack eight uh bundling your reasons with their reasons and we kind of talked about the
the alignment problem with you want to get on facebook to talk with your friends and see the
news and they want you to be on facebook to be on facebook um but the example that he gives quickly
is you know in the in the physical world of grocery stores uh you know you go to the grocery
store to get to go to the pharmacy or get milk but they don't want you just running out so they put
that shit at the back right and i'm like oh that's true um so that's kind of funny uh they make the
customers they make the thing that the customers want inseparable from what the business wants
which is spending more time in the store um so that's actually man again a lot of it sounds so
sinister but it's just an accident of how it came out right um number nine inconvenient choices uh
we talked about that there's no like alternatives um you know if you don't like it you can always
unsubscribe or you can always leave the product or whatever but it's like there isn't there are
things that do what facebook does the parts that you might like like if you like the social stuff
there's meetup and meetup i not on it that much but i think it's probably less in your face than
facebook is um and i'm not super i assume so i'm not super anti facebook it sounds like i'm
because i'm railing on it but that's just sort of the point of the episode i yeah i use facebook
a lot like multiple hours a day every day so but i feel like i do not use it as irresponsibly
i i sacrifice my time to it but at least i do not sacrifice my friendships and
spread outrage to to the people i care about
yeah i mean if you're if you're aware of what's going on that's you know at least you're aware
of it kind of like moderating your drinking right or planning not to bring your car keys if you're
planning on getting wasted or whatever it's like drinking but then not being a rude asshole while
you're drunk uh the last one is uh forecasting errors and foot in the door strategies um so foot
in the door is like uh this was in that book i keep insisting that you read um influence science
and practice yeah but the the general idea is that if you get someone to agree to something
small they're more likely to agree to something big okay um and it's all kinds of fun wacky
experience people did on people to prove this people don't know like the full cost of what
they agree to when they sign into facebook or something but yeah so you get on and you know
if you delete your account i think unless there's some new way around this but at least for a while
you uh couldn't like say all right facebook i want you to delete my pictures in my posts
facebook's like nope they'll post those those are ours forever okay um so certainly a lot of the
content that you put out there is available for everybody so you can make your stuff private
but if you comment on someone's page who there's isn't private people can see your comments yeah
and so you know even like a lot of people i know meet you know have their facebook set to private
for you know whatever reason that they don't want their employers know that they drink or
are atheist or something right um but you know you uh rsv rsvp to a skeptics conference or an
atheist conference and they don't the conference probably isn't private so if someone wants to
search what what events did this guy go to boom it shows that you went to these uh so uh i think
people might not be aware what they're giving up when they sign up um and that's going to be true
for everything right uh i'm sure there's i mean certainly with google uh and i i have none of these
problems with google because google isn't in my face as much and when they are i kind of appreciate
it and i think that's kind of what they're going for um but i mean like google i mean unless you
tell the app not to track you unless you're using it um but uh you know it knows where you are all
the time and so does your uh your iphone maps app um and it uses that information unless there's
some other sinister motives involved put on these foil hats um but for like traffic uh so you know
i know how long it'll take to get to your place from the uh light rail station because everyone
else who's taking that route well and there's enough people with their phones in their cars
they don't have to have the maps open but it knows how how congested traffic is because
these cars are moving really slow so giving accurate time distance not a if the roads are empty
you can get there in 10 minutes it gives me 26 minutes or whatever right so you know there
are good things behind a lot of these but you know you might not know that hey uh my location is
always available for people i don't know if it's available to a person to get on and see where you
are um maybe but who knows i don't know uh probably those russian hackers or the chinese hackers
or those american hackers that hacker for chan right i think that was his name yeah all right i
think we've come full circle okay um we need a guest i think to keep us rained in yeah i had fun
i did too i hope you guys had fun we're gonna move on to listener feedback yes actually before that
we want to do i want to do like a sort of in-depth co-host feedback thing let's do it okay so uh
shelly who has been a co-host a couple times was talking to me about a earlier episode it was the
emotionally charged conversations episode where i made the claim that someone shouldn't be judged
morally bad because they are factually wrong about something and shelly had pushback with that
and she said that no i think there are many cases where you can judge someone to be morally bad
if they are factually wrong about things and i wanted to like address that for a while because
i think i sort of think she has a point uh i mainly go back to my um my days on the atheist forums
where every now and then you would be talking about the at the time it was evolution you would be
talking about uh evolution stuff with people with theists and they this was back when there was no
you know god directed evolution thing yet well it wasn't it wasn't popular yet anyway uh and they
would make these really absurd claims which were just gross misrepresentations like uh if i were
to go and fuck my dog there wouldn't be a half human half dog hybrid that pops out of that which
is what evolution says should happen right so just something really stupid but then uh
that gets pointed out to them as not being true and they don't update and for a normal person on
the internet that's really just infuriating but there are like professional debaters uh
dwayne gish comes to mind ken ham who will go and not i mean they aren't professional debaters they
are professional bullshitters and they debate occasionally yeah they're professional clergy
in some some manner and they debate people occasionally and they will make certain claims
that are factually incorrect but sound like they could be plausible to the people who are not educated
about uh evolution and the people they're debating with will set them straight they will explain the
situation to them they will sometimes after the fact if it's like an online debate or you know
just afterwards if they remain in contact they will send them evidence and and uh citations and
all this and they will say oh okay great thank you for setting me straight and then continue to repeat
what they said over and over uh the stuff that's wrong and i believe those people really are morally
culpable for spreading falsehoods right i didn't hear shelly's full uh position here i just heard
what you said um but it sounds to me like the distinction could be if they're lying or not
yeah not if they're spreading misinformation like if you're accidentally wrong and someone
points it out then oh my bad i'll stop saying that yeah i don't think you know depending on
the damage you did you'd have to go back and try and put out fires but um it's like like ken ham
