And really, anyone who's listening to this, if you have anything to say about this question, like, what did we miss?
What would you have liked to have said if you were on this podcast?
Or what should we address? Leave us a comment or something. We will read these or send us an email.
We'll totally read them on, not online, but, you know, on the podcast and respond to them.
Okay. How can they leave a comment and how can they send us an email?
Go to theBaseonConspiracy.com and click on the comments for the episode that you want to comment on.
Or they can send us an email at BayesianConspiracyPodcast at gmail.com.
Unfortunately, the Bayesian Conspiracy was taken.
Yes, it was.
Somehow.
Yes.
I think that was it. Did we have anything else we were going to?
No, if anyone else has any other questions, we've got like a list of topics that's going to keep us going for a year at our schedule.
But if anyone wants to send any questions or anything, we will be glad to take them.
Thoughts, suggestions, comments, concerns.
Tell us how much we suck.
How we can make this better.
The first step to getting better is knowing how much you suck.
But constructively.
No, that's true. Don't be jerks.
All right.
Because I can't take any more trivia, dude.
Hey!
I have nothing to contribute. Have we stopped?
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Before we go, we have to do our sign-off.
Thanks for listening. I'm Inyash.
I'm Katrina.
And I'm Stephen. We'll see you next time on the Bayesian Conspiracy Podcast.
Oh, tell them that we'll see them in two weeks.
Oh, yeah. We'll see you in two weeks on the next episode of the Bayesian Conspiracy Podcast.
