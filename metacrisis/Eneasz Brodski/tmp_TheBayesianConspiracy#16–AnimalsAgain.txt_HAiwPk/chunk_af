I mean, because those two species that you laid out
are complex in their different ways, right?
And then that comes kind of down on a value judgment.
Maybe Sarah's species cares more about social interaction
than they do about toolmaking, although they're in a spaceship,
so they kind of care about both.
And she's not alone, so she cares about social interaction.
What if Sarah is not an alien species?
What if she's human?
Then what would she say?
Yeah.
Probably the same thing, I guess.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, so kind of on the same.
Which would you kill and eat?
I would say that we don't have enough information.
But like, while you're got the information,
your crew's starting to death, what do you do?
Like, you're the captain.
You got to make a call.
Or not, but if you...
Well, I'm also...
Yeah, I'm a pretty...
I'm speciesist, as you are.
Yeah.
And since we're choosing whatever Sarah's race of people
to identify with as ourselves,
then I don't know, the cooperative hunting ones.
Okay.
You'll eat them first?
Yeah.
Over the planning head tool-using ones?
See, I think I would go back on...
I would only have my own experience to draw on.
I'm a little bit biased towards tool use, I guess.
I'd only have, like, my own experience to draw on.
So, like, I imagine that Sarah would be in a similar boat
where she'd look back and be like,
what are the animals on Earth that do these kinds of things?
How complex are they?
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd probably say that these ones are dumber.
If she cared about which one's dumber, right?
Do you hear that?
I mean, recently they saw a...
I don't remember if it was a crow,
or if it was some species of Corvid,
used a tool to carry another tool
to someplace where it could use that other tool.
Yeah.
That was awesome.
I just...
I love these birds, man.
Yeah, actually, the other weird thing about this book
is I had just finished a section
on new Caledonian crows in the wild
using a hooked twigs as tools.
Okay, cool.
And I was just listening to that on the radio,
and they're like, this is the first time
that tool use has been shown in these birds.
Oh, no.
It's been around for a while.
And I just read about it in this book,
which admittedly came out in this year,
in 2016.
Yeah.
And I saw a YouTube video
at least five years ago of a crow
unbending a paperclip
and reaching into grab stuff.
It wasn't even a tool.
Captive.
So the difference is captive in wild.
Ah, okay.
So the captive new Caledonian crows,
that's the one that had been shown a while ago,
is that they would literally bend paperclips
in order to use them as tools
in order to fetch something.
And friends of Wall said,
in his book, he's like,
nobody should have been surprised about that,
considering we already knew
that wild new Caledonian crows bent sticks.
Oh, okay.
And then so it was kind of funny
to now hear on the radio.
For the first time,
it's been shown that wild new Caledonian crows
bent sticks.
Right.
In other news, for the first time, fire hot.
What was, there's a word for it,
the type of animal that lives in conjunction with humans
but isn't domesticated.
Specifically like city birds, squirrels.
Or elephants.
Or elephants.
But elephants aren't domesticated.
No, they do their thing.
No, they're very wild.
They do their thing as opposed to like...
They're often trained and used for...
Well, I think Stephen is referring to animals
that are not trained but just live near humans,
like coyotes and pigeons.
Well, I was thinking crows specifically,
because I saw another YouTube video
where they were throwing nuts
at crosswalks in the street.
Go over at crosswalk time.
So like, not only were they using traffic to open nuts,
but they were smart enough to use it
when the new traffic would stop there.
And so, but I don't know if that would count
for captivity or non-captivity.
Oh, that's wild.
Oh, good.
Yeah, because that's all.
Yeah, they're referring...
Honestly, I probably wouldn't have thought of that.
Not in the lifespan of a crow, anyway.
So, that's awesome.
No, and I don't want you to be too disheartened.
I don't think anyone should ever be cruel to animals.
I care deeply for them, you know,
to the extent that people, I guess,
are permitted to be cruel to animals.
It's like, when you have a really good reason,
like you're starting to death,
or, look, it's going to take us 30 apes,
but I think we can crack uploading human minds.
Like, that, I mean, you'd be hard-pressed for me to say
those 30 apes aren't worth the potential immortality
of the human species,
and whatever other species we want to immortalize.
So, but I mean, those are high bars, right?
So, you know, things that don't fit the bar, fun.
What are the stupid reasons people torture animals for?
Food?
Not food, I think.
It depends on the food.
When you have other options?
When you have other options, I think.
I don't know.
Oh, we didn't talk about this last time.
I remember that was the one thing
I mentioned seconds away from turning off the mic.
Vegetarianism?
We didn't talk about food preferences at all,
and I don't know how far we're into this.
We want to get to emotions at all on this one.
No, we did talk a little bit about it.
Did we?
Yeah, yeah, about chickens versus pigs versus pigs.
Oh, sure, sure.
Not too much, but we did touch on it.
Right.
So, I'm vegan, mostly vegan,
and the two people,
Anyosh and Steven, that I'm here with, are not.
They're not only not vegan,
they're also not vegetarian.
I know that a lot of people maybe,
you know, get that distinction.
I guess I'm trying to say that they eat meat.
I feel like I'm being shamed right now.
To further shame you,
I will say that I feel bad about eating meat.
Well, I don't, as much as possible,
I don't eat any pork products.
I don't eat pork either.
One of the reasons that I was...
Because they're like dogs, and I love dogs.
Trying to come up with some ways
to do de-biasing is because
if people are eating meat,
they might have motivated reasoning.
Okay.
It actually would be really nice for you
if you put a lower moral weight on animals or...
It's true.
It makes my life easier.
It makes your life easier.
It means you don't have to live with this much guilt.
So, trying to get away from that scenario
where we're coming into this with incredible biases.
I think de-biasing is one of the
core techniques of good rationality.
And there are lots of things that you can do,
even quick little ones.
And I don't want to get into one of my favorites
until we do a whole episode on it,
but we should have done it at the beginning of this one.
And we didn't, so I won't even mention it until next time.
There's a good one coming up eventually.
So...
