So, what should Sarah decide
for her also alien species?
So, I forgot the names of all the things.
So, the zergles have the two of you.
I mean, some of them seem to eat something that aren't other animals,
so you might consider eating those.
Eating the blobs.
The blobs.
I mean, maybe.
So, that's the kind of thing, too.
Everything that can be said about a flatworm
can also be said about a flower,
or like an acorn.
So, like, I mean...
That is not true.
They're complex.
They have dividing cells.
They...
So, flatworms have brains.
I know, but is there any...
I guess...
I don't know.
So, I guess...
A lot of tree networks can communicate with each other,
which is, you know...
So, they have a brain.
Flowers open their petals and respond to stimuli,
being as flat traps to eat things.
I guess, I mean, so, I don't know, I guess...
I'm sorry, I don't want to belittle...
I don't want to belittle the other kingdoms that aren't animalia.
Okay.
But...
Kingdomists here.
If we could just...
Yeah, I'm sorry.
But we're sticking with the alien.
We're sticking with the alien.
To be clear, I didn't mean to completely derail.
That was just something that was on my mind.
I knew that there was this nagging thing in my head
that was trying to come out,
and that was it, that I wanted to make that comparison
ten minutes ago, but it's gone forever.
So, we'll move past the zeroes and blurtles.
Right.
So, what should...
We should ask Katrina later on
if what's the moral worth of a network of trees
compared to a flat worm?
There's larger costs, though, with trees.
Like, they house lots of things.
Yeah, they sequester carbon.
So, that too.
But, I guess...
I forgot which ones did what.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It was...
So...
The two losing ones and the cooperative hunting ones.
There's literally nothing else on the planet.
So, there is...
Apparently, those are the only things that are editable
by our aliens.
Fair enough.
Those are the only things that the aliens can eat,
so they either have to...
Can the aliens eat each other?
They're not going to.
They can, but they won't.
I asked that because we were talking about this before,
and, you know, like how we place value on things
because you care more about them and stuff.
And I think this is off the air last time,
and I'm not...
I'm not a cannibal, but...
I said that, you know, there are circumstances
under which, you know,
otherwise decent human beings would kill and eat
other human beings.
Yeah.
I mean, they can leave.
Because they care more about themselves
than other people, right?
They can leave or put themselves in stasis
and wait, or they can...
So, I think that you might correctly identify
that we don't have adequate information
to make that judgment.
Yes.
One species can make shows, rudimentary,
tool use and forethought,
and another species does cooperative hunting
with the third species.
Well, that's true.
Did you answer, like, answer?
What?
The question.
The usable one?
What would you advise Sarah?
I mean, so, like, it sort of depends,
I guess, and this is kind of defeat the thought experiment,
because the point you're making is fine,
and it's a good intuition pump,
that we have limited information.
How can we make this judgment?
And the correct answer is mostly that we can't.
But, like, you know, if it literally is, like,
your whole crew starving to death,
you just eat the one that's bigger.
Or the one that looks like...
Or the one that's easier to catch.
Right, so, like, I mean,
that's why I brought up the cannibalism thing,
is because, you know, if it really comes down to it,
you're gonna do what you need to do.
If it really comes down to it, I'd eat a chimp.
Like, I wouldn't want to,
but if I was literally starving to death,
you'd bet your ass I would.
Oh, so, if you were starving to death,
you would kill and eat a chimp.
You wouldn't kill and eat a child, right?
Or, I'm sorry.
How hungry am I?
I should have said that as...
You are so hungry that if you do not do this, you will die.
Right, I mean, like, that's...
Like I said, I guess I...
Is the child smart enough to eat me after I die?
So...
Because if the child can keep going,
that's an important consideration.
That's true.
I might be willing to die to keep the child going.
Is it two years old or, like, ten years old?
Like, if I said, look, eat me in the...
Like, actually, this is a great thing in the book, The Martian.
When they did the...
If you haven't seen the movie, do so.
But I'm going to go on, assuming that you have,
because you're all cool people.
So...
The crew on the Hermes spacecraft makes a flyby past Earth
to pick up supplies and then loop back around Mars to save...
Well, spoiler, whatever.
Halfway through.
One of the crew members is talking with her parents
about what they're planning and all that,
and they're like, yeah, but look,
what if you miss the drop-off?
They're all going to die.
And she's like, well, look, you can't tell everyone.
But we're not all going to die.
I'm the smallest.
If we miss the drop, they're immediately going to take cyanide capsules,
and I'm going to subsist on the raining supplies
and them for the flight back.
I'll make it home.
And so that is a calculation that you can make,
and they made it based on her size and the relative size
to other people, the amount of nutrients that she would eat to survive.
Those are the kind of calculations that you make
if it's literally starving to death.
So, like, if the kid could eat me,
I would last longer than the kid as far as a food supply.
So all of the things being equal,
that would be a decent trade, right?
But, you know, if it's a six-year-old,
so if we're talking about...
I actually probably would not kill the kid.
I would just starve,
and I guess the kid would probably have to end up starving too
if he doesn't know how to roast and eat me,
because I would rather die than to kill a child.
That's sort of where I would end up, too.
But we're also, again, going back into speciesism
with this kind of thought experiment.
We should really be thinking Alien A, Alien B, Alien C, right?
Right.
Well, again, I never actually answered when you asked about Sarah,
but I would leave it up to the aliens
because I don't see why I'm involved in this
if they want to eat one species or another.
What do you think Sarah will say?
What do I think she'll say?
So they are an interplanetary traveling species
that arrived on this planet, but something went wrong,
and what decision do you think that Sarah will make?
Oh, what decision do I think she would make for her crew
as in telling them which animal to eat?
I don't know.
Again, probably whichever one is easiest to kill
or whichever one provides the most calories.
Okay.
So your model of Sarah, who you don't know much about,
is that the intelligence and that stuff,
it wouldn't really matter to her.
Not while she didn't have time to assess it.
