yeah they don't matter and uh it's it's essentially i guess how utilitarian would act if the people
outside of their sphere of concern didn't matter at all or not even didn't matter at all but mattered
significantly less so like if they were bacteria or something yeah or i mean maybe that wasn't even
quite fair it would be you know like a utilitarian might care a lot more about people than they care
about uh you know cats or dogs um do you think that the protagonist in the last of us was right
with what he did no uh hell no i don't i definitely don't think so but i think i'm on a youtube video
as it was somebody who does a great deal of um of video game commentary disagreeing with him about
that because he was like yes it's absolutely right how honorable how you know cool see that
that strikes me as some combination of of deontology and command so i think that's this
where people get tripped up on using words like right um that's what that's why when i'm using
outside of this conversation i i almost never used the words ethics morals or not even right
and wrong unless right and wrong or pre-established to me making the world a better place and that
kind of means exactly what your intuition think like what your intuition says it means uh where
people are more free to meet there to to do what they want enjoy themselves achieve their goals
whatever it is right the girl was his daughter right not some girl but the girl was not his
daughter oh no no relation i always thought it was his daughter nope okay i think it's care ethics
it's care ethics it's care ethics and i think it's also i think that there's there's a certain
extent that he was willing to go to and um to cure the world of of this horrible zombie fungus
and um losing this person that he cared about was not within that yeah so he's a bad utilitarian but
possibly good care ethicist bad utilitarian bad yeah and you know even even people don't like
utilitarians would say you know look uh if you could do this one thing that even ruins your life
and kill somebody and it saves the world you should do it everyone everyone says that there's
probably people out right are you you on slippery slope grounds and be like well then why do you
draw the line between that and killing a healthy people in person and taking their organs to cure
five sick people right i think you draw the line i mean at least in this case you draw the line at
being one person this one time to save everybody whereas like if we lived in the world so that
the one another you know alluded to another common thought experiment against consequentialism
baby chorisa what's baby chorisa oh it was the first it was the first chapter in the book you
lent me today steven i haven't read it in almost ten years baby chorisa was um an acephalitic
baby so um or ancephal oh no the winds are happening again
it's either ancephaly or acephaly but the point is that the baby is born without the majority
of their brain oh sure so they're born with the brain stem they're able to breathe and do um
impulsive reactions but there's there's no thought there um because because most of the brain and
the top of the head is the top of the skull is also missing so the question the parents wanted
their baby their baby whose name was chorisa her organs to be harvested to save the lives
of other babies yes and thus started the massive ethical conundrum that made it into this philosophy
book yeah and that that's a that's a different case uh than than the general main main criticism
i was going to bring up but that is important and that that raises the question of like what do we
have an ethical obligation towards like you would think any parent that would do that with
their healthy baby would be a monster well there's five other people here with sick babies i'll let
them go and just cut mine up and give them their organs that's that's all kind of screwed up but
we don't have i think the parents and the doctors involved understood that at some level we don't
have an ethical obligation towards this human it doesn't have anything that's like to it doesn't
have any consciousness doesn't have a personhood um so the the standard conundrum goes you're
visiting the doctor you're perfectly healthy is you katrina and uh you're visiting at the hospital
for some reason because that's important for the thought experiment because it happens to be that
there are five dying patients and they all need a different organ and they're all your blood type
and your doctor's like well one for five this is i i would i would try to switch on the trolley
problem i'm gonna go ahead and do this there's an obvious answer to that if um all of those sick
patients are going to die then sacrifice one of them should either they should draw straws
or one should volunteer to be sacrificed for the others since they're all obviously the same
blood type two if they're the same blood type as i am and that way and they all have different
organs that are failing and other healthy organs yeah one of them should die i don't have to even
be involved in that situation i stay healthy that is that is the most practical answer i've ever
heard to that but that was awesome you just came up with that right now on the fly that's actually
tim's answer oh okay so and that's a good answer but like to make to make the thought experiment
do its legwork imagine the least convenient possible world right so they're all dying of
some mysterious bone marrow thing and you have the same you have a matching bone marrow type
and they need all of your marrow it'll kill you to give it up but it'll be enough to save all of
them but they can't donate to each other because they're all sick okay that's always the case right
so i could give all my bone marrow well bone marrow you make more of they need a little bit
right now you're gonna get sick and die the point the the idea i know i know i mean there's such a
temptation to try to duck out of these when there's an obvious solution right um i think the standard
reply is that uh it has more negative consequences because then people simply stop going to doctors
because they're scared they will be harvested and killed and so the whole world in general is
worse off since no one ever gets any medical treatment at all exactly so that's that's that's
what i was going to try and go is the standard room but i do like your way of destroying it because
it was a it's a it's a that was baller it was baller as hell um credit credit to tim um if you
see him again before we see him which is probably going to happen let him know that we think he's
awesome okay so the the main critique of of consequentialism that you keep bringing up is
that you can't predict all the consequences and yet in this thought experiment they stop at like
you know two days later not a month later when it turns out that people are freaking out that this
can happen um so part of it is considering the long-term consequences and as in as much detail
as you can um or as reliably as you can i was just so the consequences it's um it's kind of it reminds
me of economics and economists trying to pitch important um tax policy changes to a focus group
i guess this is a planet money thing recently i didn't see it but i heard about it second hand
i've probably heard about it because i have heard every episode of planet money okay except for the
truffles one that's just a recent all right so did you know i think it's planet money and it might
be something else with money in the title that is also a popular podcast but i think it's planet
money um anyway they had economists from all over the board um all over the the right wing left
wing in the middle talk about different policies that they thought everybody would agree on i know
all economists would agree on and they came up with six and but they talked about why also it
would not be it never be proposed by a politician because reasons why all of them would be very
unpopular then the next phase of that was to try to pitch it to a focus group and i think what and
tim was the person who told me about this and he said that the frustrating part was that the people
in the focus group could only think of the first step they really had trouble uh conceptualizing of
any further implications so they could only think of the first part so take away um mortgage interest
deductions right but but then we won't have those deductions but then the cost of owning a home will
go up and that's it that's that's it that's as far as they could go conceptually um these these lay
people in the focus group anyway i was thinking about that um a lot of times when we're doing our
consequentialism as as lay people we can only think of one or two steps out right is that what
she was yeah exactly and i that's a really good example and i like the uh the the sad reminder
that the lay people aren't the best at thinking long-term prediction wise or long-term consequence
wise um and that that derailed me a little where were we as was pointed out on who's day yes we
know yeah yeah yes um unfortunately unfortunately this is true and that's why it turns out that
voting's a problem but which we have an episode about that's right that tim was also on uh not
that he's on this one but his voice that i'm remembering is on it uh he's on this one in spirit
in spirit uh what you were talking about steven is you know the people harvesting the bone marrow
organs or whatever um they're they're thinking it's hard to think beyond the first step of there are
five people who will survive if they have this compared to the one person the one healthy person
right it's not a standard trolley problem because there are there are other things to consider
outside of that absolutely um someone might consider like well what if it was done in secret
just once um so this i don't know what peter singer would say who might be a you know dedicated
utilitarian i would still say that you're doing something wrong by you know hurting that one person
you know maybe give them the option to donate what you know if they if someone is a kidney
well i've got two you know um the the what why can't you do it just in secret one time so it
won't ever have any effects except for saving you know four extra lives right is uh one of the
reasons that again i'm going to beat my personal hobby horse since i like virtue ethics is one of
the ways that i think virtue ethics has a leg up here because virtue ethics says that a person who
has the virtue of of not uh falling into the trap of killing people to save five and making the entire
world worse is someone who even when he was given the option to do it one time in secret to save
five people still wouldn't do it because that uh that revulsion in him of doing such a thing would
prevent him from doing it so the the one case that we want to avoid is avoided because of his
general desire to right but while we expect doctors to not make that choice to follow the
Hippocratic oath yeah right we expect that of doctors but there are plenty of people in the
world who we expect to make the choice of killing people to save others to save more people potentially
so rarely works out that way um and that's totally acceptable to us and that's within the
ethical schema is to have soldiers go out and and be honored for killing in order to save others
right or to save other interests or you know for whatever reason it's i i guess it is assumed by
people that someone made the calculation somewhere and said that the best way to preserve social
stability or our national interest or whatever it is is that we have to sacrifice x thousands of
people in war and that is better than the alternative consequence so we expect some people to use
x ethical system in our culture and we expect other people to use y ethical system in our
culture depending on their profession um i'm not sure about that like we expect soldiers to benefit
to like the command on high yes but i think that you want to do it with the commanders to kind of
be utilitarian and the commanders to be utilitarian and we want our doctors to be deontologists well
our doctors we also want to be utilitarian we've just made the decision that the best utilitarian
option is for them not to sacrifice the healthy person because then the knock on effects mean
everyone is forced off friendly reminder that there is a popular version of utilitarianism
called really utilitarianism yes that would let us know you're driving towards the consequentialist
and and not do this but the deontologists would also say absolutely not um it works it works in
both there's a lot of overlap so the and that that's kind of one of the themes of moral philosophy
right that they tend to go the same way like so the deontologist we mentioned the the categorical
imperative the other um so there are two formulations of it and it's supposed to be the
same general principle and these two derivations the other one is that you never treat people as a
means to an end they're always means themselves people being rational agents um if you're going
to sacrifice somebody as an as an organ farm you're using that person for for other ends not for
and they ask their own ends right what if you're using someone to help harvest your crops uh so
that that's kind of one of the problems again technology is kind of easy to poke into right
so like you know you're briefed at starbucks you're using as a coffee delivery machine right
you might ask their name and talk to them but for the most part you know can i get coffee thanks
bye um they're they're they're just coffee pots that you have to talk your order into right so
if you're not caffeinated if you're not caffeinated in the morning that's how you feel
now but you know you you it's okay and society recognizes that like you know you're not talking
as ending themselves while they're they're doing their job and just like you would society does
much smaller more close to society that would be considered extremely rude if you don't stop
by and talk talk with you for five minutes when you get your coffee for sure uh i also wouldn't
expect you know they're they're seeing me as you know a means to bring business in the company
they don't care what i'm doing there they're transaction they're transactionary relationships
right and then there are other kinds of relationships anyway there was one last point i wanted to make
on moral philosophy which was i sort of made the case that i feel like under the surface most of
these approaches are consequentialist at the bottom virtuosists argue for virtue because it
tends to work out well the dentologists the the maxims argued they're argued for there are argued
for because they tend to work out well um if the if the maxim was it's okay to steal go forth and do
it all the time that would be chaos so that wouldn't be a maxim that you could universalize i think
this is going to be the stretchiest one of these i think even the relativists could be utilitarian
at bottom or at least could be consequentialist have a consequentialist consideration because
the problem if we're to say our society is better than theirs well then we can do what we want to
impose our will on them and that might involve killing a bunch of people and that's bad so we
shouldn't so let's just stop it at the bottom and say we can't say what better that might be where
that is kind of going i was got some pretty decent steel mining there well i'm i'm also saying that
they're being inconsistent that they're being consequentialist and they're not being relativist
right so that's some good decent steel mining we will argue that uh their ethics are just as
good as ours so that we do not have to have this war where we kill a lot of them in order to impose
our morality i think that's sort of like the yeah we're saying we want everyone to get along right
yeah i think that's the fear that underlies most of more relativistic thinking that uh especially
you know like after a couple of bad centuries of imperialism by europeans and stuff it's like okay
you know what we can't just we can't say their savage isn't bad anymore whereas i would i would
argue that you can say that they are bad but you don't necessarily have to go and impose your will
on them you can use a softer form of power it's it's interesting right so i think like providing
birth control yeah steven pinger i think what steven pinger gave the analogy that if you learned
that one person held down a screaming five-year-old girl and cut her labia off with a with a sharpened
stone god i don't want this to be an episode all right well let me let me rephrase that if you
learned that your neighbor or if you learned that one person held down a five-year-old and
performed the procedures involved in female dental omethylation oh god there you go colloquially we
can't use that word sure we can it's the reality we can if you're squeamish about it we can say
it's a female circumcision it is a real thing it's a real thing it's a horrible thing about
facing so if you learned that one person did that the only question to ask would be you know
would life in prison be a severe enough punishment for him if so then if you learn that a million
people are doing it then then if thereby becomes culture and is magically above criticism i don't
think it's above criticism at all but the relative this does i don't think that's what's
happening in that situation either for why we why we feel that way about your neighbor doing it
versus a culture doing it doesn't have to be your neighbor it can be somebody in another culture
but if it was just one person that it's it's it's terrible it's a lot of people it's somehow if
it's one person it's easy to dissuade that by taking by throwing one person well that's one
way is to take them out of the culture the other way is to make sure they can't do it again in some
other way but we're talking about the gravity of what they did but yeah and and you know punishments
that are uh not atypical in cultures where that practice is also involved we're having emotional
reactions right now maybe i and their emotional reaction is appropriate with something that terrible
maybe i'm strange in that i think that if somebody does something horrible that the most
important thing is making sure that they don't do that again i don't think you're strange i think
you're just better person than i am instead of and i don't actually really think that people
should be punished if it can be avoided i i yeah i know i totally agree that's where i'm at all
that's where i i think a few weeks ago i made an argument that said i wouldn't kill a day you're
saying uh if there was another way to detain it right so yeah the important thing is to stop them
from doing bad things or the consequentialist is famously against the death penalty or reform him
right and then he can go out into the world and do good right and be a good person and maybe feel
so bad that he spends the rest of his life atoning and making lives better that's i mean that's the
punishment part is that he you want him to feel terrible like what if he changes his life and then
he can feel good about himself because he is actually making people's lives better no i totally
