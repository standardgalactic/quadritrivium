agree isn't that isn't that the nicer thing that is the nicer thing i isn't that better than i do not
have i cannot in my brain model someone who is a good person who knows that he did that in the past
that wouldn't want to atone for it for a long time if he didn't try to atone for it i wouldn't come
atoning is different than like hating yourself yes right did i use term hating myself you said he's
going to feel so terrible about it for the rest of his life and that's i guess i did say that didn't
i i meant he would have a strong uh desire to atone for his past actions yes as as one should
where were we oh yeah so uh i was gonna say the difference between the one person doing it and
the culture is you have to take a different approach to the culture because you know like
throwing people throwing everybody in i mean i guess that probably would help but um but you
can't it takes a lot of resources in order to yeah assault a million people and throw them in jail
and they're gonna resist and also that would be incredibly disruptive to their entire society
to have most of the people thrown in jail at that point that's just it seems to me the person who
says and therefore it's their culture and it's okay is someone who is blinding themselves intentionally
instead of saying this is terrible but we're not going to do anything about it because the costs
are so great we can't they they say oh but it's okay and i i dislike that sort of blinding themselves
yeah i think that that that is the blinding oneself to that consequence that the relativist
is doing they're not they're not saying it's it's wrong and i wish we could do something about it
but they're saying if i could press a button that stops them from doing that i wouldn't because
it's their culture you know and that that's the that's the weird thing that like philosophy in general
kind of has this problem but especially ethics like we're just talking about like the average
person on the street um everyone's a moral philosopher right um but well that i said that as a
joke and it's kind of my point that people people seem to think that in some weird way that like
peter singer's opinion on what's the right thing to do is worth just as much as you know
all that daddy's opinion of what what the right thing to do is and or what their opinion on the
right thing to do is right in a way that like we don't do with any other domain right uh my opinion
on physics is worth less than steven hawkins and no one would be tempted to say that well no we
should we should hear zuber out maybe he's got something to do this no he he doesn't not he
doesn't hold a candle to people actually know what they're talking about i think people are talking
about that with cons though where or i was like but this seems ridiculous this seems like this can't
be what his actual position is and then um i think he said something like yeah well i mean either of
us are famous philosophers and contests so and i said the tongue in cheek i i yeah no i absolutely
didn't mean and therefore we should take him seriously um i meant that as a point that philosophy
has a bad time pushing out stupid ideas so yeah no i i when i said that if you took me seriously i
didn't i meant that as a complete joke yeah we're not famous philosophers that actually sounds like
a somewhat serious argument though con was smart in a lot of other areas so that that i think is
the main reason that he's popular was popular and still is universal that universal universalizability
is that the word yeah it is actually a pretty important concept i don't think that was his
wording that came around a few decades ago but the same idea um is somebody trying to interpret
his wording it's it's desirable but it it's not the kind of thing that like actually works for me
think about for five minutes and there are there are other versions of the ontology i know less
about the ontology than i do about consequentialism utilitarianism and virtue ethics mainly because it
seemed on its face so ridiculous that i didn't spend a lot of time doing it and the primary and maybe
maybe you should well the prep the other reason is the the primary source on it con is uh notoriously
hard to read in a way that seems like he was going out of his way to be like confusing well i think
we learned a lot one of the things that one of the things that we learned is that i will no longer
call myself a moral relativist and that apparently um morals and ethics only apply to rational actors
and i didn't realize that before and that the kind of rationality that um animals have is different
i think that it applies in this extent that you can blame somebody for doing something wrong
okay so like and you wouldn't blame a lion for doing something wrong no you might you might analyze
it like man it really should have eaten that that pregnant gazelle because it was full of you know
extra food um and easier to catch exactly so uh and you might say it was wrong to do that because
it's you know lowering the chances to getting food next year but like it doesn't know it's just
doing what lions do um so that i think is why the the capacity for reason is stressed so much in
that field the last thing i was going to say is speaking of like rehabilitating people as far as
whether doing something wrong that is the only i think same way to deal with transgressors is to
rehabilitate you can there are like four ways that you can there are four theories behind punishing
people for doing something wrong the one is retribution you know i've or not you hurt me i'm
going to hurt you back just because that makes it fair and i forget the other two and one the other
one is rehabilitation you hurt me i'm going to try and make it so that you don't do that again
one of those other two is deterrence right i'm going to hurt you so other people will see
that this is what happens when you do this sort of thing right deterrence and then remove you from
society because you're a threat in the danger so um so we have removal deterrence rehabilitation
and retribution retribution yeah retribution is the only one that i really have a problem with
i think there's a lot to be said for deterrence and there there are people that need to be removed
yeah you said like you know some people feel bad about what they did and come to terms with it
some people lack that nugget that lets them have compassion uh there are broken people out there now
if we could fix that that'd be great but since we can't we're going to just keep you over here
behind these walls where you can't hurt regular people um like that's unfortunately the best we
can do you know we'll try not to torture you while you're in there but being a bit of a
bio-relative this i'm not bio-relative this bio-determinist myself there's something to be
said for uh at some parts in people's lives they're just much more violent and if those people you
can remove them for the decade or two that they are violent afterwards when they come out they aren't
as bad you know like boarding schools for teenagers with you know thick walls and locking doors
something like that for for people who have violent inclinations and i've met one or two
there's actually for some of them uh going into um military is is actually not a bad career
choice because that's the where they can get out there aggression yeah when i was uh probably in
middle school so when i was a preteen i was going through all of those different hormonal changes
and i remember having been really disturbed because i had violent ideation so i would be
walking down the hall and i think i just want to punch somebody and i think oh what a horrible
thing to think i'm a monster and those thoughts went away uh and i was just thinking about how
how you would talk to a young person or a kid and just be like hey let's talk about ways to deal with
these feelings for now in ways that don't involve actually being violent and then kind of let them
know that they'll probably pass how strong was your urge to actually do the violence i never hit
anybody yeah but um i was you know mostly it turned into self uh just really low self-esteem
and like self-hatred because i had a lot of uh violent visualization when i was a kid i just
like i'd be cool to mow down everyone in this hallway think of all the bullets flying in the
blood and everything you know but it was never a thing that i would act on and i never felt bad
about it because i was just like that's what guys do right we like action movies this would be really
cool looking it's like i was actually gonna kill anyone and were you like ever you never thought
you were going to no so did you just i don't know and now i wonder if that's like a gender thing i
had some deep like feeling like i had i wanted to punch somebody and i i never did it and i you
know i didn't even swear at a person um until i was in eighth grade once but yeah i think boys
might be taught to embrace their violence sides more it's possible i think i was also i was in
my head complaining uh ideate or ideation ideate people say in different ways yeah and visualization
and you guys talk about two different things i think they are so uh so i mean um i also had
plenty of visualization um i read a lot of fantasy books right and i would you know imagine different
things that were happening in those fantasy books and um if people were mean to me i would imagine
you know like the the ceiling falling in or whatever but the desire the strange desire
to to hurt somebody um that came from a different place okay and did you feel like it was deserved
though like someone had done something bad no it wasn't even for a person it wasn't even for a
specific person it was a i want to punch someone oh okay i must have had a different thing than
you then it was just like um it was just basic directionless violent feelings so i think i think
the takeaway is that it does happen quite a bit in teenagehood though i think it does i i like to
think i'm a very peaceful person and i like to think that i'm not the only person that that happened
too no i think you're you're pretty super peaceful and if it happens to you it happens to
everybody i'm trying to think of exactly specific times my memory sucks um yeah you know where maybe
an example you know someone pisses you off in traffic or maybe like is it have to be directioned
or is it just like in general like i would just love like just to just plow through all these cars
with my car right now like that kind of random thought my experience was directionless yeah if
it was a specific person then it is a whole different situation so it was just like a flash of
rage and desire for violence yeah but happened regularly for a short period of time and i was
just thinking if i were in it maybe if i were in a different situation maybe if i didn't have um
all of these other reasons to to not be violent maybe if it was even encouraged then things might
have turned out a little bit differently and good training and impulse control i assume
i decent impulse control i've never had good impulse control who am i kidding
all right um so yeah we made our at this point we've already made our conclusions we got a
little derailed and then i'm not sure if this is gonna seamlessly transition or not but here we are
we've wrapped up uh we didn't have any really listening feedback that we had stuff to comment on
so um no listening feedback section on this episode you can never tell how long our listener
feedback sections are going to be that's right so anyway this was a little different it was less
of a talking about you know a thing and from a rational perspective and kind of just laying out
stuff but i wanted to try and apply some reductionist thinking to what can we take apart from all of
these in a way that is actually useful maybe we'll attack a different philosophical problem
another time see if we can get to the bottom of free will or oh god no something come on that's easy
um all right so anyway thanks for signing up thanks for listening yeah come back in a couple weeks
and uh that's that bye bye
