philosophy which is seriously indeed often the more more stupid ideas are more popular just
because they're more entertaining yeah there's that too um well not often but sometimes yeah we'll
we'll have to cover philosophical zombies and at some point yeah we had a little conversation
about that today when i was saying you know most of the philosophers that i meet don't even know
what that is but yet we and less wrong talk about how philosophers are really into it all the time
it's because it's the one thing that the primary sequences on less wrong actually talk about as a
philosophical uh topic in a way that's super clear um so i think that's the easiest hobby
horse we will jump on but it is popular like i said in philosophy of mind uh david chalmers
writes books on it uh den den it writes books against it and these people are all these are all
people that are alive today they didn't all die 500 years ago like you'd think an idea this bad would
have um so the the last approach to ethics and then we're gonna go back and do a little digging
into each of them is moral moral relativism uh everyone has met a moral relativist most likely
they're the people who would say that there's no such thing as right and wrong you know your belief
is just as valid as their belief and there's no criteria about which to judge which one's more
right or more wrong that sounds an awful lot like the church i grew up in yeah it's a great
wishy washy nice way to approach things but it it doesn't really hash out the the moral relativists
will also want to say it's wrong to be intolerant of other people's beliefs and they chip themselves
before they even finish tying their boots actually we again uh referring to church we had a lot of
discussions about that about how we needed to be more tolerant of people who are intolerance
because that was also okay yeah i my first irel encounter with a moral relativist was in college
it was my professors and she used the example of female genital mutilation saying there's nothing
that we can say is wrong with that and i'm like you're a woman you're the last person you're like
the second to last people that i think that would be saying that this is a fensible position i uh
people like that i always think of as strawmen but apparently they they actually exist some of them
actually exist why strawmen i think the impulse is like when she think about rape when she think
about um child rape i'm sure i'm sure so like the it's not saying that uh the more and i don't
want to strawmen them too much the strawmen moral relativists would say well there's nothing wrong
with it they would say it's wrong for our society but if there's another society that enshrines it
well we can't judge art their society by the basis of ours who's to say ours is better it's like we
are but that's not fair so i prefer the the type of moral relativist there's more of an emotive
emotive uh philosophy that says there is no actual grounding in any sort of like objective
wrong odds and right odds out there but we still make our own decisions as to what's right or wrong
and we can impose those on others but can you can you um imagine a culture in which it is okay
yeah there were cultures where it was okay to rape children there are cultures where it's okay to
rape children right and so like and i mean i'm gonna have to find the article and i apologize
ahead of time if i can't but um i i saw somewhere that in places where it's culturally okay to do
that the long-term impact on the victim is less severe significantly less severe than in cultures
where it's not okay to do that yeah i mean so that there are if we were to i'm trying not to pick
real world examples but it's it's hard not to so like you know i guess we could use you know
child rape as an example so yeah that could be the case where if it's if it's normal and hopefully
your uh your abuser isn't super savage about it then yeah you might not be that worse off after
the fact but uh you know the second you move to somewhere that doesn't do that and you try and do
that then you're gonna scar somebody um so i think it's not so much moral relativism isn't so much
about saying that you know you can't make a judgment it's saying that one culture can't judge
so like i think it again depends on the moral relativist yeah i'm trying i think most of the
ones nowadays are that way which is really sad but there's there's others that don't absolutely
go that far there are some that are also you know just like full on no no nothing's right or wrong
i'm trying to be as charitable as possible um you know but like so it would be nonsensical and wrong
of me or at least incorrect of me to say women in the united states are treated on average better
than women who live under the taliban they would say well you're just judging that
based off your culture you know why would you say you know they would say that they treat
theirs better than you treat yours or that they treat theirs appropriately or something
they the moral relativist would say you have no place to stand if i challenge you that and you
say no i'm right they're wrong uh that that kind of comes down to the bottom of the way to defeat
any physical philosophical argument is to attack their very first premise so the premise that like
well-being is good is the premise that you take if you're gonna develop any ethical system
and if you're gonna deny that and like what is well-being what is good like uh you can't
get off the ground and that's how you just stop anything in its tracks yeah i have a question
about that sorry i'm talking a lot no uh i want you to talk a lot since you're very passionate
about this subject um so my question is i'm pretty sure that i've been using moral relativism
incorrectly for ever um up until now maybe because i'm about to ask for some clarification
so i mean early on unless wrong when we met each other i said i'm absolutely a moral relativist
and what i meant by that is that um between species and we're talking about you know like
the the three worlds collide type situation or you know between different species of mammals
or animals in general or um that there is some there's some relativity in terms of what is good
for them and what is bad for them right so there you know it might be good to die for your offspring
survival but you know in our culture we tend to think it's not good to die for your off you know
to die every maybe that's not maybe that's not a good example um maybe to eat your your competitors
offspring so that your family has a better chance of living that's probably a better example yeah sure
we wouldn't be in favor of eating our neighbors kids so in some cultures that uh are primarily not
human i'd say uh that's a that's a good thing eat your eat your competitors children so that your
your genetic offspring have a better chance of surviving and that's not a thing that we condone
in fact we'd say it's really a terrible awful bad thing um to do here so i thought that that was
moral relativism in that literally there's no good or bad aside from what we assign to it what we as
humans assign to it and we can only assign it to humans yeah i think um a moral relativist would say
they wouldn't say we as humans they'd say we as americans or we as whatever this in group is and
we can't judge that out group but honestly if i i can't judge the ancient romans for the pedophilia
either or the pedorasty you i think it would be safe to say that we've made progress from the way
that they used to do things i can and i do i'm okay judging people yeah so like we're better than our
as than you know slave slave owners because we don't i think it's good that we don't have slaves
and so you know it doesn't mean that they're all monsters it was normal for the time or something
right i'm just gonna draw the line of humans yeah i wanted to mention really quick too that i think
that like why are you not okay with judging lions that kill the the you know the offspring of their
competitors because that's what they do yeah but it's still evil no it's good for them but there's
a lot of things that are good for an individual that are still evil they can it's not evil it's
how is it evil for a lion to kill its competitors offspring uh because they are murdering someone
it's it's not murder okay it's not murder they are killing a thing that does not want to die
yes they have to do that all the time in order to survive i also think that's a bad thing
i i think i can put some of this to rest as long as we're using the words like moral and ethics that
all the big names and moral philosophy mill cunt aerostodal i think all the books talk about ethics
with reasoning agents um it would be ludicrous i'm sorry it's ludicrous to apply that to non-humans
right well so but but even to assume that they that anything is good for them in the same way
that something is good for us we're using two different uses the word good there so like well
we might mean something that is good for them is great for the like reproductive fitness or something
but when we talk about good for ourselves we mean like morally right you know what i mean you don't
just mean like good for our reproductive fitness right but um you know there are social animals
that also have moral codes there are things that can be done and there are things that will be punished
right by the other animals in their community um if they're done for example uh there is a viral
penguin video um adultery in penguins oh i didn't see this one oh there was a there was a terrible
fight um penguins are like like many birds they're serial monogamous so they stick with one mate
through the breeding season although there are um a certain incidence of extra pair copulations
and which were kind of just starting to understand the extent of through genetic testing and increased
observations but there are things like uh there are songbirds that if they what you never told us
what happened to the penguin oh um i actually didn't watch the whole thing because i didn't want
i saw that the penguins were fighting and there was lots of blood involved oh shit they got pissed
didn't want to uh i didn't want to watch a bloody penguin battle but that's what happened it was a
bloody penguin battle so a penguin got caught cheating on its penguin mate yes uh so i think so
that's something that they consider bad in their penguin culture right so to the point that other
people not involved came in to punish well yeah it was the two male penguins oh okay yeah so it was
the original mate and then the extra pair okay mate so i think that there's there's still a
component missing with penguins of like the irrational agent involved where they're not doing it because
look you've you've transgressed our codes this is the last time it's more like that's my fertilized
egg repository not yours i'm gonna fight you for it right and like i don't think it's even
articulated on that level with a penguin i might be wrong there might be more to it in your life of
of a penguin than i think but i don't think so well how do you think that they form connections
i think that in some ways it's probably a similar to us i i guess uh if it is there might be something
going on in their heads that uh the trail love you know yeah but i think i think it's kind of
just like urges there i think the key the key component for for a more legion is a rational
okay so we're we're defining it as morality only applies to humans specifically well to rational
humans too not babies not mentally infirm humans like so it's wrong for me to hit inyosh but if
there's a toddler in here swinging around a toy bat or something to hit him it's not you don't
blame the toddler it didn't it blame the toddler you blame the parent if you're if you're gonna if
you want you know like you know what i mean though it's not like the toddler isn't it's just
basically a mindless robot running around swinging its arms no it's not it can learn
i i mean i would like for the parents to teach at these things but if the parents aren't going to
then i would tell the toddler not to do that and i might i might give it negative reinforcement
for sure you you would you would discipline it you would reinforce the toddler that's what
morality is but you wouldn't you wouldn't assign blame to it in the way that you would assign blame
to somebody like if an adult came in here yeah what if do came in here and bit you hard i would
give do some negative reinforcement as long as it would i could still come back into the house
i would i would give do to you and urge you to give do negative reinforcement
use the facial expression that i get yes if you can't admit me i'd do whatever i took to get
him off of me if it was actually hurting me well yeah i'd be stubborn i love dogs i wouldn't i would
hate to hurt it but i would i would get desperate at some point right you like your blood inside
yes um but yeah so you would feel a public service announcement if you're bitten by a dog
hold still until the dog opens its mouth to get a better grip and then remove the dog's reaction
to something being still after its first grip is to get a better grip huh if you pull away it'll
just keep on pulling and shaking okay i did hear once that if uh you managed to get a dog to bite
onto like an article of clothing or like a rope that you're holding to keep yanking at that and
the dog will not try to go after you he'll just keep clamping on to that thing this can all be
gleaned through careful observation of the game of tug of war with any dog right but so you'd have
also through personal experience with dog bites yes oh shit so do they open their mouth long enough
for you to yank your arm away yes you just stay calm stay still and then the the first bites never
in the right position right if if the thing's still and it's not trying to get away that means
they they have the instinct that they have the time to get a better grip huh you can do this with
the dog just play tug of war and like let him grab it and then pull really quick and they'll
they'll hold onto it yeah and if you hold it still be blooded up let them grab it and then
hold it for a second they'll adjust their grip see i've never done that and i just always assumed
the adjustment would be so quick you couldn't pull away in time i mean i guess maybe hopefully
they don't want to kick in anyway so deal bites you don't hurt him but he's so small and easy to
hurt he is which is why you shouldn't do it ah so another uh if if dogs and children are just
enough uh you wouldn't blame a car that the parking brake failed and backed into you no no because
their car can't learn well yeah i guess but uh i think that there is a component of i think there's
in the field and to me there's blame versus like reinforcing behavior yeah is there a difference
yes yeah one would say you're a bad person the other one would say i wish you won't do that again
and you're a bad person no no wow you people are not as judgy as me you say you're a good person
but that behavior was bad i think maybe i shouldn't be a parent depending on the moral
philosopher that you are you can't see somebody's a bad person no but uh i think you i think you
can't say that about things that aren't thinking like they're just doing uh i was thinking about
how to treat a child yeah oh yeah exactly you don't want to tell the child that's a bad person
kid runs up to you and kicks you you don't say like you're a terrible child you say you're a good
child who does stupid things they say you're naughty don't do that so it's incredibly harmful
it doesn't stop the child from kicking so drinking or short-term the question in short-term
versus long-term but we'll go into child-rearing techniques another time okay so uh see i don't
i don't i don't care all that much about this this blame or this reasoning i care more as to
whether i can change the behavior yeah i think that which is what i which to me is what morality
comes down to yeah i think irrespective of like what you care about there i think those are two
different things but also what's your goal right my goal is to not be kicked okay but if
deo comes in here and bites you you can make sure it doesn't happen again by killing him oh no
right or you can make sure it doesn't happen again by you know going through a different technique
right that's what naughty dogs do when he's not a naughty dog that's right he's better than that
yeah that's right so you have multiple goals i guess is what i'm trying to say yeah uh maybe you
want to raise a well-adjusted child or you don't want to like ruin somebody right i'm not gonna
kill the kid for hitting me with a bat right even though that would stop the bat hitting yes
they have other long-term goals so as far as like character stuff that was something that that uh
conch and aerosol will focus on more than mill and bentham the utilitarians so the the virtue
ethicist virtue ethics is aerosol's hobby horse and it's less about like doing the right thing and
it's more about being a good person um i'm a big fan of virtue ethics yeah people people like it
part of the reason people like it is that aerosol was super down to earth whereas playdough was like
super mystic and and fuzzy fuzzy aerosol being down to earth was cognizant of the fact that
reality is super vague and i can't give you a set of rules that you can follow all the time because
the world will throw something at you that i can't predict so you know here's the kind of
way to approach life in general and that that's that will lead you to be a good person um the way
things i like about instilling good virtues in people is that you can't predict every single
consequence of every single action which is one of my main beefs with consequentialism as applied
to actual real life sure uh so what you want there are always unintended consequences yes and and
we're not perfect predictors we we can't tell what all the consequences of something will be
but if you find a set of virtues that tend to have generally very positive outcomes
in you instill those in people then not only will you usually get positive outcomes
but they will be self um self motivated what are these virtues that's a good question what is what
is a virtue if i say that maybe um a virtue is being honest that doesn't put me into the
deontology camp of always tell the truth no because you're saying honesty is a virtue rather than uh
it is a categorical imperative that no one ever lie when and you can turn honesty you know down to
one or up to ten so you know honesty might be like being super brash and uh abrasive with people or
or being you know super wishy washy never committing to anything those would be kind of the two extremes
around honest the virtue of honesty right but the the advantage in my opinion that uh virtue has
over deontology is that there is no intrinsic motivation to follow a deontological rule unless
someone has already really drilled into that deontology is great and if you want to be a good
person and value by your society you will follow these rules but if you have the virtue of honesty
by the very fact of having that desire to be honesty you are already self motivated to be honest
