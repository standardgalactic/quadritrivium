Or I guess that's what annual means.
And there are people who are voted as less human than some of the programs.
So I mean it obviously has a couple quirks to work out.
So I mean that's why it's not like the, that's it, that's the test we know now kind of situation.
But it's the first step to thinking, alright we're going to take this seriously or not.
I think we're done.
I think we're done.
I think we had some discussion on the subreddit and stuff but a lot of the stuff was addressed there and we can't go into all of it.
But I just like these listener feedback sections.
So do keep writing in, we've got the website where you can add a comment, you can email us.
It is called TheBaseyAndConspiracy.com.
That's right.
Email us at baseyandconspiracypodcastedgmail.com.
Or comment at the subreddit under slash r slash the basin conspiracy.
That's it, those are the only ways.
Stop trying to contact us in other ways.
I don't know how you got my phone number but I don't like it.
Anyway, thanks again for listening and we'll see you again in a couple weeks.
Let's try that one more time.
It must be in a couple weeks.
Yeah but see them.
Oh my goodness.
Thanks for listening.
Come back in a couple weeks for the next episode.
Bye.
