Then I will push notifications turned off.
I just look it up every, you know, a few times a day.
I need a ping to remind me to get in there.
So like the only thing I need is the dopamine
that I'm not getting by not being on it.
All right. Thank you.
OK. Yes. On that note.
And thank you, wealth again.
You are also a ping of dopamine every time we do this.
This thinking of patron, please feel happy.
And wealth is such a good name.
Well, yay.
All right, everybody, this is great.
See you in two weeks.
All right. Bye bye.
