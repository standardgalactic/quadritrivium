to have this new experience
and get to know this person on this level.
It's so much harder to consume romantic fiction,
or fiction with romantic elements
once you're poly, because
at least half of them are about the love triangle.
Like, I like this person and this person,
now I have to choose, and whoa, it's me.
I'm like, you idiot! There's such a simple solution!
You can have both Edward and Jacob!
But maybe that doesn't work for them
because they really do need to be monogamous.
Good thing the only...
Yes, but when every single story is that way,
it gets fucking annoying.
Good thing the only major piece of fiction I'm currently consuming
has the main protagonist with
three partners, so...
Which one's that? The Wheel of Time.
It's not really about that,
but it works out to where
he loves three women
and those three women love him.
So, that said, it's a much bigger
series than their romantic thing. It plays a very small part.
There's a much bigger...
Hey, I really like when there's representation
of non-monogamous people
in any kind of media.
There is. I wanted to be to
not do a disservice to the
enormous world building and character building
that this story does across 14 books
by saying that it's primarily
about a
poly couple, or poly
relationship.
Oh, I want to give a shout out also.
One of my exes
wrote a lovely book in which
there are lots of
poly queer characters
and it's called
Ascension.
I'll put a link to it
in the show notes.
So,
what if I got everything
I felt like I needed romantically from one person
but all the other stuff I need I can get from friends?
Or, like, so I guess...
It couldn't be mono.
Yeah, but I guess what I'm curious about is...
But it's not like a...
I mean, I have been
in my
long polyamorous relationship with Tim.
There have been years where
I have not dated anybody else, but him.
And when I do have
dated other people, it's not because he's not fulfilling
for me, it's that
I start to feel like
I want to get out there
and experience people
and, you know, have
new connections and I'm ready
to do that now.
What differentiates that from friend hunting?
It doesn't have to.
Yes, but
a friend relationship and a romantic relationship
are just different. I know.
And I'm only blabbering this because...
There's blends. Yeah.
They're definitely blends.
And often one leads to the other.
But,
I guess that's another great thing about being poly
is that you don't have the same kinds
of hard limitations with your friends.
Thank you.
And you can be friends
and, like, not worry that maybe
that hug was too long.
And, oh god, am I cheating
on my partner by spending too much time with my friend?
It relieves so much stress being able to be poly.
You are not constantly policing your emotions
and your actions.
That sounds like
one avenue. So the only reason
I'm kind of beating this point is because
this was a long conversation I had
our last, last wrong meet up.
This guy's position was more or less that
if you subtract the elements
of romance, which he felt was a troubling word
because it was hard to pin down exactly
what it meant from a relationship,
then it encompassed all relationships.
I'm curious just to see how I'm basically
trying to find a way to actually resolve
that confusion we were having.
I think there is
some confusion and that's why
we're saying that
there's a little bit of confusion around
how you can act with your friends
sometimes.
And you're like, where is this
what somebody else might see as a romantic
connection? Where is this?
And you
if you are giving yourself
freedom
to feel the way you feel
and act the way you act
you don't have to worry about
that distinction.
Because it is
difficult. I was talking to somebody
who's definitely monogamous and also much older
than I am. I talked to him about this
and he's like, yeah, I guess
I have some relationships with
a few women that are
romantic but not sexual.
And I call those women my friends
but we do have
very romantic relationships.
What's exactly what that means?
My relationship
maybe my relationship with one of my
partners is
we cuddle and kiss
and
we do not have sex.
Some people would put that in a sexual
relationship category though. Especially like a monogamous couple
you know who
but what if you're kissing your friends
on the cheek or the head
if they say something particularly charming?
I think
what if your friend is hurt and you go over
and hold them for a while?
Even like certain conversations you have
are really rather intimate conversations
which some people would not
consider appropriate for
they would consider it edging on romantic.
I guess I can see that.
Maybe you travel with your friend
and
maybe even is some sexual attention
that you don't act on
but is that too
romantic?
There's a lot of grey area
that it's nice to not have to worry about.
I think I'm finally
coming to a resolution as to why I was confused
talking to this person because I didn't imagine
lines were drawn where he thought they were drawn.
That's common.
I certainly wouldn't
see any issue with any of that stuff
maybe other than like if my partner kissed somebody
and we didn't talk about beforehand
I would see that sort of as a transgression
of the relationship.
Of your monogamy expectations.
Yeah.
But it's not the kind of thing that I'm axiomatically opposed to
but it would be weird if
the transition happened without a conversation
that included me.
That's where I'm at.
I totally understand as a poly person
I don't really like surprises
although I can get over it
if I am faced with a surprise
because those happen
but I like it when someone's like
I'm interested in this person
I might want to kiss them at some point
you know like I'm like
thank you for telling me
now I will be prepared if that happens.
But there's not always time for that right?
No there's not always time.
So sometimes you can get a pinch
I mentioned that I do get jealous
luckily again I have got
such awesome partners right now
that jealousy does not last long
but it's more of a quick pinch
and then I'm like
why do I feel that way?
