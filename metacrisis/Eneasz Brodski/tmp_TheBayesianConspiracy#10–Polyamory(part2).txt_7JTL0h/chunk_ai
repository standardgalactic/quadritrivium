and you are at a position
where you can open it up
that's a good time to open it up.
Sure, yeah exactly.
You come, I think that
that kind of naturally makes it so
that people tend to come from a place of couple privilege
if you're already in a relationship
and then you decide to open it
I prefer to
enter relationships already non-monogamous
and single people
can be non-monogamous too
even if they're not dating anybody else
and when I wasn't dating anybody to Tim
we were still poly
so, yeah
and I think that there's something certainly to be unpacked there
it sort of ties into
well, I've got a few more things
but I guess one thing that I wanted to do
was
first of all, do you guys ready to get into
it's almost three hours, I'm ready to read
we'll have to figure out how to parse this in a minute
but I do have one last thing I wanted to do
so one thing
I wanted to ask, so you guys have different stances
so you're both poly
under the umbrella term of consensual non-monogamy
yes
yet your different flavors of it, which one's better?
Ha! Ho!
You know, I've been talking about
why I think that
my way is better the entire time
I don't feel like I have to get into this
at the end, I think it's really
common for people who are involved
in poly relationships
to
think that their way is better
and
be really ready to say why that is
but all I can say, actually
in reality, is
my way is better for me
and I have lived
my life and I have learned
hard truths and I have made a lot of mistakes
and
I know I have a lot more learning
and growing and changing to do
so I can only speak from my experience
about what's good for me
Alright, that's a pretty soft point
Inayashi, here you go
I could never answer that question if it was asked of me
because it's a bullshit question
it's like asking what way is thinking
is better, is it better to be
conservative or liberal, is it better to be
you know, more Asperger's
or more extremely extroverted
or is it better to be close-minded theist
or rationalist? Well, that's an easy answer
Right, so that's what I'm gonna get
is that parsing it that way doesn't necessarily
I think there's different ways of thinking
and the whole, what is the
is it Myers-Briggs, the one that
is kind of ehh iffy but it's a way
that people often sort themselves
there's no
one way that's better than another
when you do, IntJ I guess
is a really popular one among
our sort of crowd
not to say that it's better or worse than any other
way of thinking, it's just a different way of doing it
Well, that's sort of the problem with Myers-Briggs and one of the major criticisms
is that it's a lot like a horoscope
where they all say great things about you
But, alright, so
maybe to put it a different way that's less like
alright, fight
I've given my reasons why
I ended up giving up rules
I've given my reasons
I actually haven't given
my reasons about hierarchy
but it's actually very similar
to rules in which it's
doesn't necessarily
allow the
the non-couple
person to
have a say in their own relationships
the way that the others do
and gosh that works
really well for a lot of people and
there are people who they want
to have a
satellite relationship or
all satellite relationships or
all secondary I guess
is another way that people refer to
that all secondary relationships
I'm my own primary partner
people have different ways of looking at different things
that they want and if
you can find people who want
the same thing that you want
more power to you
it's all about being consenting well-informed
people, I guess the way
reason I would caution that approach is
be ready for change
because people's feelings change
and
we didn't mention this but
when I asked Tim
why does Zeleizer
why is that a rationality thing
why is this a polyamory
rationality thing, his answer was
if you think that you're going to be living
for a very long time
or if you think there's a good possibility
that you will be
then maybe you want to be
with one person for your entire
current life span
but how do you feel about
being with one person if your life span
is many times more
than that
that's actually
part of my argument against marriage in general
the way it's traditionally envisioned
but we can save that for the marriage episode
that people grow
and people change and people don't always
grow in exactly the same way and given enough time
they're going to be different enough people
that others will fit them
better
that's what it was when I was 22
and I was starting out poly
I had a philosophy professor say the exact same thing
you just said in Yash
therefore it's right
it was interesting because he was
engaged to get married at the time
so I asked him but you're going to get married
so what does that say about your
professed belief that you guys might change to different people
it means that we're going to get married and we'll see what happens
I think if I'm paraphrasing correctly
maybe he didn't have a satisfactory answer
but that's what it is
and as far as the
functional immortality aspect of it
I think that's another thing to consider too
that it's one thing to commit to somebody for 60 years
another thing to commit to somebody for 6 billion years
and say
that is a really long time
but you could be
a standard human and do
sequential
monogamy and be married
for X number of years
until you don't want to be married anymore
and then marry another person for X number of years
and that's also okay
well that would be more like
what was the word you used for
non-enforced monogamy
de facto monogamy?
it's also
there's a cartoon kimchi cuddles
about polyamory which I will also link
where they refer to that as ethical monogamy
nice
but I'm thinking like
my great grandparents I think they've been married
for
60 or 70 years before they died
I think they were happy in their marriage
my in-laws
Tim's parents are
monogamous and a model couple
and so so happy
and old
sorry if you guys ever hear this
I'm sorry I called you old
but I'm never gonna hear this
so if someone
comes to the comments and says okay so this poly stuff sounds really interesting
