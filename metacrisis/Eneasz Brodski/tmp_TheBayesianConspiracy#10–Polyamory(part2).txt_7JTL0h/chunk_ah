Let's talk about it and now that we've talked about it
I'm not jealous anymore.
Some people who are in poly relationships
a very close friend of mine
who I've always thought
thought of as a very very successful
poly person
he confided to me that he had debilitating
jealousy.
Part of what really helped him
was figuring out
why, what are the triggers
and trying to follow that back
to what is he really
feeling afraid of
is it
is it losing his partner
is it
not having the kind of connection
that he thought he did
what is he really afraid of
and once he was able to address that
and then talk about that with his partner
things got exponentially better.
So some people really do get jealous?
Yes.
Because
my next question is going to be
if poly is so awesome why do some people have to
poly hack
conditioning yourself
so that you get over
the want, need for monogamy
and over things like jealousy
and making it so you can be poly
successfully and more naturally.
There is some practice involved.
There is some changing your mental structures.
I always assumed that it was because
I mean I had to do a little bit
but it was getting over the shit that society
has drilled into you.
Because for me that's all it was.
It was
as a man in society
you get massive privileges
I guess that's not
something that needs to be said.
But it also comes with you have to hold on to your man cred.
And if someone else is sleeping
with your women then all of a sudden
you lose all your man cred
and...
People were judging Tim
about that people
which had nothing
to do with our
feelings about the relationship but they were
convinced that I was
taking advantage of him when he didn't have another
partner
and that it took until
he had another partner
for them to even be slightly okay
with it because otherwise it was
me abusing
him in some way.
I was resistant at first
for a few months I guess
but for me all it was was getting over
the societal instilled
this is the way you must act
when you ingrain things into yourself.
What about getting over the need to be the most important person
to someone?
This is the thing, I've never had that
I've never felt any sort of jealousy and I wasn't sure
they were actual things.
I thought it was all just societal conditioning.
It's a real thing.
Like when I see
someone I love with someone else
enjoying themselves
that makes me happy.
That is known as compersion
definition alert, compersion
feeling happiness at somebody else's happiness.
Why would I be upset about that?
I think
Dr. Fisher might say something along the lines of
well
men are more inclined to be that level of
jealous because they don't want to be caught
raising someone else's kid
or something right so the
mental image of
their primary partner having sex with another male
means that they might be wasting their
life raising someone else's genetic
offspring. Such a waste of your life
to raise a kid that you love.
Well hold on
that's not what she would say either
or excuse me she wouldn't be endorsing
that conclusion.
It would be a natural selection.
My mental model
of her making it that quote
was speaking on behalf of our ancestor's
genetic fitness.
It would be like saying there's no point in adopting
right and there certainly is
I just don't want children in general.
Yeah luckily
that's one easy answer to
and especially if it's impossible for both of you
to have children then hey there's no
then if you have that inner ape saying
dude she's going to get knocked up and be raising someone else's kid
you know just your apeshine brain
not like a real thought you can just tell it
no dude we're both infertile.
Anyway I actually think
that's a great thing about Polly is that
my relationship with Tim
was able to change
and is
still flexible and able to change
and we still
love each other, adore each other
and are able to
be together.
I think that that's a healthy part of any good relationship
whether you're having more than one
relationship like that or not I think that
being able to grow together
whether in different directions or whatever is super important
I think that's awesome.
I guess what I'm saying
with that statement is that I don't want to
give ground and say that Polly people are the only people that can do that.
No
but as I mentioned
I feel like I'm building
flexibility into relationships
by being Polly.
I know you said you dislike a lot of things Dan Savage says
but one of his big things is opening up relationships
saves relationships.
He does believe that? Yes.
Man do I ever not agree
with him that is like the worst way to
come to being in an open relationship
is
if you feel like you need to save a relationship
usually they end
if you try and usually
it's not only painful to you
and the partner that you're having trouble with
which is why you opened it
it is causes heartbreak
for everyone else
that either of you
dates or is in any
kind of relationship with.
I'm not sure if he was saying
it to save the relationship
he was saying that having an open relationship
saves relationships.
I guess that's my warning
to anybody is if you're having
problems in your relationship
adding other people
is a really
not good
idea.
I was going to say it's as bad as having a kid to save the relationship
but that's not true. It's much better
than introducing a new life.
But it's a similar sort of mistake
you don't do something like that
to try to save relationships.
I mentioned that podcast in a few episodes
it wasn't just for me and it was a few years ago
but that sex nerd Sandra
from the Nerdist Industries podcast
I'm not sure if it's a thing or not it was a few years ago
but that's what that swinger guru said
was that people talk about
opening a relationship to save it
and he says that's not the case
if your relationship is on the rocks
opening it like this is going to just shatter it
if you're already secure, if you're already jealous
it's just going to break.
Build that in before you even start
build it in
build in that flexibility
build in trust with each other
or if you already have like trust
