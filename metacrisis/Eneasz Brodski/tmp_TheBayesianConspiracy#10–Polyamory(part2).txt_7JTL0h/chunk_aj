I've never taken it seriously before
I don't know where to start
well I am happy to link more than two
I'll link kimchi cuddles
I'll link Elizabeth Chef's
articles
more than two especially is a practical
guide to ethical non-monogamy
so that'll actually help you
figure out how to
maneuver a relationship
but I also said that it spoke more to your flavor than it did to Enya's
it talked against rules and it talked
against hierarchies
it tells you what to do
if you are going to be involved
in an ethical hierarchical situation
more than two is kind of a go-to text right now
they used to be the ethical slot
but more than two has taken over
recently
for example there's something that is
honestly the relationship bill of rights
and it's changed to reflect that
but I think they originally had it set up as
the secondaries bill of rights
if you're going to be in an ethical relationship
what to look out for
red flags
who you should be dating
I think I might also link something called date your species
that's great
advice for somebody starting out
because Katrina has been talking so much
some of the
advantages of having the
more traditional couple that is open
as opposed to the relationship
anarchie she does
it does tend to be a bit more predictable
and doesn't necessarily take as much
time out of your life
when you are mainly interacting with other couples
who are also open
afterwards you go back
to your own houses
and so it doesn't
there isn't the constant
drain of having to see someone every single week
and maintain the relationship
so it takes less time
it makes it much easier
to plan your life
because generally it's assumed that if you
have to get up and move somewhere
for work reasons or whatever
that your partner, your primary partner
is going to come with you
it looks very much like a traditional
business
and that is a level of security
that some people really need
because when you more have the
four open relationships with people
then you're not quite as much guaranteed
that and I personally
think that sort of freedom is awesome
but then there's other people
who are more than willing to trade in that
freedom for some stability and some security
that this person will still always be with them
and it gives you someone that is just
the default person
that you always go to, you do everything with
it's all the standard
arguments for having
a person that you pair up with
a significant other
so it was my default to assume that people
would date until they decide they want
to be exclusive and then be monogamous
relationship escalator
so that was
and I just want to throw in a note that
getting off the relationship escalator is
I think fantastic and freeing
other people don't find it freeing
and that's okay, that's fair
but then when I was
in a polyamorous relationship
I was told that
hierarchical is how people do it
and I was like
oh, in that case I have two primary
partners
oh, that's cool
yeah, that was more primary
that was my
and that was my response to that
as I spent like I
don't play favorites
they're very different people
and I have these two relationships
that are necessarily different because they're
with different people who I love
I love them both
I actually had to learn
that hierarchical isn't the only
way to do things before
and before I was like oh I just have two primaries
okay
so it sounds like there's a lot to look into
a lot of homework
anyway, actually
the truth is if you have some questions
feel free to ask us
also, I'm not sure
we really did that good a job of steelmanning
because it's just so hard for me to
figure out
I don't know if you should be inviting steelmanning
we invite very polite steelmanning
yeah, if you have a great argument
in favor of monogamy bring it to the table
as long as it isn't you know
you're actually doing polygamy and this is why polygamy is awful
yeah, we know why polygamy is awful
if you have a good argument to bring to the table
please do
you know
things tend to
things tend to get pretty
not good when you're talking about this kind of stuff
unfortunately
in the comments section, heck yeah
this is pretty heavy
topic for most people
okay
I would hope that as rationalists
as rationalists but to somebody who's maybe
being exposed to this through the podcast
for the first time
if you're coming to them and saying man the way that you look at
your primary relationship, you're married to 10 years
I'm telling you that it's probably not the best way to set up a marriage
or set up a lifestyle
that's gonna sound like an attack
if anyone says there's no difference between what you're doing
and fucking animals then they're banned
but I don't think anyone would do that
you guys know the rules
talk nice, bring us questions, it'll be fun
come to our subreddit
the Bayesian conspiracy
write us a Bayesian conspiracy
podcast at genehill.com
we gotta get a short array
or leave a comment on our website
thebayesianconspiracy.com
and if you have a couple minutes
put a rating or review at iTunes
I think that that gets us more able to notice
that would make a big difference
it takes three seconds
you don't even have to write a review so if you want to though go for it
thanks for listening
know this was a lot of relationship talk
and signing off, bye
you
