at least that's an answer it's what scares me as people who say no no i need to i need the moral
code from the bible otherwise or from god or my religion or whatever otherwise i'd be out raping
and killing people and it's like if that's what's stopping you i want you to lose my number real
fast like i yeah like that that's the the issue you you only you've gone through the whole experience
of parenting for example and the only reason you care about your kids is that you think you have
externally imposed duties to that effect uh one i don't buy it and two horrifying if true
in the same vein the last two lines people can stand what is already true for they are already
enduring it i think is what's for me important to keep in mind when going through the quantum
quantum physics sequences because a lot of that's some of that stuff anyway leads to a sort of nihilism
um anytime i think of the the fact that the universe may be infinitely big i quickly fallen
nihilism because then if everything is happening an infinite number of times why does anything
matter but you know i've already been enduring that being true for my entire life so apparently
i i could stand the truth exactly i like that a lot you know whether or not that's true
yes you put it more i was just going to try and reiterate but you already put it just
perfectly the corollary i guess comes in big gold letters on the
cover of a wholly remarkable book don't panic right you can stand what is true it was true
five minutes ago before you knew about it yeah exactly all right and since that one was so short
we are also doing the apocalypse bet today i think it's fair you grab this one if you'd like gray
all right so uh this is a post by eliezer that doesn't show up this was in the original sequences
right because that's what you're using is source yeah okay so it didn't migrate into uh rationality
from the i to zombies but it's about i totally know why too um should i hit it then or did you
get a chance to read it i did get the chance to read it okay and the the reason so it it covers
the idea of a prediction market on events that are of such grand import that they're going to
disrupt this the either the ability to settle the contract or the importance of settling the
contract in a way that that makes the bet hard to sell like anytime someone wants to bet like i
bet you the us dollar will collapse after you know in the next 10 years you can always take them up
on that bet because if you lose the bet you don't have to pay up because the elica dollar has
collapsed yeah and that there's a the problem with that is the absurd specificity of the prediction
that it implies if you think it's going to happen and give or take 10 years say i think it's going
on january 1st 2030 uh the us dollar will be worth 0.01 vietnamese dong currently the exchange
rates about 50 000 if i remember right okay so that that sounds like some serious collapse
um so you you could set up the simplest contract for this would just be all right uh you owe me
i i bet that it's not going to go wrong uh if the exchange rates higher than that then you pay me
a million dollars on january 1st of 2030 and if it's lower i pay you a million dollars and and
given the the odds involved this is a huge just a preposterously advantageous bet but in the all
or nothing scenario described the the prediction you have to make is so specific that if you were
right about all the reasons for the us dollar collapsing but off by three days and in fact
the dollar imploded on january 4th when uh east timor invaded hawaii then you'd still be out the
million useful dollars at the time of the bet which which isn't desirable and eliezer suggests a
sort of reverse prediction contract that still pays these sort of even odds on this where if i
think gold's going to become worthless in 10 years or you think gold's going to be worthless in 10
years and i think that it's going to be no earlier than 20 years before it's worthless then i could
pay you an ounce of gold every year for the next 10 years and then if gold is still worth anything
then you pay me i mean or if it's not but you're i'm getting a much better deal if it is then you
pay me two ounces of gold plus whatever interest for the 10 years after that and in either case
one of us has obtained the value of the amount originally bet uh net yeah which but it doesn't
have the same absurd uh specificity of prediction because if you if you're betting it's going to
happen in 10 years and it happens in 11 you've still won the bet overall but at much but it's
somewhat lower odds yeah the the so i was raised joe's witness at some i sometimes bring up and
they are very much a the apocalypse is coming very soon sort of religion so uh if you found a
true believer it would be entirely reasonable to set up a sort of bet with them that i will give you
i don't know a thousand dollars a year for the next 20 years and then after that you give me
two thousand dollars a year for the next 20 years and we'll adjust these for inflation every single
year right uh so in which case you know you end up giving them 10 000 and they end up giving you
back 20 000 and you make out unless the apocalypse does come in which case you've given them all this
money until the apocalypse so they lived a better lifestyle than apocalypse comes they've won the
bet basically they don't have to pay you back uh and on its face it looks like a pretty good bet
but it i'm smirking sorry for side barring but it puts me in mind there are businesses
that say we'll take care of your pets after the rapture oh you pay us like a monthly fee and if
the rapture comes we'll take we probably will take care of your pets yeah okay yeah that's
interesting i i would feel bad about practicing dark arts on that level but it's interesting that
you can get people to take that apocalypse bet if you structure it properly yeah i think the
reason it didn't make it in um is that robin hanson pointed out in the comments that it wouldn't
work and eliezer came back two years later long before editing rationality from ai to zombies and
said past eliezer robin's completely right about this and stop arguing with him yeah so what was
robins uh robin had a thing well okay robin had a thing about um some technical economic thing
about how due to interest or whatever interest rates this would not quite work out i personally
didn't understand it all i know is that i saw in the comments uh eliezer says dear past eliezer
robin is just right here your idea doesn't work accept it and move on which first of all i thought
that was pretty fucking awesome because that's like what you want to do as a rationalist right
like you publicly acknowledge you were wrong and you just accept it and you stop fighting it
and you move on with your life and i was like incorporate that into your brain and keep going
and that's that's exactly what you want to do for your rationalist right yeah i i found robin's
reason for it um the reason he gives is that the the interest rate which is effectively going to
be what dictates the odds of the bet um combines preferences about having stuff on some at some
future date versus the present uh and also beliefs about whether you're actually going to have to
give up anything of value to satisfy the contract and you can't in practice separate those two effects
in a way that makes it possible to set an appropriate interest rate so like i said stuff
that's over my head uh though the reason i personally think it would never work is because
if you think the apocalypse is coming you don't save up for the apocalypse you spend all the money
that you're getting from this bet and all anything else that you make and then after the day to the
apocalypse you're like well shit sorry i can't pay you 2000 a year i got nothing and i declare
bankruptcy yeah basically and they would get out of it i would expect to never see that money again
if i were to make such a bet because anyone who really believes in the apocalypse is going to live
as if they thought the apocalypse was coming i have a bet with my mom that i won't hold her to
because i already forgot the specifics but it was something like i'll give her a thousand dollars
if by 2030 the established consensus is that e-cigarettes are worse than regular cigarettes
and if they're not then she owes me like ten thousand dollars or something wow she was really
confident on this which was kind of insane that's why i told and she was like well you know i'm not
sure i was like well then let's let's put money on it not seriously ten to one odds and i i'm so
wait maybe it was the other way around do you have this written down somewhere no that's why it's
it was a throwaway joke on the phone but it was the other way around i told her i'd give her ten
thousand dollars and she'd give me one okay yeah so it was it was where i'm ten more times more
confident than she is right one thing i do want to say as long as we're discussing this sort of
prediction contract structure it's not useless categorically it is useless in case of apocalyptic
events for the reasons we've gone over but i do have a bet going over on whether the us will
invade venezuela to resolve the presidential crisis i expect that they will not and we have
a dollar rolling for every month of this year from me to the other person and two dollars rolling
back if it hasn't happened or from the first six months of the year which i've already gotten that
part but whether i turn a profit quite the size of the original bet will depend on it not happening
by the end of the year interesting that's pretty cool yeah this is a buck so this is just kind of
like just put a little money where your mouth is yeah nice is this on bets all bear witness
and no it's it's not made with another rationalist actually made with the friend that i spent this week
visiting okay but i would actually totally be willing to get behind us suggesting this as a
default form of prediction over time in bet's little bear witness that also like keeps it
fresh in everyone's mind yeah if you're paying out every month yeah so someone just goes in and
posts all right it's been 60 days now on this contract it's the second month and
for those rush more still hasn't caught fire yeah so i'm i have just ven mode two dollars to
david use of for people who are not familiar bets all bear witness is a channel in the less
not less wrong in the basing conspiracy discord where people bet on future events like this
i feel like there's an app idea here and you could just have your bets all bear witness
app instead of like your patreon app yeah and i think at that if we actually had an app for it
we might start running into a gambling law issues yeah that's fair you got to keep it small time
and yeah but but i do like the i mean i just get my receipt for my patreon every month and so if i
got my receipt every month that was you know handled as far as the terms of the bet set up in advance
and that money's either coming in or going out every month that'd make it nice and easy but
it would take some of the mindfulness out of it i want to have to write that check or send that
ven mode every month so cool i love it one thing before we um go that i found very interesting
in the last paragraph aliases says if the predicted date was hovering around 2080 i would
pick up as much of that free money as i dared which uh tells us that aliases thinks the end
of the world is coming by 2080 if was the start of that sentence though well yeah if the predicted
date if someone was willing to offer him a bet for 2080 he would take that oh i think what he's
betting on there though is the ai singularity yeah because that's one of the events he specifically
calls out as likely to disrupt the settlement of trades right and not necessarily the end of the
world but something where the world as we know it right the american dollar will not have any value
at all for whatever reason or because we're all paper clips or be it because we have transcended
the use of money what are the fucking years what are the exact words that harry uses for this uh it
won't end to the world but it will warm up a small part of its surface yeah the um we we are in
almost 2020 so 60 years to go from for from the original prediction i'll try and hold out that
long yeah i just find that interesting information i have i wonder if he still uh feels that is the
case um based on things that have happened over the last 10 years or if he's moved that date up or
pushed it out i hope he's moved it up yeah i think he said that he uh when um when alpha go happened
i think he said at that point he moved up his timetables for everything which i don't know
is it seems like a pretty significant update yeah um this is one of the cases where i would much
rather read uh guern writing about something than eliezer because instead of being a stream of
consciousness of essays guern basically writes a git repo of guern's mind and updates these
things over time and will note he changelogs everything so you could go through guern's
changelog and see january 21st 2020 this crazy thing has happened and i've just updated my
estimate for the singularity from 2060 to 2065 interesting okay and i actually did one of the
first things i considered podcasting was guern but his idiosyncratic publishing style presents
some unique challenges there that i haven't completely figured out yeah plus it's so fucking dense
yeah it's it and in particular his most famous stuff has pictures which on which the essay depends
for a lot of its appeal and like the this waifu does not exist got several times more traffic
but i think you guys brought this one up on a previous uh episode uh it's got several times
more traffic than any other page on guern.net but it depends on pictures so even though it's
the one that people would listen to most in the podcast that's not helpful because it you can't
because it won't work in podcast form did you say this waifu does not exist yeah uh he he trained
a neural network to generate uh anime girls oh okay okay right after the what they made that one
that trained the one to make human faces that exist yeah yeah um okay let's go on to a few quick
side topic things before we go into listener feedback and then end things sure okay uh the
first side topic thing i wanted to talk about was that um there is currently a rss feed for um
we want more that has the first few that has the hpm or podcast episodes right before the we want
more episode in the feed so you can like listen to it if you want to listen to the text if you
want to before you listen to the analysis of it however uh i will add this link and i want to
thank the person on our discord who made it available however you're going to start doing
that just natively well however it works easiest i just saw koi pasted this gigantic xml file that
i had no idea how to put into my podcast feeds so yeah i think it was an rss uh feed but did you
want to do it like i mean we can do it on the official we want more rss as well uh so if i'm
understanding this is sort of interleaved like we would hear episode zero discussing some of
what steven wants to accomplish with the podcast followed by chapters one through five followed
by we want more episode one followed by six through ten followed by the we want more of that
exactly oh that actually sounds although it would just be chapter six because then they
discussed just chapter six in the next episode oh right yeah that just how does it update which
episodes i'm doing um i i think he does it manually on the current rss feed oh yeah the
the thing he set up on github yeah yeah because he can basically just copy paste from the the
hpm or podcast rss feed in the order desired but if you wanted to do it on the official one i could
show you how to do that and it'd be like i said super easy um i'm flexible we'll have to we'll
talk about it afterwards yeah that sounds cool okay um yeah i'll get some thought in that case
the other thing i wanted to talk about is jojo rabbit yeah whole oh man i'm glad you brought
that up because i forgot to ask so it sounds like you liked it i don't want to i i i really don't
want to oversell things because i've noticed that like if i go in with just like medium expectations
for something and it far out shoots those i am blown away whereas if someone tells me this is
the best thing ever and then i go see it and it's like 98 percent of the way to the best thing ever
but not quite there i'm like not not what i was expecting so um you know some people dislike
jojo rabbit i hear some critics really we're not very pleased with it at all some critics are idiots
okay if that's fair uh but that's not even a statement about the critics for jojo rabbit i'm
just saying yeah yeah just it's it's true but sturdens law applies to critics as well as the
things they're criticizing yes is that 30 or 90 90 percent of everything is crap gotcha but uh i
went to see jojo rabbit and uh i was expecting it to be kind of touching and kind of funny but like
not huge in either way and the movie ended up making me cry twice same uh i normally do not cry
through any sort of movies uh so this this was just it was perfect the mix of of humor and
childish innocence plus like the horror of the nazi regime plus just taika boutidi ordinary
germans trying to be people but being subject to this regime and being evil because of it like
the combination of all of that was just so fucking amazing and oh my god it was i loved it so much
yay you might like it as well it's not the best movie in the world but it's really good i can't
give much higher praise than it made me cry twice i can only second what you know i said
i bet we cried at the same points i wish we had seen it together but at times scheduling was weird
yeah um yeah it uh it made me laugh it starts off hilariously i pitched the movie um basically if
you haven't seen the trailers the trailers don't spoil anything it takes place the
the protagonist is what an 11 year old hitler youth and his uh his friend is his imaginary
friend adolf hitler played by taika boutidi what were you gonna say oh i i haven't seen it so i'm
listen i'm following this and literally writing it down to watch later cool yeah and so i won't
spoil anything other than um it if you're familiar with taika from thor ragnarok or from what we do
in the shadows or hunt for the world or people um that's why i wasn't expecting anything too huge
because i was like yeah thor ragnarok it was funny but you know okay i'm expecting that kind of
humor i didn't know he could deliver emotion on this level either yeah and it was wild and again
i don't want to oversell this because that always ruins things for me yeah it's it's it's a good
movie it's not the best movie you'll ever see but it is a good movie and yeah the caveats aside
i or include it i totally agree but um and some people don't like it and i'm i'm for everyone
yeah i was just i was amazed because i i had no idea it was going to have an emotional load
