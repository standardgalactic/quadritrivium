to it and it did yeah and so i think that's what took me by surprise yeah so now we've ruined the
movie for everyone because now they know there's an emotional load to it well i don't think knowing
that will hurt your experience okay it might you haven't actually said which direction of crying it
went in so it's possible that i was crying out of rage at how bad this movie is perfect all right
so yeah now see now now you've primed some low expectations and the movie and people's experience
of the movie can only benefit that's that's the way to do it yeah it's always really hard to get
people to go see something that you really liked without overplaying it too yeah
like how do you tell someone like this is the best harry potter fanfic i've ever read
without them expecting fucking you know the best thing if they've ever read yeah yeah so i as long
as we're doing mover reviews i saw mid samar last night okay which is two hours and 50 minutes
that i'll never get back really bad yeah it was by the same i think director or writers that did
the wit they spelled the two v's because they're idiots oh yeah and um hereditary okay and hereditary
was i saw the i saw the witch hereditary was interesting it was a good spiritual successor
to the witch which if you didn't see it if you like looking at artsy stuff it's great
if you want to spend two and a half hours doing that you can't understand any of the dialogue
because they speak incredibly low with thick accents there's very little dialogue i don't
know any of the character's names the plots sucked there was like spoopy moments but that's it
and and granted i mean i'm a surface level observer of things and the analysis like rachel
showed me the last line of the script that they had for this mid samar movie and i'm like okay
that did not come through to me at all mid samar is this like made up swedish cults summer
festivity thing and their their grad students they're gonna go do this with a friend i've heard
about this movie and they go and the girl the protagonist has this conversation with her boyfriend
that you're meant and worked perfectly to hate because he sucks um that no no we need to get
out of here like nobody knows about this stuff we're all gonna die like that because movies like
she's genre savvy for that for that conversation of saying look you know how this is all a secret
like there's no way that we're gonna get out of here we should leave and then she just forgets
that whole thing and and without spoiling anything else like it's like no man just you had it and then
you just you just pick up the idiot ball for the rest of the movie and in her defense the idiot ball
was presented in the form of drugs being given to people constantly oh well so this is it was
actually a beautiful movie to look at and it was well choreographed and there's several shroom
trips involved and things look like a shroom trip i mean if i was drugged up i might have a hard
time doing anything reasonable too that's fair um but it but so so as far as visually it was a really
fun movie i it just could have been an hour shorter um but like the their their visualization of what
it was like to be outside on mushrooms was actually pretty good okay like things are breathing and
moving in a way that even later on you're like why the hell is oh yeah because she took shrooms and so
um that that that part was fine but anyway that was the most recent movie i saw and i
highly regret seeing it okay did you have anything not related to anything rationalist um
let's see one podcast i would refer to people's attention uh it is not rationalist but the the
author is a Mormon and considers it a Mormon apologetics podcast although it i honestly
listened to dozens of episodes before i picked up on his religiosity so either i'm really oblivious
or he's impressively subtle in any case he disagrees with rationalists on a lot of things
but he's a fan of scott and for a religious writer who most who put out like in the last two weeks
an episode entirely called the blind spots of atheism he is incredibly good at engaging respectfully
with the people he disagrees with so he like i've corresponded with him a little bit by email
about some other subjects like why there there are so many Mormons getting into speculative
fiction these days and the answer to that apparently is because Orson Scott Card got a
professorship at BYU oh okay then it networked effects from there but he's incredibly good at
discussing rationality adjacent themes and being respectful and thoughtful about it even when he's
disagreeing with whatever the modal rationalist position is he's got a moderately scathing
criticism of the Mormon transhumanist association which i didn't know was a thing until i listened
to his episode about them but even when he's basically when he's talking about what an inquisitor
might consider heresy he is still very respectful methodical and not contempt like there's no
contempt and no animus when he's talking about these things so if you want a rationality discussing
but non-rationalist podcast uh we are not saved also readable in text form at wearenotsaved.com is
a really good one and he's he's the second podcaster apart from Anyosh who convinced me that a podcast
was a thing to that i could sit down and do sweet awesome i'm downlining an episode now that sounds
like a lot of fun going on to listener feedback sure uh the first one isn't really a feedback
in so much as it is a list of links which are going to be included in this episode uh but
Lorian Chang i believe from the subreddit gives us a whole bunch of air pollution links which we
didn't include when we were talking about air pollution in the last episode uh there's one
on teen exposure to air pollution reduces IQ levels long term one on air pollution raises
dementia risk one on air pollution deaths and then also uh we got a link regarding medical staff being
fine with long hours doctor suicide rate highest of any profession so a bunch of really interesting
links to um backup things we were saying before about air pollution being bad and contradicting us
on doctors being okay with their hugely long hours when was the doctor conversation um when we
were talking about people who are uh okay working a lot and not needing breaks all the time oh you
guys were talking about that i didn't feel that way because i always feel super lazy that's why
i didn't resonate okay i remember yeah perfect i have a bunch of projects that i don't finish for
that reason and um one of the reasons that i settled on my produce something and fix it later
podcasting method uh people who listened to the first couple of episodes i apologize i am working
on remakes but for the sake of my actually getting anywhere on this project i had to stick to a
schedule and then go back and fix it even if that was more difficult um as far as the long hours
i'm with steven on this one and if i could somehow if i could do what the what i saw in a recent
article for an ad agency ad agency in new york and work a 25 hour week by default plus things that
require you to stay into the late afternoon that would be worlds better than anything i currently
do well because a lot of time is just spent you know filling out the clock yeah like i don't i
don't got six hours i don't got eight hours of work today but uh i'll just work really slowly
so that i go home at the right time and i don't want the company to think that they need to give
me more work and the company doesn't want to think that they're paying me for an incomplete job
so even though neither of us would actually prefer this it's well damn you molak yeah exactly
i'm reluctant to add to that about my current jobs so okay well i'll push through and just
say that we had that conversation the the head of hr was visiting the denver office most of our
office is in royal oak michigan which is two hour two time zones ahead and they leave the
office at six p.m. which basically means that after four p.m. our time we shouldn't really push
to production or do anything because there's no one there's not a full office to help fix if
something explodes so our last hour or so every day is typically pretty slow um and our hr guy
was kind of surprised about that and i was like that's that doesn't mean that we're not working
it means that we can't like finish something at the end of the day it's in in programming it's
common that you don't push things you know the lat at the second half of friday right because
if it takes a couple hours to pop up and then the f4 o'clock on friday everything explodes then
everyone has to stick around till it's fixed so blow it up on monday morning not on friday afternoon
yeah i want to feel like that's couched enough my job safe i want to skip the next feedback because
that involves jess so going on to vape carl marx uh also from the subreddit talking about the straw
thing when we were talking about a pollution plastic pollution that kind of stuff uh every marketing
department was super happy to have a thing they could do that wouldn't cost anything and they
could say made things better it doesn't hurt to do it plus it kept them from having to make
real changes so it's a win win from a rational business perspective uh yeah that's that's i think
i touched on that once before that corporations uh can't like you but corporations can be woke
and it's really much more of a branding thing than anything i just went out in fact when i bumped
into you we went out to the place next door and my brother and my mom were in town and they had
whatever biodegradable straws my mom was like i hate these because they always get soggy and stuff
and useless and yeah and i'm like yeah it's it's a drag because on the individual level what can
you do to fight you know climate change or the pollution of the planet it's like i personally
can vow that i'll never spill 4.3 billion barrels of oil into the Gulf of mexico um but given that
that shit happens it's like all right cool what did you just even oh i i uh i used the right straws
and energy efficient light bulbs my whole life it's like great well thanks like and it yeah yeah
this straws thing really doesn't make any difference but it lets them look like they were doing
something different it lets them create a commercial with one of the genders handing a coke to a
swat team guy which doesn't actually make the world better in any way but all of a sudden you look
like you're you know socially responsible or whatever wait is that a thing that that commercial
yeah i don't know which gender it was because i'm not familiar with them it wasn't the um
Caitlyn Jenner it wasn't camp it was it was it was a child Jenner right it was yeah youngish
i have no i don't that's the only look like teens in my estimation who knows yeah but yeah i remember
there was um there's an snl bit making fun of that commercial okay uh or some other comedy sketch
maybe maybe it was key and peel but that sounds too many years ago but yeah it's hilarious no here
have a Coca-Cola and it was just surreal and stupid yeah yeah yeah car vape carl marx also says
when i think it was me that said the whole nation is more left than right uh the response is what
by what metric i can't imagine one that would be a greed pond that has america as a generally
leftist country if you look at the policy positions of the democratic party they would be
almost center right in most europe which yeah that's that's that's fair
maybe just feels that way because of our nice little bubbles although the far right revival
in a lot of europe has would kind of move the us relatively to the left that's true in western
europe then i guess because eastern europe and is is really having a far right revival yeah
and it we're definitely very very very conservative uh in both small and large sea
senses i guess uh compared to norway yeah yeah now that's that far right revival is is kind of a
shitty thing because you know my home country is in eastern europe and they're having that same
problem well your current country is having that same problem too so that's true but it's worse
in poland where these people are actually okay fine trump did get elected but damn it i'm trying
to say it's worse there um i mean the the hungarian uh closet fascist party yovik actually has
its domestic phone number and in 1488 oh really yeah their their phone number in budapest ends with
that what's the significance of that uh the 14 words uh white supremacist slogan that i'm not
going to dignify by repeating here and then the 88 is hh right right i knew that from worm um
incidentally empire 88 is possibly the best name ever given to a white supremacist gang
and i'm glad that wild bo has copyright to it so nobody else can use it nice well i just imagined
some white supremacist reading where i'm like really enjoying it be like great gang name right
here guys we should change in getting tattoos and stuff wasn't also i don't hope that happens but i
hope it's appear on page 88 of mind calm for something the 14 words i don't know if there
actually are a german 14 words the 14 words are uh two similar formulations of a slogan
by an american white supremacist david lane in english okay well never mind then i was wrong
about that david the anarchy fair facts has has some complaints about how i represented him which
is fair now that he says it um the developing world bit he says was about all pollutants not
co2 specifically i should have made that more clear sorry um okay i i did think you were talking
about co2 specifically at that point but uh if you were talking about all pollutants very much um
i agreed because when you look at maps of where like ocean plastic is coming from and
where all the dirty fuel is being burned and leaving smog that you can literally
like see a few feet in front of you yeah that's that's china that's india that's those places
the uh the main river that dumps out of china into the pacific ocean
is spewing plastic like crazy like when people are worried about their plastic straws getting in
tortoises noses that's that's because of the trash that gets shipped to china which they then um do
not necessarily great things with in the us we have pretty tight controls above where our trash
goes it's usually well sequestered in landfills so yeah your straws weren't contributing to the
problem anyway yeah if you want to reduce overall air pollution you should be supporting
electrification and natural gas like if you get people cooking with electricity and natural gas
in rural china and india you will do an order of magnitude more good than you're going to
accomplish by trying to get american co2 emissions down we definitely burn an unhealthy amount of
oil and it would be good in the long term to fix that but uh cooking on a wood burning stove is
so much worse for everyone concerned yeah uh david says i'd argue the dilly like smog is at
least as important as warming but i got the carbon and pollution wires crossed in my brain
so cool uh he does also say you need to consider the time series the emissions and now we're talking
about just carbon emissions the emissions of both china and india are trending up while americas and
europe's are flat or falling so you can't really say that america and europe are driving warming
since that implies an upward trend um i don't know like sort of point taken i i don't necessarily
agree if we're still putting out the most emissions per capita each year the more emissions being put
out is what's causing more warming right so i would probably say we're doing the driving but
if you mean it in terms of who's increasing their emissions each year then yeah i guess that's more
of a semantics argument well and if you're looking at what's going to cause global warming
catastrophe in 50 years he's arguing it won't be the u.s right um it'll be that said if you
want to feel some optimism here i think episode 170 the great uncoupling of sam harris's podcast
he interviews um andrew mccaffey and it's just it's kind of like a steven pink risk like positive
vibe on uh hey look yeah technology stuff is you know especially emissions is is is terrible
but china and india have access to things that we didn't have when we were when we were making
this big of a mess namely that we've already found some solutions that they might implement
faster than we did yeah so i think i think it's basically unconscionable to ask china and india
to stay in you know levels of poverty that we would not tolerate so obviously their energy
consumption per person is going to reach our levels at some point as it well should um it just
we just want the energy to come from good places exactly yeah we need to start working on that
nuclear fusion i mean start working on it's like it's done we just need to start building them
no we got fission oh yeah okay fine i'm walking off the uh now getting getting fusion right would
be awesome i think if i if i assuming no scaling no economy of scale i think i crunched the numbers
on this once and figured out that a fusion plant large enough to produce like assuming
discounting transmission losses a fusion plant big enough to supply the us overall demand for
electricity would be the size of the port of los angeles okay and uh that sounds like a reasonable
plot of land to give up yeah well once we get fusion working and while everyone in nevada
doesn't want a yucca mountain to be built because solid radioactive waste fusion doesn't have that
problem anything goes wrong with fusion it vents to the surrounding environment you probably don't
want to be within a few hundred feet but it's not going to slowly kill you over years if you live
three miles away i also like the point that someone made is that uh burning coal also has
radioactive uh particulate emissions it's just that when we burn coal it's blown out into the air to
infect the entire world whereas when we have fusion uh the nuclear waste stays in solid form
so we can sequester it somewhere that's safe as opposed to putting it into the atmosphere
yeah there there's a kind of cool uh commodity based on a related issue um the steel that goes
into making geiger counters can only come from one source like one category of source and that is
ships built after we started making ships out of steel but before 1945 why because all because
ships during that period only have background sources of radiation in the gases used to make them
but if every piece of steel made after the trinity test has extra radioactive crap that was
spread through the atmosphere blown into it and it adds an extra source of radiation that
throws off the geiger counter so this low background radiation steel is mostly collected
from like sunken german warships huh so geiger counters are gonna get really expensive so if
you want one buy one now um sort of after i don't know how long it's going to take but eventually
since we haven't had nuclear detonations in air for a very long time um eventually those
