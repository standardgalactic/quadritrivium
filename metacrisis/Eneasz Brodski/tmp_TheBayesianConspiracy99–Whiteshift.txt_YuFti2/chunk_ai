exogenous radiation sources will have just decayed and maybe around the year 2200 we can go back to
using to just making plain old steel and putting it in geiger counters and hopefully we won't still
be spewing radioactive waste from coal burning into the atmosphere at that point i don't know if
that's i actually don't know if that's a source that's accounted for because i the the biggest
radiation source i'm familiar with in coal is thorium i want to say but i don't know enough about
specific radioactive decay chains to be sure of how that would affect things oh and at that point
we'd already been burning coal for a long time yeah so i i don't know if that's a source that
if that's actually accounted for and if it is then every geiger counter that's ever been made
is badly calibrated because we started burning coal in what early 19th century yeah well i mean
i'm sure somebody realized that problem and it calibrated well enough for our purposes yeah
david also says uh david also says should be the name of his podcast dude i'm not super
confident in this but i'm pretty sure that coastal china has a much higher per capital
co2 emissions rate per capita sorry co2 emissions rate in the usa they just have their numbers
artificially lowered by having a few million people living in basically third world farms
which don't admit admit much carbon um i i never thought of that i think that's a
damn good point because coastal china lives a lot like the us does in terms of energy consumption
so why are their numbers that much lower per capita very well maybe for because of all those
millions of of farmers in the inner inner country absolutely i want to be perfectly clear i didn't
mean my last joke as a pejorative it's it just uh it's not saying that you say too much it's that
you say a lot which isn't a diss and everything that you say is valuable and it's really interesting
so that's that's actually a really good point and i would be surprised that is uh i'm amazed that
that's not a major part of the consideration right you've got people a large section of the
population that's basically producing no no emissions because they're not doing anything yeah
and then their numbers are relatively like ours and it's like well that's the numbers that work
yeah okay that yeah i'm surprised and intrigued i would include as an example of the problem david's
talking about north korea nobody owns a car so they don't really so they're probably not emitting
much co2 but the embargo has got to be restricting the technology they're using so i'd expect that
all of their power is coal fired because they have plenty of coal and people are cooking with either
coal or coke or wood which put out a lot more pollutants per meal you cook than any than modern
heat sources so north korea as an example i think would i don't actually have specific co2 output
figures for them but i would expect that they emit much less co2 per capita than you would think
but a great deal more in the way of other nasty pollutants mining gold with mercury or that kind
of crap yeah finally david ends with i kind of begrudge you saying that i said most pollution
comes from the developing world putting me on blast because the usa still emits a lot of carbon
and then talking about choking on smog and plastic in the oceans killing endangered species
both of which are far and away driven by the developing world more than the developed world
just wanted to point out that you should feel bad about that but not really bad
and do you feel a little bad i do actually kind of feel a little bad we started talking about
carbon and use the us numbers for carbon but then switched to talking about smog and plastics
which was not fair well what mistakes we made there we didn't have the virtue of narrowness
that's true we were talking about pollution like it's one thing yeah all right hey bring it home
if only we'd read this pot none of this uh sequence before i wanted to say montan bailey but that
doesn't apply here because you're not retreating to a defensible claim these are just two different
claims that are being conflated by bad category boundaries yeah all right and our last feedback
is from philosophist who this must have been on the discord because it doesn't have a uh
subreddit stamp i want to express that permanent hopeless malphoy was something i disliked because
it infers the limitations of rationality at a point where rationality was winning the day uh this
is when we were talking about the final chapter of draco malphoy interacting with harry potter
thinking to solve a problem is so frowned on in the art of story making that this particular
instance works against the cause it was however realistic enough to be something that at some
point happened with a character but draco was reformed from egoist fool to rationalist he's
the reason we should keep trying to convince people to have more rational and thought out
opinions he was our only hope and then his rational soul was murdered not cool i'd never
thought of draco that way before which is why i really wanted to pull this out but i think he's
right isn't that that's kind of what we want draco is the everyone else in the world that we're
reaching out to that we can make better through rationality or not that we can make better but
whose lives can be improved right he's definitely supposed to be i mean harry like harry says as
much to hermyony when he's talking about about draco after the trial it's like okay no he grew up
in the most closed prejudiced pure blood environment that it's possible to have in magical britain
believing that you hermyony for example are the worst sort of human being and need to be
gotten rid of and all this other crap and despite that it took me seven months of manipulating him
at school to the to get to the point where he had trouble dropping you off a roof i think i think
draco is not meant to be every person we're reaching out to he's meant to be the hard cases
yeah right but but just thinking of draco as the people we can save i like that thought me too
that is a happy thought for me knowing that there's somebody you can save already significantly
improves the apparent tractability of the problem like anybody who like does like books of puzzles
knows this knowing that there is a solution is yeah makes it feel like an entirely different
order of problem than not knowing if the problem is even soluble yeah exactly maybe he shouldn't
have been left there in the story that it was sort of an abandonment at the last moment hi
we'll have to give it some thought i read that and i've got it saved but i still need it's
still processing for me yeah well not happy note anything else we've got to we've got to add
no i think on that happy note we can think our happy patron yes for bringing you this bummer
of an episode well actually most of the episode was great mr this episode's patron is christopher
james who i put in the note here was a former supporter and then jump back in so thanks christopher
means a lot obviously thanks for keeping the lights on around here making things sound good and thanks
for helping to bring this rationalist word to more of the draco mouth voice of the world
maybe they will not have their rational soul murdered couldn't have put it better myself thanks
also thank you very much to gray for showing up giving us this episode this week sitting in for
jess it it was really interesting and like i said i'm going to keep listening to this podcast
because it sounds really cool and i'm gonna listen to yours when i can find it and i'm
going to re-listen to this one to better process everything that you were talking about this is
awesome thank you yes it has been just beyond awesome to to be on here um meeting everybody at
both ends of this of this trip i took was just great and uh i have actually honestly been
considering moving so knowing that there is a nucleus of a community of people that are easy
to interact with here is pretty awesome i would add that the issue one of the issues that i've
had with minnesota is that the social norms that we like as rationalists about dealing with other
rationalists the the ass culture in particular are very much not the social norms of the the
minnesota defaults too okay so it's um we have a small core group push up to the meetings i'm one
of the two people who runs the mailing list so uh email you can email me at gsv bemusement park
at gmail.com if you're in the twin cities area and wish to be added to that list how are the social
norms different some people call it passive aggressiveness the term that everyone agrees on
captures it without being pejorative is minnesota nice there's a very low threshold
to engage in vacuous small talk and a very high threshold to advance your interaction with someone
even if you enjoyed the small talk i was acquainted with someone from uh an eastern european country
and this is a thing that like i've noticed from some of my relatives too and uh she she basically
said the same thing that a lot of people from eastern europe come to the us and at first they're
like shocked that everyone is constantly so friendly and like everyone is so open and trusting and it's
like it feels like an imposition because they have a lot of walls and it's like all of a sudden
everybody wants to be like your personal confident confident and best friend and it took her a while
to realize that americans make a lot of very shallow connections where everyone is very friendly to
everyone and happy and smiling and in europe she said in eastern europe if you're smiling
you're probably an idiot because life sucks there's not a lot of reason to smile you unless you
have you know some damn good reason you shouldn't be smiling you know but the when people do smile
at each other and become friends they like form really deep bonds and she said like in america
she simultaneously felt very invited and welcomed by everyone but also very isolated because like
forming those really deep friendships she said was much harder in america because everyone
stops at the surface level and to get to that deeper level like you're talking minnesota nice
to get to that deeper level of friendship is much more difficult people who are more standoffish
yeah i i spent a lot of my early life isolated for that reason i have a strong preference for the
eastern european way of doing things managing a bunch of small a bunch of really shallow connections
is considerably harder for me than managing a couple of high quality ones so and when there aren't
when you aren't in a position to meet a lot of people you don't meet a lot of high quality people
so it's hard to have more of those connections um but the the way that one of the things that makes
me so that makes me find interacting with other rationalists so much more pleasant than
the baseline human is that there are norms that seem to accommodate this there's no encouragement
to just have these shallow connections and there is active encouragement to develop the
connections that you make and it's it's great to be part of a social an expanding social group
that does that so thank you to bayesian conspiracy thank you to bayesian conspiracy discord um
everyone who reads late star codex and less wrong in comments and these sort of things
i know i'm not the only one it's a lot more pleasant with everyone interacting with everyone
doing it this way that's awesome all i can think of is pointless anecdotes to add to that but i'll
spare everybody and just say that sounds great i yeah i agree that's i remember robin hanson this
isn't the anecdote i this isn't the anecdote i was scrapping this is a more useful one when robin
hanson was in town for his um podcast with sam harris we went out to lunch we went out to dinner
with him and he asked like so what is your your guys's less wrong community work on and i was like
nothing and like what do you mean he's like well some people have like a startup they're doing like
a an app or something i'm like oh we just have the community that we like that the norms the
i it was a way less articulate version of what you just said i've actually had some conversations
both on discord and off um with jess last time i was here about what a rationalist startup might
be like and considering that things like dragon army have historically failed and that one of the
chief criticisms i've been reading about rationality recently is the that we're not
doing anything that way it might be a huge piece of branding for there to be one such business
like the first the IPO of the first rationalist startup would make scott and ellie as her household
names and get people reading this well if anyone has a really good idea attach this to it perfect
yeah all right well thank you for listening everybody and we'll see you again in two weeks
