Yeah.
Scroll down.
Who are we thanking?
Looks like we are thanking Emilio Alvarez.
That was the pause for the Tadadoys.
Yeah.
Thanks for helping support this broadcast or podcast rather.
Where we can, you know, help bring you people like these on to tell us all about
fucking less wrong 2.0 where people are nowadays keeping the rationality thing going.
Yeah.
And you really, you really make, I don't know, all our patreons make this much more
rewarding, both in the, in the sense that, you know, we get money for it, but also in
the sense that similar to like how you guys were saying when people just felt much better
learning that they're in a book that's going to be published, it's, it's nice to have
people like monetarily supporting you in that way.
Yeah.
We appreciate what you do.
Yeah.
We're hoping that Scott gets some of that soon.
Yes.
Oh, cannot wait.
Some of that sweet unit of caring.
Perfect.
And thanks again, Emilio.
I was quiet because you know, I said everything I was going to say, which seems to be kind
of a running theme this episode.
Yeah.
All right.
I think we're good to call it here guys.
You're saving me.
I kind of just was like, thanks.
Where's, what are they?
Okay.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, thanks again, Oliver and Ben.
This was fantastic.
And I can't wait to get these in the mail.
I'm looking forward to it.
Yeah.
Great.
I look forward to it.
Tell me, tell me what you think of them.
I sure will.
And everyone listening, well, I guess, you know how to find less wrong.com.
I was going to say there'd be a link to find them, but you guys can't find that.
You know, good luck.
I mean, they would be one of the lucky 10,000.
Like that's, that's really.
That's valid.
Wait, this is online.
I could read it myself now.
Great.
Lesserong.com spelled like it sounds.
You know, we did actually, for the period where we were making Lesserong 2.0 and we
hadn't taken over.
We had the URL, Lesser wrong.
Lesser wrong.com.
Lesser wrong.com.
And then we then made our second sort of dev server, lessist wrong.com.
We then redirected Lesser wrong to Lesserong.
So if you go to Lesserong, it'll take you to Lesserong.
But Lesserong is still just our development server.
You can still go there and see what.
What does less wrong in a week?
That's awesome.
Even Lesserong in the story.
Yeah.
Well, if it's Lesserong, you can't get any Lesserong than that, right?
Well, arguably it could be least wrong, which is less wrong than Lesser wrong.
Lesser's wrong.
Lesser's wrong.
Lesser wrong is not financially available, so we stuck with lessist.
The ultimate one is just going to be correct.
Lesser wrong at all.
Once we get to the transhuman future.
That's right.
Correct.com.
Lesser long is our short form page.
Oh, yeah.
We're going to redirect to our short form page.
And then, I can't remember the other ones we had.
Well, of course, there's great of Ron, who is one of our competitors who makes a different UI for the site.
More right, which I think is like a conservative.
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's more right.
Are they still there?
I don't think so.
I think they collapsed a long time ago.
Sorry.
Cool.
Okay.
Thanks, everyone, and we'll see you in a couple of weeks.
Bye, everybody.
Thanks again.
Goodbye.
Bye.
