because they love anime and then didn't.
I think the thing is it's not like this anime is pro like traumatizing
minors with sex things.
Yeah, but I don't think that Game of Thrones
is really pro incest either.
Yeah, but it's not anti incest.
Game of Thrones is kind of like.
It's not about specifically tackling the topic.
Yeah, which is.
Well, I don't think you're supposed to take away from it
that like incest is sometimes cool.
Right.
But it's not all about like processing the trauma of an incest relation.
Game of Thrones tends not to make value judgments
about like the stuff that it does to the point where I remember
that I was actually pretty annoyed by like a bunch of the rape scenes
because it was.
Here's some rape.
Yeah, like they keep kind of.
Yeah, like throwing it in your face and like trying to be like,
we're Game of Thrones.
We're shocking and adult.
And I'm like, I get it.
Like, can we get back to the plot now and stop just like kind of,
kind of like sexualizing these rape scenes like you.
Okay, we're supposed to like maybe feel bad for these characters
or feel like, oh, this is just a fictional thing
that's happening in this universe where this might happen.
But then I'm like, okay, you keep doing it
in a way that's making me feel kind of gross.
So whoever feels weird and gross right now,
I remember at the start of the very positive push
for the Kingslingers podcast.
So check that out.
I'm looking forward to it.
And which is not at all written by a horror writer.
So there will definitely be no violence or rape.
I don't know what there will be in it.
But I mean, I haven't read it.
I'm sure there's going to be violence.
I assume there's going to be some sort of sexual stuff.
I mean, the guy is called the gunslinger.
If he doesn't shoot that gun at somebody at some point,
I'm going to be pretty disappointed.
Right.
The Chekhovs gun.
Chekhovs gunslinger.
So, yeah, I mean, let's be real, there'll be violence.
But the podcast will be positive.
Yeah, everything on Doof Media is great.
We are not sponsored by Doof Media.
No.
Have we thanked a patron yet?
No, we haven't.
We should do that.
Instead of pimping Doof Media, we will pimp ourselves.
Is it my turn?
Sure.
Okay.
It can be your turn.
