There was this post by Brett Devereux who wrote about the video game
Victoria
And he wrote about more generally like how slavery is depicted in video games
Which was an interesting way to examine the issue because when you have video games
Historical strategy video games like civilization and Victoria and Europe are universalists
They try to simulate
Reality and it's interesting to see how they try how they tackle the issue of slavery because if they wanted to do it
Realistically they have to find a way to incentivize players to enslave populations
Because that's that's why slavery exists like it's it's cool having people do shit for you
It's undeniable
It's it's shitty and wrong of course
But of course I would say that because I'm not reliant on a hundred slaves to sustain my my lifestyle
I make the comparison so there's a way to measure
How much energy how much electricity how much power a modern human relies upon and if you calculate
You know how much work as an electrical work
How much power a human can generate and you tally up how much a modern human?
How much power they rely on you can make the analogy that it's about 130 quote-unquote energy slaves does that make sense?
That to do the amount of work that we get done with electrical appliances and other things
Machinery in our normal life. We would have to have about a hundred and thirty slaves. Yes, we didn't have all the tech
Yeah, think about everything that you do in in day-to-day
So you turn on the faucet just imagine someone digging a well and then for you know the rest of the wells
Lifesign they're drawing buckets of water from the well and then like walking it back to the kitchen
And now we have we have just like the ability to turn on a faucet immediately
Or you know taking a bath that means drawing up the fucking water again
Which involves digging a well which involves all the tools that you would need to dig a well all the expertise that you would need
To figure out where how to dig a well and then also all the tools that you would need to chop wood all the wood that you
Need to chop all the wood that you need to carry back to the house
All the time that you spend tending the fire to heat up the water and instead it's instant hot water on demand as much as I want
Whenever I want that's important to keep in mind just how relying I am and I'm just talking about the fucking water
I'm not talking about all the food that I eat all the clothes that I have all the all the like fucking gadgets and and
Screen time like me watching a TV show the functional equivalent would be oh
I have slaves that are dancing slaves or like barred slaves that are living here that I have to feed and they are willing to perform
On a moment's notice for me
I think that's how it's important to keep to think about it that way because it makes you realize just how
Luxurious we are nowadays. I spent a few days in a cabin at the beginning of the year
that was heated by wood fire and
Fortunately, there was just a giant stack of wood out back because this was at a sort of resort-ish area
And I didn't have to do any work myself
But I was like holy shit in the past if I wanted to stay warm for every night of heat
I would have to go out and cut down like a third of a tree and chop it up into pieces and haul it in here
And all I do is turn up my thermostat. Yep
And also I want to also hone in on the point about tools because I wrote another post called consider the handax
It's not only about AI, but I talk about how I think for like a million years
The preeminent technology was the stone handaxe, which is this teardrop shaped sort of semi-sharp
Rock that you can use to cut stuff down the idea of having a handle on your tool
Didn't happen until way way later
And if you wanted a knife or an axe or anything you had to go go to the fucking river get pebbles
Smash them together and then figure out how to like get some sharpness out of it
You know if you wanted to cut down a tree, it's not just grabbing a modern-day axe with a metal blade
That's already sharpened and already hafted you have to use your hand your dumb fucking hand to chop a
Tree down with a fucking rock
Like it's not as simple as just chopping down a tree
It's like you have you have to remember all the apparatus all the logistical apparatus that we are relying on
And all of that just takes blood sweat and tears to accomplish even when you get to the metal age
I write about this more in detail, but when you get to the metal age with iron the way iron works the smelting process you couldn't use
Coke you couldn't use like mind up coal. You had to use charcoal because of the carbonization
so people had to chop down entire forests and
Make charcoal out of the tree logs and then that's that gets you like the let the temperature necessary to smelt iron
Which of course like requires digging out out of the ground and then smashing it with hammers and you see these
These illustrations of people wearing shin guards in a medieval time from like smashing rocks together
You have to imagine that so many shins got thoroughly fucked up for them to even start implementing shin guards for for mining workers
For that to be a viable concern
so you're talking about just an intense amount of suffering to get very very basic provisions and
We are unfat and fatimably blessed on that front and for me
Especially if I talk about it from the equivalent of how many slaves it requires for me to say
Slavery is wrong. I'm not even judging like the the validity of the truth of that
but it's so it's so facile of me to make that claim when I'm doing it from the position of
Unbelievable privilege
Mm-hmm. I think it's not inconsistent though to say that like I enjoy all the stuff that we have but I wouldn't want it at the cost of
120 slaves right but the question is would you I I mean is that true if I was a middle-ages slave owner
It's hard to say. I would be I mean I wouldn't be that person. I'd be somebody else
If it was me, how do you know that?
Because I I mean I went to school in America in the 20th century 20 right so you're like but you're citing
I guess like you're upbringing right so my upbringing would have been necessarily different if I was born 500 years ago, right?
Yeah, and you would potentially support slavery. Oh, yeah, that's I'm saying so I
I'm saying that I am not the same person like so yeah
So that hypothetical other version of me of the other random person definitely probably would have been a fan, right?
But if I was given the choice, you know, Stephen, you lose all your electricity and stuff
But if you have a bunch of slaves, you can keep some level of the luxury out. I'd be pretty I
Today would be pretty reluctant, but I do love the the framing about that if society stayed the way it is
You'd probably be pretty reluctant, but I think if everybody else was like, oh my god, this is terrible
Yeah, it's no big deal if you have one or two slaves so that you don't have to live in this misery
We'd probably jump on on board. Yeah, unless we were the slaves
Well, since since since more since people need more slaves and like since everyone needs 130
Yeah, the slave to slave owner ratio would be skewed, you know, so it's not that easy
That doesn't solve the issue because who is the slave depends on like who conquers who and there's gonna be mutual danger from that
I get I feel like I'd be not too difficult to conquer
maybe I
Guess what I was gonna say though is we had somebody who I think would never be described as a Luddite
But our good position that is vaguely in favor of it
If you frame it in the very context of like look we get a hundred and twenty people people's worth of effort
Just to like live our lives and do our day-to-day, you know, light light a room heat and cool it
All like you said everything with water and food
It's hard to say like we made a bad move using technology, right?
Yeah, we actually made a pretty cool move and I love the illustrative example of you know
Cutting down a tree without you know cutting cutting down to the next is kind of hard cutting it down with your with your stupid meat
Hands is next to impossible, right?
Any any sort of anti-technology movement is necessarily a pro-slavery movement as well
I think that that might not be definitely they would disagree with the framing, but I think that
