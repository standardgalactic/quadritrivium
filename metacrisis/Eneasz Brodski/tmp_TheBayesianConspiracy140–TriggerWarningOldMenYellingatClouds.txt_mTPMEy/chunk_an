Well, you know, we're talking about dividing everyone between good people and evil people.
Well, I don't like saying that they're people that are definitely good people,
like this episode's patron, Christian Gruber.
Thank you, Christian.
Do you now have special dispensation from the rationalist popes, even Zuber, to
sin one time because you're on the good side?
I don't think it comes with anything like that.
I think you just get to know that you're an awesome person.
Maybe you can be irrational one time and it'll be okay.
That sounds fair.
No one is allowed.
No one's ever allowed to be irrational.
We run a tight ship here, I guess.
Damn, all right.
I'm joking in case that wasn't obvious, like people are irrational all the goddamn time
and it's fine.
Yeah.
Anyway, you rock and are unequivocally a good person.
Yes.
Capital G, capital P.
That's right.
Cool.
Well, I think, did I mention we're recording this on a Friday night?
So, well, it was an afternoon, so now it's Friday night and I'm ready to get home.
I'm, yeah, we gotta go.
High five, everybody.
We'll see you in a couple of weeks and we'll talk about something like more fun and less
old manuals like clouds, which is an emoji that I am just so glad exists and I added to my company
Slack whenever I'm feeling curmudgeony and I, you know, these, it's nice to cathart these
once in a while, but it's also nice to have fun, so we'll do that next time.
Yeah.
Thanks for joining us.
Bye, everybody.
