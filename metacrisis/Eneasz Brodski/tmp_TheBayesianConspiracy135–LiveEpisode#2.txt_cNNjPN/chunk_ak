It's true.
Like, I guess if you squint and tilt your head or something,
but it's not like...
My ex couldn't remember your name
and used to refer to you as that Keanu Reeves looking Motherfucker.
Nice.
I always like when a description of me ends with Motherfucker.
I always read this in Portuguese.
What does that sound like?
Unfortunately, no one in this room does Portuguese.
Steven...
Do I talk about Avengers too much, guys?
No, no.
You don't talk about Avengers enough.
My constantly mentioning it
is more of like a self-aware meme at this point.
Like, I deliberately make it part of like my online character.
It's like how every single video has to have super easy,
barely inconvenience, or people start posting angry comments.
Right.
It's not the same as Spanish at all.
The way it's silent.
It's silent, eh?
What are we going to do like 20 years from now
when Marvel stops making movies?
I guess that's never going to happen, is it?
Probably not, but also find the next thing to look at, right?
That just occurred to me.
We'll probably have Marvel movies for the rest of time now.
I mean, if they put this quality,
like the TV shows blew me away, so...
Because like, they started with superhero comics way back,
I guess in the 40s, when they started getting big,
and they just haven't stopped since then,
and now that has infected movies.
In fact, it's the wrong word because it makes it sound bad,
but now that has also blessed the movies.
Expanded onto the screen, yeah.
John mentioned cowboy movies.
I think it would be really cool if somebody like
managed to reboot cowboy movies.
They did with the Mandalorian.
Yeah, that's a good point.
Yeah.
I want more space westerns, actually.
I love space western.
Space western.
This is the way.
Oh, my God.
Everyone just had a collective sigh in their hearts
for Firefly season 2.
Firefly, and...
Well, I can't remember the name of the anime.
Cowboy Bebop.
Yeah.
But Cowboy Bebop finished their run.
Yeah, it was good.
Johnny, Mandalorian very much takes place
in the western hemisphere of space.
Can I give you that?
Oh, well.
I think we're running out of steam.
Yeah, I think we should wrap it up.
We're closing in on three hours here.
Yeah.
There's a lot of fun, everybody.
Thanks for hanging out.
And now it's more personal.
Yeah, this was great.
Thanks, everybody.
Rather than just saying thanks, everybody,
into the void.
It's talking to actual people.
All right.
So you can actually say it this time.
Many of whom's faces I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks for this nice garden of rationality.
Aw, thanks, man.
Thank you for helping be in it and turn the soil
or whatever the correct metaphor is.
We literally could not have done this without y'all.
Always a pleasure.
Or we could have, but it would have been much more,
much sadder.
Johnny says, this is apparently my ideal comedic format.
Typing while people are podcasting.
He can do like the Mystery Science Theater 3000 podcast.
Hey.
Hey.
That's a great picture, Gad.
That is wonderful hair as well.
He looked very shocked or something.
That is anime hair.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cool.
Well, it was nice to meet you all.
Yeah.
Everybody's saying thank you and bye,
and thank you and bye too, everybody.
And I guess that's it.
Yeah.
This is great.
Cool.
We'll be back to our-
Call me home.
Call me home.
We'll be back to our regularly scheduled content
in two weeks.
All right.
Well, two weeks and three days, I guess,
since we'd normally release on Wednesdays.
Oh, yeah.
But for the people who are not listening to this live,
in two weeks.
If they made it to the end of the episode.
That's true.
Yeah.
All right.
Oh, my God.
Thanks again, everybody.
Okay, bye.
Bye.
Aloha a hui hou kakou.
