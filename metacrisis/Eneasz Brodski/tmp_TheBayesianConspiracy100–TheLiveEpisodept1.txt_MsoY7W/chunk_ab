Yeah.
Where Robin Hansen was writing...
That's a good question.
He must have been in Georgia.
No, he was never in the university.
How did those two get in contact?
Part of your economics online, I'm guessing.
Okay.
Yeah.
I would trace it back to either Robin Hansen or Eleazar and I'm not sure.
Eleazar was in California the whole time, wasn't he?
Yeah.
I think that's why his founder effects ended up in Berkeley.
Yeah.
Well, it's also a great place for programmers.
Yeah.
It's also very expensive.
Right.
Okay.
It's kind of unfortunate that it ended up in Berkeley because a lot of people can't afford
to live there.
Yeah.
It's kind of hard to get around.
I was just in downtown Denver earlier this morning and yeah, it's an exciting place to be.
Oh, I know.
Well, I had to pick up some stuff, but it's like, it just feels full of life and there's
people around and everything's exciting now.
Yeah.
Like when I'm here, I want to do things and I go back out to the suburbs.
People...
Denver is a city of like 30 somethings.
It's weird.
We still live in New Jersey.
It was a very like Asian population area and it's weird just going around and seeing
a lot of people at an age everywhere ago.
Yeah.
It's things that cater to the interest and taste of people in their days.
It's so weird.
Denver is a really booming city right now, so people are coming here to make their fortune.
When I had a house and rented out one room, three different times I rented out to people
that were just coming to Denver or staying in the room for six months while they found
a place to live because they were getting jobs here.
Yes.
Yeah.
Although you didn't stay with them.
Well, I stayed for like a week that I visited.
Yeah.
I stopped sharing my house for a night.
Yes.
It's perfect.
Don't sweat it.
These are supposed to say that they will say something.
It's not my cat.
Hello.
Roommates cat?
I'm not a friend's place because last night I was staying over at his place and then
we got snowed in.
So I'm just doing this all in his basement.
Cool.
We can turn the alerts on and off.
Let's see.
Why are we turning the alerts on and off?
Because every time something comes in there's a balloon and apparently that's recording
stuff.
Okay.
Both patients are.
Cool.
Does Beat Saber count as HIIT?
High intensity integral training?
No.
I wouldn't say so.
It's not nearly intense enough.
It definitely is when you're in expert class.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
I saw you and Phoenix crushing it next to me.
I was playing yesterday.
I won't usually sweat.
It looked like somebody jumped above me with water on my head after I was done playing.
Oh, nice.
Okay.
I was playing for like an hour.
I got this embarrassing TDCS, like narrow stimulator thing that's supposed to train
muscle memory.
So I was playing with that.
Cool.
And it's hilarious because it's a large headset with these electrodes on top of it.
So I'm wearing this large VR headset with another headset over top of it.
I'd love to get into Beat Saber sometime, but my computer technology consists of a phone
and a Chromebook.
So the threshold, the barrier for entry is a lot higher for me.
I really wish they had Beat Saber in our case.
So people who don't want to buy a headset, I'll go play it and I'll just still have
the night pick with a bunch of friends and play it.
So should that be really cool.
I was in one of those VR setups where they have a ring around you.
Why?
So you can like walk and turn around and stuff.
Is that here in town?
Yeah.
That was like during our convention.
Yeah.
But it was like $5 for 10 minutes.
Like it was not a cheap thing to do.
Yeah, that sucks because the only thing I mentioned was playing in that sky room and five minutes
and that wouldn't get me through the car battles.
So it was really neat though because I saw, there was just the same 10 minute scenario
for everyone.
It was a run around shoot zombie kind of thing.
And I saw two people before me and I knew both times at the end there's like a noise
behind you and you look behind you like something jumps out, right?
And it's a jump scare.
I was like, okay, this is cool.
And I knew it was coming and I got into the game and I got into the room and I heard
a noise behind me and turned around.
I jumped.
I was like, damn it.
I knew this was coming.
I got tricked.
You looked like a high laser.
You shaped to turn the light on.
Yeah.
Very cool feature.
Yeah.
It sounds like a really high-maging.
I mean, if I took an accident while I was there.
You can blind people with that undobling abs.
So I almost never turned it on accidentally.
I literally do not hold my phone while I'm excited and making hand gestures.
Yeah, right.
That's why I hold a mug.
It keeps me nice and calm.
I can't just stick it sharply.
A mug full of steaming coffee.
Right.
just be shaking over my expensive laptop.
The kinds of issues, the kinds of fires, yeah.
Yeah, now it's like 50 bucks.
Well, I would love to talk to you guys
about the Dojo experience that we've had
in Kansas City sometime,
but there's a lot to talk about there.
Yeah, that would probably-
I don't want to hear your vibration now, but-
Would you be willing to be a guest
and talk to us about the Dojo thing?
I would love to.
That's definitely something that would make my year,
that's for sure.
I suppose the short version is that
we're currently in the process.
Since we were originally started off
by doing the Hammer Time sequence on Less Wrong.
Hammer Time?
Hammer Time, yeah.
It's a sequence made by, I don't recall the username
of the person-
It was the hammer.
They had attended a CIFAR workshop
and this was their attempt to convey
a lot of the lessons they learned,
as well as practice writing.
You can look it up on Less Wrong,
it's just called Hammer Time.
Yeah, I'm gonna do that.
Yeah, I'm gonna do CIFAR and then-
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna-
So what we're doing-
I'm gonna put it off when you're talking.
I have to kind of put it on when someone else is talking.
You can mute yourself or deafen yourself.
I would do it for you, but I don't want to.
So you started with the Hammer Time sequence,
like going through it?
Yeah, we started going through that.
Now we've transitioned into something else.
We currently, our core membership
are pretty much all seasoned rationalists.
We have all the sequences under our belt.
We have a couple of years of being
in the rationalist community.
We have the background knowledge.
And we even, one of our members is a licensed therapist
who knows a lot of great information
about cognitive behavioral therapy and ACT
and internal family systems therapy.
So he has a lot of information
and knowledge under his belt about-
You're gonna have-
Is it nice to hear that?
I can hear it, okay.
Sure, what?
Can you hear me now?
How am I-
Yeah.
Am I cutting out again?
No, what I'm hearing is-
What I'm hearing is bass,
so it's working fine and good.
