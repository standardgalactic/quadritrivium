Okay.
The rural area or like a suburb thing?
It's a suburb.
It's like a small town.
It's like a small town.
I was introduced to me to the book, Happy City.
Or was that your pick or was that?
Yeah, Happy City.
Yeah, that was really a good guide
about how to pick where to live.
I had some considerations from that book
when I was choosing more to move as well.
They talked about having a, like a downtown area.
It's really important for your mental health.
Having a anywhere.
Yeah, I think, I think their big recommendations
are walkability and nature.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'd see if I was to make a intentional
nationalist community, I would like something like that.
But the problem is that requires also a lot of land,
which is very expensive if you want to be near
major employment areas.
So you've got to go out to the suburbs
within everyone's two hours before they would work.
That's why you do the three thousand.
I've been looking at them.
They're just a house with five bedrooms
that I've got my own.
I don't think that that's quite in the cards just yet,
but I definitely want to make a three thousand.
Maybe next year.
Okay.
Do it.
Yeah, that would be awesome.
Just sit down and take that picture.
Lorke said that they grew up in a small town
and it was half immigrant, so it was very splinter.
Maybe you're sitting here and more about that at some point.
Why is Elon Musk laughing about a,
is that a drowned deer?
It looks like it's the bottom of a swedicle or something.
I don't know what that is.
Okay.
Please explain this picture.
Soderman is trying to get us to go to Texas
because they have cheap land there.
I am not going to Texas, Soderman.
I'm going to Austin, Illinois, and West Texas.
Nice try.
Although All Hail West Texas was a great album.
That's true.
That was a great album.
Yeah.
All right, guys.
So I'm going to check out
because I have childcare stuff to do
and I think my mother's getting ready to leave.
So, but I'll be listening for the rest of it.
All right, awesome.
Thanks, Liz.
All right.
I'm not going to come visit Jersey,
like probably in January.
I don't know.
You've been saying I'm going to visit next month
for like six months.
Yeah.
Just avoiding the parents.
I'm mostly avoiding the parents, but...
No.
Well, don't visit your parents.
Don't visit me.
Yeah.
All right, cool.
All right, I'll see you guys.
I'll adjust.
I'll see you soon.
And I'll talk to you guys on the Discord.
All right, later.
Nice talking to you too.
Thanks.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
I'm going to go to the most group house.
Interesting.
Cool.
Who?
You're the only thick.
Who goes on next?
Who wants to talk?
There's a bunch of people I'd like to talk to,
but Emmanuel said me next,
please, can we go on and put on Emmanuel then?
Yeah.
All right.
Emmanuel, you can come next.
If Averyl wants to talk at some point,
Averyl's active in the chat a lot
and will be fun to talk to.
Yeah.
I'm guessing if she feels like it.
It would be really fun to talk to.
A bunch of people that I see around all the time.
Right, I can't do anything
because I got to push the top down.
You can do the thing.
Stand by.
We are switching up people.
It's not an alphabetical order.
I'm literally touching it.
There we go.
And it is an alphabetical order?
It is?
Yeah.
Well, it wasn't.
Okay.
I'm an idiot.
That's true of him.
All right.
You got a server on mute as well.
All right, Emmanuel, you should be live.
Hello, Emmanuel.
Hey, how you guys doing?
Hi.
Can you hear me?
I can hear you.
Yes, I can hear you now.
I have to talk about my extended omatic again.
Have whatever you want.
I see, I see.
So, I'm Emmanuel, you can see by the way.
Discord name, I'm currently in Bristol, in the UK.
Oh!
I'm originally from Bermuda, like the triangle.
Awesome.
When did you move to the UK?
About nine years ago for university.
Okay, cool.
Do you prefer the UK or Bermuda?
Definitely Bermuda for the weather.
It's a bit small though.
So, I'm probably gonna be out in the UK
or the US somewhere for a while.
But what time is it there right now?
9, 9.20 PM, I just looked.
Okay, that's not sure.
9.20.
Okay, cool.
I did not intentionally pick something
that European people could listen in on,
but we've got it worked out.
Is it Monday over there or Sunday?
Sunday.
Sunday, okay.
This is a nice time for the call
because it's Sunday evening, fairly relaxed.
Cool.
I just wanted it late enough in the afternoon
that I could be awake and functional,
but not so late that it would go too long.
I probably made it here on time.
Yes.
I got back to my concert before,
unless I was gonna do that shit.
Oh, what concert did you go to?
Happy Park.
Happy Park.
Okay, okay.
Steampunk?
That was really great.
There was a lot of people there in the Steampunk outfits.
Sounds fantastic.
I felt so underdressed.
I need to...
Up your Steampunk game?
Anyway, we should talk to Emmanuel.
Yeah.
Stuff.
Emmanuel, do you have a topic you wanna talk about?
Yeah, I wanted to talk about something
that's not been bothering me about the rationalist community,
but communities in general,
and also partially the rationalist community.
And that is inefficiencies in information consumption.
And by that, I mean,
one of the things that bothers me about,
like, what's wrong in the Slate Sarcotics
and that sort of stuff is the amount of verbosity
that a lot of people have in their posts,
in their sharing information and knowledge.
And I have a lot of different sources of knowledge
that I like to read from and watch videos from,
and it's hard to allocate time towards the rationalist figure
as much as I'd like to.
You know.
Yeah.
There's, I'm sorry, go on.
Now go ahead.
