So what is the doomsday argument?
The doomsday argument.
I don't remember exactly how it goes,
but I believe it's essentially, if you sample randomly
from some amount of a set, you're
going to probably get something somewhere in the middle.
And therefore, since we are sampled randomly
from all humans, we're probably in the middle,
chronologically, of the human length of the human race
will survive waited for a number of people alive.
Yeah.
So the world is probably ending soon.
Right.
Because the number of people alive now
is just absolutely massive compared to all of our history
up to now.
And what I was saying in chat is that this is probably
a good argument, but I think all the other evidence
is outweighs it.
Yeah, and also, I don't know, if you
take the entire possible future history of humanity,
where there could be millions of us spread among the stars,
we're still in the way, way, early tail end of the population,
which I guess is statistically very unlikely.
Right.
I don't know if that's part of it.
But someone's got to be in the front, right?
Someone's got to be in the front.
But what, sorry?
That's only assuming you're sorry.
OK, I'll guess.
I think the theorem say argument is like some evidence
say that there won't be just trillions and millions.
Impending dog attack.
You just got my mic.
Oh my god, it's a dog.
Are they dead?
Like they can still talk?
Because it sounds like they disappeared.
Yay.
We took over the base in conspiracy.
