OK.
Yep, because the server is not muted.
I guess it is just waiting for April
to be done with the April talking.
I thought we were both going to go at once.
No, apparently, you got to go first.
Congratulations.
Oh, boy.
Hi, I thought it was red.
So that means I'm silent.
Sorry, I didn't understand the way that this code works.
Oh, that's OK.
How do you know?
This whole last two hours has been us
not knowing that this code works.
Don't sweat it.
By the way, it's a tie for the actor.
It's a tie.
OK.
Yeah.
OK.
Oh, the competition was a tie?
No, the name is pronounced.
Their handle.
What is the start from?
Dang, my pundit land.
It's a name.
It's literally the name.
Oh, OK.
Cool.
Well, welcome aboard.
How long have you guys been listening?
Yeah.
A year?
Oh, no.
I haven't kept track.
Yeah.
OK.
Indeed.
Same here.
The anthropic principle or what?
Or what have you guys been talking about?
I mean, I am not writing, what, is it a PhD paper
or something?
Yeah.
Just a paper, a paper in general,
on the anthropic principle.
So.
Oh, at this moment, you are?
No, I am.
Oh, OK.
No, I am using that.
That was the context, yeah.
All right.
I mean, it's not specifically.
The anthropic principle is a part of it.
It's about the cosmological constant, which
is sort of the real proof we currently
have that the anthropic principle is something
that's well accepted.
So the cosmological constant is this thing that I'm saying.
Oh, sorry.
Can you hear me?
Yes.
OK.
Sorry.
So the cosmological constant is this thing
that controls the expansion of the universe.
And it's a lot smaller than what physicists expect.
And about 120 orders of magnitude small.
So that's really, really a lot.
And the first prediction we had of it before we measured it
was because, OK, if it was so big,
no one would be here to measure it.
And that is currently the only real reason
we have why it's so small.
There's no other accepted solution
to why the cosmological constant is so small.
And the big question is, OK, but how do you really
measure whether it's possible to live with it and so on?
Because if a Boltzmann brain, which is basically
a brain that exists for one second,
thinks that I think therefore I am,
would that be, if that's a very probable event that
happened in the history, that means that maybe we are
that Boltzmann brain that is right now thinking
and is about to die in a few seconds,
just a quantum fluctuation in the empty universe.
And that would really suck.
And you wouldn't know, right?
Because, yeah, I mean, because creating just a few neurons
that are existing and then stopping to exist
is not that hard.
But then, of course, there's a question of,
if you have long enough time period, yeah.
With the cosmological constant thing,
that I mean, the only way I can accept
that sort of anthropic principle is to also accept
that basically all possible universes
exist in the sort of tech market universe
sense that all realities, well, yeah,
if you want to take the brain that way out.
But the tech market and universe idea
where all universes are just expressions
of mathematical equations and the only ones with observers
are the ones that have the right parameters
for a type of observers, which is neat.
But I also hate infinite multiverses.
Yeah, I was wondering when you were going to get to your hatred
of multiverses.
I do.
That's just a personal thing, but.
Yeah, that's a very extreme theory for what
we call the landscape here, right?
That is a theory, but a more reasonable theory
of the landscape just gives you sort of a bunch of universes
with different cosmological constants
and not an infinite amount.
And the thing that I am working on,
the real, what my actual paper is about,
is sort of a way to have that without an infinite amount
of universes, like to have a finite amount of universes
that are of finite size and still have all the guys
with the large cosmological constant
destroy themselves fairly quickly.
Because I agree, if you have an infinite amount of universes
exist for an infinite time, then statistics
sort of become really meaningless, in a sense.
It's very hard to really think about these things.
It's called a measure problem, by the way.
Yeah, so you are working on a way
to show that maybe there doesn't have to be infinite universes?
Yeah, we're working on.
So not only are there not an infinite universes,
but they are also not living for infinitely long times.
And yeah, and the ones with a large cosmological constant
are going to die very quickly.
And that's why ours is sort of long-lived.
Sorry, you just talked about it.
And it's really what we are publishing in the next few days.
So it really.
Oh, sweet.
Well, if you send us the link, probably an email,
because I'm sure it'll get lost in the Discord,
if you put it on the Discord.
Then we can include it when we put this episode on the website,
because this thing is going up on Wednesday,
I guess, with minimal editing,
so everyone can get the awful experience.
We'll cut out all via the Discord technical issues
at the beginning.
OK, when I get it, I will find a way
to send it to the masses, to the good people of the podcast.
Fantastic.
Where are you doing this right now?
Is that what university?
All right.
Tel Aviv University.
Oh, cool.
I don't know much about it, but I've heard that it's a good one.
Yeah, it's very nice.
So you live in Tel Aviv right now, right?
Well, very near Tel Aviv.
What is the situation like down there?
Because I recently, I guess in the last episode,
talked about wide shift.
And in wide shift, he mentions that Jerusalem
seems to be falling under the sway of ultra-Orthodox,
right-wing Judaism.
Are you having seen any of that sort of thing?
Nothing.
Well, in Tel Aviv, there's actually now been a very good sign
very recently.
There's a big issue with, what do you call it,
public transportation, where it's illegal to have
public transportation on Saturdays because of the Jewish
whatever.
And right now, they just started to have public transportation
in central Israel.
So that's actually a very good sign.
However, you're right that there are bad signs
in other places.
Like Tel Aviv is sort of a good place to be in,
but other places, not so much right now.
We have a lot of right-wing protests and so on.
You know, recently, we had the worst periods to be in Israel,
I think.
Like, this is sort of mild.
So I don't feel that bad about it.
But yeah, you're right.
There are problems.
OK.
Well, I hope you keep the rationalist front strong
over there.
Right.
Yeah, I might have missed it.
By the way, April, yeah.
There's only two right.
You can talk.
I mean.
