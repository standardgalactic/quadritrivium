Is there a water leak?
Do they think students are having bad behavior
without having to explain machine learning to them?
Basically.
That sounds like a super valuable thing.
People are really gonna need people to help them interface
with our new robot overlords.
Definitely.
Indeed.
Yes.
Just security for myself.
It's ready, because I'm desperately curious about it too.
Yeah.
All right, well, thank you.
Thank you for joining me.
I'll send you guys the link
for the AI voice integration thing.
That's awesome.
I'm not joining them.
But yeah, that would be fantastic.
Thank you.
Once again, thanks to Indiana Ash
for getting me into this community.
It's made my life a lot better.
Awesome.
Thanks, I'm so glad to hear it.
Thank you, Daniel.
Appreciate talking to you.
See you.
All right, who's next?
And we gotta put Daniel back on server
so we don't get that echoing thing.
All right, so do we have someone else
who would like to come speak with us about something?
Or did you have something, Steve?
It doesn't matter if you have anything interesting
to say, just like...
Well, I'll tell you what.
You guys go between yourselves for a second,
because there was one quick topic,
or we've got like four,
but I'll try and do one at a time and reject them.
Let's see, the shortest one...
Oh, these were the questions
that people sent in for us to answer.
Yeah.
People are voting for April.
Well, don't feel pressured.
Don't let people push you into it,
so you do whatever you want.
Let's see, in the meantime,
I've got like five questions here
that people either wrote in,
that have a mean to get around it,
or other things.
So the quickest one, Emilio Alvarez,
it's also supporters, they get dibs.
I want to discuss the anthropic principle.
And when I asked for clarification, I got this.
Let's see.
So I was just about to ask people about it.
HPBase says,
shit rationalists say part two would be awesome.
Yeah, so basically,
I guess I can summarize really quick
my understanding of the anthropic principle.
And then I had like this weird sub-thought on that,
that I've been throwing around the last few years,
and forgot about,
and didn't remember again till this question.
So I think the anthropic principle is just basically,
how would you summarize it?
We're here because we're here having this conversation.
We couldn't be if we weren't.
Like that sounds like a circular reasoning,
but I remember as a kid being like,
really young and wondering like,
why we were on this part of the universe,
not another part of the universe,
or like, why are,
why the earth was where it was in relation to the sun,
not somewhere else.
But the simple answer is,
is like, if it were somewhere else,
like closer to the sun,
it wouldn't be up.
I wouldn't be having this loss on that earth.
The weird,
and there's actually a name for this,
because I know I came across it at some point
in the last 10 years,
but I can't remember what it was called.
Where,
anthropically,
I'm living the timeline where I've never been killed.
And I've almost been killed several times,
like car accidents,
or whatever,
spawning misadventures.
And there's a name for this
that I'm not sure what it is.
The closest I've heard is quantum immortality.
I think that's not the same thing.
It's related.
No, but that actually might have been
what I came across then.
Because currently I'm living the timeline
where I've never died.
And if there's a timeline where I don't die,
I think I might be in that timeline.
Does that make sense?
Well, I mean, you're obviously in that timeline
because you're not dead.
Yet, but, right, so like,
Oh, one where you never die at all.
Yeah.
So that's like a tricky part.
If we hit left-wing technology,
I think all people want to hit it.
Right?
I don't think that means,
although when I say that,
it doesn't seem to follow.
But anyway, you guys take your jump
on anthropic principle
for our writing question.
Or does anyone want to talk about
the anthropic principle live on air
or on the cyber air?
When did cyber stop being a word?
That was such a fun word.
I'm going to cyber spice, man.
Would Trump really did?
No.
What would he do?
He calls the internet the cyber.
I remember what it was called cyber sex.
And I was like, this is just going to be amazing.
I could have sex with a cyborg.
No, it's just chatting and masturbating.
I mean, I think that kind of exists
with the technologies, not quite there yet.
So you could have sex with one really,
like disconcerting doll.
I have a fun proposition here.
Why don't we put the ITA and April on at the same time?
Why is there?
Oh, because they're fighting against to go first.
Ah, OK.
But if there's feedback, we'll meet one of you.
So we are not fighting.
No, who's on second?
Let's see.
Got to add a role because reasons.
I thought when I made that role,
I thought that it would automatically
on server use anyone who's given the role.
That's yeah.
The lesson has been learned.
Oh, hey, I heard that.
I heard somebody.
Hi, this is me.
Hey, April, what's up?
I just sitting here for the last hour or 45 minutes
listening to people talk.
So are we as boring as I fear we are?
I mean, I haven't been fully engaged the entire time,
but you have boring.
No, I have like the long pause.
It's like, yes.
I spent I spent.
No, you're not boring.
I just spent a lot of it reading Hammer Time.
So, OK, oh, shit.
We're still on live YouTube.
I forgot about that.
And we are not synced up to what is going on right now.
It's really.
How late is this?
It's made to late.
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
It's at least 10 seconds delayed, man.
This is crazy.
Oh, there we go.
Like 50 seconds.
Yeah, well, that seems pointless.
I can cancel the YouTube thing if you guys want.
But anyway, it's cool.
Oh, yeah, stop looking at the YouTube
to delay a superness.
Sorry about that.
Oh, the day.
Today, are you on here as well?
They ought to be.
Did I not?
Successfully, I don't think you unmuted.
Oh, did we lose people?
No, you're you should be good.
They might have it muted on their end.
Yeah, you've muted yourself.
