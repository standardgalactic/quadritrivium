Like I would have actually really liked to participate
in that.
Did you read about the lessons learned afterwards?
Oh yeah, they pushed more down.
That was really good.
I was like, now that they know these things
would be a great way to start another dragon house, you know,
but apparently just don't want to go through
that whole thing again.
Well, I think Duncan, who organized it originally
said that he might do it again someday.
And the reason he wrote the postmortem
was mostly a bunch of myths to himself
or to other people who wanted to try it
as far as, I remember, I think he said that his main issue
was just choosing around with people to be part of the house.
It's one thing for like somebody to say,
oh yeah, I'll do a six month boot camp
and like commit to daily exercising together
and splitting up various chores
and working on various projects.
But then he gets somebody who just sits in their room
on their laptop.
He gets somebody who's doing all the chores
and then got mad because they were doing all the chores
and stopped doing all the chores.
It might be just easier to start a cult.
Isn't that what we're doing?
Wait, what?
Duncan blocked me on Facebook and said, what happened?
Oh, I saw that, did something about the screen
about dietary advice?
Just Duncan, the dragon army guy?
Yeah, at least I take that to be the same guy.
I don't know for sure.
Yeah, the ETA, to me, the military wasn't very helpful.
But I also think it wasn't the point.
I wasn't at the point, I thought, please.
Not going well.
Yeah, I was, when you were talking about the military
building people, I was thinking of other examples where
people I know went to the military and like,
it kind of made things worse for them.
I love the people who are surprised
that this is not a cult for them.
I have asked this aspiration of starting a rationalist group
home here in Kansas City at some point in the future.
And I'm not going to call it dragon army for sure.
I'm thinking more of the Sunshine Regiment.
I wouldn't say still that name.
Yeah.
We can always be chaos army.
Yeah.
I mean, honestly.
I enjoyed it.
Well, guys, I don't want to take up all of your time.
So I will go and let someone else jump on in.
It's been a pleasure talking to you guys.
Yeah, likewise.
You guys are awesome.
I think that's what I'm going to be on for a while.
Yeah.
Cool.
Oh, my gosh, I'm still hearing myself that cut.
Yeah, you guys can actually move their headsets every time
they're talking, because I don't know if you've ever
done this, where you hear yourself talking
in a second delay.
It's impossible to go through a sentence.
They've actually done experiments
where they drive people fucking crazy with it.
Yeah, totally.
Yeah.
Did they actually weaponize that for our control?
Yes.
I heard about that, too, which, yes, we did the job done.
That's so funny.
They just record people and play back a quarter second
afterwards and fuck everybody up.
That's hilarious.
Anyway, thanks so much, Alex.
If you prefer, we'll have to have you on for a full episode.
Talk about Dojo's, and that's part of the community.
I think that sounds fantastic.
Absolutely.
That'd be awesome.
Well, you guys have a wonderful day, and you keep being awesome.
Thanks.
Thank you so much.
You, too.
Bye, guys.
Bye-bye.
We got to take a new color.
Somebody, oh, yeah, got a YouTube mail.
Cool.
Anybody in the chat, would you like to have your voice broadcast
to literally dozens of people?
There's so many people typing.
Nope.
No.
Ooh, within a reason, we'd go for it.
We got one.
Wes.
OK.
All right, Wes, you're on next.
Let me find you, and add you in.
Maybe we'll get many more after that.
I thought there was going to be a whole bunch of people.
I was like, I don't know, I feel like maybe we
should have picked people out to be on here ahead of time.
Probably, but what kind of dogs does your dad have?
And then the thing I've got to go find you, Wes, on YouTube.
Yeah.
All right, Wes, can you hear us?
Hello, hello.
Can you hear me?
Oh, yeah, you are on the thingy.
What is it?
Is that a broadcast?
All right.
Hi, guys.
Long time listener, first time caller.
Nice to hear you.
I believe, Jess, you already know Wes personally, right?
I'm going to stand in line and give you some more water.
OK, cool.
Is Jess in, not Jess, is Wes in New Jersey?
Yes.
Awesome.
Was Jess and Wes ever confusing?
No.
Was it confusing because of the name Rhymes?
Yeah, I don't know.
I find someone who's named like Beanie Osh that might be me.
That was dumb.
I'm sorry, Wes, how are you?
We're just by comparison.
I'm good.
I'm here in New Jersey with my new baby and my wife
for here and my mother for the baby.
And we're also watching the Eagles probably lose this game.
OK, that football thing?
That is a football thing.
OK, cool.
Is that very saddening or do you not really care that much?
I mean, they're bad this year, so it's not that sad.
OK.
It would be more sad.
They won the Super Bowl like two years ago.
Oh, yeah.
OK.
I remember them being pretty bad most of my life.
Yeah, they've been bad a lot.
Cool.
I think they lost a major game on my 21st birthday.
And my parents took me out to a bar
because they were going to buy me my first drink.
And everybody was so sad.
Someone's yelling.
Sorry, bar.
People are just crying into their cups.
I hear cities can get bad after a major loss.
Just the overall mood of the cities go down
and you don't want to be a bar instead.
Yeah, I think it's city by city.
But Philly is definitely a football town.
Wes, please tell stories about, oh my gosh,
I think you're going to say, Wes,
tell stories about the Super Bowl.
I forget who was the Super Bowl, but there was one game
where they were greasing light poles
because people were climbing light poles.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, that was the Super Bowl.
When they won the conference championship,
everyone climbed all the light poles.
So the Philadelphia Police Department
greased them all for the Super Bowl.
And well, but Philly, of course, being Philly,
we just took this as a challenge.
There were definitely people up on those light poles.
Cool.
I can see competitions to climb greased poles.
Yeah, there was, I remember a video of Wes playing
at Trumpet and leading a crowd of people singing the Eagles
song.
Yeah, I had two weeks between the championship
and the Super Bowl, so I used that
to learn the Eagles fight song on the trumpet.
Did the city clean all the grease off after or should
this light pole just be grimy?
It probably cleaned.
I think you know the answer to that.
The grease probably cleaned them.
They don't call it dirty Philly for nothing.
Isn't gritty?
For gritty, it's for Philly.
It's for gritty, it's for Philly.
The best mascot.
He really is.
