saying you know say my name or i'm the one who knocks it's got like fewer with those bad ass moments
but that's not what it's going for it's going for the moments where you're like oh that's the
sol that i recognize because he doesn't start that way uh like the seeds are there just like
they are with waltz and breaking bad because it's a well thought out story but you you see his descent
into who he becomes later and it's great so cool yeah all right uh thank you is it on to me
okay and i have heard good things about better call salt to brooklyn on nine real quick i'd love
everything about it except that it's a cop show i wish it was about anything other than cops but
yeah the characters are great the jokes are great i i still enjoy it anyway
yeah i think if you don't i knew it i knew it was a six letter um or a uh two syllable uh k
k word the zombie korean show that i was thinking of is called kingdom i was thinking like killers
or something like that and it wasn't it it's called kingdom it's on netflix and it was a lot of fun
is it subtitled or dub yes i think they do dubs i did it in subtitles which is also great if you're
like trying to like really not focus on being stuck at home because you have to read and watch at the
same time um so it's not a movie then it's a series it's a tv series yeah okay and is it done or is
it still going i don't know um it ended on a nice uh well i won't say how it ended um it i guess the
fact that i said i don't know means that it could go both ways but it's uh like what makes it fun is
that the zombies are like a background element and well i mean they're not their foreground element
but it's not like uh the walking dead and all the other things that came out 10 years ago it's
it's also the time frame that sets it like to be a lot of fun because you can't radio ahead to the
next city and say oh my god you guys they're zombies um zombies can't take you know they're not uh
being transported while in dormant period across planes and getting all over the world
they're basically just running up the country and there's people trying to get ahead of them and so
then you know they get to a new new town they see this ravaging horde behind them and they try and
cut them down like they do everyone else and it doesn't work you've got to decapitate them or
stab them through the head but again since you can't like call the town that you're heading to
give them that notification it's kind of just a fun thing of like how this this uh apocalypse is
spreading so nice it's it's a lot more fun than you think for your standard zombie show
third zombie show or second zombie show that is way better than it sounds so i'm going over budget
is santa clarita diet which i've pitched before it is it is amazing it's it is the same kind of
humor as like community and uh better off ted um just a ton of really high quality jokes delivered
like two a minute uh like like two jokes a minute on average probably that show is
fucking hilarious and it is uh without going on and on about it i will just pitch that one
i'd pitch that over kingdom but kingdom was like just a new thing i was watching so cool
all righty uh my second thing is we've all been pitching a bunch of long form stuff video games
that take you know tens of hours entire series so my next one is going to be something really
short that you can consume in its entirety in under 45 minutes it is uh the album when we all
fall asleep where do we go by billy eilish and i realized this thing has been out for about a year
but i am again a late adopter also i was like oh look pop music i don't care i don't listen to the
pop music really i don't listen to the radio but at some point i stumbled across uh bad guy
i was like oh this is a really neat song and then um girlfriend reviews put out a bass guy
or bass guy rather uh which i was like oh that's hilarious and that's that one song oh i want to
look up that one song now and they put you know parody of bad guy so i looked up bad guy and i
thought you know what i have never in my life really liked a song and really liked an artist
and then listened to an entire album by them and the song that i liked most was the song that gets
the radio play there's always been some other song on the album which was my favorite which is
never played on the radio no one else ever hears it so i try to listen to entire albums whenever i
can so i looked at this album when we all fall asleep where do we go listen to it from start to
oh my god so it starts out with bad guy which is it's a bravado song right and say like hey
i'm a badass look at what a badass i am kind of song and i'm glad you explained it because
i've heard the song and i have no idea what she's talking about so yeah and i i have a lot of fun
with those kinds of songs like one of the reasons i loved it was because you know that kind of bravado
like yeah i'll seduce your dad you know kind of thing um but uh that's actually one of the lines
in the song isn't she's 17 uh sure i don't know great it's a bravado song man it doesn't matter
do you think those rappers really all have huge dicks and ten million dollars no it's wait they
don't oh god my worldview i mean maybe some of them do and i'm sure they're all hoping to get
but anyways that's not the point the point is it's an amazing beat and it's a lot of fun and so i
keep listening and it goes into like sort of this depression spiral and it seems to be it's a concept
album it seems to be like after that she's sort of going into like these are the after effects of
how i was acting before and as you get deeper and deeper into the album you realize first of all
the entire concept of an album is someone putting into uh music what it feels like to be
desperately lonely all the time which was my high school experience as well and as you keep getting
into the second half of the album you realize that not only is desperate loneliness but this is an
album about someone who is just so in love with someone and that person does not love them back
and it's not that that person hates them or anything but the love is not returned and she
can't get over it and she's trying to get over it and she doesn't know how and there is pain
and the whole album is just this beautiful exploration of that and then at the very end
the last song is sort of like a quick going back up through the um the whole album but in reverse
and then you realize at the end that like i'm the bad guy wasn't just a position of posturing
in bravado it was like her way of psychologically explaining why doesn't this person love me back
and it was the internalization of i must be a bad person which is why they don't love me
which you can't get to unless you've heard the whole album first like the way it was intended
to be listened to consecutively and then you get that reverse wrap-up at the end it was it was
beautiful and i loved it and also like her voice is amazing and the music is just really good so
if you want an entire experience in under 45 minutes i recommend when we all fall asleep where
do we go i want to ping pong on that because first off that is the strongest sales pitch
i've ever heard for any album ever okay i i still feel like i'm missing out on a lot for not being
able to really comprehend music so i will definitely give it a shot the only album by like an artist
that i've uh that i don't know has uh record like whatever awards that i've heard all the way through
is um kesha's new album or her second newest album uh i think it was rainbow maybe we've
been the album yeah and that was a lot of fun that had like its kind of own back story thing to it
too but to stay on billy eilish um if you're unfamiliar with her somehow um my first exposure
to her was on snl she was the musical guest and if you want to just check out the kind of the kind
of like badass chick she is check out just youtube snl uh billy eilish and watch her music video her
music performance on there and it's done some amazing visual effects that uh were a lot of
fun i i'm stammering for words because i don't want to describe them just you'll watch it and be like
whoa and i think it'll be a good time so she was also like one of those ones that was like
a youtube star first and then picked up by some creep who trolls youtube for you know
attractive sounding kids or something but um it's uh that was that was i think her her start
but she seems chill um i don't know much about her and i've never heard another one of her songs
so i will check out that album for sure excellent and i haven't i i have been deliberately pitching
long stuff because we're all stuck in for more than 45 minutes but yeah um hey you know music
hasn't made the list yet and that sounds fucking dope i appreciate the the diversity of uh of thinking
here it sounds really i mean it sold me on it and uh i'm a hard sell so cool sweet i hope people
enjoy this uh my thing is i forget if we had made rules about them like just being media or
whatever but uh so there is a media attached to it but um i actually came up with more ideas of what
things have i been like what activities have i been doing um i was wanting to do a mini section on
that at the end anyway so i feel like this would be perfect well i have a bunch to add to that but uh
the one that i want to do like a longer dive on is the polyphasic sleep youtube channel
uh one of the things that i have been experimenting with since i'm working from home now is
i'm trying a polyphasic sleep schedule i'm doing a every man where there is a 3.5 hour core sleep
and then uh three 20 minute naps dispersed throughout the day and it cuts well if you're
not familiar with polyphasic sleep it is designed to try to optimize sleep for less time sleeping
and then like better quality sleep this uh youtube series talks about it started out talking about um
whether polyphasic sleep is safe because there's a lot of debate about whether you can reliably
do it long term and not mess up your health and sanity i have heard that is a huge issue it's
definitely i mean sleep is very important uh it's literally like it's how you heal and it's how you
encode memories uh into your long term memory at the end of the day and don't get it for long
enough you die yeah well yeah uh but also like more short term you can just start getting sick
you can gain weight you can become depressed uh you can more easily get stressed out or irritable
like it's uh it kind of affects everything so a bunch of caveats about like make sure you do a
lot of research if you want to try experimenting with polyphasic sleep but i decided to try it
because first of all it's something everyone wanted to do forever but it just never really
fit with my schedule since i attended to work well i've always worked in offices and like it's
pretty irritating actually that offices don't have a like mandatory nap break at least once per
day there's so much there's so much data showing that we're first of all like
ancestrally we were kind of designed to sleep uh in the middle of the day like around
two or three p.m. it's like you're circadian uh you could watch people circadian rhythm and
like their alertness and everything dip right around that time just like
uh across humans uh so this this i well i wanted to let you finish your sales pitch
on this first but i just have to ask like how do you take a 20 minute nap because i i have found
that if i like alright i'm tired i'm gonna try and zonk out for a minute i never fall asleep
within 20 minutes i fall asleep within five minutes when i go to bed at night because i'm
always exhausted but like if i could try and schedule a nap it never works yeah so that's
there's a lot of reasons why polyphasic sleep isn't for everyone one of them is just that
genetically some people are more efficient sleepers than others um but i actually could never nap
like throughout my life uh if i tried to i until you started sleeping 3.5 hours a night
well um i started actually like learning how to nap it's actually a skill you can train
which oh god you think you think becoming unconscious would be something that'd be
really good at just doing for fuck's sake brains why can't you just be good at the things that
we should all be able to do automatically sorry go ahead i'll stop interrupting
now i was complaining about you know like certain brain states here and sometimes
where you're just like having a ton of ideas and you're just like if i could just take a
snapshot of this brain state and then like load it when i need it same thing with like
calm relaxed brain state or happy brain state or i don't know anyway um yeah transhuman future
needs to get here faster uh so the person who runs the youtube channel is crimson flower uh
and he also has a discord channel that a lot of rationalists are on i don't know if uh
this person is in the community or not uh i was under the impression he was or was adjacent
but the videos detail first of all like we're talking about falsifiability um a lot of the videos
are okay so if you're going to argue that polyphasic sleep is dangerous then you would have to prove
that this is true so like a bunch of the early videos and i really appreciated this were actually
like here's how you could falsify this claim if you wanted to uh and that was in response to
a bunch of people just like constantly non-stop hearing that somebody's doing polyphasic sleep
and being like oh my god did you hear about all the scientific studies that say you need eight
hours a night which yes there are many of and yes sleep is important but uh people don't tend to
have any evidence for why they think this wouldn't work so he's actually generously being like if
you could show that uh for example there are periods of sleep that aren't one of the main
categories of like deep sleep ram sleep the other ones that i'm blanking on there's just these kind
of like dead periods where you're kind of just unconscious um they don't seem to serve any
purpose and a lot of what polyphasic sleep cycles try to do is cut those out and just get the parts
of sleep that are doing something restorative some people think that it's kind of like a chest
rich and spence thing like we don't know what these are doing so cut them out at your own peril and
i i i usually go back to the default that i've seen people try to do it before and every time
i've seen someone try to do it it's always ended in disaster uh so i don't know it just
it seems that this is sort of hard limitation with the current biological bodies we got but
if you managed to make it work i would be very interested in hearing that yeah i'm on like day
two so i'll let you know how it goes um usually with the every man's like oh there's a period of
it feeling really really great for like a week it feeling pretty shitty for the next week and then
it's slowly starting to feel great again so i'm expecting that um uh yeah i will link to both the
youtube and the discord all righty yeah that certainly sounds interesting i'm glad you guys
are outside the box on like i was like a like tv and video games so perfect i was struggling to
come up with like what fun things am i doing because most of what i have been doing is work and then
like projects but i'm like how people having fun i built i'm building two bikes
two bikes well i am building i'm repairing a motorcycle and i put together a uh
fixie bike that i got on amazon which is a okay okay fixed gear bike cool well uh do we want to do
a couple listener feedbacks before we wrap up uh i think so yeah sure cool uh this one is uh
addressed to me and this was back when i mentioned that polak is the polish word for a polish person
and i don't see why we can't reclaim that uh here's why bar tech says uh in ash said he wants to
reclaim polak is the normal meaning polish person as i'm polish myself i want to tell you please don't
firstly it's been used negatively even in the 2000s and still sometimes may be used this way
in the uk since there was a lot of polish immigration there more important even discarding
prior negative usage it sounds cringy as fuck do you ever say i was in spain and i parted with
the espanolese the speaker would sound like a weirdo trying to signal knowing the language
while clearly not knowing the language pola is fine lots of words are weird and can mean multiple
things and i guess okay if there's an actual person like i mean i'm of polish ancestry but i
don't have any really exposure to any of that and if real people from poland are like don't do this
it's stupid then all right i didn't know it was still being used negatively and all that too
it was easy enough to discourage your parents because they're old buddy buddies but exactly
yeah if it's topical then yeah i don't know isn't that what climbing is about though like
it's literally taking something that has a has been used as a slur has negative connotations and
like the word bitch is something that you can now say like wow is like you're a badass bitch or
whatever yeah it's still used pejoratively as well but it used to be literally apparently uh
i don't have like really solid sources for this but apparently it was considered a much worse word
than whore and i think victorian air like it's the worst thing i remember bitch was considered
i remember bitch was considered really bad even when i was a kid it was like the b word and you
did not say that ever i feel like now it's like kind of on the level of crap where it's only barely
a curse word yeah maybe it's not quite as bad we've had to move on to other more bad words
because it's been yeah reclaimed so much so yeah i don't know and i have that a queer used to be
entirely just negative and now it just means you know queer that one has been used as a pejorative
but then there's also a bunch of people that are but there's a really complicated thing around that
that i could explain if you care but it's okay really quick um it's your trans exclusive radical
feminists i believe are theorized to be the people spreading this misinformation because
there's people who are gay or lesbian uh who don't like the word queer because it's an umbrella term
and it can be used to include people that don't fall into the categories that they think are the real
uh people that belong in the lgbtq fold or whatever so people were spreading misinformation
about queer queer is like this horrible insult and it triggers me when i hear it uh and how people
are using it like actually like if you go back in early like literally it's called queer theory
and it's been called queer theory for a long time and it is yeah actually i mean queer hasn't been a
bad word since like what the fifties it's like is still used pejoratively but like it also was
used as like a descriptor uh a self descriptor or as like a you know something positive so
i've heard it used pretty much only as a as a positive thing like yeah i'm queer i'm here
