and i'm queer and i'm proud i'm like particularly pro that word existing because somebody who
doesn't know how they identify yet or who identifies as something but is closeted because
like their family would disown them if they came out or it would be like socially disadvantaged
can use it to still signal that they belong to this community without necessarily like
having themselves that way or nailing down their identity that was longer than i wanted to make that
somebody else talk about something uh we have another piece of feedback from William Eden
William Eden is one of our generous supporters and says the reason i wanted to support you guys
is that the general error around rationality is something like criticism and attack which
i didn't realize it is but okay maybe it is some in some places okay i have a story and
okay and i love the podcast for the moment i first listened because you seem to genuinely
and enthusiastically like rationality it's kind of sad and crazy that that's a
distinguished characteristic but there it is i both wanted to support the creation of a
community public good and specifically support your positive and inspiring message to the community
so i'm very happy about that i think that even though i i've struggled with depression most
of my life it is um i have a lot of fun doing this and i just feel better when i am like excited
and positive about things so that's basically the energy i always try to um put forward whenever i
am in a public place and it makes me happier to do that so i guess this is just sort of a a side
effect of who i am and who i choose to be around but uh if he likes that that is great i'm very
happy about that and i am surprised that there's this thing about criticism and attack rather
than enthusiasm and you said you have some more information about that yeah or i was going to
say i have an anecdote um although i want to start by saying thank you for supporting us
William Eaton and also that was a really great message um yeah it was it made me feel really
good i yeah i want a third that and then sorry go ahead jace that's okay um yeah i remember
actually reading this feedback when i was going through uh like mini depressive episode thing
and that making me feel good and any to what you were saying uh one of i think this is science-based
and then like i'm kind of laughing because we're talking about people calling things science-based
earlier um but one of the efficacious uh ways of mitigating depression is by doing things that make
other people happy like helping others helps you more than doing things that are night good for
yourself i guess yeah wow that was awkwardly phrased it's the following basic sleep i'm not i'm not
adjusted yet i hear it just keeps getting worse but no that that is a thing that i have heard
okay but i have heard constantly that uh getting that making other people's lives better is the
best way to be happy yeah and i found this to be the case like moving to moving from a like
money oriented career to values oriented careers like really impacted my sense of having
worth and having a reason to get up in the morning and yeah um anyway the little anecdote that i had
was that um and some of them are probably listening to it now there's a discord group that uh is made
up of a bunch of Denver locals who did meet up things in person before COVID and now they're
doing a bunch of web-based meet-up things it's actually um really cool they have like
a bunch of different channels for learning new skills or teaching other people new skills like
and stuff like that sharing media whatever advice but um so phoenix and i are both on there and i
think phoenix posted something uh scott alexander's in response to somebody asking a question about
oh it was irbs somebody had uh mentioned an irb and phoenix is like oh you should read this and
posted the my irb nightmare and a bunch of people jumped on it they're like scott alexander isn't
he that neo nazi guy oh my god oh man i heard that he believes these things and that whole
community is full of people that are just like sheltering nazis and i forget what other things
they were accusing the community of and then of course like when phoenix and i were like actually
i've had really great experiences with this community and i think that's a mischaracterization
they like went on well we thought at first it was rational wiki because like we know that
that's kind of a garbage pile but sorry if you contribute to rational wiki and he listeners but
i'm not it sucks yeah it does but even the like real wikipedia article somebody should really edit
it because it kind of is a biography of elia zeukowski and then it talks about roko's basilisk
and then it like mentions that rationality was the birthplace of the neo reaction movement and that's
like the bulk of the information holy shit it does like to be fair also mentioned after the
neo reaction thing oh yeah and defective altruism oh my god so the people that know that the
rationality community exist seem to have this idea that it's a bunch of self-aggrandizing tech
pros you think they're smarter than everybody else and or racist and whatever else whatever other
things bad people do well uh i and that made me sad i guess i don't i suppose i technically should
be sad i just have a really hard time caring i'm like my community is great and you guys can go
be miserable in your community of haters if you want a very good community it's just that there's
like misinformation uh out there and it makes me sad because
people misinformation had to come from like some bitter people though right i think it's just
political um i remember a lot of instances of people coming across less wrong finding something
that looked like it belongs to the opposite political party and then immediately like casting
a distrustful eye on it and trying to pick every like look up you know like what's the
list of all the bad things that people in this community have done aha i knew it they're bad
yeah i i do i do particularly love that scott alexander every now and then does get in calling
all seriousness a neo nazi and we're like you know he lost relatives in the holocaust like this is
this is not okay sure whatever you say he is he's the most nazi of all the neo nazis still
reminds me of like the kind of witch hunting that went on a tumblr where one of my favorite
artists and writers actually like changed careers and left tumblr because they got branded uh
transphobic uh like nazi supporting oh it was the other thing i don't know anyway they're trans
gender and they're oh my god dude remember when lacy green was like you know became the the
all trans tumblr people hate her for some reason this is partly i think why it's hard for me to
ever try the show steven universe because this might be related one of these two people that you're
talking about might be the person who like did some fan art and the the character they drew wasn't
fat enough or something and they got like docs they got like death threats and you should kill
yourselves out the wazoo and it's like sorry i am new to drawing like but that's that's a toxic
community you can't blame steven universe for that it's a good show yeah that's another thing
that no no for sure but oh i know it's just it's i think it's kind of like what people see when they
you know come across the wikipedia page of rationality and they're like oh that's not for me
so i'll see like the the fandom for a show and like oh this thing looks like it's terrible um if
this is the kind of people that like it right yeah don't get me wrong i'm sure i'm here it's great
yeah i see what you're saying it is really good i also love it yeah uh if you're into the like
very positive that's yeah that's one of the things i love about it it's just relentlessly
positive and optimistic and i would i would watch it to feel better about the world
yeah it's pretty great yeah don't get me wrong i need to give it a shot it's just like i said it's
it just it the uh the exposure i had to at first was through that and i'm like oh okay so it's this
show that a bunch of fucking lunatics like because look at what they did to this poor person for not
being a good enough artist yeah but you watch rick and morty too and rick and morty is also loved by
a bunch of fucking lunatics absolutely so don't get me wrong it but because the the causal order
happened the other way with rick and morty for me okay i was able to be like oh this show is hilarious
and then you go online and be like oh wow a bunch of lunatics like this show but they're all idiots
i know that it's fine and fine i can appreciate it for the right reasons the reason i keep saying
that this is sad is that like uh to use steven universe as an example like there was a good friend
of mine uh that i ran into at an anime convention and we're both cosplaying and i was cosplaying a
steven universe character and they were like oh uh that's a great cosplay but i refuse to watch that
show because i don't want to be associated with those people and i was like but it's a good show
and you're missing out by not seeing it in fact you particularly i think would like this for
particular reasons that like i don't know uh so i was just thinking about man the fact
that this person cares first of all about the signaling thing like i think that that's something
that people worry about that if i get into this rationality community i'll be associated with
these bad people even if the ideas are good which uh and yeah like these are this is a really great uh
uh discord group and these people are really intelligent uh and they would i think get a lot
of value out of actually reading sequences or reading slate sarcotics but they probably won't
because they you know what's rationality well it's uh where the you know where they shelter
nazis and make up thought experiments about basilisks and it's where tech bros go to be
all bro like yeah we're such a bro community if i were to find one one word to describe it that'd
be it we're always going to the gym and getting swole it is uh somewhat white male dominated
i think that also turns people off there's not much you can do about that though other than like
just trying to be accessible which i think it is right like if it just happens to be where
15 years ago there are more white dudes reading crap online than there were uh
i don't know other groups of people which may or may not be the case like i remember that was a
problem with the skeptic i mean the internet used to be largely white dudes that's my point so like
if if something started on the internet it might just be like sort of just the the way it's going
to land until things get going um it's like i think unless your group has like a specific
message that says no we want to stay all white dudes then i i don't really know what how to address
that problem right that is a hard problem i also think it's somewhat interesting that you know the
fact that white men like something automatically means it's probably bad yeah i mean i think that's
another thing that people see and you know they back away from the community a bit i mean any
asher also somebody who will occasionally rail on how white men are terrible and ruin everything
well i think it's more about how i have um very complicated issues with men but it's not white
men for me it's just all men hashtag not all men uh the hashtag yes all men god damn it
but no not really that it's like i said it's a it's a complicated thing which
maybe some other day we can not get into honestly like when Steven's like yeah but how do you get like
minorities into your group i was like well we could just like
drive around in bands and just start abducting people off the street and this is what gives
rationalism a bad name i mean at least there's some outside the box thinking for me other than
saying like we have a you know than having an open an open uh door policy we have cookies i
yeah like i i realized that there are more specific like concentrated outreach things
that people can do like if we had national meetups who could give uh you know if you checked enough
boxes that weren't white men you could come in for free or something would pay for your flight or
whatever but that that's makes it like tokenism i don't know exactly right so that's either you're
being i'm throwing my hands up but people can't see it yeah like i i don't know how to solve that
problem i'm there's probably like i said i think outreach is something that people are knowledgeable
about that aren't me but i don't really know how to solve that problem you didn't want this to be a
problem you shouldn't have been so white and so male steven yeah well you know when i was when
i was building my character sheet i i picked the uh uh the stats that i can't finish the joke
yeah uh yeah i think we've gotten pretty far afield and we should probably wrap it up yeah
we're we still gonna talk about activities or do you want to save that for another time
at this point we should probably hold on to that for some other time okay
okay works for me yeah yeah that works i guess in a sentence i can just say make sure you get up
from your desk and move around once in a while it's good for you yeah yeah i at least you know all
my stuff's downstairs like food wise so if i have to get up and do something at least i have to you
know go up and downstairs which is nice way to stay mo you know in motion yeah third i had on
killer back pain the lower like lumbar spine back pain and hip flexor things for
like a month and a half and since working from home uh since i am not sitting in an office chair
for eight hours staring at a computer screen i mean i'm still sitting and staring at a computer
screen because i'm working but i can sit cross legged on the floor uh or i can like sit on my
wobble cushion that's another recommendation i'm gonna stick that in the recommendations
pile get a wobble cushion it's like you know there's ballchairs so you can sit on it's like
that except it's in cushion form so you can put it on your chair and you still can
like strengthen your lower back with it and fidget by moving around and it's good
good life hack cool uh yeah i'll take another that says i could use something like that just
being able to get up and play a round of beat saver in between answering a bunch of queries or
like go walk in the kitchen and like pre-make a few meals for the next day or just like get
up stretch change positions uh my back pain is like virtually gone like very quickly and the
thing is i was trying everything like i bought all these like fancy chair insert things and
i was getting i was paying for massages i was doing like back stretches i got like
pain salves and patches and just not sitting in an office chair was the solution of course
and i'm kind of torn about not like wanting to go back to work in the office because
of the back pain but also dude the pain is a serious issue the isolation
and for most jobs if you're having uh comfort issues that are impacting your work you can get
the office to accommodate that and you know like there's no reason you couldn't buy one of those
those butt cushions for your own chair but there's also a great reason that you can get your
office to pay for it i have um kind of been i've had on my task list for many months now make a
standing desk and i've made like incremental progress towards that i got monitorizers that
should work and then i was kind of like at the step of okay i should research what shoes i should
wear and stuff and then i just like didn't because other stuff kept taking priority i made my own
standing desk like real cheap there was a uh god i don't know like maybe 40 and works pretty nice
yeah no i think it's not fancy but put my stuff on monitorizers and then i just have to
i just have to do it and now i have more motivation if we ever end up like
unquarantining to actually do that yeah sorry for that tangent no that's good i think that's
that's all good advice i'm sure there's all kinds of guys and stuff where people can best
you know set up a home office to be comfortable and stuff but um yeah other than that i hope that
this was a nice bit of positivity that wasn't uh totally dwelling on how shitty everything is right
now so and give give people some ideas of things to do to fill some time so if you guys have any
ideas you want to share them you can join you can join the community at the beige and conspiracy
discord and by all means throw them in the episode chat for this episode or wherever it feels appropriate
and uh i mean there's even a channel on there for covid 19 panic maybe we can make another one for
covid 19 like chill and we'll have all the we'll have all the fun shit that people are doing
that actually sounds like a great idea that should happen that will happen that'll be done soon so
well we have a chill corner we do that's that's true yeah all right we could just rename it we
don't need another one until covid is over so it's gone for any case yeah if you're
get bored at home too there's also a discord to chat with us and other people on and uh
other than that oh i guess do we want to thank a patron we should and i guess since we already
mentioned him do we want to thank uh william eden i think that sounds appropriate okay well
william eden thank you not only did you make us feel better and happier as as people for for
saying that we help you out like that you also help us financially which is the thing that just
keeps happening every time we put out an episode and actually the last time we had uh because we
i i pay us all basically every six months last time it was a decent amount it was like previously
had been enough you know to buy a dinner or two but uh it's like a side you got to the point where
it was like yeah yeah it was like nothing to live off of but i yeah i saw the checkouts like hey
and this ain't bad so that was better than a bill it's it's awesome it was a nice thing and
we appreciate the nice things that you guys can do for us uh in this case specifically william eden
and and on that note not to totally contradict that but if you're in the position at all where
like you're one of the many millions people who don't have jobs right now and you're trying to cut
corners uh by all by all means let this be a corner you cut we'd love for you to for you to come back
if when you know employment resumes and stuff but don't be sitting there thinking oh man how am i
gonna pay my patreon dues to the base of conspiracy um if your if your budget is tight uh i am
making this declaration without consulting my co-host because i feel that strongly about it
how dare you steven no i totally don't get don't let yourself get fucked over by uh you know trying
