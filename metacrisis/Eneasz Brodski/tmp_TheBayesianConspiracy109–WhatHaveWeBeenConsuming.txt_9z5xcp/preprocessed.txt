and we are, I guess we have a quick announcement at the beginning, GS is now pivoting to Jace,
it is not a different person at all, so uh...
Or it is a different person, a whole new person.

like talking to doctors and the psychologist and stuff so a little bit
nice okay yeah that makes sense yeah oh so I I've got a you know as you correct
if my idea here is wrong of the show topic we're gonna or the episode topic
we're going to discuss basically content things that we've consumed for people
to enjoy while they're locked at home is that essentially the idea exactly we
were going to do other stuff but like everyone is just kind of down with this
whole quarantining thing and it sucks and we said let's have a lighter episode
about stuff that we've been really enjoying that has helping us get through
the quarantine then maybe we'd like to share with our listeners they might
enjoy it as well awesome I've got another piece of like exciting news not
that exciting but it's not content related so I refinanced my house what
like three days ago sign the refi loan for 1.1% less I think oh my god that's
a lot yeah well I signed on for 4.75 at the beginning so now I'm just down to
reasonable yeah grants man but that is like 200 bucks a month so that's kind
of cool mm-hmm and it's not that difficult right no it was super easy
barely an inconvenience if you have a mortgage now's a great time to refinance
yeah all I did was respond to an email from my lender which I guess I should
mention I guess I don't know if they I doubt Cherry Creek mortgage does outside
of Colorado but I have no idea if anyone's in Colorado and is buying a
house or want to check with Cherry Creek mortgage message Sabrina Kerry at Cherry
Creek mortgage she's been great she did all this stuff for me she just sent out
like an email blast saying hey rates are crazy low that then again it took like
six weeks to get everything finalized so this was almost two months ago and yeah
anyway I'm wondering she's great I've been wondering if this might be a good
time to invest in property it's probably I don't know yeah that's the thing I
was going to be buying a place right around now last year this was my plan
and now I mean first of all I got the whole back thing which is slowing me
down but I'm also like I I don't know if I should buy now because nobody very few
people are buying so it seems like prices are dropping and oh yeah I kind of
want to hold off a bit see if they keep going down or what exactly is going to
happen so it's a weird time yeah by invest in property I meant like buy a
house to live in it's not you're probably talking about buying another
investment property well I was but like yeah in general it might just be a good
idea to wait another month or two because at least yeah for prices to drop
another one or two percent is a lot when you're talking about several hundred a
thousand dollars it's probably as long as I will need to like get a mortgage and
shop around anything that's not gonna suggest as you can at least look to see
what you can get approved for now but it's definitely something that if you
want to do you should start getting on because yeah like you said it takes a
couple months and you want to be ready to jump on it once once it looks like it
might be turning yeah I have actually bought two houses before which is oh
yeah it's weird to think about well you haven't you haven't said you moved to
Denver so for me it's it's a shift but yeah you know what you're doing yeah
actually like kind of miss working on renovating houses yeah something that I
kind of I really like hated it the first time I did it because I was working at
the video game company very long hours and then I would like leave work do my
45-minute commute back to this house it would be dark and that I'd just be like
in the dark with some floodlights nailing down wooden floor it's very rewarding
work though it is I was really burning myself out on it the first time and I
was like so you know it was the first time doing it I didn't know what the
hell I was doing I was looking at YouTube videos but then like yeah now it's been
a while since I've done it and I'm like kind of like I miss it yeah after after
like every week of work you look around you're like damn I can literally see in
the physical world the difference that I've made yeah it's really cool feeling
my dad's a well he builds houses or a modeler but he is also capable of just
building houses from the ground up or additions and he's always said that like
actually like I love my job I get a lot of satisfaction from providing one of the
basic necessities of life for people yeah and that always kind of stuck with
me is like yeah that's probably like if you don't know what you're gonna or what
you want to do with your life or what would be rewarding or fulfilling maybe
think about one of those building things or it's nice to be able to see the
fruits of your labor I've worked a lot of random jobs over the years and the
ones where like you could look at the pile of stuff at the end of the day be
like that's what I worked on that's always nice the job I have now is kind of
like that even if you can't like point at it in physical space I can at least
like I can at least look at me like that's what I worked on you're still
building things just yeah in a virtual world that's right I can do it without
sitting or without leaving my chair nice yeah that's that's the opposite of
accounting accounting you're doing the same damn spreadsheets every month just
updating numbers yeah at least it has a paycheck with it yes exactly anyways we
should probably get started and we nowadays get started with the sequences so
shall we hit the sequences first oh no it was not prepared I mean yeah we can
totally talk about them just I forgot that we're doing them first okay so the
first sequence post we have today is called scientific evidence legal
evidence rational evidence and it starts with Eliezer saying that suppose
you're good friend the police commissioner tells you in strictest
confidence that the crime kingpin of your city is Wolke Wilkinson as a
rationalist are you licensed to believe this statement and basically goes on to
point that our legal system would not imprison him on the basis of the police
commissioner statement and there's lots of good reasons for this but also that
that doesn't mean that the police commissioner statement is not rational
evidence and it would be really dumb for you to go up and insult Wolke if you
were told this so the definition of legal evidence is like a special protected
class of evidence but it's not the only level of evidence that people can and
should take into account he then goes on to extend this to say that science is
made up of generalizations which apply to many specific or to many particular
instances so that you can run real-world tests and test these generalizations and
verify for yourself that the generalization is true without having to
trust anyone's authority science is publicly reproducible knowledge of
humankind and it also should be a protected pool of beliefs that's
especially reliable so it also has a different standard of evidence than just
general rational evidence all this work in so far yeah I think so I think that's
been one of the things that even since before I was introduced to rationality
that was a sales point for science because I in the context of whatever like
high school arguing with religious people you know that was always a common
comeback well that's just like you're it's the same sort of thing you know you
believe it because Darwin said it science your religion yeah right and and like in
in all charity it's not like the dumbest thing to say if you have no idea what
either person's talking about you look at someone saying well I think this and I
think that well what makes your beliefs more founded than theirs and it's like
because I can go verify mine and then they say well cuz I just believe them
I believe real strong it is interesting like most of science is like publicly
reproducible knowledge and yet like I can't reproduce the results of you know
the 2015 Large Hadron Collider experiments right yeah theoretically like you
could reproduce them and get the same results but if I had if I had a large
hadron collider economically feasible and also you might not have the expertise
needed to do it right I think I think the important thing is that it's not
revealed knowledge that's the distinction like this isn't something that like oh
no I was told this through these magic tablets and a hat or in a dream or a
waterfall told me or whatever it's like no no I went and looked on this island I
measured the beaks on these birds you guys can all do the same thing if you
feel like it yeah you cannot reproduce special revelation from God but not only
can you reproduce the science stuff the ways to reproduce it is publicly
available so that people can test it assuming you know they have the ability
yeah and that gets into the whole pet peeve or whatever of mine that like I
really wish that there was more prestige to be had from doing replications
yeah but we do have because the scientific pool of knowledge is something
that is supposed to be general and apply to many things we want it to be a
protected pool of belief that is especially reliable and that we impose
special strong additional standards before we canonize it as quote-unquote
scientific knowledge so he also then goes on to ask that like how about this
hypothetical statement the Sun will rise on September 18th is that a scientific
belief and before we go forward I want I want to know what you guys think or if
you have any opinions on that is that statement a scientific belief I'm
pausing because I'm hesitant to answer anything with like put this in square
scare quotes and does this fit in this category or not I would say it is a
rational belief and it would hmm yeah you can't you can't replicate it like you
could wait and then record the Sun rising but the thing is like it depends on
how pedantic you want to be like does the Sun rise or do we go around it well
yeah I mean basically I guess meaning will the earth continue to turn on the
18th so that it looks like the Sun is rising I think that's a scientific
prediction I don't know what like to say like I have a belief about the future
you could say I'm I predict that on August 18th the Sun will the Sun will
rise or whatever September 18th whatever day it was like based on the fires the
Sun has risen well even like as a scientist you can just put your neck out
and say alright I'll bet you ten million dollars it rises on the 18th of
September right yeah but going by his definition it has to be something
reproducible which I'm not sure if that means like a phenomena that you could
record or that you have to actually like cause the thing to happen I don't know I
think that's putting hairs too much yeah he did he basically said what what you
guys have said that um the the point of scientific knowledge that it's
generalizable it's evidence it's a system of generalizations and so the whole point
is to be able to make future predictions and if you couldn't it would be
completely useless but the actual prediction is based on his based on his
definition not a scientific belief in itself it's a prediction you make from
scientific beliefs and you could say that it's a prediction of this theory but
since it is a specific thing rather than a generalization it's it's more of an
experiment than a scientific belief in itself which I thought was an interesting
distinction to make I I'm not sure well no I do know why that's in there because
it relates to the next post but when I read just this post itself I was like
okay that's an interesting distinction and I can buy it I'm not sure why it's
being made here but sure why not but yeah it seems like a scientific belief is
more like a belief along the lines of objects in motion tend to stay in motion
and the earth is rotating so it will tend to stay rotating unless something
acts against it and since we don't see anything coming to stop the rotation of
the earth anytime soon it should continue to rotate and so the Sun should
continue to rise and thus we predict on September 18th it will so you know the
beliefs are that the earth is in motion and it will stay that way whereas the
Sun will rise is a specific prediction rather than a scientific belief
yeah I don't have I don't have much like to split hairs there about it's kind
of interesting like Sam Harris makes that sort of broad case for science in
the moral landscape and I guess rather than dive into that it's worth at least
checking out you know some short talk or essay that he gave about that book or
read the book it's not that long it's kind of fun even if you think he's
wrong so it's it's just the I mean is it like a scientific statement is it a
scientific question I was gonna go into examples but it's kind of an aside so
well what was the thing that he said like the one thing that you said was the
same well it wasn't quite the same it was just more like you give a kind of
hashed out definition of like what it means for this to be scientific or not
and then through his lens he's like okay well because even the the foundation of
science comes with like fundamental values like parsimony intellectual
honesty evidence that sort of stuff then why don't we just go ahead and add into
that value bucket like suffering is bad and not suffering is good and then we
can like then it's just a matter of you know plug and chug to figure out what
works in the universe just like we do with what makes rockets fly right yeah
basically but like as far as like the little they're not even quite puzzles
it's just like intuition pumps it's like is it a scientific question to ask how
many birds are currently in flight around the world right now like it's not
one that we can answer even in like in practice maybe in principle like well
definitely in principle if we had a fully working simulation of the planet
then we could just you know if bird in flight count increase one but since we
don't have that the question is like a real question about reality but is
unanswerable is that therefore unscientific it's like little things
like that so that's why I don't like that's any time I see science and stuff
in quotes it it's kind of just I sometimes worry if they're splitting hairs
but that's not really the point Elias is making here and yet I managed to make a
non-related point for a minute and a half so yeah I was gonna kind of rant a
little bit about how frustrated I get by the fact that we don't really have like
we don't tend to police the definition of science in the casual parlance as
strongly as I would like for example every single shampoo or like makeup or oh
my god scientifically formulated to do yeah yeah or like with the power of
science it's kind of like Rachel sent me this picture yesterday which has been
around for a long time but it's like these hovering drones and it's some
news article covering it it says they used code and algorithms to make those
drones don't clash and crash into each other like what else would they have
used my standard my standard reply to that is always just like quote they
used words and sentences to write this book and yeah I mean I guess they didn't
use bumpers that they attached to the robot right which is kind of an
algorithm if you hit the bumper go the other way it's not one it's not one that
you have to code into it it's like a room but like aerial right exactly that's
how real birds work right birds are weird they have like magnetism sense anyway
cool essence yes so on to the next post which is related to this one and what
we've been talking about actually kind of what the last one was setting up yeah
is molecular nanotechnology quote-unquote scientific and did someone else want to
drive on this one I would just point out that I don't know how we took the other
ones out of order on the last episode I'm told they find it because they were
great but this would have been perfect to follow up with the uh Chronix episode
yeah I was really disappointed we didn't yeah we are now the new last wrong is in
a different order and I think um we probably were on the new last wrong and
we like hit the next button or whatever yes if you if you hit the next and
previous buttons then they go I believe they were the AI AI from AI to zombies
yeah exactly whereas the only way to get them in the original posting order is to
go to that wiki page that's linked near the top or right by where our uh yeah
apparently right by where I can do that at the same time it's all good it happens
that's right they were really I will like apt for the topic I think
yeah that too yeah it's amazing how applicable to many topics most of these posts are well nobody
knows why this one is applicable yet so we should get into it so I'll just answer the question right
away is molecular scientific is molecular nanotechnology all right let me try this the
third time is molecular nanotechnology scientific and I'll just say yes
well that does not at all help us get through the post though Stephen no no but I'm but I'm
just prepared to like immediately bite that bullet and say yep well okay if I'm a scientist and I say
that it's science does that make it science or do I have to put a lab coat on first you need the
lab coat otherwise how will people know you're a scientist yeah anyway like all the people in
those shampoo commercials it's perfect all right so it starts with consider the statement it is
physically possible to construct diminoid nanomachines which repair biological cells some people will
tell you that molecular nanotechnology is pseudoscience because it has not been verified by experiment
but he says extrapolations of diminoid nanomachines are based on standard physics which is to say
scientific generalizations therefore if you say that nanomachines cannot work you must be inventing
new physics or to put it more sharply if you say that a simulation of a molecular gear is inaccurate
you must claim that atoms thus configured would behave differently from the depiction
then either you know of a flaw in the simulation argument or the simulation algorithm sorry
or you're inventing your own laws of physics yeah I think I mean I can still sympathize with
who's like well you don't know it would work that way we've never seen a molecular gear
yeah you're right as I tried to formulate an argument to sympathize with I found myself unable to
well then the article itself they say what about the rape brothers attempt to build a non-biological
heavier-than-air powered flying machine was that pseudoscience yeah because all flying machines
crashed was always true before that and that that's again so pseudosciences and quotes here um
I I have a kind of a knee jerk thing about putting words like this in quotes this is done in a you
know well articulated and informative way but it's like okay you're trying to make me make
categories and shove things into either one of them when it's like the I think our tendency to do that
is kind of um over engineered no I disagree I think words having specific meanings is really
important but like yeah I I I agree but if we try and shut like hmm I guess I just don't know if
rather than like say all right which bucket does this go into you just talk about the thing
for a minute first and then decide if it has to go into either these buckets
um or I guess maybe we'll make a third bucket for plausible or probable or definitely doable but
not done yet um and then we've got pseudoscience and science right so like the right brothers saying
no I think our planes will work before any plane has ever worked before is not the same as a charlatan
with crystals saying well of course we haven't you know you guys don't believe the crystals
of field cancer yet we haven't seen my crystals yet um right but that's because the charlatan with
crystals has no scientific generalization to go off of like with the right brothers if they were
confronted with this is pseudoscience they would have said look here's the models of physics we're
using everything should work out what do you know about physics that we don't know that we're you
know how are we simulating this incorrectly which is the same thing that someone who makes a nano
machine with a simulation would say like what do you know based on the generalized body of
knowledge we have from science that I am misinterpreting how am I using this knowledge wrong uh and
you know so if someone claims that it's pseudoscience the reason you put it in quotes is because
it's not really pseudoscience it's just science that doesn't have any precedence yet but it looks
like it should be right whereas real pseudoscience is like you know dr crystals crystal magic
where he doesn't have any body any body of scientific knowledge that he's drawing on he's
just like they're crystals so magnets they do things with vibes I think oh vibes okay yeah they
they can vibrate differently and make you vibrate different and there's not an actual
scientific body of knowledge that supports any of that it's just bullshit that has a
sciency sound to the words totally and it's one of those things like I think it's easy to just to
at least give illustrations that aren't even historical illustrations that would persuade
somebody from saying something that like well no molecular nanotechnology is unscientific or
chronic is unscientific because we don't have any proof examples yet and so like I I think would be
informative to give the example of like well sure we don't have any examples of humans being able
to survive outside of the earth moon orbit but it seems like a very plausible belief to say that
they could survive a trip to mars under safe conditions it's not like but but of course we
haven't done that yet so would it be is that a unscientific thing to say it seems kind of like
uh splitting hairs between like the past and the future is the mistake that some people are making
when they're uh throwing future tech that doesn't exist yet into the pseudoscience bucket
yeah he says that uh if you decide to make a strong positive assertion that nanomachines are impossible
you are being irrational you are even being unscientific because an ungranted assertion
that tomorrow the sun will not rise is unscientific because you need this needlessly contradicted
the best extrapolation from current scientific knowledge and if you were to say that nanomachines
are unscientific you would also be needlessly contradicting the best extrapolation from current
scientific knowledge and I think as you were saying the same goes for cryonics that if you are
saying that uh these these tissues cannot be preserved what what is making you say that
yeah I'm pretty sure that this is actually about cryonics and AI um I remember it's definitely
about AI because that's what all the sequences are about uh first well yeah the first um
I went to a lesser on made up I remember getting like schooled by the other members when they talked
about total brain stimulation or emulation and I said that that was impossible and they basically
had the same argument back at me where it was like it's very difficult it would be very difficult
we can't we can't currently do it that doesn't mean that it's impossible yeah there's no reason
to think that it's impossible and it took me a while of arguing with them until I started
understanding I guess that they were uh yeah like this isn't the way that people casually or
conventionally used like the word scientific or and like possible or impossible kind of kind of
used to mean like very likely or very unlikely like we like to we like to exaggerate it could be
impossible to simulate a human mind in silicon like we don't know for sure that it isn't impossible
but all the current evidence says there's no reason to think that I was going off of uh
I was remembering Ray Kurzweil had said something kind of silly about
brain emulation that showed that he didn't understand neurons I think he said that like
we can take each neuron and encode it in like a few bits and then we would it would only need
this many bits or something like I forget it was a long time ago but you know so I was thinking
that that was like the thing that people were proposing and oh okay it was kind of an argument
that like where we actually had we were kind of arguing about two different things and it took us
a while of kind of talking past each other to see that's why I think it's important that words
have specific meanings because um yeah like double-correcting on things tabooing words or
making sure that words are defined really facilitates communication I think that is the
root of many of a disagreement where people are arguing about things that they're not actually
they're not they're not arguing with about what they think they're arguing about
and so they just they run in circles chasing down different positions where it's like no
wait actually let's just lay out what we actually believe okay yeah that's basically what I was
going to say what are we fighting about again yeah the thing is I don't know how active you guys
are on our discord but I'm on there a lot especially now that I'm quarantined and
like half the arguments seem to be basically that like people were arguing for the same thing but
using different words and it takes half a day to get there and actually understand there's no argument
and I don't know the the annoying part is that like if this argument was done face to face in
the real world it wouldn't be a big deal first of all it would go faster but like people are also
kind of nicer and more charitable when they're face to face with people whereas online people are
more likely to get snippy and like oh you're misrepresenting me on purpose and that part
kind of sucks and it's just because it's a very town exactly I want to give a mad shout out right
now to my boy three all men because that dude is notorious on the discord for steelmanning the
hell out of everything but it's also just like a really good habit when you're in online spaces
because yeah you can't sit on a voice if you're grumpy for some reason you slept bad or you're
hungry you might like misinterpret things as more hostile than they actually are and things spiral
just that emoji mean winky face there's some like a stikwink or a playful wing oh you son of a
bitch start casting winking at me joking aside I mean I'm I'm so glad that emoji or emoticons
or whatever exist it's emoji do not yeah I guess it's imagine now I that was a terrible movie um
oh well yeah the movie was bad but I use a lot of gifts too gifts as well yeah yeah so uh slack
as you look at it at discord's man at it but you just type in you know the giffy extension and then
find an appropriate gift that relates to it it's like perfect the english language wasn't enough but
that small quiet picture is or quite quiet movie is this dancing cat wearing a fedora
completely expresses what I was trying to get at here I don't even round out my argument perfectly
exactly um this is such an aside but uh I'll be quick there was this app it no longer exists
I'm sad there might be something similar I don't know but it was a chat app that you could
only communicate with each other in gifts and my co-workers and I installed it and it was
really it was like kind of the texting version of charades cool it sounds delightful it was
really entertaining it was more entertaining than it had any right to be actually which is
probably why it doesn't exist anymore uh so are we done on this topic yeah the post ends that
uh diamondoid nano systems are possible is merely a best guess it's merely based on qualitative
approximate potentially falsifiable reasoning from beliefs already in the protected belief pool
of science such a guess is not reliable enough itself to be added to the protective belief pool
it is merely rational oh yeah and I forgot about falsifiability as well but yeah add that to the
list of requirements for something to be scientific yeah replica based on based on facts
something you could observe or replicate yourself something that would that has ways of falsifying
it yeah so these things are not necessarily scientific beliefs but they are rational beliefs
based on the scientific pool all right so for next time our uh blessed on posts will be fake
explanations and guessing the teacher's password which is a famous one nice all right getting
into the main topic of discussion for this week uh steven what have you been consuming that has
made your life more happy in the in the quarantine give it to us in five to ten minutes all right
well i had another guideline which was don't fill as many things as i can in the five to ten minutes
yes we're going to go we ideally we're going to go two things each but uh steven might have more than
two i i appreciate you accommodating me i'll meet you in the middle i will do so we're gonna do
what a turn two turns each right yeah and do one thing in each turn or in your case possibly more
than one thing in each one i will do two things in each turn but they'll be related so first one's
going to be video games that i've been playing um although maybe this is a bad suggestion because
if you don't already have a nintendo switch they are apparently super hard to get right now um i've
been playing hollow night i've been playing the hell out of this game the last few days
it is what's being played for the uh new doof podcast game club where once a month the community
will get together and vote on what game uh elliot and ruben have to play the other guys who did
deep and packed which was the packed uh basically we want more uh we've got worm style podcast
with delightful accents oh yes australian being inexplicably australian is tight
which is from the captain marvel pitch meeting which everyone should see um so anyway hollow night
is kind of like a just getting a holiday is like a pitch meetings he's he's getting around to telling
us how awesome pitch meeting is that's a given that's good not that's not part of my list if you
haven't seen pitch meetings on youtube just google pitch meeting and enter anything you've seen like
a movie or tv show probably game of thrones my favorite one is yeah my favorite one is pitch
meeting season eight game of thrones it's a wonderful way to start if you've seen season
eight game of thrones and if you haven't like it's got everything from like seinfeld to uh um tiger
king that show that everyone has been pissing themselves about the last month which i completely
refused to watch but i did watch the pitch meeting for anyway this isn't about pitch meeting this is
about hollow night and another video game so um hollow night is like a uh basically it's kind of
like a little 2d dark souls uh with a lot more platforming and a lot less like status management
like you're not toxic or poisoned or bleeding or whatever but it has the same sort of like all
right great new kinds of enemies oh shit i got my ass kicked okay well i start back at the the bench
instead of the bonfire and i fight my way back there and it's a lot of fun and it's cutesy i found a
berserk reference um and it's it's gritty at the same time it's a lot of fun so if you do play that
and enjoy it uh which it's also not just on the switch uh which is why it's a good pick it's for
a lot of platforms um you can check it out on uh doof media's game club podcast as well so
they are also doing streams of it ellie it is on doof media their twitch account so let's see
next video game is going to be this one was a tough one and i had to decide between two but
this one's way more rationally rationality adjacent and it's uh horizon zero dawn for play
station four unfortunately it's a ps4 exclusive um and i can make it my pitch for it really quick
it's uh pretty it's got good soundtrack it's got great voice acting um but basically the cover art
is a girl garbed in like animal furs shooting what seems to be like a kind of robotic bow and arrow
at a robot t-rex and the game extremely well satisfyingly answers the question what the
fuck is going on in this picture how could this ever happen and if you're curious it is such a
good game the reveal is is slow and uh that there's i it's awesome so i really really love the story
and it's one that i have no idea how long hollow net will take me to beat but uh if you want to
crawl through horizon zero dawn it's like 40 50 60 hours for the game so and you can stretch
that out much longer if you're like me and you like to just kind of wander around and i do have a
ps4 now so i should pick that up i've heard that it is like i haven't played that no no well i only
got a ps4 pretty recently i heard that it's just a really like enjoyable game to play like uh the
mechanics are just really satisfying once you get used to them but the story is great like yeah i
heard that it's like as rational as appropriate as like soma was you've probably heard that from me
and it is and i will i will bring it i'll bring it to you and i can leave it in a bag by your door
without touching you and hand you the game i'll also lend you the other game i have god of war
which i wasn't going to make a sales pitch for but which is awesome and everyone should play
also ps4 inclusive um yes jace what's up you have oh thank you for remembering you also have um
psvr right i do that's the reason i bought it you can wait horizon zero dawn was no no no the the
vr is the reason that i bought the PlayStation 4 so i could play beat saber yes um you can also
play horizon zero dawn on vr oh and like get it in 3d vrness you get it in 3d well it you get it
i don't know if it's not like made for vr but it just gives you but i would get full three-dimensional
that okay see that sounds badass i'm so into that you don't get what am i trying to say it's
kind of like you're in vr space and you your tv screen is just like very large it's so it's much
more immersive but like oh okay yeah so it's not like it doesn't like split into two different
screens for my two eyes so it doesn't look like real 3d no oh i'm not so okay also i feel like
playing this on a like a trying to do it like on a 3d emulator sort of thing where like like they
did at the skyrim i feel like that would completely ruin the play of this game yeah uh it's it's it's
not designed to be viewed that way like skyrim was grainy and and flat enough to where that already
worked this absolutely isn't i don't think but it would be a fun experiment if you can play it
with the headset on that sounds like fun so yeah phoenix explains that uh sorry uh horizon zero dawn
and god of war i could probably make it easier to play while like laying down yeah necessary
yeah probably hell yeah that sounds amazing now i'm super jealous anyway sounds like a lot of fun
yeah so that those are my that's my first uh section what who's up next uh jace would you like to go
uh when uh you go because i'm trying to remember the name of the game that i was going to recommend
okay well i don't i guess i guess we're all doing video games first so i'll go ahead and do mine
because i was going to do one video game and one other thing that's much shorter uh so my video
game because i am about a year behind on everything i've always been kind of a late adopter for stuff
is near automata uh which no that is not ps4 exclusive thank goodness i'm playing it on xbox
i'm not sure if it's available on other systems but it is uh it takes place in sort of a post
apocalyptic post apocalypse earth where humans have been evacuated to the moon there's only
a few thousand humans left they're on the moon you are an android who is tasked with helping
clear the earth from these alien invaders so humanity can come back again and the thing is
the alien invaders aren't like doom demons or anything they're like these cute little machine
things that just kind of wanted a place for their own and they aren't like normally you see alien
invaders they've destroyed everything they're like implementing their own industry and stuff
no these guys are just kind of hanging out and nature has come and reclaimed like a lot of the
earth when you run around down there humanity has been exiled for a while now you're in this major
city and there's trees growing all through like the streets and stuff the highways are collapsing
there's kudzu and all sorts of greenery growing out of these skyscrapers it is absolutely gorgeous
to look at it's a whole reclamation of human artifacts by nature that is just really fun to
run through uh the gameplay is fun as well um and it just god it's gorgeous uh speaking on the
purely hedonism aspect here i'm going to go out on a limb and uh i don't know be risqué or something
but this is basically an anime in video game form and so it's got like the cute anime girl you play
as one of two different characters depending on what section of the game you're in and while you're
playing the cute anime girl she has an amazing butt and the skirt that's just just always when you're
running kind of lifting up a little bit and you can almost quite see your panties and it's very
titillating and every now and then like if she slides down a ladder somewhere the flirt the skirt
flies up a little and you get a panty shot i don't know it's it's ridiculous i feel kind of embarrassing
it but oh my gosh it's it's it's eye candy um and then when you play the boy it's kind of sad because
he's also a school aged boy but he has like preteen body so there's no eye candy there for the ladies
or for the gay guys i was disappointed on that respect but
on inequality in eye candy is is lame there are some real opportunity objectification
yeah there are some incredibly hot guys in this game that are actually uh legit naked
although the gentilia is gone because they're not humans uh but they are villains that only
show up for a little bit you don't actually get to control them right uh but uh all that being
said like the gameplay is fun the story is this is one of these stories where like
you play through it first and then it resets and you play as the other character but everything
is subtly different and then after this replay it goes into a deeper like now these all these
repercussions of the things that you did happen and um it is a very much like the typical anime
storyline where people have existential crises about what is the meaning and purpose of being
we are just these androids designed to kill we've never even met our human makers what is the purpose
of life it's very much the sort of thing like when you're in college when you're a college sophomore
and you don't understand what you're doing with your life or how humanity works or why capitalism
and and you you have all these questions but no answers and your anime is what you go to because
anime is always the exact same thing there's like i have philosophical conundrums but i do not have
answers and i just wish to yell these questions at my audience and have them yell back with me it is
the same thing and going through that storyline again was it was really it was fun it was nice
to live in an anime for 32 hours and the ending is just the most wonderful meta wrap up that when i
got to it i was like this is i have to tell people about this this is a great game so that is my
pitch for a fun thing that i've been doing which i think a lot of people would enjoy cool what system
is that for uh i know it's for xbox um i don't know if it's for any others oh also the soundtrack
on this thing i know people is one of the main things people talk about when they talk about
this game and most games nowadays just have beautiful soundtracks because come on it's
the modern day uh they all should but the soundtrack on this one is extra awesome it's
haunting at times it's beautiful it is and it's always just perfect for the situation you're in
it is available on playstation 4 uh xbox and on steam so yeah it's available for everything
sweet if you've seen any cosplay of you know uh chick with a short white wig that has black over
a black um eye eye cloth covering her eyes so it looks like she can't see anything uh that they're
they're uh cosplaying one of the characters from the automata and you know she doesn't have to see
things because she's an android and has lasers and radar to see her world so it makes sense her
eyes are covered it's also a metaphorical thing later on but um yeah it's it's cool i've definitely
seen that character in porn and wondered what she was from excellent uh okay so i remembered the name
of the game i was going to recommend it's called what remains of edith finch i just couldn't remember
the person's name um that is an adventure game uh it centers on you're playing as edith uh
you're a member of this family called the finches that have been afflicted by a curse
that causes all of the family members except for one to die in really strange ways
and you're coming back to the family home which is this really uh whimsically designed pretty
goth looking mansion that just has all these additions and weird rooms then uh the the characters
grandmother i think uh before she died in a strange way uh boarded up all of the rooms and
walked off all of the family secrets so you come back as an adult and are finding your way into
these rooms that you in this house you grew up in but were never able to get into before
and when you uh get each of the rooms you switch to the perspective of the character who died
and you get to learn what happened to them and they um each of the
stories about the characters who died are done in kind of a different style
either like a different art style or like a kind of a different theme or mood
so that's really fun cool i've seen some gameplay of that one and it looks cool i've
also seen gameplay of near automata and it's also like that one's just like a fast paced kick
ass have you know have a great time sort of thing what remains of either finch is more of like a
yeah it's like a puzzle puzzle story yeah but i mean slow paced isn't bad paced it's just it
it tells it's more of like a let's walk through a story rather than like let's shoot some fucking
robots yeah um sounds like a badass mist thing all right so sounds like a badass mist sort of
thing uh yeah kind of um the one thing i'll say about it is that the puzzles aren't very hard um
the game's really well produced and i would describe it as more of an interactive movie
it's still really satisfying to play and some of the puzzles are pretty fun but
um it's definitely not like anything hardcore but not all games have to be um i really enjoy
the genre of having an interactive movie type experience and i remember there was this like
like god of war now i remember a few years ago that people were complaining about video games
coming out that were in this genre like they're like oh they're making video games for normies
and i was kind of like why can't we just have all the genres of games and enjoy them
i like hard games but uh i liked this one too because it had a really compelling story and it
was really spooky and yeah each shit on like gatekeeping video games that they have to be
hard to be accessible like i've also been playing a lot of animal crossing which is the easiest game
in the world um it's just and there's there's no stakes there's no dying there's no hit points
you just you're building a little little island and having little friends it's great
what's funny on a quick meta note i typed in i was gonna type in what uh what remains to eat the
finch to see what it what platforms it's on turns out it's on all of them but all i'd type in is the
word what and google filled out the rest for me which is kind of weird that's spooky okay um and i
kind of want to do what steven did and split this into because they're two video games and they're
kind of related the other one is another puzzle game called baba is you baba was a sheep i've heard
of that one too oh you played it i heard of it i've heard if i haven't played it yet so you
should definitely play it um it's a top down uh how would i even describe it like kind of a
retro styled top down game where you're just trying to get to a flag but
the the mechanic of the game is actual words like uh you have to spell baba is you
in order to control baba but if you take the word you and replace it with wall
then you turn into a wall or like if you do um like wall is defeat if you walk into the wall
then you die so uh that sounds amazing yeah there are words that you drag around and
it's these are like actually more thinky puzzles um the art style is adorable and the
stuff that happens is hilarious like just the the idea of this as a game mechanic is wonderful
that is cool it reminds me of the um the anglo physics the study of anglo physics story
kind of is like that on the in like adorable eight-bit sheep form it's got that big look
okay that's that sounds wild my together as a package my first recommendation
and we're back to student and that one's available for windows mac linux and the
nintendo switch which means i should probably look into it because i've been buying up games non-stop to
justify your switch no i i justified my switch when i bought my first game for it which is
breath of the wild that was worth five hundred dollars to play so oh my god switches five hundred
dollars it was i think 300 i got a memory card i got like a protective case i got uh breath of
the wild with it um and i think it came with minecraft i think my whole bundle is 500 bucks
damn i paid a hundred dollars for my ps4 yeah i got mine new though that's true like for a pretty
long time the only reason i would ever buy a new gaming console or devices when is all the game would
come out hmm yeah breath of the wild is amazing but it's not on my sales page today so you don't
even need to talk that one up that's just the best video game ever i can talk up horizon zero dawn
more with it though is that i think horizon zero dawn would have been game of the year 2017 if it
didn't if it didn't come out the same week as breath of the wild they're like very similar types of
game which is great if you like that type of game it's like there's two really amazing games in this
genre but unfortunately yeah people tended to well that one's a big name because yeah there's
all the series so they bought that one yeah the releasing at the same time is a bad idea
yeah and like i think it's all just just also like more widely appealing which just doesn't
make it bad it was it was a great game it was it was better in different areas worse in different
areas but it was uh like anyway horizon zero dawn i think would have been game of the year 2017 without
zelda uh stealing the spotlight so not stealing it deservedly snatching it because it was amazing so
all right steven i believe we are back to you okay well then this leaves us for like i guess tv and
and movies so i am struggling to think of like stuff that everyone already hasn't seen so i'll
just i'll name a tv series and i watched that it you know kind of started out in a whim and then
enjoyed both seasons and i think they're only like 10 episodes of season it's called uh i had it in my
head a second ago if i'll just describe it then if i remember the name it dropped me it's uh korean
zombie um like it's like futile area futile era korea and there's a zombie outbreak and it's it's
way more compelling than it sounds it's a lot of fun and it is called oh for pity's sake i just had
this um hey no that happens uh well i will have to google it because it's not coming to me so i
will leave that one on the wayside and instead pitch the others i think like rather than say here's
great things like that you should enjoy because i don't know whatever it takes a lot of time to
watch or something i'll just describe what i've been enjoying um bookland nine nine is partway
through season six right now and it's great if you haven't seen that show it's a lot more fun than it
sounds when i say it's a cop comedy show um it's it's really like uh it's not like low brow comedy
like um uh like rena 9-1-1 or something it's just it's a lot of strong characters uh good jokes um
running gags and that sort of stuff uh but i've mainly i was going to pitch better called sol
it which is almost done in season five and it's i think a good show to binge especially now because
you're trapped um watching it week to week over the last few years was kind of a drag because
especially in the first few seasons there's some where it's like some episodes where it's
it's almost not enough to keep you hooked unless you're already kind of invested um
but now that you can just move straight on to the next one it's great so i would recommend
better called sol and uh if anyone's not sure that's a prequel series to breaking bad which
you haven't seen that i would recommend that one first which is also available on netflix and uh i
mean there's probably no way anyone listening hasn't heard of that show so i'm not going to give it
a summary what about better call sol though you didn't really uh i i guess i'm just describing
like what i'm currently watching like it's so it follows uh sol goodman which is the lawyer that
they had in breaking bad and basically he's just this wonderful shyster um he will manipulate the
law uh fake evidence and do whatever he can for his for his clients whoever they may be
and in the case of breaking bad it was mainly the protagonist and his friend um and so that's
how like he fell into the series and this is a prequel show some years it's not sure like before
he'd met uh like waltz and jessey from breaking bad so it's more just like an origin story for
that character and it's really good um i don't really know how to sell it other than like if
you liked breaking bad you'll like this it's got a lot less of the um i don't know uh like waltz
saying you know say my name or i'm the one who knocks it's got like fewer with those bad ass moments
but that's not what it's going for it's going for the moments where you're like oh that's the
sol that i recognize because he doesn't start that way uh like the seeds are there just like
they are with waltz and breaking bad because it's a well thought out story but you you see his descent
into who he becomes later and it's great so cool yeah all right uh thank you is it on to me
okay and i have heard good things about better call salt to brooklyn on nine real quick i'd love
everything about it except that it's a cop show i wish it was about anything other than cops but
yeah the characters are great the jokes are great i i still enjoy it anyway
yeah i think if you don't i knew it i knew it was a six letter um or a uh two syllable uh k
k word the zombie korean show that i was thinking of is called kingdom i was thinking like killers
or something like that and it wasn't it it's called kingdom it's on netflix and it was a lot of fun
is it subtitled or dub yes i think they do dubs i did it in subtitles which is also great if you're
like trying to like really not focus on being stuck at home because you have to read and watch at the
same time um so it's not a movie then it's a series it's a tv series yeah okay and is it done or is
it still going i don't know um it ended on a nice uh well i won't say how it ended um it i guess the
fact that i said i don't know means that it could go both ways but it's uh like what makes it fun is
that the zombies are like a background element and well i mean they're not their foreground element
but it's not like uh the walking dead and all the other things that came out 10 years ago it's
it's also the time frame that sets it like to be a lot of fun because you can't radio ahead to the
next city and say oh my god you guys they're zombies um zombies can't take you know they're not uh
being transported while in dormant period across planes and getting all over the world
they're basically just running up the country and there's people trying to get ahead of them and so
then you know they get to a new new town they see this ravaging horde behind them and they try and
cut them down like they do everyone else and it doesn't work you've got to decapitate them or
stab them through the head but again since you can't like call the town that you're heading to
give them that notification it's kind of just a fun thing of like how this this uh apocalypse is
spreading so nice it's it's a lot more fun than you think for your standard zombie show
third zombie show or second zombie show that is way better than it sounds so i'm going over budget
is santa clarita diet which i've pitched before it is it is amazing it's it is the same kind of
humor as like community and uh better off ted um just a ton of really high quality jokes delivered
like two a minute uh like like two jokes a minute on average probably that show is
fucking hilarious and it is uh without going on and on about it i will just pitch that one
i'd pitch that over kingdom but kingdom was like just a new thing i was watching so cool
all righty uh my second thing is we've all been pitching a bunch of long form stuff video games
that take you know tens of hours entire series so my next one is going to be something really
short that you can consume in its entirety in under 45 minutes it is uh the album when we all
fall asleep where do we go by billy eilish and i realized this thing has been out for about a year
but i am again a late adopter also i was like oh look pop music i don't care i don't listen to the
pop music really i don't listen to the radio but at some point i stumbled across uh bad guy
i was like oh this is a really neat song and then um girlfriend reviews put out a bass guy
or bass guy rather uh which i was like oh that's hilarious and that's that one song oh i want to
look up that one song now and they put you know parody of bad guy so i looked up bad guy and i
thought you know what i have never in my life really liked a song and really liked an artist
and then listened to an entire album by them and the song that i liked most was the song that gets
the radio play there's always been some other song on the album which was my favorite which is
never played on the radio no one else ever hears it so i try to listen to entire albums whenever i
can so i looked at this album when we all fall asleep where do we go listen to it from start to
oh my god so it starts out with bad guy which is it's a bravado song right and say like hey
i'm a badass look at what a badass i am kind of song and i'm glad you explained it because
i've heard the song and i have no idea what she's talking about so yeah and i i have a lot of fun
with those kinds of songs like one of the reasons i loved it was because you know that kind of bravado
like yeah i'll seduce your dad you know kind of thing um but uh that's actually one of the lines
in the song isn't she's 17 uh sure i don't know great it's a bravado song man it doesn't matter
do you think those rappers really all have huge dicks and ten million dollars no it's wait they
don't oh god my worldview i mean maybe some of them do and i'm sure they're all hoping to get
but anyways that's not the point the point is it's an amazing beat and it's a lot of fun and so i
keep listening and it goes into like sort of this depression spiral and it seems to be it's a concept
album it seems to be like after that she's sort of going into like these are the after effects of
how i was acting before and as you get deeper and deeper into the album you realize first of all
the entire concept of an album is someone putting into uh music what it feels like to be
desperately lonely all the time which was my high school experience as well and as you keep getting
into the second half of the album you realize that not only is desperate loneliness but this is an
album about someone who is just so in love with someone and that person does not love them back
and it's not that that person hates them or anything but the love is not returned and she
can't get over it and she's trying to get over it and she doesn't know how and there is pain
and the whole album is just this beautiful exploration of that and then at the very end
the last song is sort of like a quick going back up through the um the whole album but in reverse
and then you realize at the end that like i'm the bad guy wasn't just a position of posturing
in bravado it was like her way of psychologically explaining why doesn't this person love me back
and it was the internalization of i must be a bad person which is why they don't love me
which you can't get to unless you've heard the whole album first like the way it was intended
to be listened to consecutively and then you get that reverse wrap-up at the end it was it was
beautiful and i loved it and also like her voice is amazing and the music is just really good so
if you want an entire experience in under 45 minutes i recommend when we all fall asleep where
do we go i want to ping pong on that because first off that is the strongest sales pitch
i've ever heard for any album ever okay i i still feel like i'm missing out on a lot for not being
able to really comprehend music so i will definitely give it a shot the only album by like an artist
that i've uh that i don't know has uh record like whatever awards that i've heard all the way through
is um kesha's new album or her second newest album uh i think it was rainbow maybe we've
been the album yeah and that was a lot of fun that had like its kind of own back story thing to it
too but to stay on billy eilish um if you're unfamiliar with her somehow um my first exposure
to her was on snl she was the musical guest and if you want to just check out the kind of the kind
of like badass chick she is check out just youtube snl uh billy eilish and watch her music video her
music performance on there and it's done some amazing visual effects that uh were a lot of
fun i i'm stammering for words because i don't want to describe them just you'll watch it and be like
whoa and i think it'll be a good time so she was also like one of those ones that was like
a youtube star first and then picked up by some creep who trolls youtube for you know
attractive sounding kids or something but um it's uh that was that was i think her her start
but she seems chill um i don't know much about her and i've never heard another one of her songs
so i will check out that album for sure excellent and i haven't i i have been deliberately pitching
long stuff because we're all stuck in for more than 45 minutes but yeah um hey you know music
hasn't made the list yet and that sounds fucking dope i appreciate the the diversity of uh of thinking
here it sounds really i mean it sold me on it and uh i'm a hard sell so cool sweet i hope people
enjoy this uh my thing is i forget if we had made rules about them like just being media or
whatever but uh so there is a media attached to it but um i actually came up with more ideas of what
things have i been like what activities have i been doing um i was wanting to do a mini section on
that at the end anyway so i feel like this would be perfect well i have a bunch to add to that but uh
the one that i want to do like a longer dive on is the polyphasic sleep youtube channel
uh one of the things that i have been experimenting with since i'm working from home now is
i'm trying a polyphasic sleep schedule i'm doing a every man where there is a 3.5 hour core sleep
and then uh three 20 minute naps dispersed throughout the day and it cuts well if you're
not familiar with polyphasic sleep it is designed to try to optimize sleep for less time sleeping
and then like better quality sleep this uh youtube series talks about it started out talking about um
whether polyphasic sleep is safe because there's a lot of debate about whether you can reliably
do it long term and not mess up your health and sanity i have heard that is a huge issue it's
definitely i mean sleep is very important uh it's literally like it's how you heal and it's how you
encode memories uh into your long term memory at the end of the day and don't get it for long
enough you die yeah well yeah uh but also like more short term you can just start getting sick
you can gain weight you can become depressed uh you can more easily get stressed out or irritable
like it's uh it kind of affects everything so a bunch of caveats about like make sure you do a
lot of research if you want to try experimenting with polyphasic sleep but i decided to try it
because first of all it's something everyone wanted to do forever but it just never really
fit with my schedule since i attended to work well i've always worked in offices and like it's
pretty irritating actually that offices don't have a like mandatory nap break at least once per
day there's so much there's so much data showing that we're first of all like
ancestrally we were kind of designed to sleep uh in the middle of the day like around
two or three p.m. it's like you're circadian uh you could watch people circadian rhythm and
like their alertness and everything dip right around that time just like
uh across humans uh so this this i well i wanted to let you finish your sales pitch
on this first but i just have to ask like how do you take a 20 minute nap because i i have found
that if i like alright i'm tired i'm gonna try and zonk out for a minute i never fall asleep
within 20 minutes i fall asleep within five minutes when i go to bed at night because i'm
always exhausted but like if i could try and schedule a nap it never works yeah so that's
there's a lot of reasons why polyphasic sleep isn't for everyone one of them is just that
genetically some people are more efficient sleepers than others um but i actually could never nap
like throughout my life uh if i tried to i until you started sleeping 3.5 hours a night
well um i started actually like learning how to nap it's actually a skill you can train
which oh god you think you think becoming unconscious would be something that'd be
really good at just doing for fuck's sake brains why can't you just be good at the things that
we should all be able to do automatically sorry go ahead i'll stop interrupting
now i was complaining about you know like certain brain states here and sometimes
where you're just like having a ton of ideas and you're just like if i could just take a
snapshot of this brain state and then like load it when i need it same thing with like
calm relaxed brain state or happy brain state or i don't know anyway um yeah transhuman future
needs to get here faster uh so the person who runs the youtube channel is crimson flower uh
and he also has a discord channel that a lot of rationalists are on i don't know if uh
this person is in the community or not uh i was under the impression he was or was adjacent
but the videos detail first of all like we're talking about falsifiability um a lot of the videos
are okay so if you're going to argue that polyphasic sleep is dangerous then you would have to prove
that this is true so like a bunch of the early videos and i really appreciated this were actually
like here's how you could falsify this claim if you wanted to uh and that was in response to
a bunch of people just like constantly non-stop hearing that somebody's doing polyphasic sleep
and being like oh my god did you hear about all the scientific studies that say you need eight
hours a night which yes there are many of and yes sleep is important but uh people don't tend to
have any evidence for why they think this wouldn't work so he's actually generously being like if
you could show that uh for example there are periods of sleep that aren't one of the main
categories of like deep sleep ram sleep the other ones that i'm blanking on there's just these kind
of like dead periods where you're kind of just unconscious um they don't seem to serve any
purpose and a lot of what polyphasic sleep cycles try to do is cut those out and just get the parts
of sleep that are doing something restorative some people think that it's kind of like a chest
rich and spence thing like we don't know what these are doing so cut them out at your own peril and
i i i usually go back to the default that i've seen people try to do it before and every time
i've seen someone try to do it it's always ended in disaster uh so i don't know it just
it seems that this is sort of hard limitation with the current biological bodies we got but
if you managed to make it work i would be very interested in hearing that yeah i'm on like day
two so i'll let you know how it goes um usually with the every man's like oh there's a period of
it feeling really really great for like a week it feeling pretty shitty for the next week and then
it's slowly starting to feel great again so i'm expecting that um uh yeah i will link to both the
youtube and the discord all righty yeah that certainly sounds interesting i'm glad you guys
are outside the box on like i was like a like tv and video games so perfect i was struggling to
come up with like what fun things am i doing because most of what i have been doing is work and then
like projects but i'm like how people having fun i built i'm building two bikes
two bikes well i am building i'm repairing a motorcycle and i put together a uh
fixie bike that i got on amazon which is a okay okay fixed gear bike cool well uh do we want to do
a couple listener feedbacks before we wrap up uh i think so yeah sure cool uh this one is uh
addressed to me and this was back when i mentioned that polak is the polish word for a polish person
and i don't see why we can't reclaim that uh here's why bar tech says uh in ash said he wants to
reclaim polak is the normal meaning polish person as i'm polish myself i want to tell you please don't
firstly it's been used negatively even in the 2000s and still sometimes may be used this way
in the uk since there was a lot of polish immigration there more important even discarding
prior negative usage it sounds cringy as fuck do you ever say i was in spain and i parted with
the espanolese the speaker would sound like a weirdo trying to signal knowing the language
while clearly not knowing the language pola is fine lots of words are weird and can mean multiple
things and i guess okay if there's an actual person like i mean i'm of polish ancestry but i
don't have any really exposure to any of that and if real people from poland are like don't do this
it's stupid then all right i didn't know it was still being used negatively and all that too
it was easy enough to discourage your parents because they're old buddy buddies but exactly
yeah if it's topical then yeah i don't know isn't that what climbing is about though like
it's literally taking something that has a has been used as a slur has negative connotations and
like the word bitch is something that you can now say like wow is like you're a badass bitch or
whatever yeah it's still used pejoratively as well but it used to be literally apparently uh
i don't have like really solid sources for this but apparently it was considered a much worse word
than whore and i think victorian air like it's the worst thing i remember bitch was considered
i remember bitch was considered really bad even when i was a kid it was like the b word and you
did not say that ever i feel like now it's like kind of on the level of crap where it's only barely
a curse word yeah maybe it's not quite as bad we've had to move on to other more bad words
because it's been yeah reclaimed so much so yeah i don't know and i have that a queer used to be
entirely just negative and now it just means you know queer that one has been used as a pejorative
but then there's also a bunch of people that are but there's a really complicated thing around that
that i could explain if you care but it's okay really quick um it's your trans exclusive radical
feminists i believe are theorized to be the people spreading this misinformation because
there's people who are gay or lesbian uh who don't like the word queer because it's an umbrella term
and it can be used to include people that don't fall into the categories that they think are the real
uh people that belong in the lgbtq fold or whatever so people were spreading misinformation
about queer queer is like this horrible insult and it triggers me when i hear it uh and how people
are using it like actually like if you go back in early like literally it's called queer theory
and it's been called queer theory for a long time and it is yeah actually i mean queer hasn't been a
bad word since like what the fifties it's like is still used pejoratively but like it also was
used as like a descriptor uh a self descriptor or as like a you know something positive so
i've heard it used pretty much only as a as a positive thing like yeah i'm queer i'm here
and i'm queer and i'm proud i'm like particularly pro that word existing because somebody who
doesn't know how they identify yet or who identifies as something but is closeted because
like their family would disown them if they came out or it would be like socially disadvantaged
can use it to still signal that they belong to this community without necessarily like
having themselves that way or nailing down their identity that was longer than i wanted to make that
somebody else talk about something uh we have another piece of feedback from William Eden
William Eden is one of our generous supporters and says the reason i wanted to support you guys
is that the general error around rationality is something like criticism and attack which
i didn't realize it is but okay maybe it is some in some places okay i have a story and
okay and i love the podcast for the moment i first listened because you seem to genuinely
and enthusiastically like rationality it's kind of sad and crazy that that's a
distinguished characteristic but there it is i both wanted to support the creation of a
community public good and specifically support your positive and inspiring message to the community
so i'm very happy about that i think that even though i i've struggled with depression most
of my life it is um i have a lot of fun doing this and i just feel better when i am like excited
and positive about things so that's basically the energy i always try to um put forward whenever i
am in a public place and it makes me happier to do that so i guess this is just sort of a a side
effect of who i am and who i choose to be around but uh if he likes that that is great i'm very
happy about that and i am surprised that there's this thing about criticism and attack rather
than enthusiasm and you said you have some more information about that yeah or i was going to
say i have an anecdote um although i want to start by saying thank you for supporting us
William Eaton and also that was a really great message um yeah it was it made me feel really
good i yeah i want a third that and then sorry go ahead jace that's okay um yeah i remember
actually reading this feedback when i was going through uh like mini depressive episode thing
and that making me feel good and any to what you were saying uh one of i think this is science-based
and then like i'm kind of laughing because we're talking about people calling things science-based
earlier um but one of the efficacious uh ways of mitigating depression is by doing things that make
other people happy like helping others helps you more than doing things that are night good for
yourself i guess yeah wow that was awkwardly phrased it's the following basic sleep i'm not i'm not
adjusted yet i hear it just keeps getting worse but no that that is a thing that i have heard
okay but i have heard constantly that uh getting that making other people's lives better is the
best way to be happy yeah and i found this to be the case like moving to moving from a like
money oriented career to values oriented careers like really impacted my sense of having
worth and having a reason to get up in the morning and yeah um anyway the little anecdote that i had
was that um and some of them are probably listening to it now there's a discord group that uh is made
up of a bunch of Denver locals who did meet up things in person before COVID and now they're
doing a bunch of web-based meet-up things it's actually um really cool they have like
a bunch of different channels for learning new skills or teaching other people new skills like
and stuff like that sharing media whatever advice but um so phoenix and i are both on there and i
think phoenix posted something uh scott alexander's in response to somebody asking a question about
oh it was irbs somebody had uh mentioned an irb and phoenix is like oh you should read this and
posted the my irb nightmare and a bunch of people jumped on it they're like scott alexander isn't
he that neo nazi guy oh my god oh man i heard that he believes these things and that whole
community is full of people that are just like sheltering nazis and i forget what other things
they were accusing the community of and then of course like when phoenix and i were like actually
i've had really great experiences with this community and i think that's a mischaracterization
they like went on well we thought at first it was rational wiki because like we know that
that's kind of a garbage pile but sorry if you contribute to rational wiki and he listeners but
i'm not it sucks yeah it does but even the like real wikipedia article somebody should really edit
it because it kind of is a biography of elia zeukowski and then it talks about roko's basilisk
and then it like mentions that rationality was the birthplace of the neo reaction movement and that's
like the bulk of the information holy shit it does like to be fair also mentioned after the
neo reaction thing oh yeah and defective altruism oh my god so the people that know that the
rationality community exist seem to have this idea that it's a bunch of self-aggrandizing tech
pros you think they're smarter than everybody else and or racist and whatever else whatever other
things bad people do well uh i and that made me sad i guess i don't i suppose i technically should
be sad i just have a really hard time caring i'm like my community is great and you guys can go
be miserable in your community of haters if you want a very good community it's just that there's
like misinformation uh out there and it makes me sad because
people misinformation had to come from like some bitter people though right i think it's just
political um i remember a lot of instances of people coming across less wrong finding something
that looked like it belongs to the opposite political party and then immediately like casting
a distrustful eye on it and trying to pick every like look up you know like what's the
list of all the bad things that people in this community have done aha i knew it they're bad
yeah i i do i do particularly love that scott alexander every now and then does get in calling
all seriousness a neo nazi and we're like you know he lost relatives in the holocaust like this is
this is not okay sure whatever you say he is he's the most nazi of all the neo nazis still
reminds me of like the kind of witch hunting that went on a tumblr where one of my favorite
artists and writers actually like changed careers and left tumblr because they got branded uh
transphobic uh like nazi supporting oh it was the other thing i don't know anyway they're trans
gender and they're oh my god dude remember when lacy green was like you know became the the
all trans tumblr people hate her for some reason this is partly i think why it's hard for me to
ever try the show steven universe because this might be related one of these two people that you're
talking about might be the person who like did some fan art and the the character they drew wasn't
fat enough or something and they got like docs they got like death threats and you should kill
yourselves out the wazoo and it's like sorry i am new to drawing like but that's that's a toxic
community you can't blame steven universe for that it's a good show yeah that's another thing
that no no for sure but oh i know it's just it's i think it's kind of like what people see when they
you know come across the wikipedia page of rationality and they're like oh that's not for me
so i'll see like the the fandom for a show and like oh this thing looks like it's terrible um if
this is the kind of people that like it right yeah don't get me wrong i'm sure i'm here it's great
yeah i see what you're saying it is really good i also love it yeah uh if you're into the like
very positive that's yeah that's one of the things i love about it it's just relentlessly
positive and optimistic and i would i would watch it to feel better about the world
yeah it's pretty great yeah don't get me wrong i need to give it a shot it's just like i said it's
it just it the uh the exposure i had to at first was through that and i'm like oh okay so it's this
show that a bunch of fucking lunatics like because look at what they did to this poor person for not
being a good enough artist yeah but you watch rick and morty too and rick and morty is also loved by
a bunch of fucking lunatics absolutely so don't get me wrong it but because the the causal order
happened the other way with rick and morty for me okay i was able to be like oh this show is hilarious
and then you go online and be like oh wow a bunch of lunatics like this show but they're all idiots
i know that it's fine and fine i can appreciate it for the right reasons the reason i keep saying
that this is sad is that like uh to use steven universe as an example like there was a good friend
of mine uh that i ran into at an anime convention and we're both cosplaying and i was cosplaying a
steven universe character and they were like oh uh that's a great cosplay but i refuse to watch that
show because i don't want to be associated with those people and i was like but it's a good show
and you're missing out by not seeing it in fact you particularly i think would like this for
particular reasons that like i don't know uh so i was just thinking about man the fact
that this person cares first of all about the signaling thing like i think that that's something
that people worry about that if i get into this rationality community i'll be associated with
these bad people even if the ideas are good which uh and yeah like these are this is a really great uh
uh discord group and these people are really intelligent uh and they would i think get a lot
of value out of actually reading sequences or reading slate sarcotics but they probably won't
because they you know what's rationality well it's uh where the you know where they shelter
nazis and make up thought experiments about basilisks and it's where tech bros go to be
all bro like yeah we're such a bro community if i were to find one one word to describe it that'd
be it we're always going to the gym and getting swole it is uh somewhat white male dominated
i think that also turns people off there's not much you can do about that though other than like
just trying to be accessible which i think it is right like if it just happens to be where
15 years ago there are more white dudes reading crap online than there were uh
i don't know other groups of people which may or may not be the case like i remember that was a
problem with the skeptic i mean the internet used to be largely white dudes that's my point so like
if if something started on the internet it might just be like sort of just the the way it's going
to land until things get going um it's like i think unless your group has like a specific
message that says no we want to stay all white dudes then i i don't really know what how to address
that problem right that is a hard problem i also think it's somewhat interesting that you know the
fact that white men like something automatically means it's probably bad yeah i mean i think that's
another thing that people see and you know they back away from the community a bit i mean any
asher also somebody who will occasionally rail on how white men are terrible and ruin everything
well i think it's more about how i have um very complicated issues with men but it's not white
men for me it's just all men hashtag not all men uh the hashtag yes all men god damn it
but no not really that it's like i said it's a it's a complicated thing which
maybe some other day we can not get into honestly like when Steven's like yeah but how do you get like
minorities into your group i was like well we could just like
drive around in bands and just start abducting people off the street and this is what gives
rationalism a bad name i mean at least there's some outside the box thinking for me other than
saying like we have a you know than having an open an open uh door policy we have cookies i
yeah like i i realized that there are more specific like concentrated outreach things
that people can do like if we had national meetups who could give uh you know if you checked enough
boxes that weren't white men you could come in for free or something would pay for your flight or
whatever but that that's makes it like tokenism i don't know exactly right so that's either you're
being i'm throwing my hands up but people can't see it yeah like i i don't know how to solve that
problem i'm there's probably like i said i think outreach is something that people are knowledgeable
about that aren't me but i don't really know how to solve that problem you didn't want this to be a
problem you shouldn't have been so white and so male steven yeah well you know when i was when
i was building my character sheet i i picked the uh uh the stats that i can't finish the joke
yeah uh yeah i think we've gotten pretty far afield and we should probably wrap it up yeah
we're we still gonna talk about activities or do you want to save that for another time
at this point we should probably hold on to that for some other time okay
okay works for me yeah yeah that works i guess in a sentence i can just say make sure you get up
from your desk and move around once in a while it's good for you yeah yeah i at least you know all
my stuff's downstairs like food wise so if i have to get up and do something at least i have to you
know go up and downstairs which is nice way to stay mo you know in motion yeah third i had on
killer back pain the lower like lumbar spine back pain and hip flexor things for
like a month and a half and since working from home uh since i am not sitting in an office chair
for eight hours staring at a computer screen i mean i'm still sitting and staring at a computer
screen because i'm working but i can sit cross legged on the floor uh or i can like sit on my
wobble cushion that's another recommendation i'm gonna stick that in the recommendations
pile get a wobble cushion it's like you know there's ballchairs so you can sit on it's like
that except it's in cushion form so you can put it on your chair and you still can
like strengthen your lower back with it and fidget by moving around and it's good
good life hack cool uh yeah i'll take another that says i could use something like that just
being able to get up and play a round of beat saver in between answering a bunch of queries or
like go walk in the kitchen and like pre-make a few meals for the next day or just like get
up stretch change positions uh my back pain is like virtually gone like very quickly and the
thing is i was trying everything like i bought all these like fancy chair insert things and
i was getting i was paying for massages i was doing like back stretches i got like
pain salves and patches and just not sitting in an office chair was the solution of course
and i'm kind of torn about not like wanting to go back to work in the office because
of the back pain but also dude the pain is a serious issue the isolation
and for most jobs if you're having uh comfort issues that are impacting your work you can get
the office to accommodate that and you know like there's no reason you couldn't buy one of those
those butt cushions for your own chair but there's also a great reason that you can get your
office to pay for it i have um kind of been i've had on my task list for many months now make a
standing desk and i've made like incremental progress towards that i got monitorizers that
should work and then i was kind of like at the step of okay i should research what shoes i should
wear and stuff and then i just like didn't because other stuff kept taking priority i made my own
standing desk like real cheap there was a uh god i don't know like maybe 40 and works pretty nice
yeah no i think it's not fancy but put my stuff on monitorizers and then i just have to
i just have to do it and now i have more motivation if we ever end up like
unquarantining to actually do that yeah sorry for that tangent no that's good i think that's
that's all good advice i'm sure there's all kinds of guys and stuff where people can best
you know set up a home office to be comfortable and stuff but um yeah other than that i hope that
this was a nice bit of positivity that wasn't uh totally dwelling on how shitty everything is right
now so and give give people some ideas of things to do to fill some time so if you guys have any
ideas you want to share them you can join you can join the community at the beige and conspiracy
discord and by all means throw them in the episode chat for this episode or wherever it feels appropriate
and uh i mean there's even a channel on there for covid 19 panic maybe we can make another one for
covid 19 like chill and we'll have all the we'll have all the fun shit that people are doing
that actually sounds like a great idea that should happen that will happen that'll be done soon so
well we have a chill corner we do that's that's true yeah all right we could just rename it we
don't need another one until covid is over so it's gone for any case yeah if you're
get bored at home too there's also a discord to chat with us and other people on and uh
other than that oh i guess do we want to thank a patron we should and i guess since we already
mentioned him do we want to thank uh william eden i think that sounds appropriate okay well
william eden thank you not only did you make us feel better and happier as as people for for
saying that we help you out like that you also help us financially which is the thing that just
keeps happening every time we put out an episode and actually the last time we had uh because we
i i pay us all basically every six months last time it was a decent amount it was like previously
had been enough you know to buy a dinner or two but uh it's like a side you got to the point where
it was like yeah yeah it was like nothing to live off of but i yeah i saw the checkouts like hey
and this ain't bad so that was better than a bill it's it's awesome it was a nice thing and
we appreciate the nice things that you guys can do for us uh in this case specifically william eden
and and on that note not to totally contradict that but if you're in the position at all where
like you're one of the many millions people who don't have jobs right now and you're trying to cut
corners uh by all by all means let this be a corner you cut we'd love for you to for you to come back
if when you know employment resumes and stuff but don't be sitting there thinking oh man how am i
gonna pay my patreon dues to the base of conspiracy um if your if your budget is tight uh i am
making this declaration without consulting my co-host because i feel that strongly about it
how dare you steven no i totally don't get don't let yourself get fucked over by uh you know trying
to throw us money so um if like i said if it's an amount of money that you're noticing missing
especially in these trying times please don't worry about it we will understand so and if you
still want to give back but don't have the money you could just participate in the discord or subreddit
or you could tell a friend uh give a great review at itans or stitcher one of those places
aren't well thank you everybody and we'll see you in two weeks yep wash your hands y'all take care
you
