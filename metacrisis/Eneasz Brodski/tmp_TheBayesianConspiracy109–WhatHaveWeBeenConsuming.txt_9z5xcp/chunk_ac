right great new kinds of enemies oh shit i got my ass kicked okay well i start back at the the bench
instead of the bonfire and i fight my way back there and it's a lot of fun and it's cutesy i found a
berserk reference um and it's it's gritty at the same time it's a lot of fun so if you do play that
and enjoy it uh which it's also not just on the switch uh which is why it's a good pick it's for
a lot of platforms um you can check it out on uh doof media's game club podcast as well so
they are also doing streams of it ellie it is on doof media their twitch account so let's see
next video game is going to be this one was a tough one and i had to decide between two but
this one's way more rationally rationality adjacent and it's uh horizon zero dawn for play
station four unfortunately it's a ps4 exclusive um and i can make it my pitch for it really quick
it's uh pretty it's got good soundtrack it's got great voice acting um but basically the cover art
is a girl garbed in like animal furs shooting what seems to be like a kind of robotic bow and arrow
at a robot t-rex and the game extremely well satisfyingly answers the question what the
fuck is going on in this picture how could this ever happen and if you're curious it is such a
good game the reveal is is slow and uh that there's i it's awesome so i really really love the story
and it's one that i have no idea how long hollow net will take me to beat but uh if you want to
crawl through horizon zero dawn it's like 40 50 60 hours for the game so and you can stretch
that out much longer if you're like me and you like to just kind of wander around and i do have a
ps4 now so i should pick that up i've heard that it is like i haven't played that no no well i only
got a ps4 pretty recently i heard that it's just a really like enjoyable game to play like uh the
mechanics are just really satisfying once you get used to them but the story is great like yeah i
heard that it's like as rational as appropriate as like soma was you've probably heard that from me
and it is and i will i will bring it i'll bring it to you and i can leave it in a bag by your door
without touching you and hand you the game i'll also lend you the other game i have god of war
which i wasn't going to make a sales pitch for but which is awesome and everyone should play
also ps4 inclusive um yes jace what's up you have oh thank you for remembering you also have um
psvr right i do that's the reason i bought it you can wait horizon zero dawn was no no no the the
vr is the reason that i bought the PlayStation 4 so i could play beat saber yes um you can also
play horizon zero dawn on vr oh and like get it in 3d vrness you get it in 3d well it you get it
i don't know if it's not like made for vr but it just gives you but i would get full three-dimensional
that okay see that sounds badass i'm so into that you don't get what am i trying to say it's
kind of like you're in vr space and you your tv screen is just like very large it's so it's much
more immersive but like oh okay yeah so it's not like it doesn't like split into two different
screens for my two eyes so it doesn't look like real 3d no oh i'm not so okay also i feel like
playing this on a like a trying to do it like on a 3d emulator sort of thing where like like they
did at the skyrim i feel like that would completely ruin the play of this game yeah uh it's it's it's
not designed to be viewed that way like skyrim was grainy and and flat enough to where that already
worked this absolutely isn't i don't think but it would be a fun experiment if you can play it
with the headset on that sounds like fun so yeah phoenix explains that uh sorry uh horizon zero dawn
and god of war i could probably make it easier to play while like laying down yeah necessary
yeah probably hell yeah that sounds amazing now i'm super jealous anyway sounds like a lot of fun
yeah so that those are my that's my first uh section what who's up next uh jace would you like to go
uh when uh you go because i'm trying to remember the name of the game that i was going to recommend
okay well i don't i guess i guess we're all doing video games first so i'll go ahead and do mine
because i was going to do one video game and one other thing that's much shorter uh so my video
game because i am about a year behind on everything i've always been kind of a late adopter for stuff
is near automata uh which no that is not ps4 exclusive thank goodness i'm playing it on xbox
i'm not sure if it's available on other systems but it is uh it takes place in sort of a post
apocalyptic post apocalypse earth where humans have been evacuated to the moon there's only
a few thousand humans left they're on the moon you are an android who is tasked with helping
clear the earth from these alien invaders so humanity can come back again and the thing is
the alien invaders aren't like doom demons or anything they're like these cute little machine
things that just kind of wanted a place for their own and they aren't like normally you see alien
invaders they've destroyed everything they're like implementing their own industry and stuff
no these guys are just kind of hanging out and nature has come and reclaimed like a lot of the
earth when you run around down there humanity has been exiled for a while now you're in this major
city and there's trees growing all through like the streets and stuff the highways are collapsing
there's kudzu and all sorts of greenery growing out of these skyscrapers it is absolutely gorgeous
to look at it's a whole reclamation of human artifacts by nature that is just really fun to
run through uh the gameplay is fun as well um and it just god it's gorgeous uh speaking on the
purely hedonism aspect here i'm going to go out on a limb and uh i don't know be risqu√© or something
but this is basically an anime in video game form and so it's got like the cute anime girl you play
as one of two different characters depending on what section of the game you're in and while you're
playing the cute anime girl she has an amazing butt and the skirt that's just just always when you're
running kind of lifting up a little bit and you can almost quite see your panties and it's very
titillating and every now and then like if she slides down a ladder somewhere the flirt the skirt
flies up a little and you get a panty shot i don't know it's it's ridiculous i feel kind of embarrassing
it but oh my gosh it's it's it's eye candy um and then when you play the boy it's kind of sad because
he's also a school aged boy but he has like preteen body so there's no eye candy there for the ladies
or for the gay guys i was disappointed on that respect but
on inequality in eye candy is is lame there are some real opportunity objectification
yeah there are some incredibly hot guys in this game that are actually uh legit naked
although the gentilia is gone because they're not humans uh but they are villains that only
show up for a little bit you don't actually get to control them right uh but uh all that being
said like the gameplay is fun the story is this is one of these stories where like
you play through it first and then it resets and you play as the other character but everything
is subtly different and then after this replay it goes into a deeper like now these all these
repercussions of the things that you did happen and um it is a very much like the typical anime
storyline where people have existential crises about what is the meaning and purpose of being
we are just these androids designed to kill we've never even met our human makers what is the purpose
of life it's very much the sort of thing like when you're in college when you're a college sophomore
and you don't understand what you're doing with your life or how humanity works or why capitalism
and and you you have all these questions but no answers and your anime is what you go to because
anime is always the exact same thing there's like i have philosophical conundrums but i do not have
answers and i just wish to yell these questions at my audience and have them yell back with me it is
the same thing and going through that storyline again was it was really it was fun it was nice
to live in an anime for 32 hours and the ending is just the most wonderful meta wrap up that when i
got to it i was like this is i have to tell people about this this is a great game so that is my
pitch for a fun thing that i've been doing which i think a lot of people would enjoy cool what system
is that for uh i know it's for xbox um i don't know if it's for any others oh also the soundtrack
on this thing i know people is one of the main things people talk about when they talk about
this game and most games nowadays just have beautiful soundtracks because come on it's
the modern day uh they all should but the soundtrack on this one is extra awesome it's
haunting at times it's beautiful it is and it's always just perfect for the situation you're in
it is available on playstation 4 uh xbox and on steam so yeah it's available for everything
sweet if you've seen any cosplay of you know uh chick with a short white wig that has black over
a black um eye eye cloth covering her eyes so it looks like she can't see anything uh that they're
they're uh cosplaying one of the characters from the automata and you know she doesn't have to see
things because she's an android and has lasers and radar to see her world so it makes sense her
eyes are covered it's also a metaphorical thing later on but um yeah it's it's cool i've definitely
seen that character in porn and wondered what she was from excellent uh okay so i remembered the name
of the game i was going to recommend it's called what remains of edith finch i just couldn't remember
the person's name um that is an adventure game uh it centers on you're playing as edith uh
you're a member of this family called the finches that have been afflicted by a curse
that causes all of the family members except for one to die in really strange ways
and you're coming back to the family home which is this really uh whimsically designed pretty
goth looking mansion that just has all these additions and weird rooms then uh the the characters
grandmother i think uh before she died in a strange way uh boarded up all of the rooms and
walked off all of the family secrets so you come back as an adult and are finding your way into
these rooms that you in this house you grew up in but were never able to get into before
and when you uh get each of the rooms you switch to the perspective of the character who died
and you get to learn what happened to them and they um each of the
stories about the characters who died are done in kind of a different style
either like a different art style or like a kind of a different theme or mood
so that's really fun cool i've seen some gameplay of that one and it looks cool i've
also seen gameplay of near automata and it's also like that one's just like a fast paced kick
ass have you know have a great time sort of thing what remains of either finch is more of like a
yeah it's like a puzzle puzzle story yeah but i mean slow paced isn't bad paced it's just it
it tells it's more of like a let's walk through a story rather than like let's shoot some fucking
robots yeah um sounds like a badass mist thing all right so sounds like a badass mist sort of
thing uh yeah kind of um the one thing i'll say about it is that the puzzles aren't very hard um
the game's really well produced and i would describe it as more of an interactive movie
it's still really satisfying to play and some of the puzzles are pretty fun but
um it's definitely not like anything hardcore but not all games have to be um i really enjoy
the genre of having an interactive movie type experience and i remember there was this like
like god of war now i remember a few years ago that people were complaining about video games
coming out that were in this genre like they're like oh they're making video games for normies
and i was kind of like why can't we just have all the genres of games and enjoy them
i like hard games but uh i liked this one too because it had a really compelling story and it
was really spooky and yeah each shit on like gatekeeping video games that they have to be
hard to be accessible like i've also been playing a lot of animal crossing which is the easiest game
in the world um it's just and there's there's no stakes there's no dying there's no hit points
you just you're building a little little island and having little friends it's great
what's funny on a quick meta note i typed in i was gonna type in what uh what remains to eat the
finch to see what it what platforms it's on turns out it's on all of them but all i'd type in is the
word what and google filled out the rest for me which is kind of weird that's spooky okay um and i
kind of want to do what steven did and split this into because they're two video games and they're
kind of related the other one is another puzzle game called baba is you baba was a sheep i've heard
of that one too oh you played it i heard of it i've heard if i haven't played it yet so you
should definitely play it um it's a top down uh how would i even describe it like kind of a
retro styled top down game where you're just trying to get to a flag but
the the mechanic of the game is actual words like uh you have to spell baba is you
in order to control baba but if you take the word you and replace it with wall
then you turn into a wall or like if you do um like wall is defeat if you walk into the wall
then you die so uh that sounds amazing yeah there are words that you drag around and
it's these are like actually more thinky puzzles um the art style is adorable and the
stuff that happens is hilarious like just the the idea of this as a game mechanic is wonderful
that is cool it reminds me of the um the anglo physics the study of anglo physics story
kind of is like that on the in like adorable eight-bit sheep form it's got that big look
okay that's that sounds wild my together as a package my first recommendation
and we're back to student and that one's available for windows mac linux and the
nintendo switch which means i should probably look into it because i've been buying up games non-stop to
justify your switch no i i justified my switch when i bought my first game for it which is
breath of the wild that was worth five hundred dollars to play so oh my god switches five hundred
dollars it was i think 300 i got a memory card i got like a protective case i got uh breath of
the wild with it um and i think it came with minecraft i think my whole bundle is 500 bucks
damn i paid a hundred dollars for my ps4 yeah i got mine new though that's true like for a pretty
long time the only reason i would ever buy a new gaming console or devices when is all the game would
come out hmm yeah breath of the wild is amazing but it's not on my sales page today so you don't
even need to talk that one up that's just the best video game ever i can talk up horizon zero dawn
more with it though is that i think horizon zero dawn would have been game of the year 2017 if it
didn't if it didn't come out the same week as breath of the wild they're like very similar types of
game which is great if you like that type of game it's like there's two really amazing games in this
genre but unfortunately yeah people tended to well that one's a big name because yeah there's
all the series so they bought that one yeah the releasing at the same time is a bad idea
yeah and like i think it's all just just also like more widely appealing which just doesn't
make it bad it was it was a great game it was it was better in different areas worse in different
areas but it was uh like anyway horizon zero dawn i think would have been game of the year 2017 without
zelda uh stealing the spotlight so not stealing it deservedly snatching it because it was amazing so
all right steven i believe we are back to you okay well then this leaves us for like i guess tv and
and movies so i am struggling to think of like stuff that everyone already hasn't seen so i'll
just i'll name a tv series and i watched that it you know kind of started out in a whim and then
enjoyed both seasons and i think they're only like 10 episodes of season it's called uh i had it in my
head a second ago if i'll just describe it then if i remember the name it dropped me it's uh korean
zombie um like it's like futile area futile era korea and there's a zombie outbreak and it's it's
way more compelling than it sounds it's a lot of fun and it is called oh for pity's sake i just had
this um hey no that happens uh well i will have to google it because it's not coming to me so i
will leave that one on the wayside and instead pitch the others i think like rather than say here's
great things like that you should enjoy because i don't know whatever it takes a lot of time to
watch or something i'll just describe what i've been enjoying um bookland nine nine is partway
through season six right now and it's great if you haven't seen that show it's a lot more fun than it
sounds when i say it's a cop comedy show um it's it's really like uh it's not like low brow comedy
like um uh like rena 9-1-1 or something it's just it's a lot of strong characters uh good jokes um
running gags and that sort of stuff uh but i've mainly i was going to pitch better called sol
it which is almost done in season five and it's i think a good show to binge especially now because
you're trapped um watching it week to week over the last few years was kind of a drag because
especially in the first few seasons there's some where it's like some episodes where it's
it's almost not enough to keep you hooked unless you're already kind of invested um
but now that you can just move straight on to the next one it's great so i would recommend
better called sol and uh if anyone's not sure that's a prequel series to breaking bad which
you haven't seen that i would recommend that one first which is also available on netflix and uh i
mean there's probably no way anyone listening hasn't heard of that show so i'm not going to give it
a summary what about better call sol though you didn't really uh i i guess i'm just describing
like what i'm currently watching like it's so it follows uh sol goodman which is the lawyer that
they had in breaking bad and basically he's just this wonderful shyster um he will manipulate the
law uh fake evidence and do whatever he can for his for his clients whoever they may be
and in the case of breaking bad it was mainly the protagonist and his friend um and so that's
how like he fell into the series and this is a prequel show some years it's not sure like before
he'd met uh like waltz and jessey from breaking bad so it's more just like an origin story for
that character and it's really good um i don't really know how to sell it other than like if
you liked breaking bad you'll like this it's got a lot less of the um i don't know uh like waltz
