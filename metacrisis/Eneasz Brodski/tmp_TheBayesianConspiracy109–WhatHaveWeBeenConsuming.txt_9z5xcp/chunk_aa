Welcome to the Basin Conspiracy, I'm Manny Ashbrovsky, I'm Stephen Zuber, I'm Jay Sticky,
and we are, I guess we have a quick announcement at the beginning, GS is now pivoting to Jace,
it is not a different person at all, so uh...
Or it is a different person, a whole new person.

like talking to doctors and the psychologist and stuff so a little bit
nice okay yeah that makes sense yeah oh so I I've got a you know as you correct
if my idea here is wrong of the show topic we're gonna or the episode topic
we're going to discuss basically content things that we've consumed for people
to enjoy while they're locked at home is that essentially the idea exactly we
were going to do other stuff but like everyone is just kind of down with this
whole quarantining thing and it sucks and we said let's have a lighter episode
about stuff that we've been really enjoying that has helping us get through
the quarantine then maybe we'd like to share with our listeners they might
enjoy it as well awesome I've got another piece of like exciting news not
that exciting but it's not content related so I refinanced my house what
like three days ago sign the refi loan for 1.1% less I think oh my god that's
a lot yeah well I signed on for 4.75 at the beginning so now I'm just down to
reasonable yeah grants man but that is like 200 bucks a month so that's kind
of cool mm-hmm and it's not that difficult right no it was super easy
barely an inconvenience if you have a mortgage now's a great time to refinance
yeah all I did was respond to an email from my lender which I guess I should
mention I guess I don't know if they I doubt Cherry Creek mortgage does outside
of Colorado but I have no idea if anyone's in Colorado and is buying a
house or want to check with Cherry Creek mortgage message Sabrina Kerry at Cherry
Creek mortgage she's been great she did all this stuff for me she just sent out
like an email blast saying hey rates are crazy low that then again it took like
six weeks to get everything finalized so this was almost two months ago and yeah
anyway I'm wondering she's great I've been wondering if this might be a good
time to invest in property it's probably I don't know yeah that's the thing I
was going to be buying a place right around now last year this was my plan
and now I mean first of all I got the whole back thing which is slowing me
down but I'm also like I I don't know if I should buy now because nobody very few
people are buying so it seems like prices are dropping and oh yeah I kind of
want to hold off a bit see if they keep going down or what exactly is going to
happen so it's a weird time yeah by invest in property I meant like buy a
house to live in it's not you're probably talking about buying another
investment property well I was but like yeah in general it might just be a good
idea to wait another month or two because at least yeah for prices to drop
another one or two percent is a lot when you're talking about several hundred a
thousand dollars it's probably as long as I will need to like get a mortgage and
shop around anything that's not gonna suggest as you can at least look to see
what you can get approved for now but it's definitely something that if you
want to do you should start getting on because yeah like you said it takes a
couple months and you want to be ready to jump on it once once it looks like it
might be turning yeah I have actually bought two houses before which is oh
yeah it's weird to think about well you haven't you haven't said you moved to
Denver so for me it's it's a shift but yeah you know what you're doing yeah
actually like kind of miss working on renovating houses yeah something that I
kind of I really like hated it the first time I did it because I was working at
the video game company very long hours and then I would like leave work do my
45-minute commute back to this house it would be dark and that I'd just be like
in the dark with some floodlights nailing down wooden floor it's very rewarding
work though it is I was really burning myself out on it the first time and I
was like so you know it was the first time doing it I didn't know what the
hell I was doing I was looking at YouTube videos but then like yeah now it's been
a while since I've done it and I'm like kind of like I miss it yeah after after
like every week of work you look around you're like damn I can literally see in
the physical world the difference that I've made yeah it's really cool feeling
my dad's a well he builds houses or a modeler but he is also capable of just
building houses from the ground up or additions and he's always said that like
actually like I love my job I get a lot of satisfaction from providing one of the
basic necessities of life for people yeah and that always kind of stuck with
me is like yeah that's probably like if you don't know what you're gonna or what
you want to do with your life or what would be rewarding or fulfilling maybe
think about one of those building things or it's nice to be able to see the
fruits of your labor I've worked a lot of random jobs over the years and the
ones where like you could look at the pile of stuff at the end of the day be
like that's what I worked on that's always nice the job I have now is kind of
like that even if you can't like point at it in physical space I can at least
like I can at least look at me like that's what I worked on you're still
building things just yeah in a virtual world that's right I can do it without
sitting or without leaving my chair nice yeah that's that's the opposite of
accounting accounting you're doing the same damn spreadsheets every month just
updating numbers yeah at least it has a paycheck with it yes exactly anyways we
should probably get started and we nowadays get started with the sequences so
shall we hit the sequences first oh no it was not prepared I mean yeah we can
totally talk about them just I forgot that we're doing them first okay so the
first sequence post we have today is called scientific evidence legal
evidence rational evidence and it starts with Eliezer saying that suppose
you're good friend the police commissioner tells you in strictest
confidence that the crime kingpin of your city is Wolke Wilkinson as a
rationalist are you licensed to believe this statement and basically goes on to
point that our legal system would not imprison him on the basis of the police
commissioner statement and there's lots of good reasons for this but also that
that doesn't mean that the police commissioner statement is not rational
evidence and it would be really dumb for you to go up and insult Wolke if you
were told this so the definition of legal evidence is like a special protected
class of evidence but it's not the only level of evidence that people can and
should take into account he then goes on to extend this to say that science is
made up of generalizations which apply to many specific or to many particular
instances so that you can run real-world tests and test these generalizations and
verify for yourself that the generalization is true without having to
trust anyone's authority science is publicly reproducible knowledge of
humankind and it also should be a protected pool of beliefs that's
especially reliable so it also has a different standard of evidence than just
general rational evidence all this work in so far yeah I think so I think that's
been one of the things that even since before I was introduced to rationality
that was a sales point for science because I in the context of whatever like
high school arguing with religious people you know that was always a common
comeback well that's just like you're it's the same sort of thing you know you
believe it because Darwin said it science your religion yeah right and and like in
in all charity it's not like the dumbest thing to say if you have no idea what
either person's talking about you look at someone saying well I think this and I
think that well what makes your beliefs more founded than theirs and it's like
because I can go verify mine and then they say well cuz I just believe them
I believe real strong it is interesting like most of science is like publicly
reproducible knowledge and yet like I can't reproduce the results of you know
the 2015 Large Hadron Collider experiments right yeah theoretically like you
could reproduce them and get the same results but if I had if I had a large
hadron collider economically feasible and also you might not have the expertise
needed to do it right I think I think the important thing is that it's not
revealed knowledge that's the distinction like this isn't something that like oh
no I was told this through these magic tablets and a hat or in a dream or a
waterfall told me or whatever it's like no no I went and looked on this island I
measured the beaks on these birds you guys can all do the same thing if you
feel like it yeah you cannot reproduce special revelation from God but not only
can you reproduce the science stuff the ways to reproduce it is publicly
available so that people can test it assuming you know they have the ability
yeah and that gets into the whole pet peeve or whatever of mine that like I
really wish that there was more prestige to be had from doing replications
yeah but we do have because the scientific pool of knowledge is something
that is supposed to be general and apply to many things we want it to be a
protected pool of belief that is especially reliable and that we impose
special strong additional standards before we canonize it as quote-unquote
scientific knowledge so he also then goes on to ask that like how about this
hypothetical statement the Sun will rise on September 18th is that a scientific
belief and before we go forward I want I want to know what you guys think or if
you have any opinions on that is that statement a scientific belief I'm
pausing because I'm hesitant to answer anything with like put this in square
scare quotes and does this fit in this category or not I would say it is a
rational belief and it would hmm yeah you can't you can't replicate it like you
could wait and then record the Sun rising but the thing is like it depends on
how pedantic you want to be like does the Sun rise or do we go around it well
yeah I mean basically I guess meaning will the earth continue to turn on the
18th so that it looks like the Sun is rising I think that's a scientific
prediction I don't know what like to say like I have a belief about the future
you could say I'm I predict that on August 18th the Sun will the Sun will
rise or whatever September 18th whatever day it was like based on the fires the
Sun has risen well even like as a scientist you can just put your neck out
and say alright I'll bet you ten million dollars it rises on the 18th of
September right yeah but going by his definition it has to be something
reproducible which I'm not sure if that means like a phenomena that you could
record or that you have to actually like cause the thing to happen I don't know I
think that's putting hairs too much yeah he did he basically said what what you
guys have said that um the the point of scientific knowledge that it's
generalizable it's evidence it's a system of generalizations and so the whole point
is to be able to make future predictions and if you couldn't it would be
completely useless but the actual prediction is based on his based on his
definition not a scientific belief in itself it's a prediction you make from
scientific beliefs and you could say that it's a prediction of this theory but
since it is a specific thing rather than a generalization it's it's more of an
experiment than a scientific belief in itself which I thought was an interesting
distinction to make I I'm not sure well no I do know why that's in there because
it relates to the next post but when I read just this post itself I was like
okay that's an interesting distinction and I can buy it I'm not sure why it's
being made here but sure why not but yeah it seems like a scientific belief is
more like a belief along the lines of objects in motion tend to stay in motion
and the earth is rotating so it will tend to stay rotating unless something
acts against it and since we don't see anything coming to stop the rotation of
the earth anytime soon it should continue to rotate and so the Sun should
continue to rise and thus we predict on September 18th it will so you know the
beliefs are that the earth is in motion and it will stay that way whereas the
Sun will rise is a specific prediction rather than a scientific belief
yeah I don't have I don't have much like to split hairs there about it's kind
of interesting like Sam Harris makes that sort of broad case for science in
the moral landscape and I guess rather than dive into that it's worth at least
checking out you know some short talk or essay that he gave about that book or
read the book it's not that long it's kind of fun even if you think he's
wrong so it's it's just the I mean is it like a scientific statement is it a
scientific question I was gonna go into examples but it's kind of an aside so
