well what was the thing that he said like the one thing that you said was the
same well it wasn't quite the same it was just more like you give a kind of
hashed out definition of like what it means for this to be scientific or not
and then through his lens he's like okay well because even the the foundation of
science comes with like fundamental values like parsimony intellectual
honesty evidence that sort of stuff then why don't we just go ahead and add into
that value bucket like suffering is bad and not suffering is good and then we
can like then it's just a matter of you know plug and chug to figure out what
works in the universe just like we do with what makes rockets fly right yeah
basically but like as far as like the little they're not even quite puzzles
it's just like intuition pumps it's like is it a scientific question to ask how
many birds are currently in flight around the world right now like it's not
one that we can answer even in like in practice maybe in principle like well
definitely in principle if we had a fully working simulation of the planet
then we could just you know if bird in flight count increase one but since we
don't have that the question is like a real question about reality but is
unanswerable is that therefore unscientific it's like little things
like that so that's why I don't like that's any time I see science and stuff
in quotes it it's kind of just I sometimes worry if they're splitting hairs
but that's not really the point Elias is making here and yet I managed to make a
non-related point for a minute and a half so yeah I was gonna kind of rant a
little bit about how frustrated I get by the fact that we don't really have like
we don't tend to police the definition of science in the casual parlance as
strongly as I would like for example every single shampoo or like makeup or oh
my god scientifically formulated to do yeah yeah or like with the power of
science it's kind of like Rachel sent me this picture yesterday which has been
around for a long time but it's like these hovering drones and it's some
news article covering it it says they used code and algorithms to make those
drones don't clash and crash into each other like what else would they have
used my standard my standard reply to that is always just like quote they
used words and sentences to write this book and yeah I mean I guess they didn't
use bumpers that they attached to the robot right which is kind of an
algorithm if you hit the bumper go the other way it's not one it's not one that
you have to code into it it's like a room but like aerial right exactly that's
how real birds work right birds are weird they have like magnetism sense anyway
cool essence yes so on to the next post which is related to this one and what
we've been talking about actually kind of what the last one was setting up yeah
is molecular nanotechnology quote-unquote scientific and did someone else want to
drive on this one I would just point out that I don't know how we took the other
ones out of order on the last episode I'm told they find it because they were
great but this would have been perfect to follow up with the uh Chronix episode
yeah I was really disappointed we didn't yeah we are now the new last wrong is in
a different order and I think um we probably were on the new last wrong and
we like hit the next button or whatever yes if you if you hit the next and
previous buttons then they go I believe they were the AI AI from AI to zombies
yeah exactly whereas the only way to get them in the original posting order is to
go to that wiki page that's linked near the top or right by where our uh yeah
apparently right by where I can do that at the same time it's all good it happens
that's right they were really I will like apt for the topic I think
yeah that too yeah it's amazing how applicable to many topics most of these posts are well nobody
knows why this one is applicable yet so we should get into it so I'll just answer the question right
away is molecular scientific is molecular nanotechnology all right let me try this the
third time is molecular nanotechnology scientific and I'll just say yes
well that does not at all help us get through the post though Stephen no no but I'm but I'm
just prepared to like immediately bite that bullet and say yep well okay if I'm a scientist and I say
that it's science does that make it science or do I have to put a lab coat on first you need the
lab coat otherwise how will people know you're a scientist yeah anyway like all the people in
those shampoo commercials it's perfect all right so it starts with consider the statement it is
physically possible to construct diminoid nanomachines which repair biological cells some people will
tell you that molecular nanotechnology is pseudoscience because it has not been verified by experiment
but he says extrapolations of diminoid nanomachines are based on standard physics which is to say
scientific generalizations therefore if you say that nanomachines cannot work you must be inventing
new physics or to put it more sharply if you say that a simulation of a molecular gear is inaccurate
you must claim that atoms thus configured would behave differently from the depiction
then either you know of a flaw in the simulation argument or the simulation algorithm sorry
or you're inventing your own laws of physics yeah I think I mean I can still sympathize with
who's like well you don't know it would work that way we've never seen a molecular gear
yeah you're right as I tried to formulate an argument to sympathize with I found myself unable to
well then the article itself they say what about the rape brothers attempt to build a non-biological
heavier-than-air powered flying machine was that pseudoscience yeah because all flying machines
crashed was always true before that and that that's again so pseudosciences and quotes here um
I I have a kind of a knee jerk thing about putting words like this in quotes this is done in a you
know well articulated and informative way but it's like okay you're trying to make me make
categories and shove things into either one of them when it's like the I think our tendency to do that
is kind of um over engineered no I disagree I think words having specific meanings is really
important but like yeah I I I agree but if we try and shut like hmm I guess I just don't know if
rather than like say all right which bucket does this go into you just talk about the thing
for a minute first and then decide if it has to go into either these buckets
um or I guess maybe we'll make a third bucket for plausible or probable or definitely doable but
not done yet um and then we've got pseudoscience and science right so like the right brothers saying
no I think our planes will work before any plane has ever worked before is not the same as a charlatan
with crystals saying well of course we haven't you know you guys don't believe the crystals
of field cancer yet we haven't seen my crystals yet um right but that's because the charlatan with
crystals has no scientific generalization to go off of like with the right brothers if they were
confronted with this is pseudoscience they would have said look here's the models of physics we're
using everything should work out what do you know about physics that we don't know that we're you
know how are we simulating this incorrectly which is the same thing that someone who makes a nano
machine with a simulation would say like what do you know based on the generalized body of
knowledge we have from science that I am misinterpreting how am I using this knowledge wrong uh and
you know so if someone claims that it's pseudoscience the reason you put it in quotes is because
it's not really pseudoscience it's just science that doesn't have any precedence yet but it looks
like it should be right whereas real pseudoscience is like you know dr crystals crystal magic
where he doesn't have any body any body of scientific knowledge that he's drawing on he's
just like they're crystals so magnets they do things with vibes I think oh vibes okay yeah they
they can vibrate differently and make you vibrate different and there's not an actual
scientific body of knowledge that supports any of that it's just bullshit that has a
sciency sound to the words totally and it's one of those things like I think it's easy to just to
at least give illustrations that aren't even historical illustrations that would persuade
somebody from saying something that like well no molecular nanotechnology is unscientific or
chronic is unscientific because we don't have any proof examples yet and so like I I think would be
informative to give the example of like well sure we don't have any examples of humans being able
to survive outside of the earth moon orbit but it seems like a very plausible belief to say that
they could survive a trip to mars under safe conditions it's not like but but of course we
haven't done that yet so would it be is that a unscientific thing to say it seems kind of like
uh splitting hairs between like the past and the future is the mistake that some people are making
when they're uh throwing future tech that doesn't exist yet into the pseudoscience bucket
yeah he says that uh if you decide to make a strong positive assertion that nanomachines are impossible
you are being irrational you are even being unscientific because an ungranted assertion
that tomorrow the sun will not rise is unscientific because you need this needlessly contradicted
the best extrapolation from current scientific knowledge and if you were to say that nanomachines
are unscientific you would also be needlessly contradicting the best extrapolation from current
scientific knowledge and I think as you were saying the same goes for cryonics that if you are
saying that uh these these tissues cannot be preserved what what is making you say that
yeah I'm pretty sure that this is actually about cryonics and AI um I remember it's definitely
about AI because that's what all the sequences are about uh first well yeah the first um
I went to a lesser on made up I remember getting like schooled by the other members when they talked
about total brain stimulation or emulation and I said that that was impossible and they basically
had the same argument back at me where it was like it's very difficult it would be very difficult
we can't we can't currently do it that doesn't mean that it's impossible yeah there's no reason
to think that it's impossible and it took me a while of arguing with them until I started
understanding I guess that they were uh yeah like this isn't the way that people casually or
conventionally used like the word scientific or and like possible or impossible kind of kind of
used to mean like very likely or very unlikely like we like to we like to exaggerate it could be
impossible to simulate a human mind in silicon like we don't know for sure that it isn't impossible
but all the current evidence says there's no reason to think that I was going off of uh
I was remembering Ray Kurzweil had said something kind of silly about
brain emulation that showed that he didn't understand neurons I think he said that like
we can take each neuron and encode it in like a few bits and then we would it would only need
this many bits or something like I forget it was a long time ago but you know so I was thinking
that that was like the thing that people were proposing and oh okay it was kind of an argument
that like where we actually had we were kind of arguing about two different things and it took us
a while of kind of talking past each other to see that's why I think it's important that words
have specific meanings because um yeah like double-correcting on things tabooing words or
making sure that words are defined really facilitates communication I think that is the
root of many of a disagreement where people are arguing about things that they're not actually
they're not they're not arguing with about what they think they're arguing about
and so they just they run in circles chasing down different positions where it's like no
wait actually let's just lay out what we actually believe okay yeah that's basically what I was
going to say what are we fighting about again yeah the thing is I don't know how active you guys
are on our discord but I'm on there a lot especially now that I'm quarantined and
like half the arguments seem to be basically that like people were arguing for the same thing but
using different words and it takes half a day to get there and actually understand there's no argument
and I don't know the the annoying part is that like if this argument was done face to face in
the real world it wouldn't be a big deal first of all it would go faster but like people are also
kind of nicer and more charitable when they're face to face with people whereas online people are
more likely to get snippy and like oh you're misrepresenting me on purpose and that part
kind of sucks and it's just because it's a very town exactly I want to give a mad shout out right
now to my boy three all men because that dude is notorious on the discord for steelmanning the
hell out of everything but it's also just like a really good habit when you're in online spaces
because yeah you can't sit on a voice if you're grumpy for some reason you slept bad or you're
hungry you might like misinterpret things as more hostile than they actually are and things spiral
just that emoji mean winky face there's some like a stikwink or a playful wing oh you son of a
bitch start casting winking at me joking aside I mean I'm I'm so glad that emoji or emoticons
or whatever exist it's emoji do not yeah I guess it's imagine now I that was a terrible movie um
oh well yeah the movie was bad but I use a lot of gifts too gifts as well yeah yeah so uh slack
as you look at it at discord's man at it but you just type in you know the giffy extension and then
find an appropriate gift that relates to it it's like perfect the english language wasn't enough but
that small quiet picture is or quite quiet movie is this dancing cat wearing a fedora
completely expresses what I was trying to get at here I don't even round out my argument perfectly
exactly um this is such an aside but uh I'll be quick there was this app it no longer exists
I'm sad there might be something similar I don't know but it was a chat app that you could
only communicate with each other in gifts and my co-workers and I installed it and it was
really it was like kind of the texting version of charades cool it sounds delightful it was
really entertaining it was more entertaining than it had any right to be actually which is
probably why it doesn't exist anymore uh so are we done on this topic yeah the post ends that
uh diamondoid nano systems are possible is merely a best guess it's merely based on qualitative
approximate potentially falsifiable reasoning from beliefs already in the protected belief pool
of science such a guess is not reliable enough itself to be added to the protective belief pool
it is merely rational oh yeah and I forgot about falsifiability as well but yeah add that to the
list of requirements for something to be scientific yeah replica based on based on facts
something you could observe or replicate yourself something that would that has ways of falsifying
it yeah so these things are not necessarily scientific beliefs but they are rational beliefs
based on the scientific pool all right so for next time our uh blessed on posts will be fake
explanations and guessing the teacher's password which is a famous one nice all right getting
into the main topic of discussion for this week uh steven what have you been consuming that has
made your life more happy in the in the quarantine give it to us in five to ten minutes all right
well i had another guideline which was don't fill as many things as i can in the five to ten minutes
yes we're going to go we ideally we're going to go two things each but uh steven might have more than
two i i appreciate you accommodating me i'll meet you in the middle i will do so we're gonna do
what a turn two turns each right yeah and do one thing in each turn or in your case possibly more
than one thing in each one i will do two things in each turn but they'll be related so first one's
going to be video games that i've been playing um although maybe this is a bad suggestion because
if you don't already have a nintendo switch they are apparently super hard to get right now um i've
been playing hollow night i've been playing the hell out of this game the last few days
it is what's being played for the uh new doof podcast game club where once a month the community
will get together and vote on what game uh elliot and ruben have to play the other guys who did
deep and packed which was the packed uh basically we want more uh we've got worm style podcast
with delightful accents oh yes australian being inexplicably australian is tight
which is from the captain marvel pitch meeting which everyone should see um so anyway hollow night
is kind of like a just getting a holiday is like a pitch meetings he's he's getting around to telling
us how awesome pitch meeting is that's a given that's good not that's not part of my list if you
haven't seen pitch meetings on youtube just google pitch meeting and enter anything you've seen like
a movie or tv show probably game of thrones my favorite one is yeah my favorite one is pitch
meeting season eight game of thrones it's a wonderful way to start if you've seen season
eight game of thrones and if you haven't like it's got everything from like seinfeld to uh um tiger
king that show that everyone has been pissing themselves about the last month which i completely
refused to watch but i did watch the pitch meeting for anyway this isn't about pitch meeting this is
about hollow night and another video game so um hollow night is like a uh basically it's kind of
like a little 2d dark souls uh with a lot more platforming and a lot less like status management
like you're not toxic or poisoned or bleeding or whatever but it has the same sort of like all
