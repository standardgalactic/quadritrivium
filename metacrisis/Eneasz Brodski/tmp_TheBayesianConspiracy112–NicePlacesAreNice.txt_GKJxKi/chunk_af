emojis or something like that you know a lot of um the ways that I have found I've I've done
some amount of uh emotional distress like conflict resolution things over text and
one of the things you do is you use some kind of like Gobin Rappaport intervention or like some
janky version of it where maybe you're just just doing um uh nonviolent communication
using your eye statements making sure that it's not like you're a bad person but like this was
this was an action that maybe you feel bad uh or like you always do whatever and it's like
this one time uh like last week this happened and that like I noticed this has happened a
few other times and the yeah and the thing about you know the right to be an asshole the problem
is that who gets to define what's an asshole right right if that's the same reason I'm against
against people saying it's okay to punch nazis because then right away very quickly
Nazi turns into whatever this person is against right I think there was a anyone who eats meat
as a Nazi so it's okay to physically assault people who eat meat well not even that but then
there's there's a case of mistaken identity I remember a story about somebody who got punched
because somebody thought that they had a swastika tattoo but it was actually something else
I think they got stabbed or stabbed stabbed wasn't this in like Washington like right around
that whole thing when we had that episode yeah yeah so yeah that's that's another reason you know
why you could push back and say well you know your definition of asshole is not the same as mine so
I think the server should have a everyone's ability to be however they want to be oh yeah but I'm
glad you circled back to cynicism because that's I think that the the difference that makes oh I
wanted to talk about that really I wanted to hit on and I kind of lost sight of it like there's
difference between like pointing out why an idea is bad and doing it in a constructive way that
lets someone better the idea or at least maybe if it's one that is completely empty that there's
not there's no way to better it at least to illustrate what is missing right this your idea
is not complete we can't save it here's the things it would need to actually work I always consider
that like I feel like I'm being asked to do free labor for other people's dumb ideas so
basically I just ignore things like that well so then you ignore but you don't you don't try
mean to say that's a bad idea yeah you don't have to do that much labor either you could just say
like oh I think I disagree with that um I think I saw something there's some study they saw a while
ago but anyway I have like low confidence in that but um I don't have the time to check that right
now but just just you know that's my two cents yeah I mean I mean if this was me I wouldn't even
jump in have to say like well here's the 10 things I think it's missing and here's here's your 50
point plan to get there I might just say I feel like that's missing a few crucial steps and right
now isn't executable or you could say like my understanding is this thing but uh I might be
wrong I don't know but uh here's how I don't know or you could just ignore it yeah or you're gonna
know it's depending on how little you want to interact with it at all yeah and maybe it's zero
percent there's there's no rule saying you have to comment on everything right so um but there's
so there's the the version that is like actually helpful and the one that's not where all you're
doing is just propping yourself up by by making another idea or another person feel smaller
and stupid right and that that's not constructive to anybody and as far as like my my vision for
what I imagine a rationalist community to be like I picture it way closer to the first thing than
the second you don't walk into a room uh and we don't have this problem in meet space meetups and
I think that's part of why like online stuff is just different um if someone came into some half
baked idea there'd be a fun talk about it right if you know someone wanted to talk about it it
wouldn't just be like uh oh that's dumb and moving that's dumb and you're dumb for thinking it
but there's the anonymity of the internet but there's also the fact that you're not in the room
with the person so say like um Kevin who's a fictional member of our Denver community came in
and said uh man like uh I don't know uh communism is awesome you know brand new to the meetup is
just like hey guys like wow you're all rationalists I want to talk to you about why communism is awesome
and and better than capitalism I think people would probably argue about that but they would
do it in such a way as like we'd be sitting in a circle Kevin would be there too and then like
or like you know it would never like nobody would go to Kevin and be like you're an idiot get out of
here I know or like or they wouldn't go up and like just be like here's the reasons your ideas are
wrong one two three four and then walk away and then Kevin's left standing there somebody would
come up to him be like wow that person was just a dick to you you know like the thing is the person
there I know I talked about uh in the we want more uh recording that we did a few days ago
I talked about uh how much I love coral because I really do love coral he's a great character
and he's a very good character yeah and I have a lot of sympathy for him and I think a lot of
rationalists love that sort of coral thing just as much as I do but I think it's always pretty damn
important to um not always but often check in and maybe think to yourself what would coral do
and if or what would coral say and if you're typing something that coral would say maybe
just delete it because coral is never a good thing to have in a community he's always just
going to make things bad I think it's good to have people that have outlier opinions to keep
everybody sane but um I don't want that to be I don't because Stephen was talking about um we
should have exactly one person like that in his name should be Robin Hansen yeah I think like
you don't you don't want to you don't want a friend as you don't want coral as a friend you
want Harry as a friend Harry will be the same person who'll point out why your idea is bad
but he won't do it in a way that says and everyone believes it is stupid he won't do the full coral
you know rail on how on cynicism right I think every community could use one coral but no community
should be just quarrels or even half quarrels or even two quarrels one coral is the perfect amount
of coral for any community if you guys remember my review of talking to strangers they both talk
about the holy fool who is the person outside of the community by you know nature of maybe having
down syndrome or something but the quote unquote person that used to be called the village idiot
but the thing is that the holy fool glorifies the village idiot because that there was this
acknowledgement that this is the person who can come in and point out something that everybody
else is overlooking uh or like the emperor's new clothes uh the little child who says he's not wearing
anything like there needs to be that person in the community there also needs to be there's another
thing from uh darkness strangers the whole community would be like that of the incredibly paranoid
person who was totally like all about bernie madoff is doing this stuff and trying to tell
everybody but doing it while by going to his superior wearing a trench coat in a hat with
like a secret document box and depositing on his desk and doing all kind because he's so
fucking paranoid it was his boss he could have just walked up and would say hey i think bernie
madoff is doing x y like incredibly paranoid people sometimes are really useful to have around but
you don't want everybody to be basically like paranoid schizophrenic level because that would be
awful so like i love or shak or something i don't know i love what you help put my head in yasha
relating this all to harry potter and that the rationality characters uh moody would not work
well in a room full of four other moody's oh my god like they wouldn't get anywhere they'd be
distrusting about everything each other saying that's the schizophrenic paranoid like level person
that you want one of exactly having a moody is perfect having three out of four moody's would be
out of a group would be a nightmare they would just be suspicious of each other yes exactly
wouldn't get nothing done and i i know we do have a hard stop time so i think it's time oh yeah
we're past it one more thing all right as long as it's fast yeah steve was talking about cynicism
i just want to say that i in particular i agree with this and i how i talk about this is that i
hate haters i i hate hater culture and community like there's some people that think it's cool to
sit around and like just make fun of things or to trash things and i've been in friend groups or
like communities where the thing to do is to trash talk stuff and like it's this weird insecurity
thing i think this is unfortunately like uh my experience of this is all male friend groups
often tend to have this thing where it's like it's uncool to like something
that just makes you like a nerd or sap or something so like oh man like let's all get together and
play this stupid fucking video game oh my god like this this game is so bad like or i don't know like
oh man you like that band that band is so gay like just like people getting together and just
shitting on everything and like the only way you can also be cool is by also being like maximally
cynical and hating everything and making fun of it and it's just like i hate being in communities
it feels like everybody is having these incredible insecurity responses to things all
the time and need validation from everybody else like just please be vulnerable just somebody go
i love that show shut the fuck up steven university is fucking great like or whatever that's a hill
i'm ready to fight on hard that and this can be a nice final note never shit on something somebody
likes you know like don't go wrong like unless like they like is really shitty i disagree man
oh you said that okay yeah like i mean life you hate the thing you can say i personally
dislike this thing but like that's what you that's what you say i love how much you love it yeah and
i can say that about literally anything man like i like and just the general thing is like life in
general sucks a bit for most people some other time at the very least life is suffering as the
Buddha would say all right so and and so if someone finds something that they enjoy in it don't tell
them they're stupid for enjoying no no well so i would never like tell someone they're bad for
enjoying something and like try to mock them for that because i think that's bullshit that's
that's all i'm saying okay if if something does suck and you're like oh man if if you want a
version of that that i think is better check this out or something right specifically my hate on the
uh star trek the card that aired uh this year like you were there for that that was just a
couple days ago was that was that wrong i think you were expressing your opinion yeah and like you
did it in a tongue-in-cheek hard way that says no one should watch it or something but you didn't
say you're an idiot if you like it right that's the difference and like if someone liked it who
cares man like they're they might have the reasons like there's a lot of things that just i don't
like because um quite a few people i know liked it my my ex-girlfriend loved the scooby-doo cartoon
and would watch it endlessly and i would kind of make fun of her for it she would make fun of
herself for it but it was like the thing is she's like i don't know it's just it's got this nostalgia
factor uh i love the animation i love the i don't know it's like she had perfectly good
reasons for loving this thing i had perfectly good reasons for not and this didn't need to be a
conflict between us and i wasn't but sometimes people will do like oh you have bad tastes and
then they get offended by that and you're like yeah that band sucks let me like and they'll argue
to you trying to get you to stop liking this band or or to agree that you're stupid for liking
this band and it's just what is why are you doing this stop i know that some things are subjective
dude in fucking junior high at one point uh i was humming the white stuff because i'm a huge
weird ale nerd i love all of weird stuff yeah and like i saw him in i saw him live and someone was
like so good are you singing the right stuff and uh which was uh one of those boy bands right uh
and i was like no i'm singing the white stuff by weird ale they're like no you fag you're singing
the white stuff the right stuff and i was like no and i'm like i quoted them the lyrics of the
white stuff because i'm a weird ale nerd i had them memorized they're like oh okay that's cool then
which first of all why the fuck did i feel the need to defend myself i like i could have been like
yeah man i like what i was being attacked yeah but instead i was like no man i'm not one of those
lamers that likes the the the backstreet boys whoever it was i'm singing weird ale which i don't
i say what you're saying yeah i feel bad that i felt the need to defend myself at all instead of
just flipping in the bird there's like an idealized version of you that would have been but like also
you were being attacked and you were just responding kind of with like a panic response probably yeah
but more than anything faulted against guys for being a douche totally seriously all right that's
a good that's a good uh stop point we gotta think of patreon thank you yes okay uh this week we are
thinking luke hanks luke i hope this wasn't yeah too terrible of an episode for you because it was
mainly about community norms but you know um maybe you'd like hearing about how to talk online more
community norms are super like special interests of mine so maybe maybe luke is like maybe cool
or if not luke um tell us what you do on here yeah yeah thanks luke we really appreciate it
we do uh it's awesome you help keep this thing running you do i was going to say that before
you wrap up i would have liked to have time to talk about the protests all the fun stuff around
that but that takes 30 minutes and we didn't have it today so maybe we'll get to it in a couple weeks
okay well we may have someone on who disagrees with us on this particular thing and they can
explain why they hate civility and want the world to be terrible maybe we will be convinced
all right now on that note uh we got a roll so see you guys in a couple weeks thanks for listening
bye bye stay safe
i think black liquor is just what you get when like you scrub the devils taint with a cotton swab
taint liquor
