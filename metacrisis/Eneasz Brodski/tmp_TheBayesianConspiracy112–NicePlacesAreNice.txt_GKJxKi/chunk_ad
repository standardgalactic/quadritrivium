be punishable by what like stern warning or no I don't I hate that idea because that I mean I'm
not just saying flat out no I'm just saying like uh I dislike that idea because like I don't want to
have a list a list of rules that like you aren't being nice enough and cheery enough and now the
the neighborhood um scold is going to come to you and be like hey I noticed you weren't being happy
enough for our discord maybe you should listen to general like suggestions for the norm somewhere
on the discord though and then having them there that people can see and letting enough people
know that these are the norms that if somebody comes in and just starts like spewing racist
like words and yeah well like using Nazi signs and saying that like Scott Alexander is clearly
a Nazi because he thinks that Austrian Jews are the superior race which is actually a thing that
happened that I saw happen but he's a Nazi because he I mean no uh it's so bad I'll tell you this
whole story later this is one of the stressful things that happened that like led to me not being
on the last episode uh I was talking about this before we started recording but yeah I'm like
I'm torn on having a mod team like that at all because I don't think maybe not even I wouldn't
even maybe give them the title of mods but I would just say hey like whoever wants to you know like
whoever cares about these values we're gonna stick them up here in the discord like hey we
prefer this to be a non-cynical place where people are collaborative and where people can
can also but I think that's more of a give criticism and accept criticism without personalizing it
I think that's more of a community effort yeah like everyone has to be like this is who we are
and if if someone and I think so far this has worked out pretty well on the discord server
where it's still small though I can see if it gets bigger it could start getting more out of control
yeah but if people do find that people are being too cynical or too nasty someone brings it up and
then there's you know an afternoon where that is the topic for the day where everyone's like
are we too mean are we uh too nice like whatever um but but I like the fact that the community does
kind of hash it out and I don't want there to be you know cops walking around with uh you know the
niceness cops with their niceness their niceness nightsticks right that they can use to ban people
if anyone hasn't isn't familiar with the game we happy few this fits perfectly with that everyone
takes a drug called joy and it basically puts them like on happy lsd trips and then it's great
you've got the the cops who run around basically hitting people who aren't taking enough joy or
the or they get kicked out of town so like we don't want that I I don't I really don't want any
moderation like I feel like the community as a whole honestly doesn't really need it I don't know
what like for example say that you get a troll that is just being a total dick in order to disrupt
things repeatedly people ask them to stop and they don't I think that's beyond the scope of the
discussion though because trolls are easy to handle you ban the troll you're like yeah go away
this is more like the general atmosphere of how people interact yeah like and yeah I agree if
someone comes on and is being trolly or or deliberately provocative in the sense of I don't
know posting uh fucking I don't know I'll kind of beheadings or something and they won't stop
then it's like all right cool we're not I'm not going to try and explain to you the norms of the
community you're just out but um I like maybe that's a good norm actually the the point at which
like basically everybody else agrees like wow fuck that person is the point where you should ban
somebody yeah yeah but the thing is like I find myself and I think you may have mentioned this
too uh Steven like I find myself even on the discord in general being a grumpier nastier
person than I am and it's not just on the discord it's anytime I'm online like there's something
about the keyboard that I I stop maybe it's because I can't see the people and they're
yourself to outrage porn too I wonder about that not anymore the uh used to I was so much
angrier and more depressed and upset when I was part of the social justice community and
they just constantly are broadcasting outrage porn all the time here's the thing that everybody's
upset about today you need to be upset about it too find out here yeah no it's it's been years for
me since I've been into that and it has been a huge quality of life improvement to cut out the
outrage porn entirely also sorry if I keep posting on social justice in particular a thing happened
okay well and and there's an obvious like uh I'm bitter about it no no I mean I think that's
fine I would like in general we're all we're all in favor of the goal of like yes everyone should
be treated humanely and and respected but that's I mean uh social justice I think as you're using
it as I use it doesn't mean that right no I mean well it used to mean that because social justice
warriors kind of turned into a different thing but anyway um I think I did want to bring up
before we lose track of this any ash was originally saying like someone did leave and it seemed like
maybe that person needed a thicker skin and I was well what I meant specifically by that was the person
left because they had a personal disagreement with uh someone who has slightly more power on the
discord they they have the channel boffin roll which means they can uh set emojis for the channel
they can move the server channels around basically doing the the kind of the the emoji lord yeah
you have upset the emoji lord they get to do some of the uh maintenance work of a discord server
which takes the load off of me and steven and you so that we don't have to do that right and I
really appreciate David if you're listening I really appreciate your work in this and doing this
uh but anyways they had Wes too helps the what Wes helps too as Wes is now also channel boffin
he wasn't at the time that this happened okay uh at the time David was the only channel boffin and
we just like what they actually call it channel boffin that's the name that's amazing yeah
and um so uh the this person thought that uh David was like the owner of the discord or something
and they had a personal falling out with David and left because of that because like
I I don't like this person it's their discord I'm out of here yeah and in my opinion that's like
if you have to be friends with a discord owner that's like there's a lot of people on my discord
or not my discord god I'm sorry our discord it doesn't matter yeah there's a lot of people
comment it's our it's everyone's discord on the basing conspiracy discord there's a bunch of people
who I uh I think my line was they have weird alien values that are different from my own and I don't
know um they're not people that normally I would strike up a friendship with but I don't have to
be friends with everyone on the discord right can I can just coexist on the discord can I finish
my thought yeah it was I just wanted to point out um that there is actually at like clinically
proven uh there's a range of people's tolerability for social uh distress there's they call them like
very sensitive people vsps they exist as a discrete group um there's also add in particular
has this but a lot of non-neurotypical uh neurotypes have much more uh rejection sensitivity
which just means you are more likely to interpret things as social rejection and
get really upset about it and it's important to know that people have they do have different
levels of skin thickness but it's just genetic I mean like using scare quotes with skin thickness
I'm talking about emotional skin thickness some people are genetically born with thinner
skins than others and it's just like it's important to know that yeah some people
are going to get really uh they're going to take things really personally and
I think it's perfectly within that person's like rights to have just decided this is personally
upsetting enough for me that I feel the need to leave oh yeah totally everyone has the right
text at any time like I think I don't even know how much this is I think having a thick skin can
be a learned skill but for example um one of my partners is borderline and we're working on trying
to thicken their proverbial emotional skin with exposure therapy and it's hard it it hurts
it's like it's not something that I would say oh it's easy to like you know just just grow a
thicker skin is actually like pretty insensitive thing to tell us it's almost as hard as literally
growing a thicker skin yeah um it's like go go cure your like genetic mental illness right right
it's easy it's not I mean part of that is like you know we shouldn't make every community that we
are a part of or that we make ourselves like have to curtail to the most delicate of the entire
population right I think there's an importance just to acknowledge that people like that are out
there and know how to interact with them I completely agree with what I think you're saying
which is we don't need to go the social justice route of making everything accessible and safe
yeah and I think you know maybe the difference in how this play out in in uh in the community would
be more like if someone says all right you know what this isn't the place I thought it wasn't
getting out when they leave they you know instead of people saying man what a pussy they say um
no one said that well not in so many words no no one said that at all okay uh well so good
it sounded like Steven was just kind of exaggerating the thing that people said yeah so like like
grow a thicker skin could be exaggerated too man what a pussy that that's sort of what I meant
okay I'm sorry it came off that way I didn't mean it that way no no you I don't think I don't
think it was even your thing that I was thinking of um well because the only thing I remember seeing
was people saying man that sucks maybe we should like look at who we are as people and make make
things you know yeah that was actually a really like uh I like the fact that that was the response
yeah like the person who said that I think makes me like the community is a thicker skin was me
because I don't know what to do when someone is like I have a personal you know gripe with
someone I think is in power and therefore I'm gonna leave and I let them leave yeah I'm honestly
forgetting almost every detail here because this happened almost two weeks ago and I didn't see the
whole thing oh that was no this was uh way longer before that oh okay then yeah then I then I certainly
have no idea um about the specifics of all of this then like I guess um and this was actually
shameless plug for the other podcast I do called we want more the last episode or the one that
came out two days ago uh upon the airing of this episode uh has Inyash Brotsky on as our guest
and we we talk about this with Brian about uh it was funny because Brian pointed out exactly he's
like you know it's funny is if I was reading these words I would feel like you're being an asshole
but because it's you and I could see your face I don't feel like you're being an asshole and that's
that's part of the the challenge of of online discourse and as a whole I think that's what
you were getting at a minute ago yeah that like it's so much easier to a read in more negativity
and be maybe even be more negative online than you are in real life because you're not interacting
with a person you're interacting with letters yeah and I want to focus not on the situation that
happened on our specific discordant specific people because first of all I don't think that's
that big a thing in the grand scheme of things same here small kerfuffle it was more the thing that
like caused our attention to turn to this issue yeah and also um saying it's two separate people
said uh when people started saying you know I think maybe we should be nicer I feel personally
called out by this and I don't want those people to feel personally called out by this partly because
I like those people and I don't want them to be uncomfortable but also because again I don't think
it's a this is not a personal calling out coming to Jesus moment for any any individual person that
we're airing public laundry now to try to shame them everything it is nothing like that so I want
to move very far away from specifics like that and just to general like how to do internetting and
text communications better as a people because this is more and more of our lives especially as
we're locked up inside and and it's uh there's ways to be more cordial online there's also ways to
uh do you want to go ahead uh Stephen oh I was just gonna say that that's what I've been trying
to gear it at the whole time like because it's not just like our our discord I don't really I mean
I care about it I like that it's there but this is this is a general phenomena yes and it's general
community stuff yeah and but it's it's observable across anything that involves people not talking
face to face and so you know what I meant more specifically like the rationalist community kind
of is at the point where it's going to be what we make it it's still in its infancy and especially
the Denver rationalist community like we can choose the norms like we can choose what founder
effects we want to have like you know filter down to the descendants of our community here well I
think one of those founder effects that we should try to introduce is the concept of charity not in
terms of giving money to things but in terms of not just that's a good one I mean yeah okay but uh
the more important one is the one where when you read what people say you always try to interpret
it in the way that is uh the least aggressive and the least mean as possible from that person
even if you suspect that may be giving them too much credit because uh generally generally people
overcompensate especially um online towards this person is attacking me and I don't know why that
is but I think it's wonderful practice to at any point in time you're reading something that maybe
angers you a little bit is to look at it like you know what if someone was saying that line with a
smile on their face like is it possible that this is some kind of jokey thing or just trying to point
something out in a uh light-hearted manner that uh rather than a you know you suck I hate you manner
more than like ah isn't this kind of silly we can joke about this kind of thing yeah um the reason
that that does tend to happen online is negativity bias first of all humans tend tend to focus on
negatives especially when social interactions social distress is involved it's like social
distress in your community is very hard to ignore um again I recently went through like a couple a
different community that I'm involved in went through um a weird stressful thing um and they
were there was a bunch of like did social discord in not the it was on the discord but there was
discord on the discord uh and I was like at the time trying to work and trying to I had already
planned some like social obligation I was like I can't pay attention to this right now I couldn't
not pay attention to it I was just like oh my god I need to know what's happening I needed it was
horrible um and then there's the catastrophization um of if you don't know if you don't know like
okay you hear something terrible happened and your brain immediately jumps to something probably
much more terrible than what actually happened but um man there's something else I was gonna say uh
wow there goes that thought I'll it'll come back um yeah I think that the the perceived negativity
online like I mean I don't know exactly how to combat it like part of it if you if you assume
that somebody's being nicer than your initial assumption like so if you check that and say
okay maybe they're meaning this nicely um like I have a technique for doing that and this has
actually been I think basically since texting started being a thing which is like okay if I
read that and with people that I knew and like if I read that and it makes me like upset I'm going
to assume that I misunderstood it or that they misconvaded and like in in my life it's easy as
saying wait did you mean this and like whatever the hurtful thing or something like oh hell no no I
meant it like this it's like oh yeah see that makes much more sense and so that sounds doable um you
know if someone says yeah I meant it the mean way you dumbass then like then then at least you've
got your answer then you send them back an emoji of like a middle finger right and you're like we'll
get out of my life then yeah so part of what I do is I I generally avoid sarcasm when I'm talking
online unless I'm making it very clear unless you follow everything with the winky emoji yeah or I
mean I even use that non-sarcastically so like I use that's the only thing I do is I use emojis
heavily yeah um like I throw in a heart emoji throw in like a thumbs up or a smiley like whatever
it is then it's like they can at least um like unless they're reading sarcasm into everything
then they can say okay that's the emotion he was meaning when he typed that so I was laughing
about emojis earlier but actually I think that we should we as a society especially the business
world and like the politics what showed norm the use of emojis maybe we can make ones that are less
silly so people will feel less dumb using them but the thing is we as humans get the majority of our
like contextual clues about what people mean by body language facial expression and tone of voice
and when you cut that all out you lose a lot of information I think we've
I know I'm going to get shit for this because I'm using uh evo psych here but I think that
there has been a lot of evolutionary pressure on humans to uh when there is or maybe cultural
evolution or as opposed to biological evolution because this is more of a cultural thing to um
to when there is a social conflict there's ways to diffuse the tension around them and to help
people get through the conflict without strangling each other and we have things like you know
nervousness in general uh showing that hey I'm not here trying to flex on you I'm kind of nervous
bringing this up and uh joking and like you said tone of voice right even smiling at people and
being like ha ha you know here's this thing and like most of the time when people laugh especially
in in more fraught situations it has nothing to do with humor at all like if you were to go back
and read that's what humor is uh laughter is a way of diffusing tension it is yeah it's one of the
uses of it one of the big ones and so there are all these things that we use both to signal that
we are not here trying to string each other uh that just don't translate you can't put them online
really and so when you read something that someone says you aren't getting all those cues from them
instead all you're seeing is the words that are not couched with all all this armor and it's like
oh shit I'm being attacked fuck this guy and and I think that's a huge issue which is why we
