need to really overcompensate in the other direction that you know start taking this
shirtably that was my thought there okay it's back um I have some strategies that I personally use
such as uh tit for two tats uh from game theory basically uh and some of these are just like
kind of um interventions if I notice I'm really upset about something I like having a basic
role that I come back to so one is a tit for two tats um somebody can screw up twice and I will
forgive them twice because it was probably a misunderstanding um and I also you know I'll
point it out like oh it was really hurtful when you said that I was stupid for having that idea
I don't mind if you said the idea was stupid but like calling me a stupid person I think was kind
of mean and they're like oh okay and like maybe do it again if they do it a third time then I'm like
then I'm gonna get mad but the first two times I'm going to explain why that upset me and then
say be like but I figure you probably didn't mean to do that is that like we're still friends
then we might start having a problem after the third time um tit for two tats by the way just is a
strategy that tends to win when you uh it depends on the different models different
social situations for example they'll use game theory to simulate wars or to simulate
negotiations and so forth and so on but cross the board tit for two tats tends to be one of the
ones that wins in the end I'll post a link to there's a visual explanation of this uh
made by somebody who likes to animate ideas uh cool person cool video helps really uh
explain some game theory concepts in the form of cute cartoons and fun little interactive flash
games um I think one of the most important concepts behind charity is the idea that your
interlocutor is first of all not stupid they are trying to be legible to you and this is a project
both of you are working on together to be you know legible to each other and figure out what
meaning is being sent across and also that they are um just just try to assume people are being
misunderstood as much as possible rather than being actively aggressive yeah I like the thought of
steelmaning people but steelman the thing that they say like make try to if you see something
and you're reading it as like say the word I will take you and you notice you're noticing like oh that
sounds angry that sounds like they're resentful of me be like okay I'm gonna again I'm gonna think
of the steelman version of that which is I will take you like I will I'm saying right now that uh
this is something that's important to me and I'll do it read it try reading it that way um
there's a CBT there's a CBT skill of reframing if you use a reframing like this regularly enough
you'll start to do it automatically um I still haven't perfected it I still go back into my pit
of anxiety sometimes and we'll read messages from friends it's like oh no they hate me I've
messed up the relationship they think I'm dumb in a night but like much less than I used to um
I think another thing a second skill that you can do which is um probably more palatable to
some people than this charitable thing because you can only be charitable for so long is uh
just asking like you if you took someone if you read something and it seems to be aggressive
be like that seems a bit aggressive did is this what you meant by it like just just ask is is this
what you meant because I'm getting tones that I don't like there's simple tools like I did for
two tats or the uh the charitable principle whatever there's more complicated tools that are
very effective again partner of a borderline person here we go uh there's Gottman Rappapur
the Gottman Rappapur intervention uh is I think it was developed for marital counseling but it's a
really good um format for two people to resolve a discussion one of the things is one person
takes the role of speaker and one of listener and the the person who's speaker has to completely
finish their thought or like explain the reason that they're upset before the listener is allowed
to interject anything except clarifying questions or things like oh I see or oh I get it or like oh
how did that feel that sounds horrible aside from the most formal settings it is it's bad but like
it works it works so well well I the thing is you I'm usually not trying to negotiate a marriage
with people online no but I mean it works it could work for two best friends having a fight about
whether batman or spider-man is better oh we talked about this a couple episodes ago
actually and you laid that out okay so yeah you know that one there's also um the rationalist
version which is uh double crooks and it's it's basically very similar both of them you're encouraged
to use i statements you say when this when this thing happened I felt like this um when you said
this I it made me feel like diminished um and I would prefer in the future if this and so first
of all you're taking responsibility for your own emotions is that cruxing no that I'm talking about
gotman rap or but uh sorry yeah and in both of them though what you're trying to do is um I think
the goal to both cruxing and gotman rap or is to get to the point where you understand the person's
argument well enough that sort of the same thing is still meaning you could describe that their
argument in a way that they would kind of nod and go oh yeah no that's what I meant actually
that that was phrased better than what like than I had put it I don't yeah I don't even think that
people need to go that far that's why I said this is an intense tool yeah if you have a really bad
disagreement yes that you need to resolve use one of these but in general causal conversation is
being like did I hear you right when you said this nonviolent communication uh is another good
tactic in general that's where I get i statements from yeah I the rap of horror rules makes me think
of this uh den den article where he lays out it's it's less stringent than like the metal
counseling one counseling one but the the short version is like you should be able to restate
your opponent this is more for like intellectual disagreements which sounds a little more applicable
and it was like you should be able to restate your opponent's position in terms that make them say
man I wish I thought to put it that way that's right that was what I was thinking of actually
yeah and I um it's uh and you might have said that sorry I was making a note to include that
Dennett link in the in the show notes no I'm glad that you um explained where it came from
because I was like somebody at some point said it like this and then I said it wrong so oh no
you're good clarifying um what was funny about that is when uh Sam Harris and Dan Dennett had
their like spat about free will back and forth on the internet um Harris wrote back he's like I feel
like your your your beloved rapper for his rules failed you because the most charitable thing you
could say about my book is that at least it exists to show everyone how wrong it is and it's like
and what's great about that is because Dennett is like in my perception of him from watching his
talks he's a very he's a fairly like warm and fuzzy dude and so that does sound uncharacteristically
harsh of him and so that you know when when they had I think two two podcast episodes on this they
were super chill about it and there was none of this like oh yeah no I'm glad that that your
bullshit's out there to show everyone how dumb dumb this is that nothing like that came out during a
conversation it's just so easy for that to happen on again on two people who are on very friendly
terms about a subject that neither of them really have like any skin in the game on really right
like other than their own uh it's an intellectual disagreement it's not like I don't know somebody
criticizing your religion or like saying that your wife is dumb or something exactly yeah so like
over something this this esoteric it's kind of abstract it was able to get charged enough between
two guys that are on decent terms and are professional adults and professionals yeah with
like degrees and I found it really funny sorry I love watching like people get salty totally
and then you can watch them be unsalty when they're talking yeah I mean I for what it's worth the
like and this is more specific but well and you can do this we do this all the time at work too
you know and it's rarely to solve like a a saltiness disagreement more to resolve a confusion
disagreement um or confusion altercation uh text or voice chat is an option on a lot of platforms
and there are voice channels they can jump into on on our discord there's one I use all the time
at work on our and what that's what's better about slack is it's easy to call people um I like slack
more than discord but yeah it's like it's good and there's there's definitely there's definitely perks
to discord that slack doesn't have but uh the like hey you know what we're not getting anywhere
let's jump on a chat and then a five minute chat solves a 30 minute text exchange yeah that can
happen and just then that way it's somewhat easier to lay out where you're coming from and like yes
this is why this this is this I'm thinking of work stuff rather than than life stuff
and it's like oh okay see I thought you were saying this this and this and it's like ah see
that's why we were talking circles past each other now yeah now I've solved that I think really
frequently people have what seem like disagreements that are really just misunderstanding what the
other person's trying to say or what they're upset about and I do think the responsibilities kind of
like on both sides it's the person listening has to also know that they switch and um got been
wrapped up or okay you switch roles okay no well I've just meant like the person who is who feels
like they're being offended can also there's a lot of cultures uh across the US and a whole bunch of
them are you know in any online gathering because you know you can log in from anywhere in the US
there's places on the US where one of the most loving things you can do is you know give people
a ribbing call them a dumbass you know like aye a dumbass and the these sorts of cultures where
you show affection by being a bit abrasive at each other because you wouldn't do that with
strangers to exist and sometimes just think you know maybe the person who's talking with me is
just from one of those cultures where being a little bit aggressive is a sign that we are on
good terms with each other I yeah I was actually going to say uh we don't have to pussyfoot around
and put on airs and pretend to be these you know polite little um aristocrats we can just be real
with each other yeah um I was going to say actually we weren't trying to name names but
I know that one of the people who was involved in this thing and who is more on the abrasive
and like is absolutely doing that uh I've been around this person and their friend group and they
like kind of punch each other in the shoulder be like man you dumbass what how do you how could
you possibly think that Iron Man's better than Spider-Man like you offend me with this opinion
everybody is doing this and they're all doing it with a tone of voice that
that you lose on discord but like it's not like you know are you fucking idiot how could you
possibly think that it's it's like lol you know like ribbing elbow poke uh and then like and you're
supposed to go like to use you're supposed to drop into that same persona and and fight back
but in a like it's a joking like I don't know imagine like the the thing bros do where they
punch each other and they're like man bro and like yeah basically it's not supposed to be actually
like aggressive a lot of the time it's supposed to be that that sort of cultural thing you're
talking about in ash where where you're showing respect for another person by being like I know
you can like roll with this well and I think that's the general phenomenon of like counter signalling
which you can do all it in in this context where like um if I called you know if you had some
idea you know and I was like oh yeah good one dumbass like you know I'm joking and you laugh
because I said it right yeah if you proposed it to a a colleague at work who we've shared three
sentences with and they said that you'd be like the fuck and like a good example uh anecdote for
my life that doesn't come from the internet was um my uncle doesn't have a right arm from the elbow
down it got wrecked in a in a train accident thing um so he's got like a one of those thing
contraptions where like you flex your shoulders and opens up the hook and other bands close the hook
and he was over for Thanksgiving and I could see him like holding his plate and trying to do stuff
and I was like need a hand and I kind of like not doing my elbow yeah and that then that's a joke
right disabled people joke about their disabilities so much and they're so hilarious and the reason
they do it first of all is kind of a as a community of disabled people it'd be like I don't know
two blind people being like do you see what I'm saying I I haven't seen anything in eight years
I'm like laugh and then like all of their non-disabled friends hanging out with them get so uncomfortable
right and I guess what I was getting at though is that I could make that joke with my uncle I
wouldn't make that joke with like somebody at the supermarket who I saw struggling to load their
cart or something right yeah I'd be like can I you know can I give you some help or something I
don't know what I how I'd phrase it without using the word hand but whatever um like so and then
the person will be like oh yeah I don't you as you can see I'm missing one you got two I'll take
I'll take one they may they may well I this is a maybe not the the perfect example but you see
what I'm getting at like there's there's a level that they might react that way or if they might
react with kind of like I'm fine I can do this myself God I hate when people just like there's
an acknowledgement that we don't have to wear these uh polite masks because we know each other
yeah and even like the level beyond that like it's okay like we can make these kind of abrasive
jokes because we have rapport yeah um like the rapport and then you also understand what they mean
um something that was really there's a while where I thought that there's a hard and fast
rule like don't make rape jokes um but then I realized that sometimes for example like
two women who maybe have a backstory of both having been raped or have having like experienced
something in their lives that it's actually like going out to a bar and then occasionally like
make it oh man like that sounds kind of rape culture or like I don't know like saying the same
joke that would have been fucked up coming from somebody else but like the joke is like I don't
know you do a peter griffin voice from family guy and you say like a woman can't drive or something
like that and like the joke is that you're making fun of the people who say that sort of thing but
the thing is if you if if these two people who you didn't know had these background experiences
like they they I don't know if you as a bystander came by and sat down next to them at the bar
and were listening and tried to also just start making rape jokes because you're like oh oh these
two women are making rape jokes awesome yeah I would not fly yeah there's there's very much like
knowing a person knowing the context like it's a it's a bit of a balance because I I don't want to
be in a server that's all just cynicism and people being like no that would never work then you know
like the the the quarrel type of cynicism where you can't argue with it because it certainly
seems to be true based on the world but on the other hand just makes things terrible and gloomy
all the time but I also don't want to be in a community where everyone is constantly pussy
footing around walking on eggshells to make sure no one is ever offended by anything and I've been
oh won't you think of the children you know like I would like something in between that I've been
in a dystopian community um on it was a Facebook group it was it might still be around if you
want to look for it it was called um polyamorous atheist or something like that uh it got taken
over by social justice to the point where there was this message that you had to read before
you were allowed to enter that was like it was paragraphs and paragraphs talking about systemic
oppression oh god talking about the fact that oh yeah um the word polyamorous people use the word
poly shorthand generally and this you were supposed to use poly-a for polyamorous because
poly some people use that for polynesian and they used it first um that you were not allowed to use
any ableist language whatsoever uh including the word stupid and dumb uh because that that that's
making fun of people with intellectual disabilities um I like how you describe this culture as dystopian
this is no absolutely it gets worse I don't know if we have to I'm already getting annoyed hearing
about it but if you want to if it if the annoyance helps illustrate your points please continue yeah I
mean just I'm not saying stop I'm just saying I feel I feel it already yeah so the ableism uh got
to the point where we need to make this uh we need to also keep in mind people who have like lower
socioeconomic um or like maybe they I don't know depending on what device they're looking at they
might not be able to see pictures so you're not allowed to post a picture unless you post a caption
describing what the picture is oh god okay see and this is you're not allowed to post an emoji
without describing winky face if it's a text-to-speech thing it says it already yeah I know I'm just
saying that they went like so above and and the thing was that the then the moderators were so
draconian that sometimes a new person would join like I saw this somebody's like I'm hi um I'm new
here and uh you know I'm having a really big problem uh and I was really hoping that I could
talk to somebody about like my relationship because right now it's leaving me really depressed and then
like posts an emoji and then three mods will descend upon this person being like you messed up in
these particular ways you didn't you didn't tag your emoji like I don't know uh say I'm having
a really stupid problem like you use the word stupid like I will see people like that join
immediately leave I think and like the people who sometimes uh I think it's been mentioned um
someone said like I have a right to be an asshole I don't think when people make that claim they
aren't saying I want you know to be a troll and make the things terrible what they're saying is
I do not want to turn into that sort of a dystopian hellscape of politeness and I've seen this happen
before and so I reserve the right to not participate in that sort of thing you know I think there's a
happy medium to be struck though where yeah so I can see both both sides I think you have a right
to be an asshole like if you're if you're jokingly being an asshole also just insert some linky
