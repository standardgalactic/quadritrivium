of of plant life on earth and how we got from thinking about the fact that this tree will be
here when my grandkills and are dead yeah yeah it all the advanced knowledge I think makes things
even more beautiful and more filling me with awe and wonder than if I hadn't had that knowledge
absolutely I don't know so Keith's as full as shit is what we're saying fuck that guy
delir my other sales pitch for this book is glad he died young I think many people's exposure to
Richard Dawkins is him like angrily ranting at anti evolutionists or twitter um like anti
evolutionists or anti scientists or religious people or whatever um and so like the god delusion
I think was the first book I read by him and it's a very like uh annoyed tone doesn't make it annoying
to read it was very fun to read but unmoving the rainbow is just pure passion yeah like it's full
of his like it's full of this I love when he evangelizes about science because I love just
watching somebody love something so much yeah he's got the same sort of passion and and uh poetry
the poetic way to illustrate that passion that like Carl Sagan had yeah and it's it's contagious
even in his writing for some reason I like that there was a passage that stuck in my head I forget
what book it was from might have been god delusion I think it was in a different one but anyway uh
he's like Richard Dawkins is writing about the Pleistocene era and like some a fossil and then
suddenly he just like is he just breaks into poetry and starts writing a poem about like
oh poor Pleistocene mother wailing as like her child is being taken away by a hawk oh yeah the uh
the ton child who they found its skeleton and its eyes had characteristic claw marks of an eagle
and so like Richard Dawkins just writes a poem about this yeah and was it any good this poem
I thought it was good it was just a few lines but it was yeah it was memorable but it's just the
idea that you know he's moved to think about it poor ton mother weeping in the savannah or
something like that like yeah it was it was just you know all things like that it's clear that this
is from an interested place rather than like a let me smash the keyboard angrily griping at these
people on the internet who are wrong kind of vibe which again I'm not shooting on it I think that can
be uh fun to read too but I really wish we didn't have a third post now because that is a perfect
segue into our main topic well we'll bring to the third post real fast okay yeah the third post
honestly is so uh short and fast that I have almost can we summarize it to lull emergence
yeah yeah so the third post is the futility of emergence and the two quotes I pulled from it
are emergence has become very popular just as saying magic used to be very popular
and its usage fits all the checklist items that we just read not just read but that we earlier read
for a mysterious answer to a mysterious question uh that's all I pulled from it I would this one
really funny I just want to like kind of say some of the best lines from it for example
take literally that description taken literally that description fits every phenomenon in our
universe above the level of individual quarks which is part of the problem imagine pointing to a
market crash and saying it's not a quark does that feel like an explanation no then neither should
say it's a it's an emergent phenomenon I I find this post very interesting because at the time
that it was posted uh saying things are emergent properties or emergent systems was in fact very
popular oh my god it was like a meme all the time yeah it was like oh my god look at the emergent
properties of this embryo turning into a look at the emergent properties of the brain creating
consciousness and this is an emergent problem I was like stuffy like that word stop it and now
that isn't done anymore right uh I haven't seen it very much I haven't seen it at all I think for
a number of years I've seen it used and I've seen it used in ways that I don't protest because for
example Eliezer writes it's the noun emergence that I protest rather than the verb emerges from
yeah yeah and so I've seen that I've seen the word emergent used but then the then it goes on
to explain what it emerges from so I was like oh okay I'm not pissed off by this word anymore
because it's not being used this is my is a semantic stop sign anymore yeah or as a mysterious
answer or yeah yeah how how much do you think like this sort of thing could be attributed to uh
Eliezer and his circle of you know people that we're all talking about this sort of stuff
I don't know I also wonder that about um people started really focusing on um skewed data in
science like replication crisis that was it and it was right after the rationality community
was bitching about people not replicating studies yeah a lot yeah and I was like that's weird timing
but uh yeah who knows I mean a lot of people so like I mean obviously he's always been kind of on
the the leading edge of this intellectual field right he talks with other people in that area
and he's probably not the only one who's making these sort of observations I'm just I always wondered
like how much of it is direct influence of this stuff and how much is it like talking to other
people and also knowing what's going on I wonder if someone in the Berkeley community might know
these things oh there's gotta be some kind of lorekeeper if I had to guess I would say
that this was probably one voice in a chorus of people complaining about the use of the word
emergence and that it added to the noise that finally shut it down it's interesting I think
the fact that he doesn't have any sort of degree makes things uh popularly not be attributed to him
like for example I saw the paperclip maximizer a couple years ago attributed to Nick Bostrom
and uh while like Nick and Eliezer were on the same forums and talking about these sorts of things
and he you know says specifically yes this originated on the SL4 forums it could have been Nick
it could have been any one of us I think it was basically him that came up with the paperclip
maximizer as a literal uh concept when he was on like with paperclips when he was on
Sam Harris's podcast uh Harris brings up the paperclip maximizer and he's like now I think
that was Bostrom and he's like uh as far as I know it was me but like it because you know it
wasn't archived there's no way to to demonstrate but he's like I think I remember that was that
might have been me right um and that's the weird thing like people are like okay which one of
these people in this circle is the Oxford professor Nick Bostrom okay we're attributing it to him
because if we you know it makes the quote seem more prestigious if you can put after it Nick
Bostrom University professor at Harvard right or at Oxford or whatever it is like people are more
likely to believe the quote just by seeing the name after it I don't think that's too bad over
heuristic I don't know I don't think it's a bad heuristic at all but I also think it's unfortunate
that people will misattribute things to other people that have higher credentials yeah in this
case at least there's like some plausible explanation for the fact that it's not like no look my book
came out two years before yours and it's like no we we we actually can't prove it and I don't he
he said that he thinks it's him he and maybe he just doesn't want to like stand up and take
credit too loud because you can't prove it yeah no have you Eliezer wants to stand up and take
credit for things well like maybe not at the expense of I this was just a read um inadequate
equilibrium that part of that book is very much about bragging about things yeah I think that
in this particular case maybe it was just because like there's no way to prove it and it doesn't
like I think and I'm putting my I'm gonna google it right now who invented the concept of the
paperclip maximizer well I mean uh whatever Google says it was somewhere in one of those
chains probably yeah my my guess my guess for a thought experiment described by Swedish philosopher
Nick Bostrom in 2003 in instrumental convergence so huh yeah my my I was only making that the
my guess on like specifically not wanting to do real Harris's show and also not wanting to say
you know no no forget Boston was me who did it right and like when there's when there's no way
to prove that it was him and it's like what's the point the the real the really important
thing is that this idea is out there and it it gains traction in outside of FAI community
friendly artificial intelligence research communities right yeah so like it's it's
this one's less about like no no it's me I want the points and it's more it's like
I'm glad people have this idea in their head you don't want to start all the stupid controversy
when what you're really here for is saving the world from AI right I also think there might be
an argument to be made that Bostrom coined it and Eleazar popularized it I think if anything
would be the opposite because Bostrom is the one that has a book where he explains it whereas Eleazar
and him were just you know chatting on the SL4 forums when the supposedly was originally first
going oh interesting but interesting but ultimately uh maybe we should get back to right the podcast
topic yes so our posts for next not week next fortnight are going to be positive bias look
into the dark and say not complexity I love all of these I think this is the sequence I read the
most yeah this is like the big I don't know important chunk of sequence that I also tend to
direct people to if I'm trying to you know give them somewhere to start and I forget it's very
intimidating if it's like oh I'm interested in this rational stuff where do I start and it's like
here read this Bible of rationality instead you read this book of rationality and I forget if
it's part of the map and territory sequence or if it's its own thing that are mysterious answers
to mysterious questions um but in any case yeah great stuff I'm looking forward to these next posts
too and you know in on a meta level I'm glad where we like where we began including these sections
it's a good excuse to go back through these and they're fun yeah yeah I agree uh so for our main
topic so we have a discord and there's chat that goes on on the discord sometimes and uh like any
you know public place there's varying um people want different norms uh to you know match their
own personal styles because everyone's more comfortable with their own style and mainly what
it was was that some people were saying that it seems that there is too much like confrontationalism
and not enough uh niceness and I don't know there wasn't like one big thing that happened there were
a couple people that left uh and at least one of those cases I was just like wow did someone
need to just have a slightly thicker skin here uh but you know that person was still a he was a
cool person and I I okay both these people that left were cool people and I really like them and
I miss having them in the community but it's okay as a brief sidetrack I as you guys are probably
very aware have been having this long lifelong battle with depression kind of thing as as many
rationalists do um and one of the things I do to combat that specifically is to seek out uh joyous
positive things uh and indulge in them like Steven universe for example is one of my you
unweave a bunch of rainbows the what I said you go and you unweave a bunch of rainbows every rainbow
I find I tear to shreds but no I I specifically seek out wholesome awesome happy things uh because
that helps me uh to be more of a normal person and it affects people around you really positively
too it's like it's it's a good life hack to just be the kind of person you want to see in the world
and then you'll attract the kind of people that you want to be around and like their lives better
yeah and I just think in general you can do the opposite I right I would like to have in general
in the rationalist community a norm of anti-synicism and of uh just being jollier
like Christmas is my favorite holiday for a reason and I think it's uh that's basically kind of what
I want to talk about uh today like how to um be more charitable and uh friendly online
I have a lot of thoughts so many thoughts me too can I jump in with one quick one
oh you you may and then I want to jump in with one quick one after you totally or you take as much
time as you want but I would just I remembered when there was a discussion the one we mentioned
where people left and uh somebody was like well people just need thicker skin or something I was
gonna also talk about this and I and I really disagree with that sentiment and I had this
image of like you shouldn't have to like be jumped into the to the rationality community
we're like jumping in in the gang sense of we're like all right we're gonna all kick the
shit out of you for a minute and then you're in the club like you shouldn't need uh and you know
there's a difference between like in a uh pejorative colloquial sense of being a snowflake that can't
handle anything and you need to you know keep everything safe I'm using quotes on all of those
I think that there's value there's a valuable uh conversation to have there but like I'm saying
there doesn't need to be like a safe space for everybody in that you know there can't be challenging
ideas that's different but it shouldn't be a place where it's like oh no I get to call you a dick or
an asshole or a piece of shit that because I disagree with you like no there doesn't need to be
like literal name calling and it like I said the idea that you should need thick skin to enter the
community I think what you need is a there's difference in skin thickness and mind thickness
maybe that's I'm torturing the analogy but the idea that like what I would say is um that I've
never mind you're still go ahead okay um let me see if this sounds right I think um rather than
thick skin is what you need to join the community is the ability to be ready to be wrong um or be
open to ideas like don't yell at somebody for suggesting something like oh that's stupid
just be like I think that's wrong for these reasons but like I'm open to being wrong too what do you
think uh maybe just not personalizing stuff like that yeah I I I agree but also being willing to be
critiqued but not like and not take that personally right and so that that was what I was trying to
just differentiate with my bad analogy of mind thickness like you can't uh if if being uh thin
skinned means that like no I can't have my ideas challenged and obviously this isn't the community
for you I would say yeah but that's not what anybody comes in looking for to my understanding
not people that've joined the discord anyway the people who came and left came and left because
they thought it would be like oh cool this can be a collaborative space where people have uh you
know this uh an interesting uh take on something or a project they're working on and they positively
collaborate to make their I want that community I want that too and uh if I'm allowed to plug
another discord I although I don't have a link so I'll have to find a way to get this out there
I'll find out if you can get it to them I can't but I'm not sure if they want it public or not
there is one called University of Bays that is essentially that thing where there's different
channels for different things if you're if you've got a side project like hey I've got this you know
you're you jokingly perhaps jokingly perhaps not had the idea of making a an absent distillery
deadass so if you if you want a place for advice and you know if you post it to the wrong place
it'd be like that's a stupid idea that's you know business will never get off the ground
why do I waste your time there's already absent out there that's not the answer you're looking for
you want to know how do I do this how do I get small business going and so if or or if it is a
bad idea I want somebody to say not you're an idiot but that idea is not a good idea for these
reasons right and so there's it's part of presentation um and I'm not saying that you have to
like there's also the failure mode of that where it's like oh so now I need to couch everything I
say in this two paragraphs on either side of like you're great I like let me list all my triggers
like or all the triggers that are possibly like part of this idea first and then caveat it again
and again right and then the person responding before like if what you really want to hear is
like is this a good idea they shouldn't have to give like two paragraphs disclaimer at the top
of like you're a great person your idea is generally good but I think this idea's weaknesses for this
and this it would be nice to just get a no and here's why and so like directness is fine it's
hard to differentiate the difference between like being direct and being way blunter than necessary
it is really hard to read tone I recently um had a conflict between some friends uh that was just
because they were texting to each other and both of them had a paranoia that one was talking down
to the other or that one was kind of I don't know like they were they had these assumptions coming
into this discussion that like oh this person doesn't really want to do this with me they just
they're they just um are suggesting they they're saying they want to do it because they're doing
it out of pity and this this person isn't doesn't even really want to do this they're just I don't
know it was like they both had these preconceptions coming in and then they were just able to
interpret every sentence that was exchanged and this it was on discord as oh well that they said
I will take you doesn't that sound kind of aggressive it sounds like they're mad and they're like no I
think they're saying I will take you you absolutely have to link that key and peel sketch I already
put it my notes to send you excellent I think we put this in before but well without even talking
about I'll just there's a three minute youtube video key and peel comedy sketch that's totally
worth watching and hits this point right on the head but like it hits it the absurd and that's
why it's funny but like in the real I'm wondering I guess how to cultivate that norm especially
in a in a way where it's like you know I have suggestions I'm trying to keep this like general
so it's not me complaining about the discord that like we started um but like that's also the one
I'm thinking about the most like I also don't want to spend 10 hours a week talking with you guys
about how to moderate stuff um because I don't want to do that frankly I won't I was like the
whole thing before I spend an hour a week moderating it I have suggestions one of those
suggestions involves letting other people volunteer to be mods yes but with the agreement that like
all of the conspirators or and the people that are most active maybe on the discord who want to be
the mods can kind of get together to talk about what we think the norm should be what things should
