is well calibrated to like reward you when you're
getting bored and to keep you into it and it totally
does and so she was watching
like how does this keep people that engaged people
died playing I'm like here watch for two minutes
and see what happens and so like there's a
there's a brief fight with whatever mob
monsters that you struggle a little bit in
and then there's ones that you struggle a lot in
and almost don't make it and then you hit like a double
XP shrine every three minutes or whatever
and so there's incentives every few seconds
well not few seconds whatever almost perfect amount
of seconds to keep you super engaged and
that could be refined to the point where
yeah it's way more fun to play this game than it is
to do literally anything else oh yeah have you ever
played these damn phone freemium games
yeah a little bit yeah yeah
I tend to also be super stingy so those
don't suck me in but I didn't know people that have been sucked in
yeah the same I mean yeah I don't mind
putting in the five I play clash of clans
I'm playing like since launch yeah so
I haven't put in any I think I put in money
around the month that it launched because I found
at work was doing it but it was 20 bucks
one time for the I don't know
shameful amount of hours I put into this game so
I feel like I I probably did that down pretty well
but yeah that in fact I was just
I heard on the way here I listened to a podcast I think
clash of clans made three billion dollars last year
yeah so yeah just through the little
microtransactions you know hey just for a buck
you can get this cool little deal well I guess
what I was getting at is that people are getting dangerous to close to optimizing
that fun game where I hope
an AI would do it non-malicious well
it's not even have to be maliciously we're all going to live
an equestrian line I mean
doesn't sound like the worst outcome right
if it is as fun as it looked so
I think we linked to that before right that
was in that was friendship is optimal yeah
preferably the AI makes the game actually
fun and not just addictive
yes and I think
it did I can't remember it's too many
specifics in equestria yeah and I read
two different versions of that story too
wait what yeah there was one from the perspective
of
like a bunch of people including the
author of the game and like the one who coded
the AI and stuff yeah and there's one from
the perspective of I think an individual player
huh are they both by the same author
they were written stylistically
similarly all I guess I'll have to
make sure that they were in fact two different
things I could have sworn they were
I'll try and find that okay
all right let's jump on
all righty now without incident says in terms of
having kids it seems like going back to previous
episodes Steven and Inyash had agreed
that a potential human life being realized
is a net positive perhaps with some caveats
I was surprised that sort of reasoning
wasn't discussed at all with the focus
being entirely on the motivations of the parent
being good or bad yeah I mean all else
being equal I do feel like more people is
better because then you just get more happiness
as long as you're not you know making the world
worse by doing it which is sort of implicit
in or I guess explicit and all else being
equal then yeah but I think
there's something to be considered like
if I had a kid I feel like it would impact
my happiness adversely and so while
the net positive gain
between you know me and two children
the two children's happiness might overcome
my unhappiness but
I guess I don't feel an obligation to create
as many people as possible as fast
as I can right otherwise
there's a lot of
I'd be spending my time very differently if I thought that was important
I spent a lot more time with the sperm bank
for one yeah I think
to the point about children making
you less happy I know everyone's not like me
and everyone's not the same I think children
to a large degree rewire you
such that
like being with them and playing with them and so forth
becomes like super concentrated
joy juice compared
to whatever else you were doing with your life before that
like for sure and
so that's one thing that is always
salient to me in these conversations where I'm like
I know there's like
research that shows that people become less
happy after their parents and my comment
on that is always like I think there's some peak
shaving going on because yeah when you're
when they're little and you're losing a lot of sleep
and you can't really talk to them because
they're a baby your
life is like worse seen from the outside
but also like that injection of joy
into your brain when they like accidentally
smile at you really kind of
offsets a lot of that and then they get bigger
and then they're just fun it's
this probably sounds somewhat condescending but like
it's almost impossible to convey
like the change in like brain stuff that
goes on between before
being a parent being after being being a parent
for sure and actually talked about that we did have an episode
on child wearing some time ago and that was
something that I was cognizant of that like
I would be reprogrammed in a way that like
pushing my kid on the swing would be super rewarding
in a way that pushing any random kid on the swing
now would be super boring right or excuse me
not in that way so
my hesitancy part of it is like I just
don't feel like I could give a kid the life
that it would deserve right now but like I just
also don't want to shake up who I am
but that's not like I'm not down
to people who have kids yeah sure now I
I get the Gandhi doesn't want to take the
pill that makes him not Gandhi anymore
type yeah well in this context
that like the pill wouldn't make me less Gandhi
would just make me different different Gandhi
yeah so like I don't think I don't think
I'd be a worse person although
we had someone write in saying that they
were after we did that show that they were a parent
and yet it didn't drastically change them
or anything and then they went on to give examples of how it
did I
I was looking for that email actually I we can
I'll find it but you know what we should probably save this for
our parenting episode deal
okay so not without incident says
this is on the alpha go episode
couple quick comments while master
did use a single machine
that machine includes Google's
NN accelerator ASIC
I don't know what that is
which is 50 times more powerful than a CPU
so it's a bit misleading
to say that it runs on a
machine that anyone else thinks of when they think of a computer
also it's a bit misleading because
any use of a neural network can be divided into
two stages training
where it learns how to play and inference
where it evaluates the current board state and possible
moves inference is generally
much computationally lighter and that's
all alpha go has to do during one of those
games whereas the training
takes a lot more power and a lot more time beforehand
yeah ASIC
is application specific integrated
circuit so it's basically a chip that was made
specifically for that computational
task which makes it better at that
not necessarily better overall oh
thank you for telling us sure awesome
the other thing is in the same context
about how a human
could help alpha go play better
I didn't think I did a great job explaining it
master just like earlier alpha go
is still ultimately reliant on
a tree search algorithm it seems
likely that the human partner is essentially
improving the otherwise random choices
of the Monte Carlo tree search component
even if they are much less capable
at evaluating board positions the neural
networks this would explain why a player much
weaker than alpha go can still improve its play
when they work together make sense
I'll just take that a face value okay
cool that is all I had I think
you had one comment that you had also
wanted to read that was actually one about the
