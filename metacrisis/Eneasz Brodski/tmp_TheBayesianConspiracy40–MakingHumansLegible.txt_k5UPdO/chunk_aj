okay what I guess
it's about $500 for a ticket
it's not too bad but
no it's not prohibited well I guess
I mean I guess depends on how much money you got
yeah and like if you can afford not to work for how many days
Burning Man lasts or whatever but how long does it go
it's seven days and then there's also
you have to bring in everything
that you need to live on so
if it's you're going for the first time
like I will be it's actually a fair outlay
in supplies can't eat barter for that
no it's not a barter economy
it is you are allowed to gift
people things can't you
get gifted those things
in exchange for other gifts
I mean I guess
you could but self-reliance
is apparently a large tenant of the thing
so you're supposed to be fairly self-reliant
when you come in oh that's weird I feel like if I was going to
self-reliant week I would just pack a big backpack
and go into the mountains for a week
and then probably dogs and I could at that but I would practice
with an overnight first right yeah well I mean
you can you can do that too just
Burning Man where everyone is doing nothing except
trying to survive and spend seven days and
do as much cool shit together as they can in that time
and as much LSD as they can in that time
supposedly yeah I probably will not
because I wouldn't want my first trip to be there
that sounds like it would be taxing
you wouldn't know when you came down
right everything's still so weird
there's a glowing skeleton driving towards me
yeah I don't know
culture probably not as horrific as one thinks
but I can see a vast
amount of on-wee and meaninglessness in that society
and I don't think the majority of humans
would get through their 20s
but you would do okay right now
in my 20s I would have killed myself
well the idea is maybe you get psychologically well adjusted people
like better than me better than you
10 years ago to live in these
areas that exist in this area right so
I don't know maybe I should read these books
I'm sure it's quite an undertaking
Sailor Vulcan says
you guys missed the obvious solution to the whole personal autonomy
versus decision making capability problem
difficulty level of decisions
should scale with intelligence
the transhuman gods wouldn't make all the easy
non-god decisions because that would be boring
for them as long as people aren't dying
or suffering terribly for their mistakes
the transhuman gods wouldn't need to intervene
well I feel like suffering terribly
needs to be operationalized right
because is
well if you don't get this vaccine it won't kill you
but you could develop a cough that will
inhibit your fitness for the rest of your life
like is that terribly enough to have the
the transhuman god step in and be like you're getting this vaccine
or is it enough for them to like just
solve the problem before it even reaches you like
by putting in your food or something
I see what they're saying but that also
I guess part of the thing that we struggled
with in that episode was how do we
scale ourselves when we don't know what we're getting into
we had to be kind of just taking their word for it right
yeah and unless
they just didn't want to weigh in and let people
just experiment on it I don't know
the more constraints you put on it the harder it gets
but I don't know what are your thoughts on
autonomy versus decision making
I mean I think the way the comment was posed
I don't think that a god like AI
would become bored by small decisions because
I think that like the scope and depth and breadth
of what it could do would just expand
and it could solve all the problems all the time
so I don't think that's necessarily the thing
but that being said I mean I think
as long as the AI provides like some form
of safety net where you can't make
any decision that's going to hurt yourself
beyond some level of utility loss
or however the AI wants to express that
then you can play whatever games you want
that's sort of where I'm at is like you should be allowed
to wear like whatever color shirt you want like
if you feel like I like red but the AI is like you know what
more people like blue you should wear a blue shirt today
because it'll make people like you more or something
that's a decision that maybe you should be left up to you
but I don't really know where you draw
the line between like you said should you be allowed
to walk through a Jewish community wearing a shirt
with a swastika on it well do I want
the AI god stopping me
or do I want I don't know that's the question
yeah I like so much could you not just
impact like that might make you super happy
but my bum out everyone else and there's
more of them being bummed than you are being happy
so I don't know I guess what I was getting at
those that this is not that easily solved
of a problem right there's something to
that probably but I don't think
it's a solution at least as formed
right now I think there was one of the things
I really enjoyed about metropolitan man
it was at least flirting
with that question in fact not just flirting
I think a large part of Superman's motivation
was I am the
superhuman here how do I
decide what counts as
terrible suffering and how much do I interfere
in people's lives
yeah post to letting them make their own decisions
but still stopping the most horrible consequences
and I think honestly
Superman got a pretty did a pretty decent job of it
well like Lois pointed out though he also landed
at a good time if he landed there
150 years ago and there were slaves being exchanged
at the harbor would he have let them keep
being enslaved does I mean
Superman aware that there's current slavery on earth
I feel like he did his best
to not upset the metis
of the existing population right so
he didn't want to come in and immediately
overthrow the world and be like hey here's a bunch of free energy
and you know super cheap
space travel and that sort of thing so
but I think maybe he was doing the right thing he did try and assess
the situation at length before he went in and started intervening
so maybe that was actually
that does sort of tie into the idea
of not I guess
his goal wouldn't have been enforcing
legibility but it would be in
sprinting through chest of defenses
so yeah
I think humans are easy enough to manipulate
probably that the AI could just
create some kind of like sporting
contest that is a completely
zero sum game that we would all be obsessed
with and so we'd be protected from any
actual harm to ourselves but we'd
feel the drama that we're
prone to feeling just
by having this our whole lives
would revolve around sports we'd either be playing sports
or we'd be watching sports all the time
it sounds like you're just talking about status
because status is somewhat zero sum
and we are very obsessed with that
yeah yeah status is definitely a big part of it
I mean people
love to be part of a team too
even if they're not actually on that team
we live in Denver so I think we all know
those fans I feel like that
you're at least the way I pictured your
expression there manipulating us by keeping
us engaged in things that didn't actually
hurt or harm us really I mean that sounds like
movies and video games and it's like people are already
kind of doing that so I mean an AI is just
going to build a better version of Diablo
4 and we're all going to play that because
it's going to be super engaging I mean I was
never that big into Diablo I played it for like a month
but when I was part of the reason it got ruined is because
somebody came in and spammed a bunch of like
super strong weapons that made the game less fun
I was telling my girlfriend that
you know I think at the time that's playing it like five
people had died playing this game through like
dehydration or whatever
and leaving aside the possibility that they
decided to play Diablo
knowing that they would die because they wanted
they would rather play for another hour than go on living
the rest of their life like the
the other interpretation of that is that they
were just so engaged because the game
