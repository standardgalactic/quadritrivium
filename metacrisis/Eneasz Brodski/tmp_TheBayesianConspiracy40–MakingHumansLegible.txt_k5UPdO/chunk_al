child rearing oh it was about the chart okay
so we're gonna wait until next time I can just pull out the
quote because I don't want to make it sound like
I'll give them a chance to respond to me saying that
you said that they said it didn't rewire them that much
and then I said they give examples of exactly
how it did and their quote was exactly
I'll say that I never felt like a real
adult until I had a child and I think that it was
maybe that I felt nothing in my life really
mattered up until that point once you have
someone really important to you that is
completely dependent on you it adds a weight
to your figurative soul and that weight gives your
previous life or makes your previous life feel
inconsequential so that to me does make it sound
like they changed their life and like it rewired
them considerably right like I don't know
if I'd want to be changed into a person that
thought my entire life up until now have been
pointless although that's sort of what we're
talking about with you know upgrading
better brains and minds right we would look
back and be like I can't believe I satisfied
living like that maybe that's what it like being
apparent is for what it's worth I don't feel
like my whole life prior to having kids was
pointless it's just
it was a bit like being a different person I
will grant that not pointless though
I don't know I think everybody's different though
I mean even other parents I talked to
this is spectrum I think
that's good to keep in mind so
I believe we're done at this point I think so
okay you know how she wanted to plug something
oh yes I have
that collection of short stories that is out
red legacy and other stories
and it is available at Amazon and
various other places where you can buy e-books
and physical copy at Amazon as well
cool and I want to thank Matt again for joining us
to do anything you'd like to plug for yourself
yeah sure I co-host a podcast about
the web serial Worm which
I anticipate at least some of the listeners of this
show have read
it's me
a longtime fan of the story
guiding a first time reader
through the story Worm arc by arc
and every week we read a new arc
and we do a close reading of it
plots and opposite
kind of a detailed literary analysis
it's really fun and I would really appreciate it
if you would check it out now
I recall when I read like the first 12 arcs
or whatever arcs are actually pretty damn
long right yeah they get
to be like a hundred thousand words long eventually
yeah how how long does this podcast
go if you do an in-depth analysis
on every arc so far
the average about two hours each and
well so let me let me
some of the arcs we've had to split up into two
episodes and then in those cases
usually the episodes are going to be two hours each
so for example this last week
I believe we released the first
half of arc 15 last week and we're
doing the second half of arc 15
this week yeah four hours
per arc is actually where it's getting up to
pretty it's pretty dense
actually so it was Worm though so that
that's fair yeah
and what was the URL for that or the
yes thank you for asking the name
