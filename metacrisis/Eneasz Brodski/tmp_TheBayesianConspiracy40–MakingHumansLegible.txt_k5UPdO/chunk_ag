having never had full hearing
and never been fully deaf
I've personally experienced a wide range along that spectrum
it is objectively better
to have more senses than fewer
Yeah, I actually really appreciated that
that perspective and I'm also glad that
we didn't you know the one person who wrote in
that might have something
well I guess we're not going to get a lot of deaf people writing into the show
Probably not.
Yeah, I appreciated that feedback
and I do like the point
and actually I think it was
I think I saw Daniel Dennett articulated this way that
we're not like the owners of our kids
where they're stewards it's not
well it's mine I can do whatever I want with it
it's like no it's your responsibility now that you have one
and that means you know
being sensible to some degree at least right
so and not just about cochlear implants but things like vaccines
I mean there is something
pedantically more senses is better
I don't know 100% if that's true
like if we could sense more
the electromagnetic spectrum we'd be blind
but that's probably not what they were getting at
so it's interesting have you ever
heard of the northpaw
bracelet or anklet rather
it's like an ankle bracelet which
is sort of awkward to wear because
people think that you are in prison
or that you're out of prison on parole or something
but it vibrates
against your skin in whichever direction is north
yeah it is the coolest thing
I've heard it described as basically having a second
well a sixth sense now
and that eventually you start dreaming
in with the sense where you just always
know where north is
and it seemed like a really awesome
ability and I got one and it didn't
quite work for me
and part of the problem being that people did assume
that I was out of
you know on jail I had done something wrong and I was like
I'm just not gonna wear this anymore because
I would love to try it if you still have it
I don't anymore that's okay
so how did it work did it just constantly buzz north
yeah and what there's
I'm assuming there's weights on all four sides or something
8
it has 8 of those little cell phone vibrator motors
and whichever one is pointing
whichever one is closest to pointing north is vibrating
I feel like all the time I get kind of annoying
do you just get used to it
if you don't move for a while
it stops and only
buzzes like once every two minutes or something
really briefly did you let it
like become impossible for you to become lost
did you just like always know where you were
again I only wore it for about two days
because going into the office and having people being like
I see what I was like oh man
I can't do this in accounting
it has 8 small things it looks like an ankle bracelet
an ankle bracelet looks like this big thing
attached to a belt
it has a large motor on the side
it has a little
housing for the computer chip
it has the little sensing thing in it
probably the battery
did I say housing for battery
you said computer chip that has the sensing thing in it
which will also have that
and the battery
that makes it look very bulky
that sucks
I wonder how much they are
I'm always wearing jeans
just right live strong on it
just paint it baseball or football team colors
perfect
I should maybe get another one
but yeah it's $200
that was what they cost a few years ago
or what they cost now
I believe it's what they still cost now
$150 if you do your own soldering
but I would not recommend that unless you are very good at soldering
I'm not so maybe we can go have these
also
Dead Claymore goes on to say
technical note
cochlear implants in order to be maximally effective
need to be installed as early as possible
I'm not sure if that's the stimulus that's coming in
if I found out that my mother had the option
of fixing my hearing and didn't
I would be quite pissed off
all that being said
being deaf isn't the end of the world
I sometimes joke that it's a superpower
for sure and I don't think we came off as
as anti people with five senses right
I hope we didn't come off as anti deaf people either
certainly
A that is interesting to know about it needing to be installed at
childhood I knew that there's some perk about it being installed at
I thought it was something to do with like how your ear developed
apparently it's also brainwiring
which also gives you the opportunity later on if you're like
you know what I feel like I'm an adult now I want this thing out
I want to try being deaf forever
then again every able hearing person
has the ability to do that too right
we all have number two pencils in here
if we really wanted to
are you supposed to go about doing that you're not right
the cochlear implants from what I've heard take quite a while
a lot of it is the brainwiring when you first get them
all you hear is like weird buzzes and beeps and stuff
and apparently there was a
probably
this American life someone was talking to a reporter
one of the early cochlear implant adopters
and as they were talking to a reporter they were like
that's an ambulance isn't it
and the reporter was like yes and they were like
my brain finally made that wiring and I heard an ambulance
for the first time so
it takes a while to for your brain to figure out
what is happening to it
that's really interesting and it had been like a few months at that point
I wonder what that will be like if we ever
get technology gives us new senses
how that if it'll be faster or slower
what that'll be like
it also has to be weird being a baby right
just randomly bombarded with
sensory inputs that you have no idea what's happening
I sort of give babies like some slack now
because like
they're constantly screaming and crying but like
everything that's happening to them is the worst thing that's ever happened to them in their entire life
so like
you know they they drop their thing out of their
stroller and that they lose their minds like that's probably the worst thing
that's ever happened to them and you're right like it's got to be
super intense
especially the first few days I imagine
going from like the soft hum of
utero to
police sirens and flashing lights
must be quite the stress
everything's cold all the time
probably not good for our psychology
being born
I wanted to ask real quick
you said you are both a rationalist and a parent
we also got an email from
Jason who is a rationalist parent
would you be interested in doing like a rationalist parenting episode at some point?
sure that sounds great
awesome I will maybe do that
I bring that up because Jason wrote us an email
one of them is about the rational parenting thing and I'll put that off for later
but
when we were talking about the meaningfulness
of the real physical world
Jason wrote
it's possible the current universe we're in is a simulation
does that change anything
does it make what we care about meaningless
what does it matter?
I don't think I said or if I did
I think I hopefully appended it by the end of the episode
that I don't think that life
without contact with physical reality would be
meaningless I just feel like I'd be losing something
and yes if I learned that we lived in
if we lived in the matrix and there was a real world out there
I'd want to know what that was
so like in that sense and I think anyone who wanted
to know what their old is like would feel what I'm feeling
when I say we're missing something
we're missing what is really happening out there
like I said I don't know if that's a compelling
enough reason not to go into a simulation
especially if circumstances got dire or something
like it was the only way not to die I'd be
I'd be in there in a heartbeat even if it was super
I'm not super boring but even if it was
