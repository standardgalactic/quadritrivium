but that's just because the machines are that much smarter than them
like that's that's a dystopia to my
mind yeah that sounds interesting okay
so maybe I'll have to have a conversation
with a Zeke about this at length and he can
steel man the the utopia of the culture
series because part of that sounds great
in that like you mean I don't have to clean my bathroom
anymore you know cool
but if it's like that
with literally everything then yeah what are
we even doing I don't know
what I think what would be a little better would
be like we're kind of doing whatever we want
there's a better safety net in that like
texting while crossing the street one time
doesn't obliterate you from the universe forever
but you can still do dangerous stuff
but if something crazy happened and it
didn't work out then like you're immediately saved or you know
whether you're backed up every morning before you let it
better like you can you can
literally do anything and it will not obliterate
you here you're always fine unless you
specifically take off those safeties
hmm Charles Strauss explored that
once in acceleranda which was really
great they had basically functionally
immortality and so children started running
around with like swords and machine guns
and stuff when they're playing out on the playground
and would literally chop each other up
and shoot each other full of holes and it didn't matter
because they turn off the pain receptors and then
the machines rebuild their body and they're like yay this is
fun and it's kind of bloody and horrific and on the other hand you're like
well shit if I could swing around
a lightsaber on the playground and it wouldn't kill
anyone I would yeah if it didn't hurt and no one
died that doesn't kind of fun yeah I mean
people play paintball now and that's
a simulated version of that so yeah
we like paintball except with real guns and
when you die afterwards they at the end of the
round resurrect you well we also play call of duty
which is like another reflection of that right
so feels like the same thing and
call of duty doesn't isn't very meaningful
people who go to the military will still play
call of duty for fun but they don't derive the
meaning from call of duty that they do from
being in the military well that's because they
aren't real people so I feel like as long as
you're interacting with real in in call of duty
not that military
those aren't people
no one listening to saw this but as soon as
said those aren't real people I gave Stephen the
look as in oh
yeah so I didn't clarify because I felt
like I misspoke a clip because Inyash
gave me a look that said he felt like I misspoke
um yeah you can gun down everybody
in call of duty nothing happens and the world's
no different for it your stats in the game
change but your stats in the game
of earth all of life was like
you could gun down everyone and it wouldn't
matter because nothing changes except maybe
a few stats of how many people you gun down
on the playground yeah how does that stop
the rogue sociopath in culture
in culture
you can't like harm people without
their permission it's like what if you are
swinging a lightsaber and
you're fine swinging it until you hit somebody
and then it just stops working or what yeah
is this a whole world of simulation or just no
no it's it's not a simulation it's physical
world just the culture
and minds are that powerful
damn okay I
don't know what to add to that
Zeke goes ahead and
says because he anticipated
my uh objection here
saying regarding meaning and service
people in the culture raise children
and collaborate on projects which may
include celebrations art games
regular socialization think of the life
of a 20 to 30 something year old
offspring of a billionaire what do they
do do they weep in their bedroom about
meaningless life is now that they can hire a
servant to do literally everything for them
or do they party socialize work on projects
and self-improve and
you know that's that's the counterpoint to that
like in Star Trek no one has to work but a lot
of people do anyway for the fun of it well so
two questions about that well I guess one
caveat and one question one caveat is that
it depends on the billionaire
20 year old but you know a lot of them are
just laying around drinking because like they can't
contribute I don't know of a lot of them there aren't
there isn't a large sample size but I do know that depression rates
are kind of high in those populations which
I guess take that for what it is Zeke said
that they collaborate on projects they make
games and art with that stuff not exist
if people didn't build it because then you're still creating
things of value that wouldn't exist otherwise
and that is an outlet to make you productive
yeah it would still exist okay so speaking as
a temporary billionaire I
have been unemployed for a number
of months now and I
have a small amount of passive income
and I live extremely cheap plus I got
workers unemployment
insurance what is it called unemployment
unemployment and I'm unemployment right now
so basically I have the entire day free
and have had for several months now to do whatever
I want and
it's been pretty great I finished my
novel I am now looking for an agent
I am working on short stories
I'm doing other things that I enjoy with my life
and quite honestly I can see this
going on forever I'm like
this is so much better than having to
get up at 6am every day
slog into work to do meaningless accounting
and number juggling for 8 hours
and then come home and
yeah I don't have nearly as much money to spend but
I'm using my time with what I want to use it on
and I get to socialize with people more often
I get to see you guys I get to see other people
it's kind of great so
I'm sad that I'm only a temporary billionaire
and I'll have to rejoin the workforce in a couple months
here but
it's not something to sneeze at well
so you're in that situation that Zeke's describing
but you're creating things that wouldn't exist
otherwise and that gives you like if you were
I don't know just making the same
5cm cube of wood over and over
you'd probably get super bored
and there's machines that can do better than you can so like
if I was in this position 10 years ago I would have been miserable
I used to be not very good with not
having outside goals to push me
I was in this situation a few months ago and I was miserable
yeah exactly a lot of people who aren't employed
are miserable because you need some
kind of goals and it's nice that I have found my own
goals where I now have the
podcast that I work on and I have the
novel that I'm writing and other things I'm pursuing
but it's hard to find that sort of
self-directed goal
Matt what about you?
I think people need something to struggle against
and most people can't generate their own
thing to struggle against because it
feels artificial but something like
a novel is perfect actually because
from my perspective as someone who likes to write fiction
it sometimes feels like
a story idea is exogenous to you and it comes
in and you have to write it
and it puts demands on you
so that's a great example
of something that does work as
a self-motivating goal I think or potentially
can but yeah I think just
goals I like the word struggle
because of the connotations that
humans do to find themselves by struggle
to some degree or we find meaning in struggle
I'm going to Burning Man for the first time
this year and I get the feeling
life might be a lot like Burning Man
because there's nothing necessarily to do
at Burning Man you just show up and be there for seven days
but people find their own
projects and art installations
and other things to do and service to other people
a lot big part of it is
like the service and gift to other people that are there
I was really into that
when I was looking into it once for about ten minutes until I saw that
it cost a bunch of money now when it used to be free
or at least super super cheap
