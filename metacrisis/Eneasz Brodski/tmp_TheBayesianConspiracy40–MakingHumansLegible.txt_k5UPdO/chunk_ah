you know not tile simulator but if it was Middle Earth
right I think the stuff
wouldn't be meaningless because I still
care about the people I care about
but it would feel slightly less
meaningful I would want to know what's out there
do you have an opinion yeah I mean
I always go to consciousness
when I think about this type of thing
and kind of the pseudo
Buddhist perspective of like
I'm much more certain that consciousness exists
than I am that I have a physical body
and I'm sitting in a room so
even if everything is a simulation
whatever is happening
on the level of my awareness is
quote-unquote real as far as I'm
concerned no matter what I learn about
the outside world and I'm just
going to continue operating under the assumption that other people are
real too in which case they do have
meaning even if they are also a simulation
that's kind of where I am
and yeah if I find out that this is the matrix
I'd be interested to know what's outside the matrix
but I wouldn't
invalidate anything about my existence I don't think
you have a child I have three
you have three children would you still
would you feel that their existence is less
meaningful if this was the matrix
no I mean my only concern
for them would probably be like I want to
ensure that they're able to thrive
in whatever way they define that to be
I don't know this is my home universe
maybe they'll want to move to a different one
you'd want to stay in this one I guess it depends
on what the top level universe is like
I mean if it's just completely abstract
and incomprehensible to us then
an ant doesn't need to be made human sized
an ant should be ant sized
you know there's an appropriate scope
for an organism unless you're
going to also like modify my brain in which case
that's a completely different thought experiment
Jason also had some interesting things to say
about psychedelics because he's taken them
this email that he sent us was not
actually text he sent us an audio file so
I'm going to go ahead and throw up that audio file
on our Patreon feed in case anyone wants to hear that
caveat ask Jason first
I will ask Jason first
here's a comment which
feels prescient to me because it
touched on what I was talking about today
Zeke Aron now okay hold on
Samus says last name is Aron
I always thought so
see I played it back in the days before they had
audio in games aside from beeps and boops
so I just said Aaron
in like the ones where they actually have voice actors
does it come out as Aron Aron
I haven't played them since do they talk now
I don't know I assume they talk in all video games now
God we sound so old
like at some point she goes I'm Samus Aron
take this alien
I assume that's what she says before she
fires each bullet
or energy projectile now that I'm
put on the spot I don't know how it's pronounced
although I do think that Zeke told me that that's how he pronounces
Aron okay but
whether or not Samus pronounced it that way
the world may never know okay or the world knows
and we just don't so we're gonna
I'm gonna go with Aron since that sounds better
either way okay
Zeke Aron says when we were talking about
again we were talking about the transhumanist fiction
and we were talking about the culture and how
humans don't matter in that society
the AIs do everything of import
in that universe
Zeke Aron says Enyaar seems to have
lead-eyed feelings regarding the culture
and also a misunderstanding of what it means to live in it
being in the culture means you are
perfectly free from all obligations
duties and survival
he has a little more to say which I will get to
but I think being completely free
from all duties and obligations
is kind of
horrific because
going back to what we were saying about
how what we really care about is
other humans and our relationships with them in our
social net those things come with
obligations and duties to other people
if you are completely free of obligations and duties
then you don't really have any sort
of social network or social
ties so if you're completely free
from them you'd be completely alone
I see we were going with that but I can challenge
that by saying that like I didn't help you move
because I was obligated to
I did it because we're friends
but it's not
like it was an obligation or a duty
right like it's not the duty of all your friends
to help you move otherwise you'd have had an army of people
helping you right so
like it's just the people who are available and want to
and can or whatever so I think being free of duty
and obligation doesn't mean that your communications
break down I feel like it means that you're not doing anything
that you don't want to do so then that way when
somebody helps you you know it's because they actually want to
and not because they feel like they're fulfilling some obligation
I think there's sort of a
sense of duty and obligation to that though
like there are some obligations
that come with being a father
or a son right
well a father obviously
but also a son there is
reciprocal part of that
yeah I've never read any culture novels but like
how would the culture
enforce not having obligations
on a person like
if you take on an obligation
I'm asking I haven't read the novel I
I'm confused honestly so
I believe you just don't have to fulfill it
okay well so I haven't read them either
so like I want someone to help me rebuild
my bathroom I give somebody $300
and they still be by tomorrow and they don't come
how do they just get away with it in culture
like that doesn't sound utopian that doesn't sound utopic
do robots come and do it instead
and then I just wasted the money or do I just
pay robots because they don't they don't flake on
business deals or what or do you not need
bathrooms because that all that also solves the problem
I just think that obligations and
duties to other people are a meaningful
and important part of relationships
there are some things you expect from your friends
and your partners yeah like like the
whole signaling thing like you you
established a relation I mean this is like our monkey
wiring is like oh you have
shown me that you care by doing something
that cost you something
and that may be costing you time energy
opportunities whatever but
if nothing you do ever cost you
anything for me then I never have a credible
signal that you actually care about me
that's that that's the cynical
way of phrasing it I guess but just like you
were saying in this sort of idealized
post-scarcity world it's kind of hard to have
meaningful personal connections I see what you're saying
I feel like you successfully channeled Robin
Hansen in that analysis
and I feel like that's actually something to that
and don't you just have a duty to your fellow citizens
to not shit in public
or make society worse
in some way to defend your friends
and or defend the right
of free speech or public
assembly or whatever it is yeah
I don't I haven't read the culture the culture series either
so I can only assume that they have some way of getting around these problems
because like in a situation
where there was getting around it is that humans don't matter
you can't do anything that can fuck up the world
can you do anything that fuck up one
person nope without their consent that how can you
literally do anything you
if you want to you could like if there's a
table and you want to clean it you can clean the table
but you don't have to it'll clean itself if you
leave it alone so yeah I mean
it sounds kind of horrible and dystopian from
from my understanding of it is like there's like these
super AI over minds that are literally just
basically bouncing humans around like
billiard balls and the humans of course think they have agency
