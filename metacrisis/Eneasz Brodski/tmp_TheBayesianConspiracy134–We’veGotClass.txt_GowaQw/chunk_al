that are physically demanding or in some way dangerous like uh working on an oil rig uh driving
a truck uh you know being in the military being a coal miner even just like being a bus driver
it's just like it's more physical and also you're like more physical more taxing and you're putting
yourself in potential danger more than most of the like elite careers there's some exceptions but
this would have been fun to think about in advance but having just had the idea I don't
have time to articulate a good like answer to it but it'd be fun to try and think of okay cool we've
leveled up the right now how do we level up the left um maybe Scott will do a post like that or we
can think of something ourselves or the community I think the rationality community is like like
talk about that a lot like I mean basically actually a lot of these ideas are rationalist
ideas like you know anti-censorship uh prediction markets um but then that but that's the conservative
platform now what do we do to level up the the liberal platform oh like which uh which issue
should we pick that like we can sell to the democrats yeah I mean I can think of a couple ideas right
off but I don't have the time or the brain juice now to say like make us the party of science that's
what I was gonna say is my first thought was like specifically attack like organic foods and anti-vaxxer
stuff and yeah and like dumb you know global warming advocates that just say reduced like
carbon and or like you know the you're you're a good you're a good environmentally conscious liberal
if you don't use disposable straws right like that it the the straw thing is a good example of a
complete waste of effort yeah um you can buy a steel straw and wash it and use it yourself and then
try good luck washing a fucking straw but if you manage to keep it clean using plenty of bleach uh
you have a straw brush exactly but I mean all that stuff costs a lot to manufacture and ship
and all the chemicals needed to keep that thing clean are going to be pretty hard in the environment
too right but hey at least not throwing away straws so like sound environmental activism
might be a platform of the left science-based environmental activism it's shuttered to think
that you have to call it science-based and you know uh science-based science activism but yes
science-based science we should probably wrap this up yeah all right well not before we think
of patron yes is it my turn I think I haven't done this in a while go for it okay thank a person do
it this person we would like to thank is soon Jacobson Jacobson soon Jacobson thank you for
supporting all the classes but especially the class you're part of is the best one and we're
glad that you could help us talk about this and and bring this to the people the real hero this
week soon yeah bring this to the real working class americans who are the true people behind
everything that's right think for the most part I think of rationalist as working class to middle
class I think we tend to be every middle class we have a lot of programmers yeah I still think
programmers more of working class especially the ones who've gone through boot camps rather than
colleges because we're just weird we don't really like slot into the political norms I think also
not really the classes and they're not they're not wage workers they're salaried for the most part
too yeah which basically means you get paid I know that like I'm not sure how the distinction fits but
yeah in any case whatever class you are listener especially you soon are the is the best one so
however you define class unless you're the upper class in which case take your patron of the arts
they are a patron of the arts ah good point okay we like the upper class that patronize us
