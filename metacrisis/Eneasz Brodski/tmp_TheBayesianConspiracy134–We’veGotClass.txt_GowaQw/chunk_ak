element of guilt there as well as the sort of trying to signal superiority, but they just
like it's a lot of like white cis people fighting amongst themselves about what the like
correct thing to do is like to just keep being reminded of this Japanese woman who sells kimono
to tourists and who heard about cultural appropriation like people on Twitter or whatever,
like telling people you can't buy kimonos if you go to Japan and it's cultural appropriation and
this woman had no kind of like reference for this. I feel like you're reading your mind because
that's exactly the one I was going to bring up in this. Like so she's just like I think that
there's like these woke people on Twitter. I don't know what woke means. I guess they're like
racist or something. Like why wouldn't you want to buy my kimono? Like I make them for tourists to
wear and when I see people representing my culture and like being interested in it, that makes me happy.
I never had a black person tell me that the movie Black Panther wasn't for white people.
I've only had white people tell me that. I've never known a black person who used the word African
American to describe themselves. Maybe Barack Obama but like he's a politician. Yeah. Yeah.
He had to do the woke speak in order to like be taken seriously by his own side while also belonging
to like I don't know it's just it's really funny. But like my thing was I remember the first time
someone told me that like that oh no I don't think Black Panther was for white people and I'm like
even if every black person in the country saw it, it wouldn't have made as much money as it did.
Like are you saying that they don't want this movie to be successful? Because like I think they did.
And the I mean it's just on the face of it. That sounds insane. And so you're going to tell
you're going to tell your white friends don't spend money to see this movie. That's insane.
Who are you helping? Nobody. Yeah. I mean the vast majority of the upper class is white people
because it's old money. It's mostly inherited. It's just the demographics of the era. They're
still mostly white. And that is why the vast majority of the woke people are white people
getting you know upset on behalf of minorities because it's actually recent. Like in a lot of
cases I remember I mean some of my white friends and a few of them were black too but we were like
doing a day of the dead party just because like I don't know there's any excuse to have like a party
themed around a holiday especially if it involved dressing up because this was also my like anime
group. So like we were all doing like sugar skull makeup and the next year when Shingo
de Mayo came around to this the same like or not Shingo de Mayo god damn it the day of the dead.
But it was like the same group of people were like oh we definitely can't do that
because it's cultural appropriation. Like last year it was it was it was like painting on skull
makeup and having fun and like making traditional drinks and like the next year suddenly it wasn't
okay and it was like there was this double speak going on where it was like that that's cultural
appropriation we don't do that and we never did that. Like who dares like like I don't know it was
a party where people are talking shit about the kind of people that do the same thing we had
done last year. Okay I find it interesting that lots of times you have to before you can appreciate
a certain piece of art you have to figure out what the race or gender of the artist is because if
yeah. You're not allowed to like things made by racists. Well no not just that like if I don't
know if like Ray and the Last Dragon was done by a primarily white crew it would have been not okay
to watch it. I didn't see it I think I saw the pitch meeting for it. I have not seen it but that
is what I have. It's like the one thing on Disney Plus that you have to pay extra to watch it now.
Huh yeah I I like the kimono example too because it's like the person selling this is like yeah I
would love tourists to come give me their money and enhance my business right and what this this
15 year old girl on Twitter in America is gonna say no no that they're taking advantage of you
you don't get it but I do right it's so kind of sending. Yeah and then like it's the same thing with
like I've asked about like a bunch of Mexican people that I was friends with her that I just knew
like what what do you think about like you know people white people celebrating like Day of the
Dead or Cinco de Mayo and they're just like I think it's great like it's cool that I can go to the
supermarket and like find you know stuff for this holiday like that we're getting more recognition
as a culture and I see like the white people being like well you know they're just wearing it
as a costume they're just using it as an excuse to drink and like and and I don't know every holiday
is an excuse to drink and I was kind of like yeah that's what the like people who celebrate this
holiday do too yeah this is a this is a it's like St. Patrick's Day yeah even if you're a devoutly
Catholic uh Irish person you know it's still just like this is a this is a party holiday right um
maybe if you're not that devoutly Catholic but you know what I mean if you're if you're the kind of
Catholic who goes to church twice a year on Christmas and Easter you know even the bad Catholic I
think the only holiday that isn't a drinking holiday is Easter I'm not even planning to drink the blood
of Christ yeah you can't get wasted on the blood of Christ that's that's a that's a sin but you know
getting a buzz on Christ is totally okay all right buzzed on Christ so it'd be a great wine label
that would you'd probably get enough controversy that people would hear about it and then buy it
I bet I can if I were to go through trouble like I bet I can get it sold on the uh St.
Patrick Temple's website kickstart it get some card funding all right if anyone does that I want
five percent so that's a weakness yeah so and that was the last one that was it yeah so overall I
I think he has a very strong point and maybe I think this because I've been reading him for years
and this is something he's been kind of building towards for years but I think that
classism is a very big deal and I kind of get the feeling more because my parents came from Europe
and over there it is just acknowledged as a thing that the different classes are in a struggle
and maybe this is like due to the old influences of Marxism but like it's weird how no one in America
talks about classism at all and uh I it's boiling over it's a specific thing though where like in
India you can talk about castes because they literally had like a governmental caste system
yeah but our whole like identity as Americans originally was that we're gonna be a democracy
and everybody will be equal and we really don't want to acknowledge that we failed miserably
I don't know like but it was alive even from the very beginning you could only vote in the original
democracy if you were a rich white landowner that there was like aspirational ideas of this
is the kind of like you know we want to be the country of freedom okay and I think we still are
very attached to the idea that we're the country of freedom and acknowledging that we have class
that we have like a you know unofficial class system makes people uncomfortable well and like
definitely get I think younger people talking about it especially online right like oh the you
know anyone who says eat the rich is talking about class right yeah um I think that this is probably
like an unpopular thing amongst like voting adults because they either were alive or they
knew people who were around during the anti-communist campaign of the whatever 50s through 80s and so
like that that was just so that was such a part of the culture for an entire generation
that like oh no we're not we're not part of that class stuff America's transcended that that's like
you know I'm assuming this is part of like the implicit message right we've transcended all that
stuff everyone can be anything you know you if you work hard you can be the next Elon Musk right
in fact Elon Musk worked hard and became Elon Musk so like you could do it too so like I think
people conflate um classism with that sort of like uh in the sense that Alexander's putting it
they're conflating uh they kind of like Marxism class class uh warfare compared to like what
Scott's proposing here just happens to be the same word I think class is sort of a scary thing to
consider and like admit exist on both sides uh where it would mean that like people on the right
who consider themselves like I don't know I think there's the whole idea of the elites and like
left leaning behaviors signaling elitism although they wouldn't call it that but the
probably can certainly would uh acknowledging that they're actually like upper class and
performing upper class behaviors would make them feel bad because of the whole like oh no
privilege is like they'd have to actually admit that this is like that the media is run by the
left and there is a because of class and uh on the left I think that there's or on the sorry right
it's probably going to be scary to acknowledge that or like that they're mainly representing the
working class yeah well there's there would definitely be an aversion towards admitting that
there are classes in America and I'm in the lowest one yeah because yeah I mean like in
order to I think that would be actually the biggest like barrier to this proposal which means
that in order to talk about class they'd have to admit that they're not the best one yeah yeah
I think you're right because in Europe people really didn't give much of a fuck that they were
in the lowest class they're like because they knew they were yeah it was explicit I like to drink
I'm a peasant and someday I will kill the king because fuck the upper class but you hear people
on the left like supporting marxist ideas and like people on the right are the people that are
mainly the ones saying this is America America is great it's like you could be anything you want
to be when you grow up we're the country we love freedom and liberty like well that's that's also
the you know the admitting that we have class yeah that he was Scott was saying you know like
you can say anyone can be anything um so the not acknowledging that there's class puts in hidden
barriers because saying anyone can be anything means that anyone can move out of their class
into a different class it feels like a lot like someone denying that there's any race you couldn't
have you couldn't address issues of racism you couldn't talk about like how there's some people
who hate people of a different race and that's a bad thing if you couldn't talk about race at all
and I think that's the same thing with classism like you can't talk about classism and how you
should be accepting of all classes regardless of where you are and where they are because
classism is bad and if you can't talk about classes at all then that's a problem well I think also
there's like the you can be anything you want to be ethos is generally supported by like the
old money people or you know like uh I think they're the ones who believe at least though I think
well it's a justification for being able to say that always be crude the poor people are poor
because they just didn't work hard enough and I have all this money because I worked hard for it
I don't think they have any delusions that they worked hard for this money I think they think
they deserve it because they're of the upper class and the lowers will always waste their money and
squander it and it's probably a distinction between the old and new rich but like so like
rich republicans definitely would want like they I think a lot of times like outright say
things like you know uh they're anti welfare because they think poor people just are too lazy
to go get a job and that like women make less money than men because they don't really want
to make as much money as men or like men do work harder and earn the money like I don't know
they want there to be like sort of a you know if class existed then they'd have to admit that
actually there are these barriers like and you you didn't like work for your money or like you
did but like this person is just as deserving as this money as you sorry what are you gonna say
soon I was gonna say that I liked the the way that you put it that in order to sell this message
you'd have to say you know y'all are the lowest class or like we are where I am and I'm there
with you yeah but in order in order to sell the message you'd have to say we're the working class
and that's the best class that's what I was gonna say is I think Scott addressed that but he maybe
maybe could have spent a paragraph on it rather than a sentence he worked on rebranding low class
to working class and that you guys should be proud of it you guys are the backbone of America you
guys you guys build the roads you guys build all of our stuff the j6 packs or whatever yeah sure
but you know you know I mean you know plumbing is seen as low status unless like you're the plumber
sorry I'm just trying to remember uh it's low status until you're drowning in your own shit yeah
because the pipes aren't working what the hell was um do you it was Joe the plumber the thing that
like the republican platform was running on for a while oh that was a thing when was that that was
when Obama was running yeah wasn't Sarah Palin that coined it I don't remember uh I was just gonna
say that like it you know the the important infrastructure jobs are all seen as like low
class but if you rebrand it I think more you know more or less correctly as like working class slash
essential for the continuation of society um like I mean no if you're if you're a construction worker
right that's that's oh that's a low-brow working job whatever yeah yeah but you guys like having
places to live and roads to get there right um there's a term for that I'm trying to think of it
like someone who provides essentials like or I guess you could say essential workers uh that might be
an interesting way to kind of co-op that phrase from COVID because we basically think essential
workers are like what we thought firefighters were during 9-11 like amazing angels slash heroes
putting their lives on the line ooh they could call them the essential class yeah I think working
class probably sounds better though maybe uh something in between there I think the connotation
could be even better than working class because that still already has kind of a low-brow connotation
but during your speeches you could say the working class the essentials yeah the real American heroes
the ones putting their lives out on you know putting out fires and I'm definitely not farming
services yeah I'm definitely in favor of not shitting on people for having vocations that are seen as
low status right um especially because like I said so many of them are are essential for society to
function um I it's kind of surprising how things shook out that way you know maybe I need to just
up my history level right my skills and history but uh I don't know I guess I'm I'm just now
mulling over the idea that like why is somebody who built houses seen as low status like because
if you're rich you have people build houses for you but like yeah I guess but it's still like uh you
know I think knowledge work is higher status than labor work but I think it's because it requires a
it requires a degree you know anything that requires a degree or or a master's or like a doctor it
is more complicated than learning to build a house sure or you could even just take the degrees out
of it and say that like some things are just harder than others at like the not the physicals uh
stuff but like the cognitive stuff well I'm doing physical labor just where is your body out faster
right you you're in pain for more of your life you die younger it's I can see why it would be
viewed as more high status to not have that yeah peasants build stuff and they they get you know
hurt and die young where the nobles have their stuff built for them by peasants and eat caviar
right I think it's just that it happened that knowledge work was the most profitable in the
last few generations because so many things are run by computers now so much money goes into tech
and yeah knowledge work skills it just grabbed the fact that like intellectual work had them has
the most money means it has the most power so it's like I'm sorry I'm being like no no articulate
today but it's like there's a thing I want to encapsulate where it's sort of tied to the whole
like idea of upper class people having their like a whole bunch of degrees whereas if you join the
military you don't need a degree you just need to be need to be able to make it through boot camp
and there's like yeah this kind of I actually I also dislike that though where it's like building
a house is actually very complicated and like but there aren't house building there's architecture
degrees but it's not like if you were like to become my dad's apprentice you'd go get a degree
if you give you a roller and a hammer you like follow me up on this roof I think building a whole
house is probably really complicated but the person who like the project planner for a house
probably needs to be the the quote intellectual party member of that but like the drywall person
the flooring person those are all things you can pick up pretty quick maybe for many people right
so it's like it's for some things yeah but not certainly not things like I mean like what about
whole mining not the plumbing and electricity part that's you know okay there's jobs that are
physically hard yeah maybe that's also sort of the shift away from like uh yeah like valuing
jobs that that could only be done by certain people or certain badasses who are willing to
risk getting electrocuted you know like again electrical engineering pays a bunch because
it's kind of dangerous and really complicated yeah you know like I think I mentioned a few weeks ago
like I fixed my bathroom light or something but the most comfort I'm level I'm the most level of
comfort I'm my highest level of comfort is turning off the circuit breaker for that entire part of
the house and basically poking it with a screwdriver right like that that's as far as I can get if it
involved me having to pull wires whatsoever on the wall I'd be paying somebody a nice chunk of
change to do it because I'm not going to die poking at my own house right yeah what about like IT
like I'm trying to find examples that aren't and I'm realizing that like a lot of things that we
consider low class are physically dangerous well IT is I but like that's like weirdly in the middle
right yeah it's like the high level of low class because they're still basically wage workers
they're doing what other people tell them and it's not like that the most technical
job to learn a lot of engineers are more of the working class level than uh yeah okay that's another
example yeah like mechanical engineers but like most of the examples I think of are like jobs
