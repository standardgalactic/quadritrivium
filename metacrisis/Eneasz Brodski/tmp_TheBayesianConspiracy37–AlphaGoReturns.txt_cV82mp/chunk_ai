if Mark Zuckerberg
optimizes whatever
positions in order to be
maximally effective for being able to
I mean it would be interesting to see
it would be interesting to see
I happen to be a much much bigger fan
of the open source approach that Google
has of let's elevate everybody
let's try to work together
let's you know Facebook's
approach is you know you
can't trust humans will keep you safe
everybody get in the box
you know like obviously some people want to keep
the AI in the box
and Facebook wants to keep everybody
else in the box
it's very safe in that box as long as
Facebook is looking out for us
yeah I see what you got as your complaint there
that's not even a good point I don't know
I don't know maybe I'm betting on the wrong team
it's kind of tough at this point because I think already
Facebook and Google know
so the lines are already drawn
I don't think it'll matter too much though
you think there's a third actor it's just going to be Facebook
no there's plenty there's plenty
for instance I don't know how realistic it is
it might also be just kind of transitioning
people easing people into the idea
certain types of transhumanism
but like Elon Musk's
you know like neural net type
of you know like being able to stick a wire
in your brain and get the updates yourself
I think that the version that is being described
right now a little fantastical
but also that's the way most brilliant
new technology works I think that
there's a certain normalizing and easing
people into the idea
of humans and AI
fusing I'm looking forward to it
I just want a car that drives itself
I mean that is step one
yeah but I'm looking
forward to being we were just talking last week about
being able to upload our consciousness and not being
stuck with this body that's eventually going to decay
yeah in a scary dangerous universe
yeah it'd be nice to at the very like
whichever whichever is easier like making the universe
less hostile and punish and so pun so
punitive or making a
a new universe that's that's nicer whichever
we can do first and totally on board with
so I'm just wondering if this is a if we're currently
doing a tool assisted speedrun
of life god I sure hope not
wait what do you mean currently doing a tool assisted
speedrun of life like we are in
a simulation if my life is someone's best
effort no no no no no no no
we're not done yet
no no not even just decided in general like us like
maybe you're going through life
maybe you've already gone like through life some
number of times already maybe rather
than at the point where you know you've
fucked up you go backwards maybe
instead what you do is you don't know for sure
because life is very complicated and confusing
and it's not always clear what
are the cause and effect because you watch
a tool assisted speedrun it involves strategies
that are very bizarre and weird they look
they look crazy they look
crazy to the eye but
in retrospect when you see the beauty of the design
and you look back and you're like oh my god
how was everything
in the exact perfect place for me to learn
all the right lessons grow
all the right ways everything worked out
all this crazy stuff happened
that's really
weird it's almost as
if I kept going back in time to the spot
in order to perfect get
the exact perfect path
I feel like if I could get myself
to somehow understand exactly what
that would be like or to believe that I didn't know
it was like to be like really religious
no I mean that like because that's all like god
made this whole plan for you right right
and this current run right now is going to be your best effort
no sure but
it would mean that you are the only
real person in the universe because
no no no no why
because you are the one who has control over when everyone
gets around
what does it mean to have control
what if everything is in perfect harmony
like a tool assisted speedrun
but in tool assisted speedruns the levels don't get harder
the better you get they just they're
designed already to really do them
in the tool assisted speedrun you have
that you are tracking like Mario for example
the universe is all about Mario
so what is your
object of evaluation
if it's not one individual person is it
like all of society together
being speedrun
no no no okay let's say for instance
that and I don't know this is
keep in mind we're all talking about some impossible things
that are highly unlikely but like
what's to say that we couldn't
already have
like why can't there be a very
large number of people that are
each executing
a run or like for instance if the universe
of the multiverse is just very very very large
there's many many many many many variations
what's to say there isn't
everybody's perfect
run or a perfect harmonization
between each person's run
again if they were separate then I would
feel like the person who was the object
of that run would be the only real object
but what does it mean to be real
exactly
this is the kind of thing I
often do not like talking about
because then I'm like well no one else around me
is real and that's the problem for me
I think there's a difference between other people
not being real versus us all be connected
like to me
like to me I don't know what's
true or not I'm the last person to know
but I operate as though it's true
that you guys are different people
than me but that we are connected that we are all
one and that the universe is
to some degree there's some larger connection
between all of us and
so is there like the
the relationship between that
that matches all the different speed runs together
into one harmonized run
I don't know anything about the speed run thing
that was nearly positing that I wonder
it occurred to me just now how much
it sure is convenient
the way certain things work out
I always just sort of assumed that
that it was a combination of selection effect
you know just me being a human looking
for pattern versus
some amount of maybe there is a pattern
design right and it's it's confusing
maybe that's where a certain amount of the
personal choice comes in of how much
to you do you think there is a pattern
versus are you just looking for a pattern
in the chaos because that's what humans do maybe
but there's another option
which is maybe it starts out
extremely chaotic like a machine
learning like the plays that AlphaGo would make
before it's very good and maybe it just learns
over time it plays over and over
and over again simulating
games like a speed run
on that note I think right of time
okay
thank you guys for having me
no this was awesome it was a lot of fun
thanks for coming thank you for joining us
and we'll see you all again in two weeks
bye bye
bye
