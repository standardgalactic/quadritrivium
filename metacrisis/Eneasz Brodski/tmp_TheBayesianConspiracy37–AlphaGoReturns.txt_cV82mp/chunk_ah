of future paths
involving everybody leveling up as much
as possible so that we can keep playing the game
because I think it would be interesting to know what's going on on Mars
I think it would be interesting to know what's going on on Pluto
I think it would be interesting to go to other galaxies
I think it would be interesting
to travel to other star systems
and build other galaxies
or build things, build civilizations and structures
hell I might
find myself inclined to reverse entropy
and preserve the universe rather than heat death
I don't know, I could see what else there is to do
You'll find no challenge to any of those missions for me
I'm a big fan of living for
well forever
or as close to forever as I can manage
I'm a big fan of all time and those all sound great to me
that seems like a bit of a
digression though
Facebook is still just kind of seeking
human attention because that's what
as a corporation it is designed to seek
based on its business model
it doesn't have an end goal
it just wants more human attention all the time
I don't know
you think it does have an end goal
I'm not totally sure what it is
but yeah, I think that
that's a good point
by it I meant
the incentives and power structures
that seem to
dictate what actions are taken by that corporation
I think
that there are a non-zero number
of actors
that each have their own approach
to how to control the future
ok
and people are getting
more and more and more powerful
it's not just people at the top either
I mean if you think about
like Denver for instance has places
there's all kinds of places for
homeless people to charge their cell phones
their smartphones
on street blocks
it's the notion that there are more people
on earth with cell phones
than people with toilets
that is
wild, that's very weird
that's weird
but powerful too, don't get me wrong
it'd be really nice for people with toilets too
but the power that a cell phone has
for instance
if you can just type into
and this is for smartphones which is still
billions of people but if you can just type
into a, you just type whatever
you want to know and 99%
of the world's knowledge is at your fingertips
like it's like
you can do a lot of things if you just
have the ability to have whatever
if you can think of a question you can get
the answer most of the time
that's crazy powerful
that's crazy powerful
the most fun of that is lost on us
because we're used to it and then we just get
bugged down when we're on
3G instead of 4G and it takes
5 whole seconds to get that answer
instead of 5, you know, half of a second
no but I do agree with you
that that is an awesome power
you kids today you don't know how good you got it
when I was your age
that's what I was saying
maybe I
conveyed that poorly that's exactly what I was saying
to put it another way I feel like
in 100 or 200 years
we're gonna like so we've got this
demarcation now of like BC
and AD I sincerely
think it's extremely likely that
we will look at pre-net and post-net
as a as the next
you know
calendar-shifting paradigm you know the way
that we think about history because the world
has changed so much in the last 30 years
and it'll I think
I think once those changes sink in at more
levels and become even more ubiquitous
that that's gonna be it's like nothing the world's ever seen before
like that's what you're saying too
oh yeah yeah it's wild
yeah yeah but it's also
from another perspective like
Louis C.K. says you know it's like
he gets in an airplane
he's taken off and
and suddenly they say oh yeah
so we've got wireless internet on the airplane
now and he's like what
you have the internet on the airplane
you know and then eventually there's
technical malfunctions
and the next time he flies it's like oh sorry
the internet's not working and
what the hell come on man
say how quickly you're just entitled to
internet on the airplane all the time
you're literally flying through the sky
and watching cat videos on youtube
and you're the second that one of those two things
is taken away from you you're like what is this the Dark Ages
yeah or worse
it's not even taken away from you it just takes
a second to load and it's like
give it a second it's going
to space
so um
did you have any predictions on what
this advance in DeepMind
means for the future well the biggest thing
that we've already seen is that
Google has been
very sharing with
regards to
machine learning technology for people
who want to have
machines learn how to do things do you think
it's a good thing or a bad thing extremely good thing
it seems good from an egalitarian point of view
but on the other hand it
also kind of maybe will speed the apocalypse
well maybe
also kind of maybe might end the world
maybe maybe but
honestly maybe it's important
yeah the question though is
how much is it moving the needle versus how much is it
moving the needle the other way because
I think that the technology is being developed
you know regardless
whether we like it or not and
the more of it that is public
and open source and available
and
the group
the majority
everybody rather than
somebody in a room
is getting the advantage you know
I wonder if this is a lot like publishing
how to make nuclear weapons
right like it would have been really cool
if no one who didn't know how to make a nuclear weapon
could find out how to make a nuclear weapon by just looking it up in a book
that this might be we might look back
this could go great
but we might look back and be like man that sucked
we shouldn't have just given that information to anybody who wanted it
they should have at least had to have had the skill
to get that information themselves
on the other hand based on our episode with
Chase open source software
I really if it gets to the point where there's
a lot of AIs running around in the world
would want all the AIs that I
rely on for anything to be open source
sure absolutely I do not want
a corporation to lock my AI
behind a box and be fully
in control of that and I have no idea what's going on in there
I would like like Facebook
like you were talking about earlier
we'd like it to be open to the community
so they can audit it and
we don't have access to the algorithms that it uses
to show us what campaign ads we were
seeing last year that sort of thing
in fact in an important way Facebook doesn't have
access to see what Facebook is doing because it doesn't know
what it's on machine learning algorithms are showing
or alternatively Mark Zuckerberg is going to run
for president in the next eight years
I'd vote for Mark Zuckerberg I mean I would vote for
literally any American right now
I'm saying it in eight years though
you don't know who will be running in eight years
