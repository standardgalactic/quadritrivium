early on of who has the rights to Dota,
because one of the things that was really interesting
about Dota is that no game company made it.
It was just some people with a modification.
Dota was a mod for Warcraft 3.
Right, and so Dota,
as a mod for Warcraft 3,
turned into a game that eventually spawned
three new games
that became bigger than Warcraft.
And it's like, wow, it's funny.
Counter-Strike was a mod to Half-Life.
Oh, wow, I didn't know that.
Yeah, yeah. The original Counter-Strike
was a mod to Half-Life, and that...
I mean, to me, that's very interesting
because it was a whole new game,
which eventually became its own game.
But the thing with Dota that really I found awesome
about it was that it was a mod that created
a new genre of game. A new type
of how to play games on the computer.
And that I don't think I'd seen before
from a mod of an existing game anyway.
Lots and lots and lots of cool stuff.
I think technology is...
It's very promising.
Hopefully AlphaGo lets us keep playing games.
Yeah, so we're at about the...
We're at about the one hour mark.
Do you have any predictions
or thoughts as to what AlphaGo's
existence and presence
means to
humanity as a whole, either game playing
or more generally?
Can I add a sub to that question,
which was a year ago, we talked about
how estimates of AGI went up
after AlphaGo kicked ass against Leastadol
because it beat
predictions. In fact, I was...
I got to reading Different Intelligence pretty late
to the game. I was reading it a few months ago.
And Nick Bostrom was talking
about how it seems like maybe by the end of the decade
we can have a Go winning...
Oh, we can have a Go robot that can beat humans.
And that happened in 2015?
It was not expected to happen until
2020 or later.
He put it tentatively towards the end of the decade.
Yeah, it wasn't even until 2016
that AlphaGo was legitimately
better than any human.
I don't even think his claim was
like the deep blue of Go.
I think it was just like, can be competitive.
Oh, yeah, it wasn't until 2015 that they could
even win against anybody.
That's awesome. So with that in mind, as far as
the trajectory for
AGI arrival and
I guess just... I wanted to just put that
flavor on Enya's question.
Yeah, I think...
I mean, I don't know.
I'm rooting for Google.
I'm hoping for DeepMind.
There's a variety of different
approaches. There are some people who...
You know, I think like Facebook's approach
is a little bit more put everybody in the matrix
and that's how they're going to save us from AGI.
And I think that... That? Really?
Yeah, I think...
Facebook's approach is very much...
Nobody's going to make
an AI that kills us all if everybody's in the matrix.
Damn good.
And maybe the AI will let us...
Where did you get that impression? Has Zuckerberg said something of that effect?
Look at all of the actions and all of the strategies
and all of the different types
of mechanisms that
Facebook uses.
No.
Zuckerberg has not explicitly stated that.
So what is it that Facebook does that makes you think
that that is there?
They move more and more and more of people
they're functioning into a place
into a vehicle that Facebook controls.
Yeah.
That could just be
regular business pursuing business goals.
The more people are forced to use Facebook
the more money they make.
And the more time in app the more
ad exposure. Increase revenue.
Yeah. All those are
real valuable as well.
But there's only so many humans on earth
and the amount of
engagement for the humans...
Okay. Let's put it another way.
When you
use Google
your search history is available to you
and you can
search for anything you want. You just
type whatever it is you want to know about
and it gives you that information.
Facebook's approach
is very different. Facebook's
approach is
wildly
obfuscating. It's not built for
search. You can't just type into the
search bar of Facebook and find
all of the
key work. You can't get
all of the same information searching
all of your... You could search for the names of the people
you know and you can search for certain types of things
but you don't have access to
an encyclopedic reference
of every post every person's made
directly in such a searchable fashion.
Facebook is shitty is the shorthand that I use.
Facebook is
also set up to train you.
It's set up to have
your eyes look at things that are advertisements
and not know they're advertisements. It puts
things in different places
to trick your eyes into taking more of the information
and to get you to click on certain
links and it auto plays things
to try to force you to look at them
and it tries to sculpt your behavior.
Facebook is...
I had a fantastic episode about this recently
but that's all...
To me that's all like
the standard predatory business of
I want all of your
attention all the time for all humans
because that is
what I am motivated to seek
because I can sell your attention.
But what's the endgame?
At a certain point you don't need to sell anything
when you have everything.
I don't think there is an endgame.
It's just the endgame is
give me more of your attention
all the time because that's what
translates into dollars for them right now
and I don't think they have an ending goal
it's just perverse incentives.
So Franco Simoto
is a guy who
made the first magic strategy website
many years ago and hit a bunch of stuff for the internet
he
recently introduced me to this concept of
the difference between infinite games
and finite games.
In a finite game the players
objective is to win the game.
The way they do this is they
take more power
until they win the game.
They just are seizing power
until they win the game and then the game is over.
The way a finite game works
and the way that an infinite game works
is that you
get better at the game
so that you can keep playing.
Like if you for instance
are trying to do some ritualistic
speedrun against yourself
you are
actually trying to get better
so that you get to keep playing
because if you improve your time
by one one hundredth of a second
now you have the next game
and the difference between
games where the purpose is to keep playing
where you have to keep leveling up
versus games where you want
to destroy and end the game
I think that it's not clear
I don't think every human is on the same page
about
wanting the game to keep going
I personally am a big fan
