case that GPT three was trained on much more data also. Well, you know what that means everyone just
keep writing shit on the internet. But not like fake Chinese research shit because that's just
going to make things worse. Yeah. Yeah. And also don't use GPT three to do it because that will
poison the future dataset, but only write really intelligent and correct things. There we go.
That's that's what I've been trying to tell people for a long time. But now we have an
imperative to do it beyond mere beyond mere kindness and intellectual rigor. This is for the
security of our of our future Oracle AI. You want to make God stupid?
Okay. With that being said, I believe we are done. All right. We should do the thing that we always
do at the end of the episode and think a patron. And we are thinking a special patron today.
It's this guy that you might have heard of Wes Fenza. There's the little hi Wes next to his name
on our list, which is cute. I think that was you that put that in there. It probably was. That was
me. Okay. Okay. We can share credit. Yeah. I'll tell you. I don't know. I assumed it was you because
you knew Wes before any of us. I did. Oh, well, he had been on the he'd been on the show, I think
before he subs before he subbed and we talked on discord and stuff. But it doesn't matter. Wes,
you rock and thanks for giving us some of your money. Absolutely. You are helping bring all this
to everybody and helping us to someday train our future. Hopefully not stupid God.
You have a podcast to the Patreon, you know exactly what you're doing and so we and why
why it's appreciated. So thank you. Yeah.
All right. Great. Now I can leave the sign defect out.
Yeah. As you mentioned, Wes also has a podcast that you could check out.
Which we should plug right here since he did, you know, so kindly help sponsor us.
His podcast is the mind killer. I am also on that one. And in the most recent episode,
we talked about the whole Chinese fake research papers being published, which is bad, very bad.
We actually only talked about it very briefly, but that's what that was a reference to. So
listen to that one too. And thank you, Wes. You owe us even more money now for this.
Daniel, thank you so much for your time. This is awesome. And I'll try not to
inundate you with questions on discord when I think of something.
I'll probably. No, please. Well, all right. You've, you've opened the door.
Perfect. You're ready. You're welcome to close it anytime when it becomes annoying.
All right. All right. All right. It was great to talk to you. And yeah, thank you very much.
Thank you. And we'll see everybody in two weeks. Bye.
