I think a lot of people, people like me who are, you know, have an engineer layman's knowledge
of AI and people, I think like Daniel look at it and they say, okay, there's really something to
this transformer architecture. I see a lot of reason to believe that if you take this transformer
architecture with attention and you make it bigger and you make it more complex in a small
number of ways that we, that we kind of know we can do already and you feed it more data,
we absolutely expect that it will be. You've got those emergent properties.
Yeah, it'll level up pseudo linearly, basically. And that's, and there's a, there's a great,
there's a great quote from one of the authors of the paper, which is he believes in the,
the law of straight lines on graphs. If you, if you, if you look at graphs of performance of GPT,
like style architectures versus, you know, number of parameter, number of parameters in the model,
you start getting scarily close to human performance on everything about three orders of
magnitude larger than what GPT, GPT is right now, which isn't actually technically out of reach of,
of budgets of like modern national companies, like, you know, it would be in the billions of
dollars to do this kind of thing now. But it's like, that's, that's nuts. Like that, that no one
thought we were that close to being able to win at every task we could write down this quickly.
And we're already, we already know how to win on all of these things if you, if you just like,
try hard enough, the supervised way. So it's like, I really, this is like a moment like that,
where we're, we're frustratingly close to seeing these sorts of things be
performant on every available axis. And it's only, you know, a couple of orders of magnitude away.
And there's no reason to expect these trends to not keep going because they've held for like
seven orders of magnitude already. You've said on every single axis, but does that include the
axis of understanding that there is a physical world made out of atoms that it is running on?
Because I don't get the impression that GPT has any, like, any ability itself reflect or to know
that things exist outside of its programming and its data. Yeah. So I think this is a mostly
philosophical point. I would reframe it as what are, what are you trying to get GPT to do that
relies on that? And then your answer to that question would, would shape how I would suggest
you use GPT to solve that problem. I'm trying to do new physics by understanding how the world
actually exists. I think, I think understanding how the world actually exists is a, a deeply
anthropically biased notion of, of the way things are air quotes. And it is actually entirely
plausible that something like GPT would either be able to contribute to answer such a question,
just the way it is as, as a kind of next token predictor, or in so doing solving it that way,
it will pick up a notion of how the world actually is. That's probably not a satisfying answer,
because it's like, it's like, you, you, you clearly have an intuition that it's missing
something because it's just, it's just picking, it's just predicting tokens, right? It's just
saying what, what the next word is. But I claim, and this is controversial, I would say, that just
being able to, being able to predict next tokens as well as it can is indicative that there's something
very interesting going on inside, that it's, it actually is capturing something very much
like a notion of how the world actually is. It has associative thinking, which is interesting,
because it can be creative. I think it could be really cool for generating a bunch of ideas,
if you're a physicist, just by kind of, I don't know, I, as a like artist and writer,
sometimes would just use like text scramblers, or like different kinds of generators. And often
they weren't giving me like the thing I was looking for, like a new idea for a video game
mechanic, or a name for an app or something. But like, it generates things that sort of like,
you're like, Oh, wait, okay. And stuff you wouldn't have thought of. I could see it doing that.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, totally. It's, I mean, it's people already use it for, for story writing.
Like, people on Twitter have been like, I was stuck in my story, I like plugged a,
plugged a couple of sentences of where I was stuck. And then like hit go and it like,
plausibly continued the story in a way that unblocked them. And it's like, that's,
I can't tell if Enush looks nervous or excited. No, that is, that is a hell of a tool because
that is a problem you've run in. I don't know how often people run into it, but it is certainly a
well known problem in the field where like, you just hit a block and writer's block. Yeah. And if
you just bust through that one block and it can just keep flowing. There's blocks in a lot of
fields where like any field where you're trying to do new stuff. You know, something horrible
about that though is like, I did, I did try that out of curiosity one time where I was like,
I don't know how this conversation between these two characters needs to continue. And I fed it
in and then it gave me the next line. And I was like, that's perfect. I'm going to use that. And
now I don't feel like this is mine anymore. You're just a predictive generator on your own.
You had one line of help. I mean, I mean, it's, it's a, it was a, honestly, a thing that created
some struggle in me. I was like, can I use this and still feel ownership of this thing? I mean,
and then where's the line, right? Like, yeah, that was just one line. But what if half of the
thing had been written by, by the AI, right? That would start to feel and indeed be a little bit
different than a person writing a thing. So I don't know, it gave me, I mean, we're already at
the point where we're having the sorts of dilemmas that you find in science fiction, I think, where
it's like this, it's not smarter than you, but it did solve that problem that you couldn't solve.
I do like look forward to, I was like talking to Phoenix on the drive over because I was reading
them permutation city. And that's like Greg Eagan novel. In the beginning of the story,
the main character is looking through her email. And there are the, like these holographic things
that come out. And there's this holographic salesperson that comes out and she generates a
holographic auto responder that looks and talks exactly like her to talk to the salesperson.
And I feel like there were some other levels of abstraction there too. And I was just like,
okay, when can I deploy my auto responder that can pretend to be me on the phone with like my
healthcare provider? Because I feel like humans right now are so bogged down with so much automated
stuff that like, or I don't know, like my email, I've got like 50 emails a day and a bunch of my
different email addresses and most of it's spam. This totally exists. One of my friends has such
a service for his phone. He doesn't answer phone calls. He has an AI powered assistant answer
his phone for him. And he posted this great transcript, which was his AI powered assistant
talking to another AI, trying to get his assistant to like, you know, answer like some survey or
something. And it was just a great cyberpunk to us. It's on Facebook. I don't know if it's easily
linked. I will I will endeavor to try talking his voice. Like is it plausibly him this like a text
based thing? Yeah, not not yet. But that tech exists. So yeah, not not long. You know, to Matt's
question, I am wondering if in a generation from now, we will get like nowadays, we have speed runs
that are assisted and unassisted. If in the future, we will have fiction that is assisted
and assisted fiction. And then there'll be scandals where it's like, yes, I have proof that they
actually there was there was one line that these two characters said to each other. Yeah. Yeah,
you know, one prediction I have actually for the near to midterm is that arguing on the internet
will be dead. I think I think I might have mentioned this on Facebook at some point. Because when you
can make a yeah, when you can make a bot who a GPT three can basically do this already, it's just
a matter of like building kind of the framework around it to turn it into an agent. If you know
what I mean, if you can make a bot that can pass as a person in a chat room on Facebook on Twitter,
which again, I think I think we are there. I think it's more of like building the chassis that
connects it to the service. You just tell it, all right, you are a person who believes these things
and go forth and argue tirelessly for my position forever and seek out the people who disagree and
just hound them and never let up. And then eventually there's there's just these things
harassing each other. And humans look upon the wasteland that they've created, there's no way
to tell that their eyes because they're indistinguishable. And we can't use Twitter anymore. We can't use
Facebook anymore. We can't use chat rooms anymore. We have to talk to each other face to face.
Well, no, you could use those things as long as you know which individual person you're talking
to as an actual person, if it's someone you know in real life, if you if you can make sure that
somehow. Yes, the joke is in the real. Yeah, the joke on and credit has been for years. Everyone's
a bot except for you. And in three years, that'll be true. Yeah, I can actually write that right now.
I think so. I mean, really reckless. So you could absolutely write a bot that
that does what he's describing. You would have to add the extra trappings around like the Twitter
the Twitter plugin that like has it actually go seek out people and respond to them. But like,
yeah, I'm literally willing to pay $1,000 for this right now. This sounds amazing. I would like to
run on Twitter for your like literature because no, no, no, no, to just make a bot that'll take
the positions I wanted. Like I am looking forward to burning down these terrible,
terrible commons. Yeah, so please, if someone wants $1,000 and can do this, holy shit.
Exactly. That's the thing for me. I don't actually want to make a bot that will argue
for my positions. I just want the commons to be burned down. I agree with you because it is bad
for us. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm looking at a head start using humans. Yeah, no, I'm looking at some
of the stuff people have done with it. And apparently you can feed it a bunch of Abraham
Lincoln's writings and then generate a fake Abraham Lincoln. And I'm just thinking like,
this is also going to be great for simulation based things where
Oh, can you combine Abraham Lincoln's corpus and Adolf Hitler's corpus?
You probably can.
And give it an award at
Abraham Lincoln.
I think some people were like, I think it might have been Scott Alexander was like write a
chapter Harry Potter in the style of
Wasn't it Lord of the Rings, actually?
I don't remember the, it was something along the lines of
I think he typed like a sentence from Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit and it just continued
something like that. And it knew the characters and it was saying like,
yes, and then they all marched victoriously into battle and Gandalf was at the lead on his
deed. I think that was GPT two.
Yeah. Oh, there's a new GPT three can do that in the style of Ernest Hemingway.
You know, like, like, like, and then you read it and you're like, yep, that's the style of Ernest
Hemingway. Yeah, it's fan fiction is about to get a lot better.
Yeah, that's what's kind of crazy and hilarious about it is like, it can do this kind of thing.
And yet it can't do some surprising things. And that that to me, I'm just like, well, that's
to my mind, I feel like if you just give it more examples of that sort of thing, it'll get there too.
And so again, that's why I'm like, yeah, just make it bigger and give it more training data.
And if there are specific things you need to be able to get it to do, then
you're going to have to feed it examples of that.
GPT is soon going to put every short erotica writer out of business.
Yeah, it's holy crap.
I mean, this is like literally already is happening, like people on Twitter are literally doing this
already, like is happening. Yeah, I think that's happening within, I think within this year,
actually, yeah, that that would be a thing.
Within this year, like the next 12 months or the next four months?
I don't know. I think next 12 months, GPT, OpenA is actually just unlocked there,
or not unlocked. They've described their pricing plan for what they're going to charge users to
to get access to it. And it's like surprisingly, like affordable.
I think it's like $10 a month or something for something like 3000 words of text.
It's, it's, you could absolutely destroy the world with this tech.
If you, if you were like a bad actor and they didn't stop you from doing it,
which they probably got some words of texting per month or what per prompt that you give it.
I think that's per month.
That's not that much.
But that's the $10 a month level.
I get the feeling that we may know someone who has access to this
and could pirate it for us.
I mean, that, so that's, that's an interesting, because like it's only
100 gigs. Is that correct? Or was that the last one?
Oh, no, it's, it's the, the model itself is a, is on the order of a hundred.
Yeah. I don't know.
So that's the thing is it took millions of dollars to train. It took, it took
immense compute resources to train. But the thing about these machine learning things in
general, which has a general feature, is that you can fit them on a thumb drive once they're
trained. And so I think it's inevitable that you're going to have, you know, piracy of,
of these giant, extremely powerful models.
So I should be looking for a career in training these things.
Well, I did change careers into this.
Yeah.
I'm thinking like you're, okay, Cupid profile, like just
trying it to write the perfect okay, Cupid profile.
You probably ask it. You probably just ask it.
Daniel, you want to ask it to write the perfect okay, Cupid profile?
All right.
We're doing it live.
Nice.
And doesn't that really vary by who you're trying to attack? Attract?
Because different people's perfect okay, Cupid profile is going to be drastically different.
Maybe you just, not everyone likes job files.
Probably make it be you, right? Like, except then it runs it for you. So you don't have to.
Well, that's the thing. You can, you, you, that would be up to you to give it the right priming.
Be like, write the perfect profile for this person who has these characteristics, which
Yeah, make it like half me, but half Abraham Lincoln.
Is GPT two still open source?
I think so.
Actually, that one was what like four or seven gigs or something.
Like that was definitely enough to have on your phone, like as a whole, right?
All right. I have, I have the perfect okay, Cupid.
Okay.
Here we go.
You're going to have to say this.
I believe in the importance.
I believe in the importance of a good joke and a good book.
I also believe in the importance of a good meal.
I'm a big fan of The Simpsons and the Big Bang Theory.
I also enjoy Family Guy, South Park, The Office.
It's always sunny in Philadelphia, 30 Rock and a few others.
I like a lot of TV shows.
I like to listen to a lot of podcasts.
I spend a lot of time at the gym.
I'm on a kickboxing class that I love.
I also like to run and swim.
I'm not sure how I'll incorporate these things into my future family life,
but I know it keeps going on.
Oh my God.
