And he kind of points out how many things he had on his side.
Yeah, I don't even know if it's a slow slide into this sort of thing.
It's almost approaching the edifice of mathematics wrong from the start
because I don't think Eliezer ever would have become a crank
even if he hadn't yet been convinced that Cantor's diagonalization argument was wrong
just because it's a really subtle argument and even professional mathematicians
when Cantor first posed it were like, this is nuts, Cantor, you're crazy.
But eventually it's the whole philosophy of science thing
where you make an argument about a thing and then people are like,
oh, that contradicts my intuitions and then they fight for a while
and then eventually they kind of, I think that whole sketch there is subtle
and a slightly different failure mode than is sketched by this sequence.
Interesting.
Have you ever figured out, you said within one document
they will vary drastically in font selection and colors?
Yeah.
Do you know why that is? Is there some reason?
That's not just in math.
I have a lot of experience with people who just like,
I don't know, it's like my parent generation, people using computers.
They seem to think that like, I'm just remembering like one of the doctor coordinators
who writes a letter every Monday and she always decides to just put like,
okay, we're going to have like gigantic font like Happy Monday y'all
and it'll be in pink and we'll do a cool font.
And then like, I think it's just that like, oh, like typography is not a thing that they ever learned.
So it's kind of like, oh, look, I have all these choices of cool things I can do with the fonts
like, oh, like I can pick whatever color I want.
Why wouldn't I pick bright purple?
Yeah.
If you're writing a dumb office newsletter, just bolding the important parts
because you know everyone's going to skim this piece of shit anyway.
No, that wasn't what she's doing.
This is a woman who is clearly just sort of picking a different font and color and size for every line.
Yeah, it's sort of, it's like,
just deciding to italicize things.
Professional, professional mathematicians do have their own like, you know,
set of ways that they create emphasis in mathematical typography.
And like, it's sort of a cranks way of like trying to make emphasis,
not knowing the orthodox way to do it.
So they'll like, you know, bold things or italicize things or make things larger font to try.
It's like a poor person's approximation of trying to add rigor by like making complex typography.
I think that's what's going on, but I'm not sure.
It does seem interesting that like the cranks and conspiracy theorists seem to be on the same axis to me.
And I wonder if it's like, it's just the type of person who their stance as they approach the world is not,
I just don't want to do it the way you're telling me to do it, period,
about everything that they've ever encountered since they were a child.
And that not only includes doing math the way their teacher told them to do it,
but also formatting documents the way they were told to do it.
It's like a deep, a constitutional error that they're making that has influenced everything.
Yeah, I agree with that.
I did, to come back to the post, I found that this was sort of,
at least in my opinion, felt like it was hinting at a later post that he makes called Privileging to Hypothesis,
where like, for some reason, to do a complete fluke, just a little mistake he made,
he now had this fixation on cantors, as opposed to any of the other possible major theorems of mathematics,
and there was no reason for it, aside from random chance.
Yeah, and it sounded like, I mean, that also like ties into anchoring, but I like the idea,
because I feel like this is something I had done before, might have done easily,
I could empathize with it, of like, oh, I've seen a flaw in this thing, and then like,
aha, I got one over on you cantor's theorem, and then it's like, oh no, it punched back.
Well, now I gotta get revenge, it's like this very sort of like, anthropomorphizing,
I guess in this case, a theorem, but like,
And it certainly gets worse if you convince yourself that you're right.
Or like, a little bit right, what did he say, like,
I made a mistake, that was all, I was not really right deep down, I did not win a moral victory,
I was not displaying ambition or skepticism or any other wondrous virtue,
it was not a reasonable error, I was not half right, or even the tiniest fraction, right?
I thought a thought that I never would have thought if I had been wiser,
and that was all there ever was to it, and like, coming down pretty hard on himself,
I think, but important for the sequence, but like, I don't know,
I worry a little bit sometimes about like, how often he sort of chastises his past self,
because I'm like, you were a little kid.
I mean, he came out looking pretty good in the post, so.
Do you guys ever read the comments on these?
This is a tangent, but.
I did way back in the day when they were first being posted,
I do not have any memory of that 13 years ago, and I don't usually go over them again now.
It's just funny, because whenever I accidentally see one, I'm like,
Oh my God, this is such a meaningless nitpick.
It's a shame this is immortalized on this document forever.
I think now and then there's some good ones.
It's a proud, rationalist tradition to meaninglessly nitpick things.
I follow.
You're about to.
We disagree about this, Dale, but okay.
I was going to say, actually, like.
You know I'm not serious.
I know, I know.
It depends on, I guess, which sequence it is,
but I got a lot of value out of reading some of the comments to some sequences
to the point where my memory of,
I think there's things that I remember being in the sequences that I think were from the comments.
Yes.
And that makes it awkward.
So it ends with, until you admit you were wrong, you cannot get on with your life.
Your self image will still be bound to the old mistake.
You are being offered the opportunity to become a crackpot.
I'm chopping it up a little.
If no one bothers to argue with you, or if you never tell anyone your idea,
you may still be a crackpot.
Say oops and get on with your life.
And my big comment on this is, well, first of all,
he's again reiterating the, one of the central values of rationality is being able to admit you're wrong
and criticize your own ideas and just admit it and, you know, update your view on the world.
But my main comment on this is that due to other things,
this is why I value open discourse so much.
And I think this is why rationalists in general value freedom of speech,
because it gives you the ability to find out that you're wrong,
rather than have that ability removed from you entirely,
because you can't even find out if you can't talk about these things.
Yeah, I really wish that this was, I mean,
people are starting to talk or maybe they have been for a while about the value of failure,
or the value of making mistakes and noticing them, like, maybe particularly making mistakes.
I spent a lot of my life being pathologically, like, risk averse.
Like, I did, I was so cautious, I didn't do a lot of things.
And then, like, you don't learn if you don't try things and mess up.
And I think that kind of similarly, like, there's something important about being told you're wrong,
and then, or like, you know, coming to your own conclusion, like, oh, I guess I was wrong about this
being able to update that I think, like, postmodernism and pop psychology is really against,
like, it feels bad to be wrong.
And, like, I feel like there's this sort of cultural, well, we got to protect people's feelings thing.
And also, like, people have to be able to save face and there's always got to be this while there's,
you know, everybody has their own truth, or like, you know, nobody here is, like, wrong or bad,
like, it's just everybody, you know, we all have an opinion and it's like, that's not how concrete facts work, though.
So, like, very often people are actually just wrong.
And I think it would be cool if it was more socially acceptable, socially celebrated even to come out and say,
like, hey, I thought this thing, but then it turned out I did some math and I was wrong.
You know, like the whole replication crisis, I guess, kind of a lot of things.
Yeah, I think that I think that people feel it as an attack on their ego when they're wrong.
Yeah, like, you're wrong and you're a bad person for having been wrong.
Like, I feel this strongly in, I don't know, maybe this is unique, but in a bad way, but like,
I wish I had kind of absorbed these memes like five years earlier because so much of my, like, high school and college was,
was me taking like every bad grade as like a reflection on me as a human being, instead of just being like,
okay, I'm, I'm wrong. I obviously don't understand this and it's, and being wrong is actually good.
And now I've learned that I don't understand it and I need to improve.
And there's just a lot of unnecessary struggle there for me until, until I was really able to absorb like,
oh, I just don't understand it yet. I'm not a bad person.
Like, yeah.
There's an excellent sequence from the replacing guilt series that I think titled update from the sucker punch,
where the idea is, okay, like, you made a mistake, you failed, or you were wrong about something.
Like, what was the lesson that you learned from this? Okay, like, have you internalized that?
Do you like feel the pain of that? Okay, cool.
Now, like, you can update and now you can get rid of all the guilt and shame because you've learned your lesson.
And it's such a simple thing, but like reading, I don't know, the entire sequence also, of course, puts a lot more like,
it does a lot more intuition pumps that help you really get like, dig your fingernails underneath this thing and pry it out.
But I realized that that was just like, a thing that had been part of my psyche for so long.
Yeah, it's hard because so much of, so much of like, social technology is built around consensus.
And oftentimes, the things that one can admit to being wrong about are like, like sacred consensus building truths of communities.
And it just makes everything so horribly poisonous when you're trying to seek truth around that whole cluster of hard to hard to talk about things.
It's a terrible prior for truth seeking.
Yeah, there's like the thing where a celebrity said something bad 10 years ago.
And since then, they've completely like, oh, I, you know, I was dick in the past.
I completely changed my mind about this thing.
That was bad and wrong.
And I was dumb and young and I shouldn't have done that.
And like, I'm sorry.
And that's not enough.
It's just like, you said a thing once and now you're bad forever.
Like,
I think there's, I think there's like easier examples.
Like, if someone points out that you're pronouncing a word wrong, like, I feel like this happened to me all the time.
Yeah, same here.
And this wasn't six months ago.
This was a few years ago, but I used to pronounce epitome because that's how it's spelled.
And that's, there's a word for I only ever read the word, never heard it.
And so you, you speak it phonetically, not the way it's supposed to be said.
Most of my vocabulary.
And so most of my life has involved people laughing at my pronunciation of things that I've only ever read.
Right.
But like, so when someone corrects my corrects my pronunciation on something.
Oh, you know what?
Actually this happened recently with David reached out and said I was misusing the word.
David.
And, and he was like, would you, would you mind if I corrected your, your miss, miss speaking on something?
I'm like, no, now I will be less stupid and sound less stupid for the rest of my life.
Like, thank you.
So like, this is like a really low emotional hit learning lesson.
And that's the kind of thing that like everyone, I think should feel that way.
But every time they're wrong about something.
And like, I think everyone, what, what is it going to do?
Dig your heels in the sand and say, no, my way is right.
You guys are all idiots.
Like, so if everyone can do this on small things, it's just a matter of scaling up that skill to bigger things.
Being able to just laugh at yourself is invaluable.
And I honestly, I don't think I had that skill until I was like 30.
So same.
I mean, that, that's hard though, like, because it requires a certain amount of self confidence.
I have heard that if you succeeded everything you do, you are obviously not trying things that are hard enough.
Because you should have some rate of failure or, or you're really just not reaching your potential.
Yeah, yep.
I agree.
Anything else?
Should we get to our main topic?
Yeah, let's do that.
But before we will next time talk about, oh, okay, here's a question.
The next post in the lesser on sequences is called radical honesty.
And we kind of already did an entire episode on radical honesty.
Do we want to just skip that one?
We could do the two minutes synopsis.
If there's any points in there that we didn't, you know, that are worth pulling out.
Okay.
