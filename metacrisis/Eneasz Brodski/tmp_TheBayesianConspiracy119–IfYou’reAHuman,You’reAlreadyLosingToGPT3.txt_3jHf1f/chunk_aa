You
Welcome to the Basin Conspiracy, I'm Inyash Brodsky, I'm Steven Zuber, I'm Jay Sticky, and I'm Matt Freeman, and I'm Daniel.
Oh my gosh, guests.
The two that you just can't stop from talking about AI.
It's true.
Well, here at Work for Encouraging It, the subject of today's episode is GBT-3.
Indeed it is. Oh, we should have covered this before we start the episode. Have you guys read the sequences?
Yes.
The two specifically for today?
Yes.
Okay, so would you like to join us on the conversation or do you not care about that?
That sounds fun to me.
I'm happy to join, yeah.
Okay.
I can probably knock Mountain in five minutes.
Yeah.
Like, Anchoring is easy and established, although I think it has been, like, less overblown in the last decade than it was when this was published, but it's still a thing.
Anchoring is still a super useful concept, though, because I feel like it's one that I am aware of and use all the time.
I don't know if use is the right word, but, like, use the fact of being aware of it.
We should quickly mention what it is then.
The first post that we talk about is Anchoring and Adjustment.
It's the title of it.
And it basically covers the phenomenon known as Anchoring, which I believe we are all very familiar with now, but to quickly reiterate what it is.
It's when you are seeing, shown a number or made aware of a number, a number is brought to your consciousness.
Your brain kind of uses that as an anchor for whatever the next thing that you're thinking about is, even if they are absolutely unrelated in any way.
The common one, the experiment that's cited in this study is someone rolls a wheel of fortune type thing to get a random number and then asks people questions that are somewhere in the range of that number.
I believe it was, like, how many countries in Africa are in the United Nations?
Yeah.
And the wheel is that, like, it's fixed to stop on a number, but it seems like a random number.
Well, for the study, yeah, it was a low ball or a high ball number.
And then the two groups of the study would anchor on the higher, the low number, adjusting up or down, or, you know, somewhere within the range of whatever number they were shown.
But you can get, like, insane shit like this, like asking people their zip code and then how many doctors do you think practice in the state of California, or what was the one that someone did to me in college?
It was some anchor and then, like, how long do you think the Mississippi River is?
Okay.
And what was fun is the teacher, like, had the question up on the whatever projector or whatever it was we were using.
And, like, half the class was to not look at the, like, not to look first and then the second half was to look later and the anchor number was different.
And the, I can't remember how significant the result was because the teacher would have gone off and done it the next day, but I'm sure she found something because that all rings a bell.
It has a really strong effect whenever they test it.
And I want to point out that, like, anchoring doesn't just work on numbers, although that's what they focus on in this sequence, but things like proposing solutions to a problem.
If, I don't know, the example of you're in a boardroom and it's like, okay, we're, you know, a business, we have this problem.
I was thinking about doing this, but what do you all think?
If you start with that, then everybody's going to anchor on whatever you said and kind of, like, propose solutions that are in line with that, or that are, like, variations on that, where you'd get original solutions if you didn't say,
well, here's what I was thinking of and here's a few other, you know, things, but, like, really, what do you guys think?
So if you want a variety of answers, you tell people to think them first and then write down and share after.
If you want to railroad your own solution, you kind of present it first.
Yeah, I was going to say, I wondered how general a concept this is, because it seems like a very naturally human thing to just kind of perturb around where you have been primed in concept space.
And I feel like you could show that this is just, like, what humans do in general as a problem-solving prior, is, like, start from some base and then move around there.
And that's just, like, it's a bias, but it's actually an effective bias sometimes.
I think it's really similar or connected to the social proof idea, because we do sort of just, like, look around to see what everybody else is doing in order to see, like, okay, I have an idea.
Or maybe, you know, I have an idea, is this acceptable? Are other people kind of thinking the same kind of thing?
Or, like, I don't have an idea, but I better find one quick. What are other people thinking? I better just not agree. Oh, yeah, me too.
Yeah, this one time I was in, like, a probabilistic risk assessment course, like, a professional, like, week-long course.
And they were showing, like, you know, they'd show a whole bunch of grains of corn on the screen or something, and they'd be like, how many grains of corn is it?
And I was like, ah, this is an anchoring guessing thing. And I just was like, okay, I think I'm supposed to say, like, 50, so I'm going to say, like, 300.
And then I was, like, the most wrong out of anyone because I overcompensated way too much, and it was really embarrassing.
At least you're a fun outlier, though.
Yeah, well, so I think if I have a point, it's that you can't compensate for anchoring just by randomly throwing yourself away from the anchor, necessarily.
I don't actually know an easy straightforward algorithm for not.
Yeah, well, actually, at the end of the sequence, they say, try to think of an anchor in the opposite direction.
Or wait, I'll just, like, I guess read the whole thing.
Do biasing manipulations for anchoring have generally proved not very effective?
I'd suggest these two.
First, if the initial guess sounds implausible, try to throw it away entirely and come up with a new estimate rather than sliding from the anchor.
But this in itself may not be sufficient.
Subjects instructed to avoid anchoring still seem to do so.
So second, even if you're trying the first method, try also to think of an anchor in the opposite direction, an anchor that's clearly too small or too large, instead of too large or too small, and dwell on it briefly.
So actually, maybe the correct thing to do is, like, okay, they want me to say 50.
So I'm tempted to say 500, maybe in between there.
Another possible lesson is that there is time pressure.
And in reality, if it was an important decision, I could have just counted the grains.
And maybe the lesson is, if possible, just get more data in a situation where you feel like you need to make a snap judgment.
But no, maybe you need to just actually figure it out or figure out how to get closer to the estimate.
Treat all information like an info has it.
Including your experimental results.
Has there been, like, more research on this in the past 13 years?
I mean, I'm sure there has, but, like, on ways on how to avoid being anchored, but, like, does the thinking of some number in the opposite direction help at all?
I don't think a lot of research is done on, here's a cognitive bias, let's study ways to try to, like, that the rationalist community is kind of at the forefront of trying to overcome our biases.
A lot of clinical research is trying to still just figure out how we think, what we do in various situations.
I'm just wondering, like, if I were to go in before I was to ask for a raise and just think, like, I'm really worth a million dollars a year.
I should really just ask for a million dollars a year.
They did say that in the, they said it somewhere in the...
It says there's obvious applications in, say, salary negotiations or buying a car.
I won't suggest that you exploit it, but watch out for exploiters.
I don't know why he would suggest not to exploit it.
Yeah.
I think it's the...
I think it might as well just hide all my boss, you know.
Yeah.
Because that's star cards.
As soon as I saw that, I was like, I want to walk into a car dealership and be like, I think this car is worth about $200.
And then, and then just say that, like, 10 times and just get that anchor as low as possible.
I should have done that.
This was, there's a lot of talking anchoring.
Might even have its own chapter in influence science and practice.
Yeah, I was going to bring that up.
And like, I, I wish I'd done this when buying cars.
Now, at least the handful of dealerships, I haven't bought a car since 2013 up until January.
And every dealership I went to, they have the price.
It doesn't go up or down.
It doesn't include, or it does include lot fees, but like there's zero haggling.
And I even asked the guys, like, look, for real, if I gave you $500, you couldn't knock $1,000 off this car.
He's like, that I literally can't.
So I'm inclined to believe that that's actually the case because I offered to bribe somebody.
But that's such a strat, right?
Like, that's exactly what the car salesman Tennessee is like.
No, this is price.
It cannot change.
I am sorry.
But do you think that his commission with, you know, $1,000 less on the car plus $500 in his pocket and cash would be less than his commission if the car stayed at full price?
Well, I don't, I mean, it seems like it's not a commission thing.
It's just a car lot policy thing now where they cannot change the price.
Real question is, did you try just leaving being like, well, I'm not willing to buy for this price.
If you can knock 1,000 off, call me back and then go and never come back again.
I was able to have a much more aggressively in 2013 for the car I've got.
It was stickered at $800 and I walked out for exactly $5,000.
Oh, wow.
You got it down a bit.
I, well, and the way that I did that was like, I had exactly $5,200 from the insurance check from my previous car.
And I told him I had exactly five because I wanted to install the CD player in it.
So he was then when they're like, well, a lot fee this and that.
And I'm like, I don't have that.
And he's like, I've never seen a car deal fall through for $500.
So I was like, you're about to like, you're not going to be able to tell me I have more money than I have.
Like this is me wanting to get a car so I can stop getting rides to work.
And this is how much cash I've got.
Yeah, I mean, I left a bunch of dealerships.
No one called me and asked if, hey, can we lower the price for you?
They seemed that's, I don't know.
Maybe your mileage may vary in other places, but like it does work.
If you're selling a car on the street, like I said, I bet, you know, you said not to employ this as a dark art because it's, you know, taking advantage of people's biases, but it is something to be aware of.
Well, I know one counter to this that I haven't personally experienced, but that I've heard of someone else doing.
If someone gave him just like a really obviously low ball, like I think these cars were $200 and some new car.
They would say, I'm not doing business with you. Get out.
That's it. It's over. You have insulted me.
Like they took it personally and it worked. I guess they didn't get low ball anchored, but they also didn't get a sale.
Uh, Steve, I'm talking about influence.
I just remember that the, it is a book about how other people will try to exploit biases to manipulate you.
And the author recommends actually just pointing out the thing that they're doing.
And I love the way he explained it because it was like, okay, you've got this door to door salesman and they are like, Hey, here's a free gift.
Also, would you like to listen to my sales pitch and he'll just be like, Oh, that's the reciprocity thing.
This is okay. This is cool psychology. Sit down. Let me tell you about this.
And like the person will just sort of like the blood will drain out of their face. They're just like, okay, bye.
You're like, I read influence science and practice. This was in chapter two. Get off my doorstep.
Well, he actually was very friendly about it though, but he would just start excitedly and it's funny because I don't know if he was actually proposing that as a
Debiasing method or if he was just saying that like, this is what I did because I was so excited about it and I just been researching it.
So I was like, oh man, tell me more about your persuasive tactics and the person's just like, goodbye.
Cool. Anything else people wanted to say on this one before we go to the next one?
Anchoring is fun. Everyone should read influence science and practice.
At some point we need to contact the guy and see if we can just get a sponsorship deal going.
We've mentioned it like more than a dozen times in the past couple years.
He probably just enjoyed the free publicity. I mean, he's going to be an expert negotiator, right?
We're already giving it to him. It's not like he needs to pay us.
Tell him that you've mentioned it a hundred thousand times.
It's the most important cognitive trick you'll hear all day.
Okay, that's probably it for that one. The next one was the crackpot offer.
The crackpot offer. This is fun. Yotkowski says when he was very young,
he thought he found a disproof of Kantor's diagonal theorem,
a famous theorem which demonstrates the real numbers outnumber the rational numbers.
He then discovered he was wrong. The thought went through his mind,
I'll get that theorem eventually. Someday I'll disprove Kantor's diagonal argument,
even though my first try failed and he began to look for disproofs.
And fortunately he caught himself very quickly, says, and then I realized something.
I realized that I had made a mistake and that now that I'd spotted my mistake,
there was absolutely no reason to suspect the strength of Kantor's diagonal argument
any more than any other major theorems of mathematics.
I saw then very clearly that I was being offered the opportunity to become in math crank.
And to spend the rest of his life writing angry letters in green ink to math professors,
which he adds in parentheses, I'd read a book once about math cranks.
I guess that's a common, like, the green ink, huh?
I feel like maybe he's talking about having read Shirley or joking Mr. Feynman,
or one of the Feynman autobiographies. I think there were two or three.
I mean, this is actually a pretty common feature of having a physics department
associated email address is that you'll just get like 90 page word documents
and really crazy combinations of fonts and colors that are sketching their new
geometric theory of the universe.
Are you sub-tweeting someone?
No, I'm not even. I actually got multiple different ones of these from people.
I really hope there's a blog collating them somewhere.
I actually kind of feel bad because as a person that wants to seek the truth in the world,
you want to try to explain why they're wrong, but it's not actually possible
because there's actually kind of a reason why I'm going to devil's advocate on this a little bit
and claim that this sequence actually isn't really representative
of what it feels like on the inside to be a crank.
It's not like you can just suddenly realize that, ah, I could have done this.
It's more like you built an entire language that only you speak
that is unfalsifiable within its own little system that has been built
and trying to interact with that sort of system from kind of an orthodox system is almost impossible.
And I don't know if it's as easy as just noticing that you could have gone the wrong way.
It's an entire edifice of theory and internal trust in the methods of mathematics
that actually allows you to notice that, oh no, Cantor's theorem must be true
just because I believe all of the other steps of Cantor's theorem.
I think that like you're totally right about that,
especially once you've been doing this for all these years and built up this whole edifice
that your personality rests on.
But like if those people maybe in the very first step had just said, oh, I guess I made a mistake
and backed away, then they wouldn't have become cranks, which I think is what Eliezer's speaking.
Yeah, I don't think this is saying that it's easy.
It actually says like, I wonder how many people writing angry letters in green ink or 13
when they made that first fatal misstep.
I wonder how many were promising minds before then.
