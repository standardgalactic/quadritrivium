Get the spy to tell you what the art style is.
I actually really like that, though, because that's so surrealist.
I'm trying a slightly different version of the question to see if it'll
to prime it so that it actually answers using all of my big bag of tricks,
which is to phrase the question with a Q colon in front of it and then provide an A colon.
This is advanced tech.
Yeah, you're hacking.
It is insider trading or inside baseball, though.
Neither of those were the correct ones.
This is the inside baseball.
Yeah, definitely, definitely inside baseball.
Okay, the greatest difference between most chicken dishes is the flavor of the chicken
and whether or not it is fresh.
By far, the most prominent flavor is the chicken.
It sounds like an AI trying to pretend that it knows what chicken is.
Maybe the human won't notice.
Oh my God, it sounds like the replicant when the guy asked him,
why did you leave the turtle on its back?
You know, going back to your concern, Matt, about having it deliver one line of dialogue,
I wouldn't feel bad if you wouldn't, if that's the level of help you would have,
except from a friend, if you're like, man, what would these people say?
And they throw a line at you and you throw that in.
Would you feel bad about that?
I think that that would be fine, but that's only if I didn't know that my friend was a much
better writer than me and then rely on that for getting me out of jams frequently.
Like imagine if your favorite author gave you a line in the book and then everyone's like,
oh, this is really impressed with the turn you took here.
And you're like, oh God, oh no, I'm being praised for something I didn't do.
And then yeah, that's...
Maybe I don't have as much of a filter for that because half my job is finding
shit from Stack Overflow and just copy pasting and changing the names of stuff.
I mean, honestly, I think it's going to be what digital photography did to
normal photography or classical photography, where there's a bespoke method
and an associated toolkit one can go about if they want to.
And it's a beautiful art form of doing photography the old way.
And then there's a massive digital ecosystem for creating things that you never could have made
with just classical old photography.
And it's not like one supersedes the other, really.
It's just like there's a tool-assisted version of the thing.
And then there's the old version.
Photoshop's also really hard.
I mean, from the human side of things, I get really frustrated when people are like,
oh, you could just Photoshop that.
And that would be hours of messing with the pixel level of things
and having to know things about color and light theory.
And it doesn't just generate beautiful photos.
I'll say on an optimistic note.
Yeah, so I was just going to say that the art of it
becomes how you interact with the tool.
It's not like something has been lost because you relied on the tool.
It's like the tool is just, it unlocks a new landscape of possibilities.
I'm not saying GPT, you know, whatever can do this.
But we're going to be at the point where you just,
you can make a MCU quality film by talking to a computer for an hour.
You know, you just feel like I want it.
These are the characters.
This is the sort of plot it has.
You know, this is future tech.
I'm not saying right around the corner.
But like, yeah, like you said, it becomes a different thing.
Well, we kind of already have that level of tech
when it comes to written art.
Like literally anyone used to be to write a novel was a big deal
because there was just not that much access to the tools needed.
Nowadays, everyone in the modern world is literate
and everyone has access to the internet.
So anyone can put out a novel.
And I don't think it's destroyed anything.
It's made things better.
There's now genres and sub-genres of novels that didn't exist before.
If you want like transgender sci-fi stories with trying to think,
I don't know, like in Russian, you could find that.
There's now like, yeah, there's now fiction novels written
on the canon created by thousands upon thousands of fan fiction writers
as someone in this room is currently doing a podcast about that.
Yeah.
Methods of rationality was based more on the fan fiction universe
created by everybody, then Rowling's original work.
And then like the derivative fan picks of that,
some of which are like really fun and entertaining,
and some of which have like my preferred ending.
So I think it'd be like, all right,
I might be racing with the possibilities of playing around with this.
I anticipate, you know, 3,000 words, well, that'll get me by.
And that's less of a Netflix subscription.
Yeah, I'm definitely signing up for this because it's available.
I will say that on an optimistic note,
accounting used to be a lot of it was the actual writing down of the numbers
and adding them together and moving them between the various ledgers.
And when Excel and computerized accounting came along,
the accounting profession like exploded.
And it's because, like you said, it got it automated all the tedious stuff.
So now CEOs or see, you know, whoever wanted information could just ask someone,
hey, if we change this price by this amount,
or if we do this little thing different, how will that affect the bottom line?
And that used to be like, well, let me get back to you in three days,
as I erase all these numbers and rewrite all the numbers and recompute everything.
And now it's like, I will change this one number in this one cell.
Everything propagates automatically.
Here's what would happen.
And people found out that they really liked being able to have that sort of models at their fingertips.
And so it just exploded how much data is collected,
how much stuff is recorded and how many requests are made.
And there's far more counts now than there were before the job was automated away.
Yeah, I think this is actually a pretty good prediction
of what will happen with this sort of story creation tech, actually.
And that, you know, there's a sort of characteristic timescale
over which humans will become excited about stories.
So it's not like, you know, the world will become flooded with infinitely many stories.
There's still probably going to be fixture stories like, you know, your MCUs
that people rally around and have fandoms about,
that they get excited about with their friends about.
But the tech that goes into creation of stories will be so good
that stories themselves will just be better and more entertaining for humans.
And probably there will be a whole associated like orthogonal
young ladies illustrated premier thing going on,
where everyone has their own personal story that they can generate
that are extremely high quality relative to what we can get now.
But I don't think like the world of fandoms is going anywhere.
I think it will just be a force multiplier for story creating.
Yeah, and I mean that not just in terms of stories,
but in terms of programmers writing stuff,
because like you said, you can automate away all the boring shit
and get to the real meat of what you want when you're a programmer.
Well, and that, you know, as far as that goes to,
like your your programming job is safe.
You know, the intricacies of your company's hack job of an app
are going to be obscure to, I think, GPT3 for or GPT generations for a while.
Like, all right, you're how do I connect this again,
duct tape and silly putty application to a modern database architecture or something?
I think that's going to be because that requires more than just like
creating text of any sort, right?
So I really do like this young lady's primary idea though,
because I know a lot of the people I interact with in the nationalist community anyway,
are pretty down about institutional schooling and how we do it in the modern world.
And it would just be, I mean, I guess it kind of sucks if you have a teaching degree.
If a lot of people pivoted to this sort of, well, not necessarily,
because you couldn't use just GPT3, it's probably still higher like a personal tutor
to help people out every now and then, few hours a week.
Am I the only person who doesn't know what a young lady's primer is?
Oh, yes, you are, because you did not read along with the Doofcast
when they read The Diamond Age a couple months ago.
I got it and I tried to and then I knew I wasn't going to finish on time when I gave up.
It's one of my favorite books.
It's so good.
I have to read it.
It's great.
It's great.
But yeah, basically, did you want to explain anything, Ash?
Oh, sure. It's an interactive, oh, you wanted to do it, Daniel?
No, no, no, no, go ahead.
It's an interactive book that talks to the user and creates a story for them,
but weaves in things that you learn appropriate for your age level.
And also, it's somewhat aware of what is happening in the world around you,
around the user specifically.
So it can help them train skills that they need.
For example, if you're, I don't know, working in a mine, it would help,
it would realize that and help you learn things that miners might need to know.
But it's basically a teacher replacement.
It's basically this.
Well, what you're asking.
Okay, now I'm going to probably think.
It teaches people skills and information,
and it does so in an engaging and entertaining way,
and it teaches her to be a programmer in the book.
Yeah, the only one thing about GPT-3, which I think Bear's mentioning,
because I think it had impinges on some of the things we've talked about,
is that Dale can correct me,
but I believe that the buffer of stuff that you can contextualize it with
is only like 2000 tokens.
Is that right, Dale?
Yeah, so it's 2000 by pair encoding tokens,
which are like sub components of a word.
It's like a, it's just a representation.
It's bigger than a character, smaller than a word is how I would phrase it.
So wave hands, about a thousand words, roughly speaking.
So like this is actually an obstacle to it really serving as a thing
where it could stand in as a person in a chat room,
because it can only really remember back a thousand words,
which is enough to fake it.
I'm lucky if I can hit a thousand.
But it's definitely not going to remember that personal detail or whatever,
and then a person will be like,
wait a minute, I just told you that yesterday, you know.
So anyway, and it would also not really allow it to be this illustrated
primer where it's supposed to know your life history, basically.
Now that's just, I mean, they're making bigger buffers as they get more memory.
They're, Dale can probably speak more to this,
but there's a whole new architecture called the reformer that,
I don't actually understand how it works in contrast to the transformer,
but apparently it can take much, much larger,
much like many times larger context windows.
Yeah, so the reformer in particular can do like book length context.
So like it's just a problem of the transformer,
it scales quadratically with token size,
like the amount of memory you need scales quadratically for the base transformer,
but there reformer is one of them.
There are a whole bunch of other sparse transformer models,
which only scale linearly with window.
And it's like ongoing right now work is getting these things to be
