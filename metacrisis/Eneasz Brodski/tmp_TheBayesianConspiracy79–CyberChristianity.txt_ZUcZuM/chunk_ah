supporting the podcast. We do. We would like to thank John Pedersen for helping to provide this
podcast and bring it to all of you. Yeah, thanks, John. This was awesome. Thanks, John. Thanks,
man. It helps. Okay. We ran out of time again. So we will just probably do a full feedback
episode next time or something to catch up. Feedback's piling up. I'm not just stalling
for time, Zayla Volkan. I will address that until the dark web stuff I've been saying.
All right, then we'll see you all in a couple of weeks. Cheers. Bye, everybody.
