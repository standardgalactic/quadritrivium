with that relationship tarnishing in a small community right yeah well I mean that is also
one of the nice parts of having more than one partner that you do have other people as a
social safety net to fall back onto if something like that happens and to vouch for you and well
active vouch for you too yeah but there you're not alone you have these people you're still in
relationship with that can give you that emotional support I think you have a responsibility to have
a lot of evidence and um before you go to anyone in fact there's a metamore of mine who's dating
somebody and people hold on a term dropped there without explaining without explaining uh
oh I'm sorry um let me go back um a metamore is a term for a partner's other partner
so for example if I was dating someone who was dating Katrina then Katrina would be a
metamore of mine even if we're not dating that's right yeah so um I guess one thing about polyamory
is having good metamore relationships and um this particular metamore of mine
I definitely consider her a friend so when this other person said oh yeah I dated that
person and rapist I you know my and this this person's describing someone that you were currently
dating no let's just say I heard through a um like a third person not directly so I couldn't
follow up in questioning I had somebody come up to me and say I'm concerned about this other person
that because the person that they're dating has been called a rapist by somebody they used to date
gotcha so I said to this person who told me about it is that's pretty heavy accusation
you need to get more details like I'm yeah that's concerning I definitely don't want to judge somebody
without having any context for this but um how do you feel about going back
and getting more details or me talking directly to the person who made that accusation
so we can figure out if we need to go to to my good friend my my metamore about this other
person that she's dating I think that was an extremely responsible stance to take people
I think are inclined to overreact not so that's the thing is it's hard to say overreact but
they're inclined to react too intensely to charges like that right well like some people call
their friend like it depends on how mature your community is right or I guess how much you trust
the person that you got this word from or whatever like there's all kinds of factors that can jump in
but that's similar that's similar phoning going on here and there's no way I'm gonna act on a
situation like that yeah right no I just wanted to go into that that I've seen and I think that is
possibly one of the things that makes rationalism more amenable to to these uh to poly communities
because you I could see you know people who haven't been trained in this sort of thing to freak out
and start spreading all sorts of rumors and the fact that you require a higher standard of evidence
and you often build priors on other people and how much they can be trusted and how much a certain
amount a certain given piece of evidence alters your opinion makes that a little bit safer I think
so and you know I guess it's like if someone came up to me and said hey you know you're I heard
on the grapevine that your friend murdered somebody you're like okay can we back this up
before I call the police you know I have a partner who warned me that he that I might see accusations
about him murdering someone really and just kind of explaining the situation and just to warn you
this is something that you might see huh so don't freak out it's a misunderstanding he just fell on
my knife it happens um but okay so I think we got wildly after I do want to say the drama the drama
definitely can crop up in insular communities like polyamorous communities and it's not again
something that is specifically a poly thing but when there are only so many people who are willing
to date and experienced at dating multiple people successfully and healthily then you end up dating
some of the same people sometimes and yeah I mean you know you're gonna get drama like that I think
in any community whatsoever and it you might bump into more of it just because you know more people
you know second and third and fourth hand through a larger dating community or through a through a
larger uh you know so my dating I guess what am I just trying to say not dating community uh you
know my partner and all of her friends are like people that I know through my relationship right
but your partner partner partner partner and all of their friends and friends and friends
are so like that that neck gets way bigger right so there'll be more drama is a good way to make
friends oh yeah yeah but the more friends you have the more drama there might be I guess
so that's trying to get at right uh I guess so I guess um let me give you another example of
unfortunate uh poly drama okay so you're making all the listeners be like god I never want to be
poly I'm so much fucking drama okay all right go ahead from my own experience polydrama that's
a fun word it's like regular drama but pointy here so I mentioned that one of my exes and I
didn't part on great terms and her metamore was really really involved with that in that situation
so and one of my current partners this is years later um one of my current partners
was like I've been talking to this person and she is so cool and she does this and that I'm like
I is this her name yeah and like she is really cool but does she know that you're dating me because
she'll have a problem she might have a problem um because of of this past thing that happened
and if this is something that you want to pursue I would love to like go out to coffee with her
talk things through and and try to you know get to a better place but I just want to warn you
we parted on poor terms to the point that or I parted with my my ex girlfriend too if she
if this person knows that you are dating me she might not be willing to enter or even explore
entering a relationship with you so it ended up not working like not going forward between them
they just my partner decided it was too much trouble to even go forward with that when when
he could you know pursue other things so so I don't think we actually managed to steal man anything
no I you mentioned that people like like are just uh poly drama it's so horrible it's all
okay I guess there is that I would say that's probably the primary reason that I'm not a
poly relationship yeah because that sounds exhausting yeah and I mean well I've managed
to avoid most of the drama but and on the other hand I'm also not in very many relationships
and and your relationship and dynamic is different right you're not trying to maintain I guess like
so if one of your potential girlfriends had some drama that was going on you'd be like well all
right you know forget it yeah but no I wouldn't break it off with my girlfriend but it'd be like
that that's that's that sounds sucky for your drama you know I'd listen and commiserate but
I wouldn't get involved you it's uh I think that when you have an insular community people
learn how important it is to avoid massive trauma because there's a fear that it'll come
back to bite you in the ass you can't just burn all your bridges and be like fuck this I'm out of
here right you know you have fuck you and fuck you also so I think that that's actually really
a positive thing is that people have to have to learn you're forced to learn to communicate you're
forced to learn to do um on the other resolution I have seen much much worse drama in my monogamous
friends relationships than I ever have in a poly relationship well I've also had well I've been
in mostly poly relationships so actually I shouldn't ever I shouldn't comment on that yeah no I mean
my monogamous marriage had immense amounts of drama so you know I guess drama's just a thing that
happens with relationships it can be it really depends on who you're in relationship with yeah um
so of my relationships I'm in an eight plus year long relationship is one of them and then I'm in
two other relationships that have lasted about two years a piece at this point and then I met also
in a new one um that's only been a couple months but the relationships that I have that are the
longest lasting the eight years two years two years they are so easy and so low that's why they
last so long and I am so comfortable with those people and we are I gotta you know brag we're just
great at resolving issues and talking through things which we don't even have to do that often
as far as as relationships having drama you mentioned it sort of like as a prerequisite
you said relationships have drama to tag on yours and pat myself on the back for having a great
relationship I don't think we've had one piece of drama in our relationship I've been with my
partner for five years four or five and that's that stemmed from the relationship we just happened
to get along great on like everything it's it's it's like spooky don't try to have a wedding
right well yeah that I can actually see that being being a dramatic thing that was super easy for me
oh you're so lucky um I my you would think yours would be more complicated my drama is well my
drama is all with my parents um and that's the other steelman physician that I want to get to
is being polyamorous in the world okay that seems like a good stopping point for now this episode
got a lot longer than we'd anticipated so we're breaking it in half part two will be released
in one week from today and then we'll resume our normal schedule of two weeks between episodes
so join us again for poly part two and one week and if you have a moment consider leaving
a review or rating at itunes thanks
