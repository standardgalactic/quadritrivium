can't watch Game of Thrones with me what kind of stupid rule is that but to them that's something
that hurt them so things that sometimes look like rules aren't rules they're consideration for your
partner yeah so with the us having special things what I would strongly encourage for anybody who's
in a relationship is to think about simply doing being together being you know making that relationship
for you I don't know how to describe it with with this other person who is a unique human being
and you have you have something special with them is way more important than getting hurt
about who they watch a television show with I mean yes but emotions are funny that way
emotions are funny and if somebody if somebody is if that's something that somebody's going to be
if you about they should talk about it they should talk about their feelings and address why
like try to think about and and people should be considered I'm not saying people should just go
off watching Game of Thrones willy-nilly but um people should be considered of their partner's
feelings of course but I would also encourage them to figure out what it is about that that they're
really feeling pain over and trying to address it at its base it could just be that you did something
with someone else that is always our thing I can chime in from a mono perspective here that I can't
remember if this was Game of Thrones it may well have been I don't think it was because we're never
that invested in that show but um did you watch it with someone else well so here's the thing is
first of all I do see where coming from and that either you have to set up that as an explicit
thing which then sounds like a straight-up rule and then explaining it to the third party might
sound stupid or it sounds it's even very painful to the other person um like oh but you know you
also have a certain amount of understanding expecting that like okay you know even if you just
have multiple friends and you have one friend you watch Game of Thrones with all the time
and then you maybe like go off and watch it with somebody else because it happens to be
your friend might feel a little miffed and it's not a it's not a relationship a romantic relationship
thing it's a well I was expecting to watch it with you because that's our thing that we do together
we make brownies and we watch Game of Thrones and um I'm just a little bit a little bit hurt
I can think of a good platonic example that fits this fits the ball perfectly here and this will
help illustrate I think kind of where those expectations come from and how it doesn't
necessarily come from like possessiveness or like rulemaking but my brother and I used to watch
The Walking Dead together when I was still looking for colonists who watched it I think the 90 came
out on TV together and that was our thing and I can't remember if this ever happened what it
probably did but hypothetically I missed that Sunday we were gonna watch it that Monday well
he watches it anyway by himself and then it's like dude fuck you we're gonna watch this together
so like there's still that bit of thing and so I feel like the the one takeaway here might be that
hurt feelings are going to happen in any relationship whether it's a poly relationship
a platonic friend relationship or a monogamous relationship right and so part of it will just be
having healthy ways to deal with it and how you want to move forward with each other like
for example when Tim starts a video game and I'm watching him when he starts we will actually
talk about is this a video game that I want to be there for every time he plays it or
and watch to watch through the whole progression and yes I do that um or is it a game that I'm
totally comfortable with popping in every once in a while and he's played it by himself or he's
played it with another friend or another partner while I've been gone and if it's something that I
want to be there for then he respects that or you know he'll be like I don't think I can handle it
if I can only if I can only play this around you because I am so into this game and but you can
see how like a young Katrina would you know that's dating him and wants to play that game might be
like what's with this stupid rule that you can't play this game with me well I was an idiot okay
no I mean um let's use that real example though say like you're watching him play Fallout 4 and
you're out all week or something and he's got a girlfriend over hey you playing Fallout 4 I see
the disc there let's pop it in play oh sorry I play this with Katrina well that's stupid how come
right uh like that could theoretically happen right yeah I don't know when people when other people
watch shows or play games together and it's like the thing that they do um I'm usually cool with it
the other thing that happens is we just watch it twice and that's totally cool and um is it really
I don't I don't enjoy watching things twice but I happen to be in romantic relationships
with several people who are totally cool with watching things twice so Fernando has seen Game of
Thrones each episode multiple times partially because he also is dating somebody else who
really enjoys Game of Thrones and I totally respect that and you know knowing that he
has that outlet to watch Game of Thrones with someone else maybe I can if I have time I can
sneak in an episode on my own because I won't be putting him out but yeah it was our thing you
know and then it is more of a group thing and I feel like being a little open to change on
special things is actually really important in any friendship but the line in my head just
I had this line just pop into my head this is this conversation's got a bit metaphorical
and it makes me think of the thing is it's not it's literally what right but it but it also
like applies to larger things right and that's what kind of made me think of like everything
in polyamory it actually applies to every relationship and friendship that you've ever
had and since since I'm a nerd and this is rationale rationally adjacent it makes me think
of in uh Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality when Hermione learns that Harry and Draco have
been doing science together all year too yes she's like were you doing science with him and I
totally like I felt for both of them I know like I felt for Hermione like oh my god he was cheating
on her with science but but like on Harry's point of view he's like I was just doing science with
my other friend yeah no it was it was a brilliant chapter because you felt well I anyway felt so
much for both of them well but then again see their point we can look at the symbolism you know
look at look at where that got Hermione that position right oh dude too soon yeah have we gotten
through um have we gotten through all the rules that you had yeah it was just I was trying to like
I said I was just trying to think of three hypotheticals um are you asking me about like
real rules that I actually have or rules that I made up on the spot oh no those are the only three
okay I liked I liked the one that you thought of though I think that was a better illustration
of what I was trying to think of with the I love you thing only for one person right where you have
the one special thing that we do together and whether it's something you know as ridiculously
not tying as saying you can only love me or something that sounds more reasonable a bit
maybe to the couple but not maybe not necessarily to the to a third party that says I am so a
verse to the love word that I was in love with Melissa for a good four months before I allowed
myself to say it to her and when it did come out it came out on accident and I was like
fuck I can't take that back and I was like yeah okay I love you and yeah I totally been there when
I didn't really love the love love the person yet you know because before you love love the person
you love them sometimes like right after sex I'm thinking I'm thinking of a tv show called
better off Ted where he drops it on the first date it was very funny show check it out well or
you know they say something awesome and really intelligent and you're like I love you and you're
like oh can can we explain what that means to me right now yeah and I think that's an important
follow-up and then you know there's pressure to say it back and there's all sorts of of other
things going on there but yeah communication that's an important thing to have that's that sounds
like something that has to exist in a successful poly relationship well I think it has a relationship
but it's not something that exists in every mono relationship no it's not something that exists in
every poly relationship either what is it that you said that exists and what was the word that
used for the like non-optional compulsory monogamy yeah that those those couples I'm imagining
several right off the bat they don't communicate they're like bad friends right so uh alternatively
what if there's a situation where there's compulsory polyamory that would be just as bad as a compulsory
monogamy situation it would yes yeah but we don't we don't have that society but yes it would be
I can't like there are just people that that wouldn't work for right and so that's the whole
point yeah and I don't know if they're if the poly I'm sure they're again I'm picturing the the
fringe of every group there's probably somebody out there saying that that's what everybody should
be doing and you guys are anyone who's in a monogamous relationship is just drink the kool-aid
in there you can always find someone to say the most extreme fringe stuff but I don't think that
anyone takes that position seriously that's not my impression so did we want to get into
because I I personally consider polyamory so obviously um an okay thing to do yes that I find
that I need to try to steal man critiques of polyamory because I just cannot understand why
anyone would have anything against polyamory ever or or just the option of polyamory right
I mean de facto monogamy is fine but do we want to go into the steel manning of polyamory anti-polyamory
arguments or do we have other things first I do really want to go into it I'm just wondering if I
should be my normal defensive self and explain kind of what polyamory is not sure if you want to do
double time too when you're when we're like saying putting forward these critiques you can do it as
your normal like this is what I actually believe and then you can try and endorse it too I think
that that's that's a worthwhile endeavor for anybody to try and try and think of the best
arguments for position you don't like right or whatever so that's actually I've been a lot of
this is going to come up during steel manning so let's see what you got well steel manning was
hard for me because again it's so difficult for me to imagine why this wouldn't work I'm going to
start with what I don't think is a steel man but a lot of critiques that I did find when I was looking
for critiques weren't actually attacks on polyamory at all they were always attacks on polygamy
where they conflated polyamory with polygamy yes actually um I was thinking about that too I may
have mentioned to you that I unfriended somebody on Facebook because they were saying that if
polyamory is widely acceptable then only a few men will have all the females yes and then there
will be angry single men who can't get any females because of this imbalance and they're going to go
blow up things and um wow that's cool that that went from stupid to really stupid pretty quickly
actually I don't think that's stupid I think that is one of the reasons polygamous
societies are so evil because I meant jumping straight to blowing stuff up because you're
frustrated for lack of sex partners right no I mean I mean that's fairly common they're referring to
well they are referring to jihad and yes but a lot of early societies that were very violent
that was one of the ways they would encourage violence and get meant to go off to war the men
who were very successful and had a lot of riches had a whole harem the people at the bottom had
nothing left but they could go off to war and get riches or get killed either way the male
population is reduced it's polygamous societies are evil for particularly that reason because they
are made to exploit sexual frustration in order to create a violent warlike society I'd say that
the problem is specifically because um and because women are treated as property yes and because
women are always used as the incentive I've read a lot of blogs where they're like how are you supposed
to how are you supposed to get the correct social incentives if there's not an equitable
distribution of pussy that was literally the sentence which is burned in my head an equitable
distribution of pussy and I'm like dude pussy is not a resource you dole out these are people and
that's polygamy always treats women as as objects that are given to men as rewards for doing whatever
society wants so can I weigh in really quick and you mentioned that you mentioned jihadism and I'm
probably more vehemently against uh islam in general than both of you maybe that's a different
episode but that's but that's but that well islam and jihadism there I mean it's it's a different
episode it's going well I'm not complaining them but uh there's not another tradition that that
inspires jihad in the same way that we call it jihad is that there I don't want to get into
this conversation I was I was sort of flabbergasted because then you went on to say that poly army
or poly polygamy that's uh those words are too close to be they are it's unfortunate yeah
that they're they're necessarily evil and it's about controlling women it's not impossible for me to
imagine a society where that's just that that's the comfortable norm for people right that maybe
doesn't exist but like I don't necessarily I would I wouldn't even go so far as to say that
that's necessarily an evil thing no the the point of polygamy is that the men do not share their
women that the wind there's a bunch of women to one men but it's not a real it's not a society
where anyone can have sex with anyone how they feel the men have a harem that belongs to them
yeah and um actually that's a really important distinction that's often brought up in academic
discussions of polyamory is that the difference between polyamory and polygamy is that in polyamory
anybody can date multiple partners and people will bring up things like one penis policy and
you know different agreements that people have but polyamory is definitely an equitable system in
which you really can date multiple people like both men and women can got you and I guess so I'm
imagining hypothetical groups of people that could possibly exist but probably don't so maybe that's
that's what I'm getting hung up on and we're dealing with people that are actually out there
in existing right so the claim yeah so the claim that um that my former Facebook friend made
which you're echoing is this because we live in a paternalistic society that is naturally how
things will fall into place I'm not echoing that well that's you're suggesting that it's
something that could exist somewhere now my friend was saying not only could this exist
somewhere it does exist here if polyamory if people are given more freedom to choose
multiple mates if that's what they want to do then that is the um that is the equilibrium that
it'll tend towards man is that not the case no that is whenever you hear someone say that you're
like wow you have never met an actual poly community in your life have you because they
tend to be actually more much more women-centric than men-centric right that was the observation
that's going to bring to counter that what your guy I'm assuming was it you said it was a guy right
it happened to be a guy yeah um I guess I assume it was a guy because that sounds like something an
idiot guy would say well it could be a woman actually no it absolutely could be anyone who
doesn't know anything about call Paul this person who was in the peace corps and is a completely
admirable human being put that forward and decided to stick to his guns this is the hill he would die
on this is the hill he would die on and I just got annoyed to the point that because he wouldn't
listen to me and I feel like I have some pull on that particular topic and like the facts
and uh yeah so so I got frustrated to the point that I was like I don't need to hear your shit
and I should caveat I didn't mean that this person's idiot I meant that this person had an idiotic
position that that's that that's an important distinction and to clarify so for the people
who are not um familiar with the community they tend to be very much uh more women-centric because
women can leave in a free society and if they don't feel comfortable somewhere they will
and for that reason generally people make a lot of effort to make sure the women feel comfortable
there can you stand on that uh I I mean that there isn't generally creepers in poly communities
and if there are they get drummed out pretty quickly um there are but people are less afraid to
one it's a small community people tend to know each other like any ash for a while was actually
connected to me through polyamory yes uh not currently but you know distantly we tend to
kind of know each other know of each other and if somebody is rapey or abusive then that kind
of goes through the grapevine that that's a lot those are those are much stronger attributes
than creeper I guess I'm not sure what creeper is creeper I have a bad association with because
one person call you creepy and if all you're doing is whatever reason staring at the wrong place
for too long and you're just zoning out then all of a sudden you're branded as a creeper uh I mean
I don't think that actually happens so I'm not sure I guess I guess what is creeper I guess is
that is that is that the nice way to put rapey slash assaulting rapey slash assaulty slash abusive
yeah um like I have actually um I have received warnings from people about somebody I'm dating
oh really yeah I was I was with a guy and and did you tell them no he's actually a nice guy
I told him that maybe they misunderstood and then later I was like he's just too rapey I can't be
with him anymore and I did talk to other people about it because it's not okay no that's a pretty
intense uh relationship issue um to put it super multiple and it turned out that there were people
who didn't who I knew who actually had serious concerns about this person who out of politeness
and you know probably just not enough evidence had not talked to me about it until
after we had broken up at which point I was like this is why I received these reports
and um which was really upsetting and I suspected and but yeah I when I had a particularly bad
breakup one of my worries was that I would have difficulty dating yeah and not even not even
that date me but not even give me a chance at friendship or and that's what I was right about
