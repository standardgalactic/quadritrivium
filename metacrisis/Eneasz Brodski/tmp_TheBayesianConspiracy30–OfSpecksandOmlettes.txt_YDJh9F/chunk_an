and so they pass laws that say if you have a college
two thirds of your students are allowed to be white one third have to be minority.
If you are a large employer two thirds of your employees can be white
one third have to be a minority and I think he's saying that
that ends up having more bad facts than it fixes
because by ignoring the other factors the fact that people are somewhat racist
and tribal and simply forcing everyone to have exactly the distribution that we
see in in the population without taking into
accounts things like racism or tribalism or just the fact that maybe
people are less able to speak the language and that makes a difference in
in certain professions that it's making the situation worse
rather than better to ignore that. So you made another really good steel man
I think you're being and so we're talking about a completely different argument now
I'm going to just put that out there that you've still made it to the point where
it's unrecognizable as this as this original position
that was much more coherent than the one that was given.
If they had said for example I feel like there are some failures
with our current implementations of affirmative action that would have been
a much more defensible not necessarily a position I'd agree with but a much more
solid defensible position but they flat out said progress is like impossible
yeah right right like if they have a criticism of affirmative action then
it's like okay well that's where let's improve it right not oh well then
throw the whole thing out because it's garbage. So are they saying that humans
without rules whether it's religion or law cannot progress and get better?
Oh I don't know was that the argument? I don't think that's what it is I think it's
I took it I don't want to be uncharitable but I took it more or less as trolling I
didn't even really think that there was a whole lot of content to that statement
that was again if I'm being what was the person name who wrote in?
Albionic American?
If you want to write in and clarify I'm receptive I'm not trying to be a dick
but whatever point you're trying to make did not shine through in what you wrote
at least not to me and maybe it is blindness but it's certainly not me
being intentional or what was the word they used perverse it's just me not being
able to tell them from but if you want to come out about it a different way we
can have a real conversation but I took it as more or less trolling I couldn't
The thing that struck me that that made me interested in the comment is when he said
you can't force people into the arbitrary configurations demanded by the political
correctness of the year which sometimes you feel that a little bit right?
You can't force them immediately so there's a difference between we can't force people
into these configurations based on what you think you should be doing and just self-examination
right like being like hey maybe this thing we're doing is kind of a problem maybe this
thing we're doing isn't great we should try to improve upon it and those things happen gradually
it's not like we need to force humans to go completely against their natures and it's this
strenuous thing and it's going to cause all kinds of agony I don't know that I like that I don't
necessarily even think that that's the argument there's kind of an area it feels like it kind of
sits in that kind of idea space I guess but that sounds like a legitimate somewhat of a legitimate
philosophical view of the world to take um but I but I did think the way that you presented it was
pretty concise overall I mean I think it's one way of putting it or at least
engageable yeah it's kind of a pessimistic view of humanity like people are going to be kind of
stuck in their ways and and like like people are in or they're intransigent they're just not
they're not that malleable so you might as well just shape society to that tendency rather than to
change society to fit these high concepts I don't agree with that but I but I understand kind of
what they're trying to say I think optimism and pessimism make a big difference in like someone's
day-to-day life I much prefer being optimistic than pessimistic but I think if we're trying to look
at something from a rationalist perspective where we actually look at society you shouldn't one
shouldn't ask is this pessimistic or optimistic one should say is this real is it reflected by
the data and the world and if the pessimistic view is a more accurate one then you should
go with the pessimistic one sure sure oh it looks like we are kind of tired we want to wrap it up
over the night yeah sure okay thank you for joining us we'll see you all in two weeks bye bye cheers everyone
later
