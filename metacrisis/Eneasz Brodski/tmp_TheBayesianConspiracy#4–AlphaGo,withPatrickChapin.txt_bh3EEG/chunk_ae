on the website as well. Patrick Chapin. All right. And again, we'll have this on the website,
the Bayesian conspiracy.com. So visit us there. Or you can go to the subreddit slash R the Bayesian
conspiracy. Those are those are the two resources that and the the description and the iTunes download
and you can click those links. And we do have a correction from the subreddit. Last episode,
or was it two episodes ago now? We mentioned that Robert Almond was the Nobel Prize winner
deeply religious. Yeah. And there was a brief conjecture that he might be Jehovah's Witness.
And no, he's actually Orthodox. And I and I knew that after we we we stopped recording. I
remembered that it wasn't I knew I knew I think we knew it was never Jehovah's Witness. We just
knew he was fundamentalist somehow. But Robert Almond was a an Orthodox Jew and an old school.
Well, no, it must be a modern Orthodox. I'm assuming we do not want to speculate on that
right now. If you have any corrections or any comments, please talk about it on the subreddit
or on the website. Thank you for joining our conversation. Bye.
