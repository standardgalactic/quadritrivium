get how big of a deal it is.
Right your prior for each one is low and so for each one if you just read my colleague Brian
Kaplan's book on the case against education your prior that education is mainly about
showing off is probably pretty low and so he'll present a lot of evidence and that will lean
in that direction but you still might be wondering well yeah that's all kind of plausible but my
prior is so low I'm not sure I can still really believe this and that'll be true for each of
these areas that we have. However your prior is correlated your prior thinks that if this is true
about a lot of these areas it's going to be more likely to be true about the others.
And so if I can show you evidence in many areas at once then that correlated prior means the prior
is not weighing so much against them. Yeah and so you can believe all of them together in a way
that you can't believe anyone. In that sense it was smart to put the I think the more
charged topics near the end of the book like the last four chapters. The hardest to believe
medicine, religion, politics right. I want to first set you up and see there's this pattern
that's plausible that we are often unaware of our motives on very familiar topics and topics
where you don't really have a strong emotional investment. Right body language laughter yeah
I thought that was a very good decision to do it that way and it because I we can we can touch on
the health care one later on but let's touch on the health care one now. Well I wanted to get to
I guess like a more basic question about the book as a whole is so we've talked about maybe a bit
what the elephant in the brain is but we didn't talk about why we have elephants in our brains
and I wondered if you wanted to dive into that a little bit. Right so we devote the first third
of the book to just general theory making it plausible that we would often be unaware of our
motives and perhaps that was excessive maybe we should have just devoted a quarter or even less
of the book to that but we do a lot of tutorial about what we know about the evolution of humans
to try to make it believable that this wouldn't be a crazy thing to have happen
and so we say that humans are competitive and they have complicated social groups
and that humans compared to other primates have norms and enforce them with language and weapons
which are uniquely human and once we have social norms many of these norms are expressed in terms
of intentions so if I hit you accidentally that's okay if I hit you on purpose that's not
and because we have these norms expressed in terms of intentions and we are really focused on
managing these norms and our social interactions basically all the time whenever we're doing in
the back of our minds we're asking ourselves um if someone were to challenge me on this thing I'm
doing what could I say my motives were and we're trying to make sure we have as nice and pro-social
and you know it's norm of following a story about the motives we had and this is so important that
we've just got this going in the back of our minds all the time of course we're also looking out for
our rivals and wondering if we could accuse them of violating some norm via some behavior they had
we're also a part of our mind looking out for that but we're even more focused on defending
ourselves and this part of our mind that's focused on defending ourselves plausibly that is the
conscious part of our mind that is our consciousness is mainly there and are being able to help us
explain ourselves to other people and so the function of this thing isn't to have an accurate
representation of our motives it needs to be accurate enough to be believable to other people
given what they know but it's like the press secretary for the president who isn't actually
told the major reasons for most of what the president does nevertheless they're asked to
explain it and they usually come up with plausible arguments that make the president look good
that's what your conscious mind is and so that's the key reason why you might not actually know
your motives and I've heard it argued a few times that this is the primary purpose of consciousness
is to be a like a pr department to your body do you do you feel that is possible I think that's
quite plausible that is what your consciousness mainly does is it creates this integrated story
of what you've been doing and why and that's useful when you think back on your history why
did I do something but it's mostly useful when you tell other people what you've been doing and why
and that's especially useful when other people might challenge you about what you've been doing
and why I think I related this in a previous episode but there was this a hermit that was living
around a lake who basically cut himself off from humanity for I think over a decade and once they
interviewed him again he said yeah after after a couple years I kind of lost the sense of self
anymore I was just sort of surviving and doing my thing and not thinking as very much as a human
does because with no other people around to have a social milieu you don't really need a self anymore
which which makes me wonder do you think animals without any sort of social
social environment have just they would have to have a distinctly different sort of consciousness
if they have one at all right I mean the word self and even consciousness have so many associations
I'm reluctant to use them I usually in such context like just like to trick excuse me pick
more concrete terms where about which there's less ambiguity so I might just say most animals
don't have much of a story that they tell themselves about what they did today and why
and nor do they you know have much of a way to tell a story about what they might do
tomorrow to themselves and why and that presumably also makes it harder for them to make long-term
plans a side effect of our ability to tell these stories of what we might do is the ability to
consider multiple possibilities and to make long-term plans and and as you know one of the things
humans like to you know celebrate about their distinction from animals is we are more able to
make long-term plans than to give abstract reasons for things and plausibly this is a side effect
of the fact that we need to excuse to make up excuses and defend ourselves from accusations
about what we've been doing so it's kind of a good thing that we had to develop this hypocrisy
center because it's what lets us plan for the future and make technology and things well humans
are an amazing species who have amazing capacities compared to other animals and to the extent that
these social capacities that we started with were the key thing that got us going then yeah you have
to give them credit for almost everything doesn't mean they're necessarily good to preserve though
depends on how entangled they are basically with the all the other things that are good and then
that for that to answer that we have to get in more detail into their structure and implementation
it's interesting to me and this is one of the the sort of paradoxes explored in the book that
you know we have our surface reasons that we give for you know why did you
take that job over this job you know oh you know I feel like it'll make me happier when really it's
like it's more prestigious or something or it pays better but that sounds tacky to say that
and so like we're aware in some cases that we're covering up these kind of selfish sounding motives
and we're also aware that when other people are talking about their stuff that they're probably
doing the exact same thing and yet like it's like this almost seems like a house of cards and yet
it's just everybody like you know like in the book not looking at the elephant right so I to me that's
just a really I can't think of a good word for it confusing not isn't the right word but that's a
really fun phenomenon problem to look at well people are certainly aware that sometimes people lie
and there are sometimes they lie and they're aware that sometimes people get into a mode where
they're so you know easily telling the lies with such grace and fluidity that they forget it's a lie
and they're aware that happens to other people and themselves and but they tend to assume that
sort of they know most of the examples of this that they've got it they might lie to a date about
how prestige of their job or lie to a policeman about how fast they were going there they're
aware of some lies and they know that people lie but they assume that the lies they're aware of
and the ones they can see in other people are pretty much it and so even we economists are famous
for being somewhat cynical I think we're just not remotely cynical enough when it comes to actually
looking at the motives for a lot of common behaviors uh even we will give people the benefit
of the doubt in a way we just weren't realizing I I've seen two different takes on this and I
wanted to get your opinion on like both which one you think is more accurate and which one you like
more um the there's the Yadkowski intake where he wrote a short fanfic lord of the rings where the
one ring lets you gives you the ability to see people's true motivations and it's it's kind of
wonderful where um who was the the the ranger guy aragorn yeah where uh he sees that aragorn
was unable to compete in the human lands uh at the highest levels so he went to the elf lands
where he's like an outsider and his weird status means that he doesn't have to compete on the same
levels anymore and just as as Frodo looked around the the the circle of companions at every single
person it was just these base you know get propagate your genes sort of motivations to everything
and it was depressing as hell and then uh Zvi who I believe I saw on your blog that you read his
review and responded to it in part uh I I read the entirety of his review of your book as well
and he seems to say that even though X is mostly not about getting Y you still get some Y and everyone
has to pretend that it's about Y and lie about it and this makes like a really intricate dance it's
like a game where we're keep trying to pull one over on each other and we get some Y out of it in
the process and in the meantime it's a lot of fun to play these status games and like to me that
sounded like the most nihilistic and depressing thing ever and it's just basically admitting all
we do with our lives is play these stupid pointless wasteful games because we think it's fun um but
he seemed to be really into it he's like it's great that humans can keep themselves occupied
like this after we've solved most of the world's problems can I can I give a specific example
maybe to build on for that sure phenomenon like the I had a few friends at the end of the year
last year put their their charitable nations on a facebook status and they said this year I donated
this much to this charity this much to that charity etc and so like one externality of them
gaining prestige among their peers by saying look I'm a charity giver look at me is also like
they actually gave to charity I mean some people might actually lie about it and try and you know
fake the signal but assuming that they didn't like like like Svi said it could be you know
the downside is like I guess not the downside the fallout of you getting the the social
prestige of of being a good person is that other people are actually helped and they will
want to get that prestige as well right and also do that possibly right honestly I think what's
mostly going on here is um you're less personally offended by these facts than that you know that
people expect that a good person would be offended so it's signaling all the way down so
you don't feel very comfortable with merely just accepting this thing going on you you feel like
you should and are obligated to show some degree of disappointment and concern and of course you're
doing a laudable job both of you but the obvious fact is that humans have an enormous ability to
adapt to circumstances people have lived in an enormous range of environments in the past lots of
different kinds of food cold hot you know very slow worlds people have been low status high status
and for the most part they just adapt to that and it doesn't really need to affect their daily
mood now if you've got constant physical pain fine and that'll bring you down a bit but otherwise
you know think of the worlds that people have lived in the distant past and have been mostly
happy they lived in pretty deep poverty they had basically the same job for all their life that
their parents and grandparents and all the way back in memory had they hardly saw very much of
the world they only saw a few hundred miles around where they lived and yet they were mostly roughly
in as good as mood as you because that was the world they knew so I'm really confident that once
you get used to this picture of humanity you'll be fine with it you'll be okay but you just feel
an obligation to object which is also fine another way to say this is to say look yes humans are
not what they pretend to be they are not the the angels they like to pretend but if we set aside
this angel thing which never made much sense if you think about it if you look at what they actually
are compared to all the other animals on the planet or even all the other creatures that you could
imagine that would actually make sense they're pretty impressive they're pretty interesting
you could be okay living with them being one of them that's not such a dispiriting thing
most of these hidden motives that we have are perfectly reasonable motives to have
they aren't the motive of angels but they are reasonable motives for the kind of creatures
that we are to have some of the motives are all about showing how loyal we are and how much we
care about our allies and and friends and associates at some level they are laudable motives
they're just not quite as high a motives as that we once our conscious mind likes to make up and
pretend but I think really I think it's not that much of trouble to get used to this once
you've thought about it for a while and that's that's where I'm at too like with the the you
know charity example on Facebook it's you know they might share it to get you know their friends
or something too but it's not like a bad thing to want to tell your friends I'm a good person
here's proof just like you know the example of you know bringing home cooked meals to sick people
or to your sick friends and family you know rather than swing by the store on your way to their house
you spend the extra time to make it and you know that that that shows the extra sacrifice and how
much you actually really care or it's supposed to you know say that sort of thing if you're
ever in the hospital and some people come to visit you in the hospital if you think about it you
will know they felt a bit of an obligation yeah that they were your friends and associates and
you were in the hospital and they needed to show that you know they cared they were afraid in part
of how uncaring they would seem if they didn't come and you can tell they're they're there to
with you but they're kind of looking at their watch and they want to get going on to their next
thing but you will still feel good that they came you will know that they did actually signal that
they care and that they do care and that will be a deep comfort to you I remember seeing a few
criticisms of people saying that uh that the fact that these are that you never address whether these
are conscious or don't go into deep uh yeah yeah dive into whether these are conscious motivations
or not and that should make a hell of a lot of difference and you expressed some annoyance at that
well um we have one book to our here to write and we wanted to make it accessible so it had limited
coverage our main priority was to make clear this idea that there are these two different levels
there's the usual level of the motives we attribute to ourselves in the most public of context
say in a public politician's speech or graduation ceremony and then if we look at the details of
behavior there's the motives that would most explain the details that would just make sense of most of
what we're actually doing and in order to convince you of this it was necessary not only to explain
in theory why that should be plausible but to go through 10 different areas all in the same book
and to summarize the key evidence in each area that we have these other motives so that's quite
a lot to fit in one book now if we are right in this about this book hopefully if this could open
a whole new area of exploration of human behavior maybe dozens more books could be written about
this that would be great we would love that but we have to start somewhere and we have to start
with our main thesis and a book that says that main thesis so we can't let ourselves get too
distracted in this first book from the main thesis and just focusing on the points that
will support the main thesis so before that we had to basically say there are these two levels
and there's a difference and there's of course a whole continuum in between and we didn't want
to get too particular about identifying each context and thing on each level in between
so clearly there's a difference between what we say in public and what we say in private there's a
difference between if we're a professional and we're an amateur on the topic there's a difference
between what we are comfortable being aware for ourselves or what we're only aware in certain
situations when we're forced to be aware versus things we are completely unaware there's a difference
between whether these behaviors are adaptive in a modern world or in which context they're adaptive
and all that complexity is all interesting and important but it's not needed to make our main
point which is just that there's this big difference between the thing we most say and that most social
science and policy analysis is based on and whatever it is the thing that explains our behavior
and we focused on making sure we made that key point and from the point of view of that key point
it's not clear how much it matters exactly that it's conscious or not it is the sort of thing
we say in public or not the key thing is there's there's the difference so if we say we go to
school to learn the material and then the explanation for our actual behavior is better
accounted for by showing off and acculturation then sometimes some people are aware of this
more or less sometimes less it could depend on your age could depend on whether you're professional
it could depend on whether you're talking in public or in private but tell me why does that
matter so much from the point of view just making the point that there's that difference though the
first thing to argue is that there's a difference and and if we can't make that point all the rest
is irrelevant that makes sense to me i i didn't find it super i'm with you i don't i don't find it
