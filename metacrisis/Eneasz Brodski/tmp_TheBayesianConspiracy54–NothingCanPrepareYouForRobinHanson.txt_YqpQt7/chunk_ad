people could be more interested in our reforms if we actually can find solutions to this problem
you do you have any hope that maybe someday people will be able just to admit what things
are really about and not have to play these signaling games and would you want that
I have hope that policy specialists and experts could admit it okay and I have some hope in a
weaker sense that the larger world will admit to a few pieces but you know honestly that's
relatively weak I mean but overall the world is already you know admitted to more things today
than they admitted two thousands of years ago for example there were many polite social fictions
from thousands of years ago that we are more willing to contradict today because we have
developed more common knowledge that we all see through it I used to have a very special place
in my heart for well I used to just be a straight up radical transparency proponent and it's still
like hold some a lot of attraction to me but this seems like one of those reasons why we could
never have that that policy people would have to meet behind closed doors to not let others know
that they're focusing on the actual issue rather than on the signaling that they have to present
to the everyone else if you thought that say human nature in a forager life was the kind you liked
and we've been socialized to become capitalist and in the capitalist world we do
ugly distasteful things like you know sell people crap they don't need and lie to people etc
then you might have some hope that we could carve out a new training environment where we would stop
training people and socializing these people in these destructive ways and be more like they were
back in this forager world that would be a plausible hope but once you see that you're talking about
features of human nature that have gone back for a million or two million years there are not some
recent cultural change but they're just at the core of human nature then you realize it's just
going to be really hard to fundamentally change these things you might change how they're expressed
and the directions and that could be a lot of big wins but this is humans and this is what they are
and for a while this is what they will stay and I think part of that too is that we didn't evolve
relevance in our brains for no reason and so I think this is something that's brought up in
the beginning of the book but I didn't if it's maybe it's finished in the conclusion that I haven't
reached yet or something but the question of like whether or not like owning up to our own ugly motives
puts us at a competitive disadvantage with our community of signalers you know being being the
one in 50 people that acknowledge the elephant in the brain given that we all evolved to ignore it
does that put us at a disadvantage again probably does in ordinary environments with ordinary people
but consider being part of a specialty environment with specialists so for example the effective
altruism community is a community that prides itself on talking about charity in more explicit
terms about its effectiveness even knowing that for most people that's not what charity is about
and that for most people their sort of their mercenary mechanical calculation is a bit off
putting and not as endearing as they might like in somebody else's charity behavior so if you can
create specialist communities that have more of a knowledge shared about these elephants in the
brain these hidden motives then within those communities it can be more okay to talk about it
but you think there always have to be some level of secrecy between like specialists and the general
public well again there are some things today that we just don't pretend in the same way people
did thousands of years ago yeah so thousands of years ago basically everybody had to pretend
there were gods and the you know frequent rituals we all did were to appease the gods and that the
gods might be pleased if we did the rituals etc basically everybody had to say that and most
intellectuals kind of knew otherwise that's at least one of the standard themes in the literature
of esoteric academics but they all knew that in public you better go along with the standard story
and of course yeah and you had to go to the standard story about those other people over
there being distrust worthy outsiders and us being the trust worthy moral insiders I mean
that was a story you just always had to say and everybody kind of knew that and now today
those things are broken down it's less obvious that you always have to say those things today
for everybody to think that you're a reasonable person you mentioned that effective altruism seems
like a a good effort to get back to the root of what charity is and less about signaling do you
how long do you think it'll remain that way before it also gets caught up in signaling games well
it's already a new signaling game but it could just be a little bit better of one okay I mean
within the community people are competing to show off how high quality they are with respect to the
norms of the community and that already creates some distortions but you could still argue it's
a better set of distortions than the usual game you're not going to stop people from signaling
what you can best hope to do is redirect their signals in a more useful direction right like
I'm sorry go ahead well actually brings up this issue people have asked you know how could we stop
signaling and or how could we have better signals you know what would be the way the world could
change to do that and honestly I think we're actually putting most of our effort most of the
time into signaling so there's not really much extra effort to put in that that we could put in
or and we're not much process prospect of putting in less so I think it's more about redirecting
and so it's less about the quantity and more about what kind of signals we said
and I think it's especially about how smart the audience we're trying to impress is
so if you think about medicine again what we're trying to do is show what we care and the way
we show that we care is by by pushing people together giving people medicine that on the
surface would seem to be effective and people give us credit for that caring as long as the
usual audience would say that that's effective and the same in charity we we get credit for being
generous in charity as long as the usual audience would look at whatever charity we're doing and
say that would be a reasonable thing to do and it's because these audiences are ignorant that
these signals can be effective same way in politics we get credit for being a politically
caring person for pushing for a policy that other people in our world would believe is an
effective policy it doesn't the policy we push in politics doesn't have to actually work we might
be pushing for tariffs or minimum wages or other rent control and these might not actually
help they might hurt but as long as the people that around us that we're trying to impress
think they help then that's all it takes for us to get credit for being a caring person
so the key problem in this sense is that the audience we're trying to impress is usually
so poorly informed about the connection between behaviors and effects if only this audience could
be better informed and of course in some ways as the world gets smarter and more knowledgeable
and people learn more things at earlier ages we all just know more about more things
and that's better for this point of view and so this is a reason why there's an
externality from the median person just knowing more about how the world works
it might be a reason why it would be better if we all were eager to impress elites rather than
the median person because the elites then might be better informed and then so if instead of trying
to impress you know our high school friends we were trying to impress our professor
and who knew more say about these things then then we might all try harder to do the things that were
impressive to people who knew more well as as a bit of a teacher's pet my whole life I was always
eager to impress the professor but that also comes to a problem of access like most people
don't have the ability to impress their elites because they have no way to show anything to
their elites like how am I going to impress I don't know right so so you know but we can imagine
more institutions wherein elites do evaluate people and they you know there's a lot of possibilities
for that and of course we might imagine making sure these elites are actually better informed about
things because this makes it all the more important what do the elites know because often there are
a lot of things say about whether minimum wages or rent control works that elites don't know this
one of the things that it's just speaking as as a writer one of the things that tries to
pushes you towards getting traditionally published rather than self-publishing the elites are much
more likely to notice you if you have a big name publisher putting out your book absolutely yeah and
that's that is a thing I think about a lot people sometimes ask me why don't you put this out the
novel you wrote and I'm like right no no I want to go through the long drawn out less lucrative
official channels because then the authors that I really look up to might someday hear about me
and want to like talk to me so a lot of old style you know costume dramas or stories about
hundreds of years ago often have the story of an ordinary person who rises to heights
and often the key events in that are some contact between a lower person and a higher
person where the lower person impresses the higher person and then the higher person helps
that person advance you're describing all my favorite movies right and and you could say if
you're focused on you know the rare occasions where you could really stand out and shine
then that's more in this direction but again you know we're just thinking out loud here
again my first priority as in my previous book Age of M is just to lay out the facts of the
world and make that clear honestly I think people are way too eager to get into values and you know
reform analysis before they understand the basics of what's actually going on uh I mean it's more
fun you feel like you're you know showing off your values and that you care by talking about
reform analysis but still you know our book only went over 10 areas of life there are many more
than 10 areas of life so there's a lot of possibility for applying our methods to many
other areas of life and figuring out what the hidden motives elsewhere is that seems to me an
enormous priority and potential we can learn a lot more than we now know even after writing our book
about why we do a lot of things we are bumping up against our hours so we should probably wrap
it up uh Steven did you have anything you wanted to add or ask about I was thinking about like a
better class of signals and going back to the effective altruism movement uh I think one of
the things they have been advocating for and I think successfully in some places is uh breaking
the taboo against talking about your charitable donations like you know 15 years ago it might
be seen as really tacky to like talk about who you donated to and why and so like you know my
friend's facebook post that I saw a couple months ago would have come off as like really you know
smug or or uh uh I don't know unfavorable and yet we now we can look at it and say oh that's great
that's really cool and the fact that you list your charities lets us help you know evaluate
uh you know your effectiveness if you care for feedback or something right so if they gave
80% of their charity budget to their local animal shelter or something they might actually
be interested in hearing about why that wasn't the best use of their money um so I I have hope that
you know at least with some uh will you sorry go ahead we know some things about human norms uh
there are some human norms that have just been universal in pretty much all human societies
and then there are other norms that are more specific to particular times and places um
so the second class of norms that we have more hope to change uh you know in the united states
you're supposed to buy health insurance for people well most people in this history didn't buy health
insurance so that's obviously something they could change uh but the norm against bragging is actually
pretty universal right everywhere and so I'm not seeing that one going away well and I think I don't
see it going away either but I do see that like and so this person didn't share like their annual
income and what percentage they gave or something but they were uh I think there's one area where
at least some people get support for bragging that way but the usual way to brag is just to
find an excuse why you need to tell people for some other purpose so it would be much more
robust to just find that for charity find a reason why people need to tell why there needs to be a
place where they tell for some other purpose just find that other purpose and make it the excuse
that is some damn good advice sounds like a fun problem yeah and that's true for most of our
of course uh bragging we do a lot of bragging in fact a lot of us do a lot of bragging uh but we
usually follow the norm of following having an excuse for the bragging we we we still discourage
and don't actually do so much direct bragging right so then if we're asked you know why did you
tell me that oh I was just excited about it not because I was interested in raising my status
in proximity to you right um so I guess you mentioned one last thing I wanted to jump on which
was the health insurance thing um and I didn't get to that part in that chat in the chapter yet
but uh it can you talk about health insurance for just a second and then I had a question about that
the phenomenon of why people buy and what the conspicuous carrying there
sure now um you know the standard story about health insurance is that medicine is expensive
and you don't always have the money in you know in your pocket at the time when you need it and so
you'll need insurance to cover that and that's true of course today we spend a huge fraction
of income especially in the US on health insurance and we just usually don't have that much cash lying
around for big expenses so so we do need some sort of process to have cash and reserve to cover
health expenses but if we just did that privately we might be buying it out of our own pocket and
we really want to show other people that we are caring for them so we have a strong preference
for families to buy health insurance for the whole family for companies to get health insurance
for employees and for nations uh and cities even to buy insurance for their citizens uh there's a
strong preference all through through the world for such socialized medicine for all of us together
to be ensuring that each of us has enough medicine and insurance is this form and excuse I mean in
fact an awful lot of medicine isn't insurance at all it's called insurance but the stuff that
deserves the name insurance is really the catastrophic part the the low chance of a high expense
you know what when you buy dental insurance so you can get your teeth cleaned every six months
that's not insurance it's called insurance but it's not it's just a group purchase
that's an installment plan on your cleaning exactly I have health insurance so if I get hit
by a car and the driver runs away I don't have to declare bankruptcy to get better right right
and if you want to reassure your family that that's covered either for their accident to them or to
you then insurance is a way to show them that you care about them and the way they can show
if they care about you but it really also saves money right uh I uh there's not so actually for
most of these regular purchases what you want is a group purchase plan but without the commitment
to buy everything well what you're simultaneously doing is getting a group rate like you're going
to Costco or something Costco membership gives you a right to buy stuff cheaper but the Costco
membership doesn't also mean you have to buy a huge thing in toilet paper every two months
whereas with the medical insurance you're not only getting the group rate you're also committing to
just getting a lot of it that's a fair point that's interesting um yeah I think that covered
all the things I wanted to ask about uh at least for assuming we only had an hour that's that covers
all the the stuff on my list it's been great chatting with you guys I enjoyed it as I enjoyed
talking about my previous book the age of m yes did you want to have another book quite as soon as
this guys so uh aw did you want to add anything else uh either about the book or in general uh the
age of m has a revised paperback edition coming out uh this June oh excellent and I've been working
on a uh grant from the uh open philanthropy foundation on a different uh ai scenario that's
one things I've been doing in the background oh neat hopefully I'll have more about that at some
point okay um just because your audience may be interested to hear those things um doing an
interview with Sam Harris in a couple weeks all righty uh well thank you for joining us this has
been awesome we're gonna put links up to the new book as well as the paperback version of age of
m should people want that and uh we look forward to hearing you on Sam Harris and maybe talking to
you again sometime soon I look forward as well thanks Robin thank you hey this is Inyash I'm
recording this after the fact to give a quick behind the scenes peek into the podcast at this
point Robin turned off the recording on his side so we don't have his audio anymore we
chatted for another minute or two and then Stephen said this now that we're not recording I can tell
you honestly that I really enjoyed your book to which Robin said oh come on put that in the podcast
then well but then it sounds like I'm I'm being uh like I'm just like I'm just saying it just to
just because you know it's it's too uh I I'll sell it when we get back to the episode too but um
we should maybe add this little as the end after the music clip sometimes we have a few seconds
well I thought that it like it was I mean I when I was singing Inyash about it you know I expected
it to be kind of uh like information dense in a way that was hard to get through and it wasn't I
think I used the word page turner to describe it it was really fun and like going through here Robin
again interjected saying it would be really great if we would put this in the podcast yeah and I
I guess I wanted to save it for this part rather than to make it seem like I was ass-kissing to our
guests so oh well we're gonna totally putting this in because yeah knowing that it is not a dry
thing really helps people that get into it no it's a really fun book okay back to the rest of the show
