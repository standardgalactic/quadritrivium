all right welcome to the next part of the show I was gonna say second half but this is not going
to be nearly close to half um as long as the other one so yes listener feedback section yes today's uh
patron that we wanted to give a special shout out to was uh Aaron uh Gertler did I say that right
as far as I know I don't know Gertler Gertler anyway thank you so much we really appreciate
your support and it makes a huge difference to us thank you all of you guys are awesome
uh we have gotten some listener feedback from the marriage episode already because Kyle gets
to listen to them weeks before the rest of you guys do uh since he is doing our sound production
on them and Kyle sent us some feedback before the episode went live and we are not going to hit some
of the other listener feedback we've gotten just yet because it just the episode just aired but
we're going to go ahead and address Kyle's feedback right now because he got it in early
Kyle I think it's only fair that he gets dibs yeah totally he doesn't have work for us
Kyle says um I said in the episode Inyash said in a marriage you'd better get used to doing
nice things because you're going to be doing them for a long time isn't this something that
should be expected of any long-term relationship regardless of legal status if I have a 20 year
girlfriend I would expect her to be as nice to me and vice versa as I would my 20 year wife
and I can I weigh in on that because I'm anticipating your reply okay that of course you
should expect your friends to continue to be nice to you and the people that you care about
um you know that's like the equivalent of your parents kicking you out when you turn 18
with no notice or something what shouldn't happen is that be mandated by the law that you're that
you're that your nicest becomes compulsory lest you go to prison because that was that more or
less your reply that was basically going to be my reply yeah I that it's it's just weird that
they would it's a very strong incentive to not um do nice things like cover someone's uh car
insurance if they can't pay it for a month or whatever else you would do or always get the
groceries and the uh the cost of drinks when you go out if you make more because then that becomes
the lifestyle that your spouse is used to and now you always have to keep paying for
grocery and drinks even after you guys are broken up and uh it's it reminded me of this uh do you
remember this guy god I don't remember his name now he came to our less wrong meetups about a year
and a half ago for a few months and he stopped coming but he was uh converting his garage into
a place for homeless people to sleep yes the guy from Colorado Springs yeah maybe he succeeded in
doing that and it didn't work out for him and that's why I wasn't showing up I'm kidding people
know that he's alive so right and I mean he's that is an amazingly nice thing to do right I mean
he's taking in people who are homeless and helping them get back on their feet by giving them free
housing and food and like encouragement to get out there and change their lives somewhere warm
and weather resistant to crash too which is you know literally a lifesaver yeah no it's it's
fucking awesome and I am like really in awe of him but also you know it then it would be weird if
the government were to come in and require him to keep doing that for the next year for anyone
that he brought into his garage like you have now taken responsibility for this person he is yours
and I feel that is that the marriage thing is very similar to that where it's like the quantum
entanglement theory of morality once you touch it you have bought it so so don't touch it and I
think I don't know if we've made this explicit that episode or not but more or less maybe 90%
of all your objections to marriage revolve around the prospect of a nasty divorce right yeah so it's
not like because we didn't talk about like the institution or like the fact that you know is
basically you know the father handing off his property to be your problem now so like the
history of all that nonsense like that has its own conversation but you're talking more about
like marriage as it exists now between two consenting adults a then necessarily know what
they're consenting to and b it can go very badly for the breadwinner um no but the other thing is
that uh I really dislike about the divorce is that the main thing it does is give people the tools
to hurt each other without giving them much of benefit in in exchange for that you don't have
to hurt each other you can have a perfectly amicable separation amicable separation but you'd
now with marriage have the ability to hurt each other if one or the other wants to and that is
the main thing that getting into a marriage brought to the relationship without really any
benefits to offset that so yeah I'm all for doing nice things to the people you love obviously I
think that is a wonderful thing and that is one of the reasons I am against marriage because it
disincentivizes doing nice things lest you be forced to keep doing them forever or for a period
of time commensurate to how long you guys were married which is not necessarily forever
was that the full of Kyle's comment no uh Kyle also said when uh Kyle also has recently gone
through the divorce and he said when my ex and I were getting ready to be married we thought of
the marriage as an additional layer of protection against hard times when shit would get bad and
we didn't like each other and we and all we wanted to do was call it quits and move on the marriage
would act as the last line of defense and force us to work all the harder to write the ship in
reality the marriage did nothing to help us stay together it only created additional paperwork at
the very end isn't that something along the lines of the argument that uh navine made yeah navine
was yet that was also navine's thing that it's just it makes it harder to break up so it will stay
together longer even if we don't want to and I mean first of all I'm against staying together
longer if you don't want to in general but like like I have experienced myself and like Kyle
experienced if you don't like someone to the point where you cannot stand to live with them anymore
having that additional legal burden isn't going to make much of a difference yeah I I was dubious
of that at the time and I thought about it since that like I mean this is coming from this is coming
from somebody who's in a very happy and loving committed relationship that like if we suddenly
stop feeling that way why would we want to like force ourselves to stay together like that's just
weird I would like to think that neither of us would be you know so different that like we would
wish unhappiness on each other and so then you know if we had to force that unhappiness on each
other via like staying together like that's nuts I feel like in this weird bizarre future where we
stopped liking each other I still wanted to go be happy with somebody else very easily right
so yeah the idea of you know like Naveen talked about you know it was like this box that was
hard to climb out of or something and I that's you know but there's nothing in that box that like
you get to have as a perk that you can't get and you know very easily other ways
yeah I'm with you it seems weird like if you want to stop being friends you just stop being
friends like I mean maybe a dry run example that people have lived with is like having a roommate
that you suddenly stop liking and so like the lease is kind of like the mini marriage and it's a
bitch to get somebody off a lease if they you know want to be shitty roommates or whatever
you know if they stop paying like well both your names are on the lease so you just got to cover
the rest unless you want to get kicked out too yeah breaking a lease if somebody doesn't want to
break was probably kind of like getting a divorce right well getting a divorce is much worse yeah
but a mini example yes exactly it is a mini example I guess what I'm saying is I'm seeing
more parallels the more than I'm thinking about it then obviously like I said yeah small small version
totally all right yeah so if that doesn't sound desirable then I don't know and I have already
seen a comment or two coming in that pointed out some benefits but I guess we'll get to those next
week after more comments are in and we can really address a lot more the feedback cool so continuing
with Kyle's email he says upon reflection I would say that the act of getting married created far
more problems than were necessary and generated no benefits in return we never received any of the
financial benefits because we filed as married filing separately which is actually penalized by the
rs because we could not agree on most joint financial decisions so yeah they didn't even get
the few tax benefits that you can't get I experienced our long-term commitment and marriage
our long-term commitment and marriage as being harmful to our relationship
because for me at least it allowed me to become complacent another way of thinking about it might
be oh since we're married everything is secure so we don't have to try so hard to impress each other
making any relationship be romantic or platonic or whatever requires work sorry maintaining any
relationship if you don't put an effort don't be surprised when your partner doesn't either
external forms of commitment like marriage can facilitate otherwise loving people to stop
working because at the end of the day your chain together by a strong external force that requires
substantial effort to break certainly that chain helped a great many people but I don't see how a
legal contract helps deter breakups any more than other everyday life things would like leases
joint property ownership children and the emotional distress and personal upheaval
that is caused by a sad ending of a partnership and yeah I this was actually a thing that when I
was talking to um my ex's mother because yeah she had some issues with me wanting to marry her
daughter for only five years at a time and then getting divorced which was what we had originally
you know that was our plan uh did I mention that in the last episode no I don't think so okay yeah
we uh we set out to have a five-year marriage and then get divorced afterwards and you know
reconsider and maybe go back into it if we want to that kind of thing which I think was a really
cool move yeah yeah we were gonna keep doing that every five years then that way rather than saying
yep we're tied for life and you know whether or not we hate each other it's like no let's
pre-commit now not to like decide whether or not we want to get divorced because that's like
super wishy washy but pre-pre-commit to the divorce and then make the new decision to get married
again or not yeah that was kind of cool it would have worked if she didn't start hating me
before that five years came it was a good idea yeah yeah but um no but that was one of the things
I told her mom as well that I do think that those sorts of things lead people to be like well
I got you do you're you're you're stuck with me now so I don't have to put as much effort into
staying fit or I don't know keep working crazy hours or whatever the fuck it is that you
originally did to attract your other person because I I don't want to be that way and
I worry about it I'm not as much when you're in a poly relationship it there is you know there's a
bit more of the remembering that your your partner has other options and that you want to stay
attractive for them but uh I just I felt that that is that is another thing that marriage kind of
makes a lot of relationships slightly lesser that's an interesting avenue to think about
because yeah like as long as you're interested in like you know impressing and locking down a mate
then like you're gonna work hard to stay desirable but once you're off the table and she's off the
table or you know vice versa or something then it's like okay all this work I was putting in you
know four hours a week at the gym or something I don't really need to do anymore that was a lot
of work and I was doing it to attract a partner boom I got one I you know we're changed we're
chained at the the left ring finger now so um that's interesting I
I'll have to think about that I mean I I agree that's that's obviously something to think about I
just I'm wondering if that's the kind of thing that would happen to me no one probably thinks
what happened to them although some people probably say I'm only doing this to you know
get into like wedding dress shape or something um well I also think that in general people
get a little bit complacent over time anyway I mean you're always when you first meet someone
putting out your absolute best face and best effort right and then with time you get more
comfortable and you start not not being quite as fastidious about everything and I don't I think
even if you don't get married you'll you'll eventually come into a more slack place that's
interesting that might have been the case I'm going through like I was just talking about
even before we got on the air was I'm like in a happy life spot where like I'm you know making a
lot of right I'm trying to make some positive life changes like you know working out eating
better and stuff and it's not because like I'm looking for a new partner it's more just like
I want to feel better and I simultaneously I'm giving a lot less care about how I present myself
to other people so like I'm doing like I'm doing this I think explicitly for me yeah and so like
you know uh I don't dress well at work I don't worry about like what I have to like I don't
worry about uh saying something stupid because like I'm not trying to impress the people I'm around
where like and I think that you know I might have maybe I'm hitting a healthy level with
that whereas before maybe I was uh preoccupied with it but uh so I'm wondering if in my case
whether that's exceptional or everyone thinks that they're exceptional or whatever but that's
just interesting to think about so for me okay that is Kyle's feedback I actually also got feedback
from uh Zeke Iran from an uh on that neutrality as well should we hit that real quick too sure okay
okay so Zeke Iran says Inyash seems to be spreading misinformation and also seems to have no idea
what net neutrality actually does Inyash constantly and I mean constantly dams all government regulations
when net neutrality is brought up yet he doesn't seem to know what net neutrality actually regulated
no part of net neutrality made it harder for new isps to be created or get a foothold
for the amount of times that he argues that it did I can only think that he has a fundamental
misunderstanding of what net neutrality is slash was if anything it helps small isps because how
could a company compete with big companies when the big companies are legally allowed to make deals
with specific content providers to supply increased bandwidth or have their data not count against a
data cap if Comcast made a deal with Netflix for unlimited 4k streaming at 13 megabytes per second
five megabytes for everything else there's no way a small city scale isp could compete
your argument at the beginning about bit torrentors using tons of bandwidth is also not great when
you pay for internet you either have a cap or you don't if you have a cap then why block a specific
source of data if you don't then you're paying for unlimited bandwidth and you should be able to
download and upload at your given speed max 24 7 I don't care that you're a low usage person
their infrastructure either can or should be able to support that if this were actually a problem
then charges per gigabyte instead of giving us the bullshit cap and throttling and uh well so we
had the fun of I got to watch this conversation last night in real life yeah because we all were
out to dinner so uh I'm curious what the like measured responses now that it's not like a
shouting back and forth across a crowded restaurant tables so well we weren't I guess we tried to
talk loud because of the volume yeah not because you guys were mad no no yeah clarification yeah
we like each other um so I think I think spreading misinformation is a little bit
on the harsh side I don't think I am spreading misinformation as I clarified to Zeke uh
I do not have the expertise either legally or technically to read all the net neutrality
regulations compare them to the previous regulations and understand what exactly it means
and how it's going to affect things and I don't think very many people do Zeke said that he
probably doesn't either um and that is why I rely on experts to a fair extent and this gets into
that tricky area when we were talking about the um the conspiracy theories episode like when is it
okay to trust experts and when isn't it when can you do better than them and when should you think
for yourself and when should you trust the consensus and it's it's hard to say but I do know that in
the case of global warming virtually every person who is well versed in the field comes down very
far to the side of yes it's happening yes humans are directly responsible yes it's going to be bad
if we don't do something about it and they only differ in how much of that uh how bad it will be
and how much we can do and what we should do to to make things better so uh there there's almost
no people saying the opposite so when you have that much of a degree of consensus opinion I'm
sure you're allowed to go along with the experts unless you have a really damn good reason not to
and when I do my reading on net neutrality there is the majority not a large majority but a majority
of people do say uh similar to Zeke that in in general there should be some sort of regulation
over these monopolies but there is a minority that is sizable it's not like the ridiculous
minority of the global warming they have some decent arguments and they are not a tiny minority
that says that the net neutrality thing isn't really helping that much and may in fact be
impeding the building of new infrastructure which is something that we may run into as a problem
in the not too distant future and that they think that we would be better off without the net
neutrality regulations that were introduced a few years ago going back to something more hands off
is net neutrality tied to infrastructure or is that just another talking point that
because they're like my only my my major exposure to this is one I don't know about your source
that it was a primary information about this but I know that sort of sources like Reddit,
GitHub and you know other techy platforms put big banners across the websites you know when
these are going on saying let your representatives know this is a bad thing yeah um like so
they're like from my perspective like the techy sphere was pro net neutrality and I guess my
