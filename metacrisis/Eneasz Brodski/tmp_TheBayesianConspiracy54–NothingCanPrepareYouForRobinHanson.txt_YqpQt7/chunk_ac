super relevant as to whether or not these are things that people are consciously aware or not
we really want to find out what the actual motivations are irrespective of whether or
not people are saying them quietly in their heads or not right it seems to really matter to a lot
of people they get like offended that you would imply right this is something people consciously
so i have a theory for that again which is that in our tradition of motives we give a primacy
to conscious motives in our social norms so we don't actually tend to have such strong norms
against people doing things for reasons they're not conscious of okay and our law embodies that
and a lot of our social social practice embodies that and because of that i think people fully
well know that they will see that our book is an accusation basically that they have been lying
about their motives and they want to defend themselves immediately and that's the first
priority against this accusation and so the straightforward defense is i wasn't aware of
this and it seems correct to them that if they can defend that claim okay this may be my motive
but i wasn't aware of it i was unconscious or it was set up by society you know society
channel me down these paths and i wasn't even aware of why i was being channeled this way
then they are innocent yeah of the accusation of the norm violation and they're more interested
in defending themselves against that accusation than against then they are in this topic of what
is the actual motivation for human behavior and that's exactly what our theory would predict right
and i fact most of us are not actually that interested in explaining human behavior in
general compared to defending ourselves personally against accusations of norm violations yeah and
i can see how you would get annoyed by that because you don't really care about that that much
you're you're that is completely off topic from your book aside from the fact that
it's basically what you would expect it's like they didn't even read the book and get the point
of it right now you know perhaps if we were clever we would have said something about that
early related but that would also be picking a fight with their reader we don't want to do that
really yeah you should have put it as an appendix pick a fight with the lead reader as he's leaving
i didn't feel personally attacked until chapter 14 so i think you did a good job oh what was chapter
14 that medicine one uh-huh which i i think well i think individuals vary in what areas of life they
find most sacred or precious right so if school has been the thing in your life you are a school
teacher you love school then our chapter on school might be the thing that bothers you and if you're
really into religion then our chapter on religion will be the one that you just can't quite swallow
i put that in my notes here too um and i was sort of joking i i felt like i don't i don't i don't uh
i i was being hyperbolic when i said i felt personally attacked but it's the first one
that i actually like i felt i imagine how people feel of reading many of these uh feeling is that
like i'm reading this very compelling argument i'm like no way man i'm doing this because i
love my grandma like so it's it's tough but i mean like the education one i was on board with and
that was the chapter previous to that and uh i i'm looking forward to talking about the talking
about that with my aunt who's a school teacher and not like in an accusatory way i'm curious how
much of this she'll agree with um but i mean like i said you started off with like body language
laughter things that people i think find more enlightening and and interesting than offensive
right it's a good way to write a book so i guess if you if we're for touching on the medicine one
i wanted to dive into that a bit not that like i i'm gonna challenge and say you know hey i think
this is wrong i guess welcome to of course well i think i'm i because i think it's not i think
it's the reason but i think people will say uh i think that's probably one of the ones that
you get the most kickback on except for maybe the religion chapter from religious people
since you mentioned it to our listeners and they haven't read the book they will be doubting most
listeners right now are thinking i haven't bought this medicine claim what are these these you know
podcast people buying this claim so easily from this huckster exactly so we got we got to address it
just so that they will feel no i totally agree a little more address um so i think like well let's
quickly say what the other claim is about the medicine then right so i think the central
claim would be that it's it's largely about showing how much you care and showing to other
people how much you care about you know your family members or something that's why you you get
expensive treatments that are obvious for your family members as opposed to like you know prescribing
bed rest and soup uh even though it might work just as well as 60 worth of medication um looks
like you care less and so people are inclined to go for the expensive option even though the
benefits from it don't really pan out for that cost is that a fair summary it's half of it the
other half is wanting to let other people show they care for you right liking that so an analogy here
is a valentine's chocolate so as you know on valentine's there's a tradition of showing someone
you love that you love them by buying them chocolate now when you ask yourself um what
chocolate should i buy them and how much you don't primarily say uh how hungry are they
or what brand do i privately think they will enjoy the best right you don't grab them a
hershey's bar at the checkout line at the at the grocery store you ask how much do i need to spend
so that i won't seem to be uncaring or i will seem to care more than people who don't care as much as
i do you will also ask what brand or style of chocolate will people tend to give me credit for
having been generous on and if you don't have someone to buy you chocolate on valentine's and
you don't want everybody to know that you might buy yourself some chocolate and leave it on the
desk at the office because you'd like to have the appearance of being cared for like everybody else
right so everyone can see that you're cared for for sure um exactly i think the kickback in medicine
oh sorry go ahead no that's it so i think and i'm sure that you're i and it sucks because i've
read this i wanted to skip to those chapters but i was also really enjoying reading the whole book
in order so i almost finished the education chapter before we started here or excuse me
almost finished the medicine chapter before we started here so maybe you address these in
the second half of that chapter but the responses to things like uh you know it's like end of life
care um god well i mean it's important and like my so my my uh my girlfriend was a geriatric social
worker for five years and when i was you know reading this tour and showing her this stuff she's
like oh yeah absolutely you know nothing you know it it doesn't do anything but keep them alive longer
and they for the most part don't even want that that's why they signed dnrs that's why they uh you
know the patient themselves rarely are enthusiastic about this treatment but the family is right so
professionals will mostly know this stuff i'm not saying much that isn't well known to professionals
at least when we're talking about the details of that medicine has a relatively little low
effectiveness uh more medicine is only a very weak correlation with more health uh that we're
especially interested in expensive dramatic treatments during crises rather than ordinary
everyday cheap simple things we can do to improve our health uh that we're not very interested in
information about the quality of medical treatments when they're given privately
these are all things relatively well known however even professionals will often say
well yes it's not very effective but health is so important that even the small you couldn't
possibly do without but of course that ignores the fact that we have a lot of other much bigger
ways to influence health that we show very little interest in like are you talking about exercise and
yeah exercise that is air quality sleep yeah diet god sleep is a big one and just people a lot of
people seem to be proud of how little sleep they get they get to signal how hard workers they are
and stuff right yeah um so i think like the i think the reaction people feel especially it's
something about uh you know like paying for a medical treatment for a family member or something
um you know like the reason that i might uh pay to put my grandmother in a really nice uh um
care facility or something as opposed to not worrying about it is like the real felt reason
i guess this is the one where i felt it the most is that like you know the real felt reasons that
i have don't i'm like they don't line up with the uh the explanations for for from the signaling
perspective and yet i accept them but like they they they seem like challenged so like you know
it's not even if you want uh are willing to bite the bullet and say yes i understand that part of
the reason i'm doing this is to signal but the other reason that seems way salient is that no i
actually care and i want this to work and so uh i guess is there i imagine uh that there's some
standard conversation about this line of of feedback right well of course um now you're
very aware that you care um you might be less aware that that means you are mainly focused on
making this mechanically work though those are two separate claims uh you know very much that
you care about this person and that you want them to know that you care about them and you
want the world to know and yourself to know that you care about them uh but the question is the the
causal connection between what you're doing and the effects that will show everybody that you care
about them uh and of course uh your mind is uh set up in order to give you this good excuse this
this good story um you know people whose conscious plan is i'm going to do this because that's what
everybody will look at and i want them it to seem like i care those aren't the people we like
and respect right right so that looks way too mercenary and uh manipulative for it to be the
sort of motive we are going to expect so your mind can't stick that in your head and tell you
that's what you think and feel because that's just a not not really an option for sure and i think
that like if people were uh really interested in actually delivering the care that you wouldn't get
these weird paradoxical finding or i guess not paradoxical if you only if you thought that the
real motivation was that they cared but like they they aren't interested in learning about
like success rates for treatments or you know even like compare like cross shopping between
hospitals or something which to me blew my mind i luckily i haven't really ever been in serious
medical uh condition where i needed you know to compare my my expected life outcome based off of
treatments but if i was i would like to think that i would definitely you know have the wherewithal
to like shop around for the best option right you'd like to think so well hopefully your press
secretary tells you that that would be the sort of thing you'd like to think and that you will
presume that you will think it but now that i can probably maybe i can my press secretary will have
no plausible deniability so yeah i can actually take care of myself i liked uh in his review zvi
had sort of a awesome signaling judo technique for this he said what we should do or i don't know
if he said should but uh one technique to counteract this would be to start pointing out some of the
awful horror stories about end of life care and how bad they are and how it just prolongs suffering
and we could start saying how can we care so little as to allow this and not just allow it but
actively foisted upon people if we really cared we would allow them to go out with dignity and grace
and not spend all this money making their last few months miserable right well so the first
priority of our book is to make an intellectual argument for the existence of these motives
so that people who specialize in this sort of topic might be persuaded and talk among themselves
i don't immediately have the ambition of changing the equilibrium among ordinary people
that that seems way too hard as a starting point through the starting point i'm going to presume
that people are in an equilibrium where the behavior roughly makes sense in terms of their
personal incentives and that this is true for most everybody and so telling them how to deviate
from the current behavior is going to hurt them on the most part and even making them aware of this
which might tempt them to change their behavior is probably on average going to hurt them that's
my default assumption about the state of the world it's an equilibrium it roughly fits
but not everybody's average not everybody's the user situation and in particular some of us
are focused in our lives as a professional as a specialist in analyzing human behavior
studying social institutions and thinking about reforms those people seem to be the first candidate
for the people who should know this stuff this is right up their alley and if they don't know this
stuff they will just get their key job wrong and they could plausibly gain social credentials
and credibility by being the sort of person who's hard-nosed enough to face this and say it
even when that might not go over well in their private lives but among other professionals
they could still say this to each other i also expect there'll be a somewhat niche demand for
the young person like catcher in the rye who sees the world around them and says
people have been bullshitting me they're not telling me what's really going on where can i
find out what's really going on well i'm happy that now there's a book you could hand them
and you could say i'm not sure you really want to know but you've been asking you've
been pestering me so here you go and there may be such people who for whom you know the fact
that the world looks so hypocritical and and doesn't make sense in so many ways it's so troubling
that they decided that they want really want to know and towards and all they want to know what's
going on but i'm not presuming that i know how to change the equilibrium of the rest of the world
i think that we social scientists and specialists now that we are armed with this understanding
can start that process of figuring out how to do that and it's not obvious we can't find solutions
but they certainly shouldn't be easy to find and implement i mean this is a whole big complicated
world and it's in a strong complicated equilibrium so first priority should be to figure out what's
actually going on before we try to figure out how to improve it can i ask you to speculate a little
in a i guess related topic um i don't know have you have you seen scott alexander's recent mistake
theory versus conflict theory proposition well as usual scott i i read a bit of the way through the
post okay it's really a long post yes i mean he's very good and insightful but but he could use an
editor yeah sure it sounds it sounds very much like you are more along the lines of a mistake
theory person where there is a system that is flawed and we can rationally address this and
fix it together if we just you know put our minds to it and i worry especially recently that a lot
of politics is takes the conflict theory view of things where there's an enemy and we must fight them
and it seems that unfortunately at least in my opinion in a democracy conflict theorists win
they they take over politics because you can honestly they are the same thing with
but the only variation is the assumption of the scope at which you are hoping to coordinate
all of social analysis is done with respect to some scope of a community that you're making
the policy recommendations too if if you are about to go in a job interview i can use everything i
know to advise you about what to do in the job interview that's a very personal local advice
or could advise you i want you know you want to win marry the heart of this person to marry them
what should you do and i could just advise you directly and personally and then in a sense that's
conflict because i'm if there's a conflict between you and these other people i'm not in this moment
trying to encompass that conflict and resolve those conflicts i am i'm advising one person
in their actions but if you come to me as a couple then i could i could start to think about well
what could you do as a couple together and coordinate to to better achieve both of your ends
and uh if if you come to me as a company and you say how could we reorganize this company to be
better now i could encompass the interests of this entire company and say try to fix the
mistakes of this company rather than in the other mode it's a conflict mode where you are trying to
get a job there and i'm just trying to help you and in that mode i might advise you to do things
that like hurt them that help you right and it's all just about the scope of the community you're
advising and of course we almost never advise the entire world the entire world coordinates so rarely
that uh there is no world to advise and so uh we can still think about what would we do if we
advise the world and that's a great first cut to think about what to offer other people but
uh again when you have a particular policy audience that sets the scope for your analysis
you analyze the policy from the point of view of that decision maker and the scope they encompass so
within the scope of that decision maker you can be a mistake person who's looking for ways to win
win deals for all of them to gain with respect to their outsiders then you're a conflict person
you're helping them win in that conflict with outsiders okay and you don't consider like the
the overwhelming mass of the population which is more concerned with signaling than with actually
addressing these issues to be in conflict with the policy experts well again that's part of the
challenge of policy analysis so um in the conclusion of the book uh we say that traditionally
policy analysts have just tried to solve the problem of how to give people more of the things
they say they want and that's been hard but we faced the puzzle of why they don't seem interested
when we do seem to be able to solve that problem now we face the problem of finding reforms to
existing institutions such that people can continue to pretend to be pursuing the ends they've
always pretended to pursue but that they can actually get more of the things they actually want
that's a harder design problem it has more constraints yeah and of course when we sell
it to people we can't tell them explicitly about the second feature nevertheless there's still more
