Hello, Bayesian conspiracy listeners.
This is Kyle, the sound editor and sound designer of this podcast.
We at the Bayesian Conspiracy are looking for a new musical track to begin and end our podcast.
As the heavy metal track that you've been hearing thus far was just meant to be a placeholder
that we never got around to updating.
That is, until now.
So we'd like to ask you, our listeners, some of whom surely have vastly superior musical
composition skills than we do, if you'd like to compose something for us.
Your name will be credited at the end of every show.
Send us your submissions in MP3 format to BayesianConspiracyPodcast at gmail.com and
please keep the track no longer than a minute or so in length.
Thank you so much for being fans of the show, and we are very much looking forward to hearing
what you all come up with.
And now, back to the show.
Hello, welcome to the Bayesian conspiracy.
I'm Inyash Brotsky.
I'm Stephen Zuber.
And today we have with us Robin Hansen again.
Welcome back, Robin.
Great to be here.
Wonderful.
Great to have you.
And you are here because you have a new book out called Elephant in the Brain.
That's right.
Subtitle, Hidden Motives in Everyday Life.
Excellent.
And you, this came out like, what, a month ago now?
Well it came out January 2nd for the hardback, December 1st for the paper, I mean for the
e-version, but in the United Kingdom it doesn't come out until February 1st on the hardback,
so I'll let it spread out.
Okay.
That's, usually they drop things at the same time, don't they?
They try to, but apparently big publishers spread across multiple continents don't coordinate
that well.
Man, that's, that's, that's disappointing.
But yes, you have been, I'm assuming, making the tours already with the book and you've
been getting some feedback on the blogs.
Before we get into all that, we should probably summarize what the book is to our listeners,
though, for those who don't know.
Well, I think we can let Robin do that if you'd like.
Yeah.
It is your book.
Absolutely.
Happy to.
So my idea here is it's the one thing I wish I would have known at the beginning in my
career as a social scientist.
Okay.
We social scientists and policy makers are too naive and we take people at their word
for the main purpose of many common social institutions.
So in public species or letters of application, people will talk about school as if it's about
learning the material.
And so then social scientists and policy makers will focus on figuring out better ways to
learn the material or which variations help people learn the material faster.
Similarly in medicine, people talk about medicine as if it's about getting healthy.
And so then social scientists who study medicine and policy makers who try to reform medicine,
they focus on medicine as if it were about trying to make people healthier.
And the claim of our book is that in these two cases and many others, we are just wrong
about the main purpose of these institutions.
And that should be surprising to many of you and that's why our book should be interesting.
If we are wrong, of course, about these things, then our attempts to reform them are going
to go badly.
We're just missing the point.
And we suggest that this is in fact one of the big reasons why people are a lot less
interested in proposals for social reform than they are in proposals for physics or
other software device reform.
So I remember originally you started out in physics, right?
I started out in engineering, switched to physics, then I did philosophy of science
for a bit and then finished with a master's in physics, then I did nine years of computer
research at Lockheed and NASA and at that point at the age of 34 with two kids age zero
and two, I switched to get a PhD in social science at Caltech.
I take it that your background in the hard sciences and engineering is what really led
you to believe that people are looking for answers.
Do you think that people who have grown up in the social sciences are more aware of the
fact that this is often not the actual case?
Well, they are aware of a low level of interest.
They aren't so aware of the immediate contrast with the physical and software sciences and
that many of the usual uses don't explain the difference.
So of course, it's obvious, of course, that the world is conservative and not paying attention
and so they'd rather stick with what they've got if you have a proposal and you're so academic
with some weird paper, they're probably not paying attention to it and you might attribute
the lack of interest in social innovations to those things.
You might also notice that many proposed social innovations are huge and require vast reorganization
of society and obviously that's going to be hard and rarely tried.
But what people don't notice is there are a lot of pretty small social innovations, little
voting systems, ways to do contracts that are similarly complex to physics and software
innovations that we try and then we have a lot of pretty big, expensive things we try
in physics and software and so I think seeing them both up close makes it clear that there's
an actual difference when you hold constant the other things.
People are actually less interested in social innovations all else equal.
You have an example of a small local thing that can be fixed that people seem to not
want to do?
Sure.
So if we're having a conversation with a couple of people like you and I, we can wonder how
to allocate conversation time and one way to do it is just to do it informally and let
somebody dominate if they're socially strong enough.
Other times people time people and say you can talk for 30 seconds and you can talk for
30 seconds, that's kind of awkward but a simple solution is to time each person and keep
a budget and collect and then let whoever has talked the least so far take priority
if there's any conflicts and there's some simple ways to do that and there's relatively
little interested in that.
Another simple solution is if you've got a group of people who've got some chores to
do and you're trying to decide who should do the next chore, one way is to make it very
strict.
You know you do it on Monday, I do it on Tuesdays, etc.
But you can have a simple variation where you have what I call a tug-of-war board where
you just have a zero point and every time I do it I pull it in my direction, every time
you do it you pull it your direction and then once it's two or three away from the middle
maybe we'll start to do something more extreme to keep somebody up but again those are just
two very small examples and there's a vast world of other possibilities out there.
You're pretty famous for saying the in general X is not about Y.
And this is the book about that or you could claim it's not the book about that I guess.
This book's really about social prestige, right?
That's why you're...
Exactly.
It could be about multiple things but on the surface it's about the X is not about
a Y.
Well and you make the joke in there I think in the conversation chapter that your two
authors wrote this really just one reason might not just be to share our ideas because
then we could do it for free on our blogs but we wrote this book because we like the
prestige of getting published and all that.
The wonderful thing is I have read almost everything here on your blog over the last
10 years maybe not almost all of it but like a lot of it I picked up through your blog
and so what was the reason for publishing the book?
Was it like to create a single shelling point and put this officially into the public discourse?
Yeah so it's a lot easier for people to share an idea and a point to it when there's a book
that represents it.
Books grant authority and credentials that a bunch of blog posts don't and they have
an integrated whole.
If you point to blog posts you're not sure you're missing the right ones or should you
read the entire blog or will it be enough to read particular posts?
Why are you missing conversation between a book?
It puts that all together and also even makes it more accessible.
When you're writing a blog post you don't introduce all of the ideas behind everything
in the same way you might do for a book.
So this book summarizes the background ideas you might need to know that I wouldn't bother
to explain on the blog and puts them all in an order and says if you read these all in
this order you'll get it.
You won't be missing something.
Oh shit I just had a bad insight about my motivations.
Like I always assumed I like blogs better because they're simpler and I can read them
like piecemeal day to day but now it sounds like I may like blogs because they are harder
for outsiders to get into.
Yeah it's an exclusive access.
You can show that because you get it you've been reading it regularly and that distinguishes
you from others.
Well damn.
So I think this actually brings up, I mean obviously you're the guy to ask about this
but the whole X isn't really about Y it's really about Z.
I think that's a false dichotomy that it's not that it's really you know say in this
case Enyaush is reading a blog post as opposed to books isn't so on the surface it might
have been it's because he likes learning stuff but it's not really about that it's really
about him liking exclusive knowledge but I think it's fair to say that it's about both
right and I think that's the case in most of these things.
To be precise almost everything humans do can have enormous numbers of effects and therefore
there can be an enormous number of motivations for almost everything and obviously for averaging
over any big area like medicine or education or even blog posts if we add that all up there's
going to be thousands of motivations that contribute to those behavior.
So how can we ever say anything if there's thousands?
Well we can talk about the main motivations the ones that are most driving behavior and
of course as social scientists this is what we do usually want to talk about.
We do know that everything has enormous implications but still we want to understand the social
world so we start to start with the biggest things and say well what are the main motives
here and so for each area there is a main motive that we most often go to if we are
asked to justify or explain what we're doing even though there are many other things.
So for going to school people say it's to learn the material but of course they meet
friends there they can be a nice place to sit out and have a picnic you know you could
be not know what else to do so you do this by default I mean you know there's thousands
of reasons.
But again there's a usual story we say and so that would be the X you know it's not
about X and then if we ask among these other possible motives which one is actually much
bigger than we like to admit and perhaps more plausibly is the main motive and that would
be the other one and so but of course there are many thousands more always going on.
Yeah so to make it like kind of personal and uncomfortable at this moment in theory we
are having this conversation to like share information about your book is that like the
primary reason why we're doing this or is there alternate reasons that are that dominate.
You know if we had asked you a month ago before you anticipated having me on if somebody had
you on an interview show and they say well why do you do the podcast I'm sure you could
imagine what you have said.
I don't know because it feels good to because I am sure more I want everyone in the world
to know my name.
In addition there'd be a large mix of motives for each motives there's a whole chain of
causation so there's a we can distinguish proximate up close motives and distal motives so you know
for an awful lot of things the reason we do it is it feels good or at some level I thought
that would be a good idea and those are true but they can be true simultaneously as other
more distal motives can be.
You can go to school to say show off in addition to going to school because it feels good it
could feel good to show off.
Before we moved on I wanted to quickly touch because I just have this near the top in my
notes I think one of my favorite things that you pointed out in this and I don't remember
if it was in the book or in or just in the blog posts but the observation that laughter
for a long time people have been saying why the hell do humans laugh.
That's in the book that's one of my favorite chapters.
Yes and your insight was that laughter is mainly to signal that this is playtime and
we don't have to take things like deadly seriously right now.
Right just to be clear very few things in the book are original in the sense that nobody's
ever said it before what we're trying to do in this book is pull a lot of things together
and to make an overall point and that's actually related to the theme Bayesian
of your blog post title your podcast title that is I think there's a Bayesian argument
for why it would make sense to simultaneously argue for a bunch of these all together in one book.
And that is because when you see them all together in one book it helps people to
get how big of a deal it is.
Right your prior for each one is low and so for each one if you just read my colleague Brian
Kaplan's book on the case against education your prior that education is mainly about
showing off is probably pretty low and so he'll present a lot of evidence and that will lean
in that direction but you still might be wondering well yeah that's all kind of plausible but my
prior is so low I'm not sure I can still really believe this and that'll be true for each of
these areas that we have. However your prior is correlated your prior thinks that if this is true
about a lot of these areas it's going to be more likely to be true about the others.
And so if I can show you evidence in many areas at once then that correlated prior means the prior
is not weighing so much against them. Yeah and so you can believe all of them together in a way
that you can't believe anyone. In that sense it was smart to put the I think the more
charged topics near the end of the book like the last four chapters. The hardest to believe
medicine, religion, politics right. I want to first set you up and see there's this pattern
that's plausible that we are often unaware of our motives on very familiar topics and topics
where you don't really have a strong emotional investment. Right body language laughter yeah
I thought that was a very good decision to do it that way and it because I we can we can touch on
the health care one later on but let's touch on the health care one now. Well I wanted to get to
I guess like a more basic question about the book as a whole is so we've talked about maybe a bit
what the elephant in the brain is but we didn't talk about why we have elephants in our brains
and I wondered if you wanted to dive into that a little bit. Right so we devote the first third
of the book to just general theory making it plausible that we would often be unaware of our
motives and perhaps that was excessive maybe we should have just devoted a quarter or even less
of the book to that but we do a lot of tutorial about what we know about the evolution of humans
to try to make it believable that this wouldn't be a crazy thing to have happen
and so we say that humans are competitive and they have complicated social groups
and that humans compared to other primates have norms and enforce them with language and weapons
which are uniquely human and once we have social norms many of these norms are expressed in terms
of intentions so if I hit you accidentally that's okay if I hit you on purpose that's not
and because we have these norms expressed in terms of intentions and we are really focused on
managing these norms and our social interactions basically all the time whenever we're doing in
the back of our minds we're asking ourselves um if someone were to challenge me on this thing I'm
doing what could I say my motives were and we're trying to make sure we have as nice and pro-social
and you know it's norm of following a story about the motives we had and this is so important that
we've just got this going in the back of our minds all the time of course we're also looking out for
our rivals and wondering if we could accuse them of violating some norm via some behavior they had
we're also a part of our mind looking out for that but we're even more focused on defending
ourselves and this part of our mind that's focused on defending ourselves plausibly that is the
conscious part of our mind that is our consciousness is mainly there and are being able to help us
explain ourselves to other people and so the function of this thing isn't to have an accurate
representation of our motives it needs to be accurate enough to be believable to other people
given what they know but it's like the press secretary for the president who isn't actually
told the major reasons for most of what the president does nevertheless they're asked to
explain it and they usually come up with plausible arguments that make the president look good
that's what your conscious mind is and so that's the key reason why you might not actually know
your motives and I've heard it argued a few times that this is the primary purpose of consciousness
is to be a like a pr department to your body do you do you feel that is possible I think that's
quite plausible that is what your consciousness mainly does is it creates this integrated story
of what you've been doing and why and that's useful when you think back on your history why
did I do something but it's mostly useful when you tell other people what you've been doing and why
and that's especially useful when other people might challenge you about what you've been doing
and why I think I related this in a previous episode but there was this a hermit that was living
around a lake who basically cut himself off from humanity for I think over a decade and once they
interviewed him again he said yeah after after a couple years I kind of lost the sense of self
anymore I was just sort of surviving and doing my thing and not thinking as very much as a human
does because with no other people around to have a social milieu you don't really need a self anymore
which which makes me wonder do you think animals without any sort of social
social environment have just they would have to have a distinctly different sort of consciousness
if they have one at all right I mean the word self and even consciousness have so many associations
I'm reluctant to use them I usually in such context like just like to trick excuse me pick
more concrete terms where about which there's less ambiguity so I might just say most animals
don't have much of a story that they tell themselves about what they did today and why
and nor do they you know have much of a way to tell a story about what they might do
tomorrow to themselves and why and that presumably also makes it harder for them to make long-term
plans a side effect of our ability to tell these stories of what we might do is the ability to
consider multiple possibilities and to make long-term plans and and as you know one of the things
humans like to you know celebrate about their distinction from animals is we are more able to
make long-term plans than to give abstract reasons for things and plausibly this is a side effect
of the fact that we need to excuse to make up excuses and defend ourselves from accusations
about what we've been doing so it's kind of a good thing that we had to develop this hypocrisy
center because it's what lets us plan for the future and make technology and things well humans
are an amazing species who have amazing capacities compared to other animals and to the extent that
these social capacities that we started with were the key thing that got us going then yeah you have
to give them credit for almost everything doesn't mean they're necessarily good to preserve though
depends on how entangled they are basically with the all the other things that are good and then
that for that to answer that we have to get in more detail into their structure and implementation
it's interesting to me and this is one of the the sort of paradoxes explored in the book that
you know we have our surface reasons that we give for you know why did you
take that job over this job you know oh you know I feel like it'll make me happier when really it's
like it's more prestigious or something or it pays better but that sounds tacky to say that
and so like we're aware in some cases that we're covering up these kind of selfish sounding motives
and we're also aware that when other people are talking about their stuff that they're probably
doing the exact same thing and yet like it's like this almost seems like a house of cards and yet
it's just everybody like you know like in the book not looking at the elephant right so I to me that's
just a really I can't think of a good word for it confusing not isn't the right word but that's a
really fun phenomenon problem to look at well people are certainly aware that sometimes people lie
and there are sometimes they lie and they're aware that sometimes people get into a mode where
they're so you know easily telling the lies with such grace and fluidity that they forget it's a lie
and they're aware that happens to other people and themselves and but they tend to assume that
sort of they know most of the examples of this that they've got it they might lie to a date about
how prestige of their job or lie to a policeman about how fast they were going there they're
aware of some lies and they know that people lie but they assume that the lies they're aware of
and the ones they can see in other people are pretty much it and so even we economists are famous
for being somewhat cynical I think we're just not remotely cynical enough when it comes to actually
looking at the motives for a lot of common behaviors uh even we will give people the benefit
of the doubt in a way we just weren't realizing I I've seen two different takes on this and I
wanted to get your opinion on like both which one you think is more accurate and which one you like
more um the there's the Yadkowski intake where he wrote a short fanfic lord of the rings where the
one ring lets you gives you the ability to see people's true motivations and it's it's kind of
wonderful where um who was the the the ranger guy aragorn yeah where uh he sees that aragorn
was unable to compete in the human lands uh at the highest levels so he went to the elf lands
where he's like an outsider and his weird status means that he doesn't have to compete on the same
levels anymore and just as as Frodo looked around the the the circle of companions at every single
person it was just these base you know get propagate your genes sort of motivations to everything
and it was depressing as hell and then uh Zvi who I believe I saw on your blog that you read his
review and responded to it in part uh I I read the entirety of his review of your book as well
and he seems to say that even though X is mostly not about getting Y you still get some Y and everyone
has to pretend that it's about Y and lie about it and this makes like a really intricate dance it's
like a game where we're keep trying to pull one over on each other and we get some Y out of it in
the process and in the meantime it's a lot of fun to play these status games and like to me that
sounded like the most nihilistic and depressing thing ever and it's just basically admitting all
we do with our lives is play these stupid pointless wasteful games because we think it's fun um but
he seemed to be really into it he's like it's great that humans can keep themselves occupied
like this after we've solved most of the world's problems can I can I give a specific example
maybe to build on for that sure phenomenon like the I had a few friends at the end of the year
last year put their their charitable nations on a facebook status and they said this year I donated
this much to this charity this much to that charity etc and so like one externality of them
gaining prestige among their peers by saying look I'm a charity giver look at me is also like
they actually gave to charity I mean some people might actually lie about it and try and you know
fake the signal but assuming that they didn't like like like Svi said it could be you know
the downside is like I guess not the downside the fallout of you getting the the social
prestige of of being a good person is that other people are actually helped and they will
want to get that prestige as well right and also do that possibly right honestly I think what's
mostly going on here is um you're less personally offended by these facts than that you know that
people expect that a good person would be offended so it's signaling all the way down so
you don't feel very comfortable with merely just accepting this thing going on you you feel like
you should and are obligated to show some degree of disappointment and concern and of course you're
doing a laudable job both of you but the obvious fact is that humans have an enormous ability to
adapt to circumstances people have lived in an enormous range of environments in the past lots of
different kinds of food cold hot you know very slow worlds people have been low status high status
and for the most part they just adapt to that and it doesn't really need to affect their daily
mood now if you've got constant physical pain fine and that'll bring you down a bit but otherwise
you know think of the worlds that people have lived in the distant past and have been mostly
happy they lived in pretty deep poverty they had basically the same job for all their life that
their parents and grandparents and all the way back in memory had they hardly saw very much of
the world they only saw a few hundred miles around where they lived and yet they were mostly roughly
in as good as mood as you because that was the world they knew so I'm really confident that once
you get used to this picture of humanity you'll be fine with it you'll be okay but you just feel
an obligation to object which is also fine another way to say this is to say look yes humans are
not what they pretend to be they are not the the angels they like to pretend but if we set aside
this angel thing which never made much sense if you think about it if you look at what they actually
are compared to all the other animals on the planet or even all the other creatures that you could
imagine that would actually make sense they're pretty impressive they're pretty interesting
you could be okay living with them being one of them that's not such a dispiriting thing
most of these hidden motives that we have are perfectly reasonable motives to have
they aren't the motive of angels but they are reasonable motives for the kind of creatures
that we are to have some of the motives are all about showing how loyal we are and how much we
care about our allies and and friends and associates at some level they are laudable motives
they're just not quite as high a motives as that we once our conscious mind likes to make up and
pretend but I think really I think it's not that much of trouble to get used to this once
you've thought about it for a while and that's that's where I'm at too like with the the you
know charity example on Facebook it's you know they might share it to get you know their friends
or something too but it's not like a bad thing to want to tell your friends I'm a good person
here's proof just like you know the example of you know bringing home cooked meals to sick people
or to your sick friends and family you know rather than swing by the store on your way to their house
you spend the extra time to make it and you know that that that shows the extra sacrifice and how
much you actually really care or it's supposed to you know say that sort of thing if you're
ever in the hospital and some people come to visit you in the hospital if you think about it you
will know they felt a bit of an obligation yeah that they were your friends and associates and
you were in the hospital and they needed to show that you know they cared they were afraid in part
of how uncaring they would seem if they didn't come and you can tell they're they're there to
with you but they're kind of looking at their watch and they want to get going on to their next
thing but you will still feel good that they came you will know that they did actually signal that
they care and that they do care and that will be a deep comfort to you I remember seeing a few
criticisms of people saying that uh that the fact that these are that you never address whether these
are conscious or don't go into deep uh yeah yeah dive into whether these are conscious motivations
or not and that should make a hell of a lot of difference and you expressed some annoyance at that
well um we have one book to our here to write and we wanted to make it accessible so it had limited
coverage our main priority was to make clear this idea that there are these two different levels
there's the usual level of the motives we attribute to ourselves in the most public of context
say in a public politician's speech or graduation ceremony and then if we look at the details of
behavior there's the motives that would most explain the details that would just make sense of most of
what we're actually doing and in order to convince you of this it was necessary not only to explain
in theory why that should be plausible but to go through 10 different areas all in the same book
and to summarize the key evidence in each area that we have these other motives so that's quite
a lot to fit in one book now if we are right in this about this book hopefully if this could open
a whole new area of exploration of human behavior maybe dozens more books could be written about
this that would be great we would love that but we have to start somewhere and we have to start
with our main thesis and a book that says that main thesis so we can't let ourselves get too
distracted in this first book from the main thesis and just focusing on the points that
will support the main thesis so before that we had to basically say there are these two levels
and there's a difference and there's of course a whole continuum in between and we didn't want
to get too particular about identifying each context and thing on each level in between
so clearly there's a difference between what we say in public and what we say in private there's a
difference between if we're a professional and we're an amateur on the topic there's a difference
between what we are comfortable being aware for ourselves or what we're only aware in certain
situations when we're forced to be aware versus things we are completely unaware there's a difference
between whether these behaviors are adaptive in a modern world or in which context they're adaptive
and all that complexity is all interesting and important but it's not needed to make our main
point which is just that there's this big difference between the thing we most say and that most social
science and policy analysis is based on and whatever it is the thing that explains our behavior
and we focused on making sure we made that key point and from the point of view of that key point
it's not clear how much it matters exactly that it's conscious or not it is the sort of thing
we say in public or not the key thing is there's there's the difference so if we say we go to
school to learn the material and then the explanation for our actual behavior is better
accounted for by showing off and acculturation then sometimes some people are aware of this
more or less sometimes less it could depend on your age could depend on whether you're professional
it could depend on whether you're talking in public or in private but tell me why does that
matter so much from the point of view just making the point that there's that difference though the
first thing to argue is that there's a difference and and if we can't make that point all the rest
is irrelevant that makes sense to me i i didn't find it super i'm with you i don't i don't find it
super relevant as to whether or not these are things that people are consciously aware or not
we really want to find out what the actual motivations are irrespective of whether or
not people are saying them quietly in their heads or not right it seems to really matter to a lot
of people they get like offended that you would imply right this is something people consciously
so i have a theory for that again which is that in our tradition of motives we give a primacy
to conscious motives in our social norms so we don't actually tend to have such strong norms
against people doing things for reasons they're not conscious of okay and our law embodies that
and a lot of our social social practice embodies that and because of that i think people fully
well know that they will see that our book is an accusation basically that they have been lying
about their motives and they want to defend themselves immediately and that's the first
priority against this accusation and so the straightforward defense is i wasn't aware of
this and it seems correct to them that if they can defend that claim okay this may be my motive
but i wasn't aware of it i was unconscious or it was set up by society you know society
channel me down these paths and i wasn't even aware of why i was being channeled this way
then they are innocent yeah of the accusation of the norm violation and they're more interested
in defending themselves against that accusation than against then they are in this topic of what
is the actual motivation for human behavior and that's exactly what our theory would predict right
and i fact most of us are not actually that interested in explaining human behavior in
general compared to defending ourselves personally against accusations of norm violations yeah and
i can see how you would get annoyed by that because you don't really care about that that much
you're you're that is completely off topic from your book aside from the fact that
it's basically what you would expect it's like they didn't even read the book and get the point
of it right now you know perhaps if we were clever we would have said something about that
early related but that would also be picking a fight with their reader we don't want to do that
really yeah you should have put it as an appendix pick a fight with the lead reader as he's leaving
i didn't feel personally attacked until chapter 14 so i think you did a good job oh what was chapter
14 that medicine one uh-huh which i i think well i think individuals vary in what areas of life they
find most sacred or precious right so if school has been the thing in your life you are a school
teacher you love school then our chapter on school might be the thing that bothers you and if you're
really into religion then our chapter on religion will be the one that you just can't quite swallow
i put that in my notes here too um and i was sort of joking i i felt like i don't i don't i don't uh
i i was being hyperbolic when i said i felt personally attacked but it's the first one
that i actually like i felt i imagine how people feel of reading many of these uh feeling is that
like i'm reading this very compelling argument i'm like no way man i'm doing this because i
love my grandma like so it's it's tough but i mean like the education one i was on board with and
that was the chapter previous to that and uh i i'm looking forward to talking about the talking
about that with my aunt who's a school teacher and not like in an accusatory way i'm curious how
much of this she'll agree with um but i mean like i said you started off with like body language
laughter things that people i think find more enlightening and and interesting than offensive
right it's a good way to write a book so i guess if you if we're for touching on the medicine one
i wanted to dive into that a bit not that like i i'm gonna challenge and say you know hey i think
this is wrong i guess welcome to of course well i think i'm i because i think it's not i think
it's the reason but i think people will say uh i think that's probably one of the ones that
you get the most kickback on except for maybe the religion chapter from religious people
since you mentioned it to our listeners and they haven't read the book they will be doubting most
listeners right now are thinking i haven't bought this medicine claim what are these these you know
podcast people buying this claim so easily from this huckster exactly so we got we got to address it
just so that they will feel no i totally agree a little more address um so i think like well let's
quickly say what the other claim is about the medicine then right so i think the central
claim would be that it's it's largely about showing how much you care and showing to other
people how much you care about you know your family members or something that's why you you get
expensive treatments that are obvious for your family members as opposed to like you know prescribing
bed rest and soup uh even though it might work just as well as 60 worth of medication um looks
like you care less and so people are inclined to go for the expensive option even though the
benefits from it don't really pan out for that cost is that a fair summary it's half of it the
other half is wanting to let other people show they care for you right liking that so an analogy here
is a valentine's chocolate so as you know on valentine's there's a tradition of showing someone
you love that you love them by buying them chocolate now when you ask yourself um what
chocolate should i buy them and how much you don't primarily say uh how hungry are they
or what brand do i privately think they will enjoy the best right you don't grab them a
hershey's bar at the checkout line at the at the grocery store you ask how much do i need to spend
so that i won't seem to be uncaring or i will seem to care more than people who don't care as much as
i do you will also ask what brand or style of chocolate will people tend to give me credit for
having been generous on and if you don't have someone to buy you chocolate on valentine's and
you don't want everybody to know that you might buy yourself some chocolate and leave it on the
desk at the office because you'd like to have the appearance of being cared for like everybody else
right so everyone can see that you're cared for for sure um exactly i think the kickback in medicine
oh sorry go ahead no that's it so i think and i'm sure that you're i and it sucks because i've
read this i wanted to skip to those chapters but i was also really enjoying reading the whole book
in order so i almost finished the education chapter before we started here or excuse me
almost finished the medicine chapter before we started here so maybe you address these in
the second half of that chapter but the responses to things like uh you know it's like end of life
care um god well i mean it's important and like my so my my uh my girlfriend was a geriatric social
worker for five years and when i was you know reading this tour and showing her this stuff she's
like oh yeah absolutely you know nothing you know it it doesn't do anything but keep them alive longer
and they for the most part don't even want that that's why they signed dnrs that's why they uh you
know the patient themselves rarely are enthusiastic about this treatment but the family is right so
professionals will mostly know this stuff i'm not saying much that isn't well known to professionals
at least when we're talking about the details of that medicine has a relatively little low
effectiveness uh more medicine is only a very weak correlation with more health uh that we're
especially interested in expensive dramatic treatments during crises rather than ordinary
everyday cheap simple things we can do to improve our health uh that we're not very interested in
information about the quality of medical treatments when they're given privately
these are all things relatively well known however even professionals will often say
well yes it's not very effective but health is so important that even the small you couldn't
possibly do without but of course that ignores the fact that we have a lot of other much bigger
ways to influence health that we show very little interest in like are you talking about exercise and
yeah exercise that is air quality sleep yeah diet god sleep is a big one and just people a lot of
people seem to be proud of how little sleep they get they get to signal how hard workers they are
and stuff right yeah um so i think like the i think the reaction people feel especially it's
something about uh you know like paying for a medical treatment for a family member or something
um you know like the reason that i might uh pay to put my grandmother in a really nice uh um
care facility or something as opposed to not worrying about it is like the real felt reason
i guess this is the one where i felt it the most is that like you know the real felt reasons that
i have don't i'm like they don't line up with the uh the explanations for for from the signaling
perspective and yet i accept them but like they they they seem like challenged so like you know
it's not even if you want uh are willing to bite the bullet and say yes i understand that part of
the reason i'm doing this is to signal but the other reason that seems way salient is that no i
actually care and i want this to work and so uh i guess is there i imagine uh that there's some
standard conversation about this line of of feedback right well of course um now you're
very aware that you care um you might be less aware that that means you are mainly focused on
making this mechanically work though those are two separate claims uh you know very much that
you care about this person and that you want them to know that you care about them and you
want the world to know and yourself to know that you care about them uh but the question is the the
causal connection between what you're doing and the effects that will show everybody that you care
about them uh and of course uh your mind is uh set up in order to give you this good excuse this
this good story um you know people whose conscious plan is i'm going to do this because that's what
everybody will look at and i want them it to seem like i care those aren't the people we like
and respect right right so that looks way too mercenary and uh manipulative for it to be the
sort of motive we are going to expect so your mind can't stick that in your head and tell you
that's what you think and feel because that's just a not not really an option for sure and i think
that like if people were uh really interested in actually delivering the care that you wouldn't get
these weird paradoxical finding or i guess not paradoxical if you only if you thought that the
real motivation was that they cared but like they they aren't interested in learning about
like success rates for treatments or you know even like compare like cross shopping between
hospitals or something which to me blew my mind i luckily i haven't really ever been in serious
medical uh condition where i needed you know to compare my my expected life outcome based off of
treatments but if i was i would like to think that i would definitely you know have the wherewithal
to like shop around for the best option right you'd like to think so well hopefully your press
secretary tells you that that would be the sort of thing you'd like to think and that you will
presume that you will think it but now that i can probably maybe i can my press secretary will have
no plausible deniability so yeah i can actually take care of myself i liked uh in his review zvi
had sort of a awesome signaling judo technique for this he said what we should do or i don't know
if he said should but uh one technique to counteract this would be to start pointing out some of the
awful horror stories about end of life care and how bad they are and how it just prolongs suffering
and we could start saying how can we care so little as to allow this and not just allow it but
actively foisted upon people if we really cared we would allow them to go out with dignity and grace
and not spend all this money making their last few months miserable right well so the first
priority of our book is to make an intellectual argument for the existence of these motives
so that people who specialize in this sort of topic might be persuaded and talk among themselves
i don't immediately have the ambition of changing the equilibrium among ordinary people
that that seems way too hard as a starting point through the starting point i'm going to presume
that people are in an equilibrium where the behavior roughly makes sense in terms of their
personal incentives and that this is true for most everybody and so telling them how to deviate
from the current behavior is going to hurt them on the most part and even making them aware of this
which might tempt them to change their behavior is probably on average going to hurt them that's
my default assumption about the state of the world it's an equilibrium it roughly fits
but not everybody's average not everybody's the user situation and in particular some of us
are focused in our lives as a professional as a specialist in analyzing human behavior
studying social institutions and thinking about reforms those people seem to be the first candidate
for the people who should know this stuff this is right up their alley and if they don't know this
stuff they will just get their key job wrong and they could plausibly gain social credentials
and credibility by being the sort of person who's hard-nosed enough to face this and say it
even when that might not go over well in their private lives but among other professionals
they could still say this to each other i also expect there'll be a somewhat niche demand for
the young person like catcher in the rye who sees the world around them and says
people have been bullshitting me they're not telling me what's really going on where can i
find out what's really going on well i'm happy that now there's a book you could hand them
and you could say i'm not sure you really want to know but you've been asking you've
been pestering me so here you go and there may be such people who for whom you know the fact
that the world looks so hypocritical and and doesn't make sense in so many ways it's so troubling
that they decided that they want really want to know and towards and all they want to know what's
going on but i'm not presuming that i know how to change the equilibrium of the rest of the world
i think that we social scientists and specialists now that we are armed with this understanding
can start that process of figuring out how to do that and it's not obvious we can't find solutions
but they certainly shouldn't be easy to find and implement i mean this is a whole big complicated
world and it's in a strong complicated equilibrium so first priority should be to figure out what's
actually going on before we try to figure out how to improve it can i ask you to speculate a little
in a i guess related topic um i don't know have you have you seen scott alexander's recent mistake
theory versus conflict theory proposition well as usual scott i i read a bit of the way through the
post okay it's really a long post yes i mean he's very good and insightful but but he could use an
editor yeah sure it sounds it sounds very much like you are more along the lines of a mistake
theory person where there is a system that is flawed and we can rationally address this and
fix it together if we just you know put our minds to it and i worry especially recently that a lot
of politics is takes the conflict theory view of things where there's an enemy and we must fight them
and it seems that unfortunately at least in my opinion in a democracy conflict theorists win
they they take over politics because you can honestly they are the same thing with
but the only variation is the assumption of the scope at which you are hoping to coordinate
all of social analysis is done with respect to some scope of a community that you're making
the policy recommendations too if if you are about to go in a job interview i can use everything i
know to advise you about what to do in the job interview that's a very personal local advice
or could advise you i want you know you want to win marry the heart of this person to marry them
what should you do and i could just advise you directly and personally and then in a sense that's
conflict because i'm if there's a conflict between you and these other people i'm not in this moment
trying to encompass that conflict and resolve those conflicts i am i'm advising one person
in their actions but if you come to me as a couple then i could i could start to think about well
what could you do as a couple together and coordinate to to better achieve both of your ends
and uh if if you come to me as a company and you say how could we reorganize this company to be
better now i could encompass the interests of this entire company and say try to fix the
mistakes of this company rather than in the other mode it's a conflict mode where you are trying to
get a job there and i'm just trying to help you and in that mode i might advise you to do things
that like hurt them that help you right and it's all just about the scope of the community you're
advising and of course we almost never advise the entire world the entire world coordinates so rarely
that uh there is no world to advise and so uh we can still think about what would we do if we
advise the world and that's a great first cut to think about what to offer other people but
uh again when you have a particular policy audience that sets the scope for your analysis
you analyze the policy from the point of view of that decision maker and the scope they encompass so
within the scope of that decision maker you can be a mistake person who's looking for ways to win
win deals for all of them to gain with respect to their outsiders then you're a conflict person
you're helping them win in that conflict with outsiders okay and you don't consider like the
the overwhelming mass of the population which is more concerned with signaling than with actually
addressing these issues to be in conflict with the policy experts well again that's part of the
challenge of policy analysis so um in the conclusion of the book uh we say that traditionally
policy analysts have just tried to solve the problem of how to give people more of the things
they say they want and that's been hard but we faced the puzzle of why they don't seem interested
when we do seem to be able to solve that problem now we face the problem of finding reforms to
existing institutions such that people can continue to pretend to be pursuing the ends they've
always pretended to pursue but that they can actually get more of the things they actually want
that's a harder design problem it has more constraints yeah and of course when we sell
it to people we can't tell them explicitly about the second feature nevertheless there's still more
people could be more interested in our reforms if we actually can find solutions to this problem
you do you have any hope that maybe someday people will be able just to admit what things
are really about and not have to play these signaling games and would you want that
I have hope that policy specialists and experts could admit it okay and I have some hope in a
weaker sense that the larger world will admit to a few pieces but you know honestly that's
relatively weak I mean but overall the world is already you know admitted to more things today
than they admitted two thousands of years ago for example there were many polite social fictions
from thousands of years ago that we are more willing to contradict today because we have
developed more common knowledge that we all see through it I used to have a very special place
in my heart for well I used to just be a straight up radical transparency proponent and it's still
like hold some a lot of attraction to me but this seems like one of those reasons why we could
never have that that policy people would have to meet behind closed doors to not let others know
that they're focusing on the actual issue rather than on the signaling that they have to present
to the everyone else if you thought that say human nature in a forager life was the kind you liked
and we've been socialized to become capitalist and in the capitalist world we do
ugly distasteful things like you know sell people crap they don't need and lie to people etc
then you might have some hope that we could carve out a new training environment where we would stop
training people and socializing these people in these destructive ways and be more like they were
back in this forager world that would be a plausible hope but once you see that you're talking about
features of human nature that have gone back for a million or two million years there are not some
recent cultural change but they're just at the core of human nature then you realize it's just
going to be really hard to fundamentally change these things you might change how they're expressed
and the directions and that could be a lot of big wins but this is humans and this is what they are
and for a while this is what they will stay and I think part of that too is that we didn't evolve
relevance in our brains for no reason and so I think this is something that's brought up in
the beginning of the book but I didn't if it's maybe it's finished in the conclusion that I haven't
reached yet or something but the question of like whether or not like owning up to our own ugly motives
puts us at a competitive disadvantage with our community of signalers you know being being the
one in 50 people that acknowledge the elephant in the brain given that we all evolved to ignore it
does that put us at a disadvantage again probably does in ordinary environments with ordinary people
but consider being part of a specialty environment with specialists so for example the effective
altruism community is a community that prides itself on talking about charity in more explicit
terms about its effectiveness even knowing that for most people that's not what charity is about
and that for most people their sort of their mercenary mechanical calculation is a bit off
putting and not as endearing as they might like in somebody else's charity behavior so if you can
create specialist communities that have more of a knowledge shared about these elephants in the
brain these hidden motives then within those communities it can be more okay to talk about it
but you think there always have to be some level of secrecy between like specialists and the general
public well again there are some things today that we just don't pretend in the same way people
did thousands of years ago yeah so thousands of years ago basically everybody had to pretend
there were gods and the you know frequent rituals we all did were to appease the gods and that the
gods might be pleased if we did the rituals etc basically everybody had to say that and most
intellectuals kind of knew otherwise that's at least one of the standard themes in the literature
of esoteric academics but they all knew that in public you better go along with the standard story
and of course yeah and you had to go to the standard story about those other people over
there being distrust worthy outsiders and us being the trust worthy moral insiders I mean
that was a story you just always had to say and everybody kind of knew that and now today
those things are broken down it's less obvious that you always have to say those things today
for everybody to think that you're a reasonable person you mentioned that effective altruism seems
like a a good effort to get back to the root of what charity is and less about signaling do you
how long do you think it'll remain that way before it also gets caught up in signaling games well
it's already a new signaling game but it could just be a little bit better of one okay I mean
within the community people are competing to show off how high quality they are with respect to the
norms of the community and that already creates some distortions but you could still argue it's
a better set of distortions than the usual game you're not going to stop people from signaling
what you can best hope to do is redirect their signals in a more useful direction right like
I'm sorry go ahead well actually brings up this issue people have asked you know how could we stop
signaling and or how could we have better signals you know what would be the way the world could
change to do that and honestly I think we're actually putting most of our effort most of the
time into signaling so there's not really much extra effort to put in that that we could put in
or and we're not much process prospect of putting in less so I think it's more about redirecting
and so it's less about the quantity and more about what kind of signals we said
and I think it's especially about how smart the audience we're trying to impress is
so if you think about medicine again what we're trying to do is show what we care and the way
we show that we care is by by pushing people together giving people medicine that on the
surface would seem to be effective and people give us credit for that caring as long as the
usual audience would say that that's effective and the same in charity we we get credit for being
generous in charity as long as the usual audience would look at whatever charity we're doing and
say that would be a reasonable thing to do and it's because these audiences are ignorant that
these signals can be effective same way in politics we get credit for being a politically
caring person for pushing for a policy that other people in our world would believe is an
effective policy it doesn't the policy we push in politics doesn't have to actually work we might
be pushing for tariffs or minimum wages or other rent control and these might not actually
help they might hurt but as long as the people that around us that we're trying to impress
think they help then that's all it takes for us to get credit for being a caring person
so the key problem in this sense is that the audience we're trying to impress is usually
so poorly informed about the connection between behaviors and effects if only this audience could
be better informed and of course in some ways as the world gets smarter and more knowledgeable
and people learn more things at earlier ages we all just know more about more things
and that's better for this point of view and so this is a reason why there's an
externality from the median person just knowing more about how the world works
it might be a reason why it would be better if we all were eager to impress elites rather than
the median person because the elites then might be better informed and then so if instead of trying
to impress you know our high school friends we were trying to impress our professor
and who knew more say about these things then then we might all try harder to do the things that were
impressive to people who knew more well as as a bit of a teacher's pet my whole life I was always
eager to impress the professor but that also comes to a problem of access like most people
don't have the ability to impress their elites because they have no way to show anything to
their elites like how am I going to impress I don't know right so so you know but we can imagine
more institutions wherein elites do evaluate people and they you know there's a lot of possibilities
for that and of course we might imagine making sure these elites are actually better informed about
things because this makes it all the more important what do the elites know because often there are
a lot of things say about whether minimum wages or rent control works that elites don't know this
one of the things that it's just speaking as as a writer one of the things that tries to
pushes you towards getting traditionally published rather than self-publishing the elites are much
more likely to notice you if you have a big name publisher putting out your book absolutely yeah and
that's that is a thing I think about a lot people sometimes ask me why don't you put this out the
novel you wrote and I'm like right no no I want to go through the long drawn out less lucrative
official channels because then the authors that I really look up to might someday hear about me
and want to like talk to me so a lot of old style you know costume dramas or stories about
hundreds of years ago often have the story of an ordinary person who rises to heights
and often the key events in that are some contact between a lower person and a higher
person where the lower person impresses the higher person and then the higher person helps
that person advance you're describing all my favorite movies right and and you could say if
you're focused on you know the rare occasions where you could really stand out and shine
then that's more in this direction but again you know we're just thinking out loud here
again my first priority as in my previous book Age of M is just to lay out the facts of the
world and make that clear honestly I think people are way too eager to get into values and you know
reform analysis before they understand the basics of what's actually going on uh I mean it's more
fun you feel like you're you know showing off your values and that you care by talking about
reform analysis but still you know our book only went over 10 areas of life there are many more
than 10 areas of life so there's a lot of possibility for applying our methods to many
other areas of life and figuring out what the hidden motives elsewhere is that seems to me an
enormous priority and potential we can learn a lot more than we now know even after writing our book
about why we do a lot of things we are bumping up against our hours so we should probably wrap
it up uh Steven did you have anything you wanted to add or ask about I was thinking about like a
better class of signals and going back to the effective altruism movement uh I think one of
the things they have been advocating for and I think successfully in some places is uh breaking
the taboo against talking about your charitable donations like you know 15 years ago it might
be seen as really tacky to like talk about who you donated to and why and so like you know my
friend's facebook post that I saw a couple months ago would have come off as like really you know
smug or or uh uh I don't know unfavorable and yet we now we can look at it and say oh that's great
that's really cool and the fact that you list your charities lets us help you know evaluate
uh you know your effectiveness if you care for feedback or something right so if they gave
80% of their charity budget to their local animal shelter or something they might actually
be interested in hearing about why that wasn't the best use of their money um so I I have hope that
you know at least with some uh will you sorry go ahead we know some things about human norms uh
there are some human norms that have just been universal in pretty much all human societies
and then there are other norms that are more specific to particular times and places um
so the second class of norms that we have more hope to change uh you know in the united states
you're supposed to buy health insurance for people well most people in this history didn't buy health
insurance so that's obviously something they could change uh but the norm against bragging is actually
pretty universal right everywhere and so I'm not seeing that one going away well and I think I don't
see it going away either but I do see that like and so this person didn't share like their annual
income and what percentage they gave or something but they were uh I think there's one area where
at least some people get support for bragging that way but the usual way to brag is just to
find an excuse why you need to tell people for some other purpose so it would be much more
robust to just find that for charity find a reason why people need to tell why there needs to be a
place where they tell for some other purpose just find that other purpose and make it the excuse
that is some damn good advice sounds like a fun problem yeah and that's true for most of our
of course uh bragging we do a lot of bragging in fact a lot of us do a lot of bragging uh but we
usually follow the norm of following having an excuse for the bragging we we we still discourage
and don't actually do so much direct bragging right so then if we're asked you know why did you
tell me that oh I was just excited about it not because I was interested in raising my status
in proximity to you right um so I guess you mentioned one last thing I wanted to jump on which
was the health insurance thing um and I didn't get to that part in that chat in the chapter yet
but uh it can you talk about health insurance for just a second and then I had a question about that
the phenomenon of why people buy and what the conspicuous carrying there
sure now um you know the standard story about health insurance is that medicine is expensive
and you don't always have the money in you know in your pocket at the time when you need it and so
you'll need insurance to cover that and that's true of course today we spend a huge fraction
of income especially in the US on health insurance and we just usually don't have that much cash lying
around for big expenses so so we do need some sort of process to have cash and reserve to cover
health expenses but if we just did that privately we might be buying it out of our own pocket and
we really want to show other people that we are caring for them so we have a strong preference
for families to buy health insurance for the whole family for companies to get health insurance
for employees and for nations uh and cities even to buy insurance for their citizens uh there's a
strong preference all through through the world for such socialized medicine for all of us together
to be ensuring that each of us has enough medicine and insurance is this form and excuse I mean in
fact an awful lot of medicine isn't insurance at all it's called insurance but the stuff that
deserves the name insurance is really the catastrophic part the the low chance of a high expense
you know what when you buy dental insurance so you can get your teeth cleaned every six months
that's not insurance it's called insurance but it's not it's just a group purchase
that's an installment plan on your cleaning exactly I have health insurance so if I get hit
by a car and the driver runs away I don't have to declare bankruptcy to get better right right
and if you want to reassure your family that that's covered either for their accident to them or to
you then insurance is a way to show them that you care about them and the way they can show
if they care about you but it really also saves money right uh I uh there's not so actually for
most of these regular purchases what you want is a group purchase plan but without the commitment
to buy everything well what you're simultaneously doing is getting a group rate like you're going
to Costco or something Costco membership gives you a right to buy stuff cheaper but the Costco
membership doesn't also mean you have to buy a huge thing in toilet paper every two months
whereas with the medical insurance you're not only getting the group rate you're also committing to
just getting a lot of it that's a fair point that's interesting um yeah I think that covered
all the things I wanted to ask about uh at least for assuming we only had an hour that's that covers
all the the stuff on my list it's been great chatting with you guys I enjoyed it as I enjoyed
talking about my previous book the age of m yes did you want to have another book quite as soon as
this guys so uh aw did you want to add anything else uh either about the book or in general uh the
age of m has a revised paperback edition coming out uh this June oh excellent and I've been working
on a uh grant from the uh open philanthropy foundation on a different uh ai scenario that's
one things I've been doing in the background oh neat hopefully I'll have more about that at some
point okay um just because your audience may be interested to hear those things um doing an
interview with Sam Harris in a couple weeks all righty uh well thank you for joining us this has
been awesome we're gonna put links up to the new book as well as the paperback version of age of
m should people want that and uh we look forward to hearing you on Sam Harris and maybe talking to
you again sometime soon I look forward as well thanks Robin thank you hey this is Inyash I'm
recording this after the fact to give a quick behind the scenes peek into the podcast at this
point Robin turned off the recording on his side so we don't have his audio anymore we
chatted for another minute or two and then Stephen said this now that we're not recording I can tell
you honestly that I really enjoyed your book to which Robin said oh come on put that in the podcast
then well but then it sounds like I'm I'm being uh like I'm just like I'm just saying it just to
just because you know it's it's too uh I I'll sell it when we get back to the episode too but um
we should maybe add this little as the end after the music clip sometimes we have a few seconds
well I thought that it like it was I mean I when I was singing Inyash about it you know I expected
it to be kind of uh like information dense in a way that was hard to get through and it wasn't I
think I used the word page turner to describe it it was really fun and like going through here Robin
again interjected saying it would be really great if we would put this in the podcast yeah and I
I guess I wanted to save it for this part rather than to make it seem like I was ass-kissing to our
guests so oh well we're gonna totally putting this in because yeah knowing that it is not a dry
thing really helps people that get into it no it's a really fun book okay back to the rest of the show
all right welcome to the next part of the show I was gonna say second half but this is not going
to be nearly close to half um as long as the other one so yes listener feedback section yes today's uh
patron that we wanted to give a special shout out to was uh Aaron uh Gertler did I say that right
as far as I know I don't know Gertler Gertler anyway thank you so much we really appreciate
your support and it makes a huge difference to us thank you all of you guys are awesome
uh we have gotten some listener feedback from the marriage episode already because Kyle gets
to listen to them weeks before the rest of you guys do uh since he is doing our sound production
on them and Kyle sent us some feedback before the episode went live and we are not going to hit some
of the other listener feedback we've gotten just yet because it just the episode just aired but
we're going to go ahead and address Kyle's feedback right now because he got it in early
Kyle I think it's only fair that he gets dibs yeah totally he doesn't have work for us
Kyle says um I said in the episode Inyash said in a marriage you'd better get used to doing
nice things because you're going to be doing them for a long time isn't this something that
should be expected of any long-term relationship regardless of legal status if I have a 20 year
girlfriend I would expect her to be as nice to me and vice versa as I would my 20 year wife
and I can I weigh in on that because I'm anticipating your reply okay that of course you
should expect your friends to continue to be nice to you and the people that you care about
um you know that's like the equivalent of your parents kicking you out when you turn 18
with no notice or something what shouldn't happen is that be mandated by the law that you're that
you're that your nicest becomes compulsory lest you go to prison because that was that more or
less your reply that was basically going to be my reply yeah I that it's it's just weird that
they would it's a very strong incentive to not um do nice things like cover someone's uh car
insurance if they can't pay it for a month or whatever else you would do or always get the
groceries and the uh the cost of drinks when you go out if you make more because then that becomes
the lifestyle that your spouse is used to and now you always have to keep paying for
grocery and drinks even after you guys are broken up and uh it's it reminded me of this uh do you
remember this guy god I don't remember his name now he came to our less wrong meetups about a year
and a half ago for a few months and he stopped coming but he was uh converting his garage into
a place for homeless people to sleep yes the guy from Colorado Springs yeah maybe he succeeded in
doing that and it didn't work out for him and that's why I wasn't showing up I'm kidding people
know that he's alive so right and I mean he's that is an amazingly nice thing to do right I mean
he's taking in people who are homeless and helping them get back on their feet by giving them free
housing and food and like encouragement to get out there and change their lives somewhere warm
and weather resistant to crash too which is you know literally a lifesaver yeah no it's it's
fucking awesome and I am like really in awe of him but also you know it then it would be weird if
the government were to come in and require him to keep doing that for the next year for anyone
that he brought into his garage like you have now taken responsibility for this person he is yours
and I feel that is that the marriage thing is very similar to that where it's like the quantum
entanglement theory of morality once you touch it you have bought it so so don't touch it and I
think I don't know if we've made this explicit that episode or not but more or less maybe 90%
of all your objections to marriage revolve around the prospect of a nasty divorce right yeah so it's
not like because we didn't talk about like the institution or like the fact that you know is
basically you know the father handing off his property to be your problem now so like the
history of all that nonsense like that has its own conversation but you're talking more about
like marriage as it exists now between two consenting adults a then necessarily know what
they're consenting to and b it can go very badly for the breadwinner um no but the other thing is
that uh I really dislike about the divorce is that the main thing it does is give people the tools
to hurt each other without giving them much of benefit in in exchange for that you don't have
to hurt each other you can have a perfectly amicable separation amicable separation but you'd
now with marriage have the ability to hurt each other if one or the other wants to and that is
the main thing that getting into a marriage brought to the relationship without really any
benefits to offset that so yeah I'm all for doing nice things to the people you love obviously I
think that is a wonderful thing and that is one of the reasons I am against marriage because it
disincentivizes doing nice things lest you be forced to keep doing them forever or for a period
of time commensurate to how long you guys were married which is not necessarily forever
was that the full of Kyle's comment no uh Kyle also said when uh Kyle also has recently gone
through the divorce and he said when my ex and I were getting ready to be married we thought of
the marriage as an additional layer of protection against hard times when shit would get bad and
we didn't like each other and we and all we wanted to do was call it quits and move on the marriage
would act as the last line of defense and force us to work all the harder to write the ship in
reality the marriage did nothing to help us stay together it only created additional paperwork at
the very end isn't that something along the lines of the argument that uh navine made yeah navine
was yet that was also navine's thing that it's just it makes it harder to break up so it will stay
together longer even if we don't want to and I mean first of all I'm against staying together
longer if you don't want to in general but like like I have experienced myself and like Kyle
experienced if you don't like someone to the point where you cannot stand to live with them anymore
having that additional legal burden isn't going to make much of a difference yeah I I was dubious
of that at the time and I thought about it since that like I mean this is coming from this is coming
from somebody who's in a very happy and loving committed relationship that like if we suddenly
stop feeling that way why would we want to like force ourselves to stay together like that's just
weird I would like to think that neither of us would be you know so different that like we would
wish unhappiness on each other and so then you know if we had to force that unhappiness on each
other via like staying together like that's nuts I feel like in this weird bizarre future where we
stopped liking each other I still wanted to go be happy with somebody else very easily right
so yeah the idea of you know like Naveen talked about you know it was like this box that was
hard to climb out of or something and I that's you know but there's nothing in that box that like
you get to have as a perk that you can't get and you know very easily other ways
yeah I'm with you it seems weird like if you want to stop being friends you just stop being
friends like I mean maybe a dry run example that people have lived with is like having a roommate
that you suddenly stop liking and so like the lease is kind of like the mini marriage and it's a
bitch to get somebody off a lease if they you know want to be shitty roommates or whatever
you know if they stop paying like well both your names are on the lease so you just got to cover
the rest unless you want to get kicked out too yeah breaking a lease if somebody doesn't want to
break was probably kind of like getting a divorce right well getting a divorce is much worse yeah
but a mini example yes exactly it is a mini example I guess what I'm saying is I'm seeing
more parallels the more than I'm thinking about it then obviously like I said yeah small small version
totally all right yeah so if that doesn't sound desirable then I don't know and I have already
seen a comment or two coming in that pointed out some benefits but I guess we'll get to those next
week after more comments are in and we can really address a lot more the feedback cool so continuing
with Kyle's email he says upon reflection I would say that the act of getting married created far
more problems than were necessary and generated no benefits in return we never received any of the
financial benefits because we filed as married filing separately which is actually penalized by the
rs because we could not agree on most joint financial decisions so yeah they didn't even get
the few tax benefits that you can't get I experienced our long-term commitment and marriage
our long-term commitment and marriage as being harmful to our relationship
because for me at least it allowed me to become complacent another way of thinking about it might
be oh since we're married everything is secure so we don't have to try so hard to impress each other
making any relationship be romantic or platonic or whatever requires work sorry maintaining any
relationship if you don't put an effort don't be surprised when your partner doesn't either
external forms of commitment like marriage can facilitate otherwise loving people to stop
working because at the end of the day your chain together by a strong external force that requires
substantial effort to break certainly that chain helped a great many people but I don't see how a
legal contract helps deter breakups any more than other everyday life things would like leases
joint property ownership children and the emotional distress and personal upheaval
that is caused by a sad ending of a partnership and yeah I this was actually a thing that when I
was talking to um my ex's mother because yeah she had some issues with me wanting to marry her
daughter for only five years at a time and then getting divorced which was what we had originally
you know that was our plan uh did I mention that in the last episode no I don't think so okay yeah
we uh we set out to have a five-year marriage and then get divorced afterwards and you know
reconsider and maybe go back into it if we want to that kind of thing which I think was a really
cool move yeah yeah we were gonna keep doing that every five years then that way rather than saying
yep we're tied for life and you know whether or not we hate each other it's like no let's
pre-commit now not to like decide whether or not we want to get divorced because that's like
super wishy washy but pre-pre-commit to the divorce and then make the new decision to get married
again or not yeah that was kind of cool it would have worked if she didn't start hating me
before that five years came it was a good idea yeah yeah but um no but that was one of the things
I told her mom as well that I do think that those sorts of things lead people to be like well
I got you do you're you're you're stuck with me now so I don't have to put as much effort into
staying fit or I don't know keep working crazy hours or whatever the fuck it is that you
originally did to attract your other person because I I don't want to be that way and
I worry about it I'm not as much when you're in a poly relationship it there is you know there's a
bit more of the remembering that your your partner has other options and that you want to stay
attractive for them but uh I just I felt that that is that is another thing that marriage kind of
makes a lot of relationships slightly lesser that's an interesting avenue to think about
because yeah like as long as you're interested in like you know impressing and locking down a mate
then like you're gonna work hard to stay desirable but once you're off the table and she's off the
table or you know vice versa or something then it's like okay all this work I was putting in you
know four hours a week at the gym or something I don't really need to do anymore that was a lot
of work and I was doing it to attract a partner boom I got one I you know we're changed we're
chained at the the left ring finger now so um that's interesting I
I'll have to think about that I mean I I agree that's that's obviously something to think about I
just I'm wondering if that's the kind of thing that would happen to me no one probably thinks
what happened to them although some people probably say I'm only doing this to you know
get into like wedding dress shape or something um well I also think that in general people
get a little bit complacent over time anyway I mean you're always when you first meet someone
putting out your absolute best face and best effort right and then with time you get more
comfortable and you start not not being quite as fastidious about everything and I don't I think
even if you don't get married you'll you'll eventually come into a more slack place that's
interesting that might have been the case I'm going through like I was just talking about
even before we got on the air was I'm like in a happy life spot where like I'm you know making a
lot of right I'm trying to make some positive life changes like you know working out eating
better and stuff and it's not because like I'm looking for a new partner it's more just like
I want to feel better and I simultaneously I'm giving a lot less care about how I present myself
to other people so like I'm doing like I'm doing this I think explicitly for me yeah and so like
you know uh I don't dress well at work I don't worry about like what I have to like I don't
worry about uh saying something stupid because like I'm not trying to impress the people I'm around
where like and I think that you know I might have maybe I'm hitting a healthy level with
that whereas before maybe I was uh preoccupied with it but uh so I'm wondering if in my case
whether that's exceptional or everyone thinks that they're exceptional or whatever but that's
just interesting to think about so for me okay that is Kyle's feedback I actually also got feedback
from uh Zeke Iran from an uh on that neutrality as well should we hit that real quick too sure okay
okay so Zeke Iran says Inyash seems to be spreading misinformation and also seems to have no idea
what net neutrality actually does Inyash constantly and I mean constantly dams all government regulations
when net neutrality is brought up yet he doesn't seem to know what net neutrality actually regulated
no part of net neutrality made it harder for new isps to be created or get a foothold
for the amount of times that he argues that it did I can only think that he has a fundamental
misunderstanding of what net neutrality is slash was if anything it helps small isps because how
could a company compete with big companies when the big companies are legally allowed to make deals
with specific content providers to supply increased bandwidth or have their data not count against a
data cap if Comcast made a deal with Netflix for unlimited 4k streaming at 13 megabytes per second
five megabytes for everything else there's no way a small city scale isp could compete
your argument at the beginning about bit torrentors using tons of bandwidth is also not great when
you pay for internet you either have a cap or you don't if you have a cap then why block a specific
source of data if you don't then you're paying for unlimited bandwidth and you should be able to
download and upload at your given speed max 24 7 I don't care that you're a low usage person
their infrastructure either can or should be able to support that if this were actually a problem
then charges per gigabyte instead of giving us the bullshit cap and throttling and uh well so we
had the fun of I got to watch this conversation last night in real life yeah because we all were
out to dinner so uh I'm curious what the like measured responses now that it's not like a
shouting back and forth across a crowded restaurant tables so well we weren't I guess we tried to
talk loud because of the volume yeah not because you guys were mad no no yeah clarification yeah
we like each other um so I think I think spreading misinformation is a little bit
on the harsh side I don't think I am spreading misinformation as I clarified to Zeke uh
I do not have the expertise either legally or technically to read all the net neutrality
regulations compare them to the previous regulations and understand what exactly it means
and how it's going to affect things and I don't think very many people do Zeke said that he
probably doesn't either um and that is why I rely on experts to a fair extent and this gets into
that tricky area when we were talking about the um the conspiracy theories episode like when is it
okay to trust experts and when isn't it when can you do better than them and when should you think
for yourself and when should you trust the consensus and it's it's hard to say but I do know that in
the case of global warming virtually every person who is well versed in the field comes down very
far to the side of yes it's happening yes humans are directly responsible yes it's going to be bad
if we don't do something about it and they only differ in how much of that uh how bad it will be
and how much we can do and what we should do to to make things better so uh there there's almost
no people saying the opposite so when you have that much of a degree of consensus opinion I'm
sure you're allowed to go along with the experts unless you have a really damn good reason not to
and when I do my reading on net neutrality there is the majority not a large majority but a majority
of people do say uh similar to Zeke that in in general there should be some sort of regulation
over these monopolies but there is a minority that is sizable it's not like the ridiculous
minority of the global warming they have some decent arguments and they are not a tiny minority
that says that the net neutrality thing isn't really helping that much and may in fact be
impeding the building of new infrastructure which is something that we may run into as a problem
in the not too distant future and that they think that we would be better off without the net
neutrality regulations that were introduced a few years ago going back to something more hands off
is net neutrality tied to infrastructure or is that just another talking point that
because they're like my only my my major exposure to this is one I don't know about your source
that it was a primary information about this but I know that sort of sources like Reddit,
GitHub and you know other techy platforms put big banners across the websites you know when
these are going on saying let your representatives know this is a bad thing yeah um like so
they're like from my perspective like the techy sphere was pro net neutrality and I guess my
other concern like as far as the well they're interestingly not as pro it as they were in
the past although they were again the majority still pro it a decent by a decent amount yeah
and I guess that's interesting yeah you mentioned Netflix is you know weird example but not weird
in like dismissible but they're I think they're I'm wondering if they're atypical because they had
a particular big dog in the fight where you know so I think they I'm wondering if the analogy to
something like global warming lasts because nobody stands to make well not like any of the major
players hold on let me scratch that stand to make money from saying global warming is a problem
we should fix it it's not like you know a bunch of like new indie green energy companies are like
it's terrible we should stop it I'm sure they all were but that wasn't like the primary motivator
saying it was bad saying global warming is bad and real whereas like I think you know probably
well everybody who is stands to make a buck says net neutrality is terrible right and then there might
be some sane people who don't stand don't have anything in the fight but also say it's a bad
idea that we should do with the neutrality but I'm wondering if it's easy to separate those voices
right right the reason I went with the minority in this case even because they they had good
some good arguments they had some good technical points and I already have a bit of a bias against
government information against government regulation the I used to not I used to be very much for
we need to rein this shit in and put it under control but the more I see government regulation
and how it actually works in real life the more I'm disgusted by it because I have so with government
new regulations I'm a little bit negative but when it comes to corporations I grew up cyberpunk
and I have an intense loathing of all corporations and corporate America and what it does both to
our democratic system and to the people that it's supposedly is supposed to help and yes I know this
is very uneconomics of me to to have a thing against corporations I realize that they do wonderful
things for humanity or whatever but I personally hate them and when when I see the practical
effects of regulations it is always to it is it always comes down to corporations then start to
write the regulations like almost immediately because politicians don't have the expertise in
these industries that they would need to write good regulations so they get help and the help is
surprised by people who work in the industry and and that's the charitable version of how it actually
goes down right the possibly realist version would be like they're not even you know the the aim of
talking to lobbyists isn't even to bothering forming yourself it's to like you know levy
offers and see how much you can get from each one and say okay cool your offer's 80,000 well
there's 110 I'm gonna go ahead and take their offer and vote against this whatever right yeah I'd
like to think people aren't actually that malicious in politics I'm sure there are some I would like
to think that too but I think most of them aren't that bad but I have a hard time believing that
many of these bad decisions are just poor information that I wish I had known better okay I mean
especially when people are screaming in their faces and calling their offices every day and saying
this is a terrible idea and they're like if only someone had told me well I mean who are they gonna
believe constituents maybe or the people who are that are writing them checks like what what if half
your constituents believe that the earth was created 7,000 years ago I mean come on you gotta
so I guess that I mean fair point but I it's it's hard to from I we can talk about this another
time I don't have a lot to say other than like I would like to say that like hey Nash I'm gonna
tell you about this cool thing and here's $50,000 do you think I'm right right it sounds weird if
it also comes with a check or a promise or whatever you know because you can't literally hand them
cash legally but somehow you do so yeah I yeah I just I believe that corporations are only ever
motivated by profit because that is literally what they were created to do and Charles Strauss
has this term for them alien invaders because they're they're like non-human optimization
processes Ted Chang recently wrote an article which said it was unfortunate it said basically
the real ai's are are is modern economics and that's that's what we actually have to look at
okay I'm being uncharitable and summarizing it poorly no but I just heard that somewhere yeah
but he said basically we don't have to worry about AI because we already have non-human
optimization processes here they are corporations their only motivation is to create more wealth
for shareholders and they are already helping ruin the earth and I agree with him on all those
points except for when he says and therefore we don't have to worry about AI because to me this is
just like AI rich small these are non-human optimization processes and they are wreaking
havoc on the earth just imagine how bad it'll become once they have the intelligence of a
fucking AI behind them where did I know humans at all behind the wheel where did I hear this
paraphrase recently because your paraphrasing was like the exact same summary that I heard
somewhere like in the last two days and this oh I know damn it okay well I'm familiar with that
line thinking and I heard it very recently somewhere and I can't remember where it was
okay so so whenever corporations say something like we care about the environment or we care
about people I'm like no you care about your bottom line and you care about other people
thinking that you care about the you know the social justice or whatever it is because that
gets you more money but fuck you and you get you know you get to look good and bring on new
better people like for example you mentioned that your last job gave you like one business day
a year paid paid time to like do some bullshit charity blanket thing my job I was volunteering
whatever I wanted I got to actually volunteer at DCC and get paid for it then for Comic Con
yeah so this one my same my job lets me do that too let me pick my own charity and I don't
they're talking about like bringing on some for us to pick from if we want but we can do
whatever we want but it's like part of that is like don't we look good letting our you know
our employees are paying them to do the right you know to do charitable action on their own
but you know I mean we just had Robin Hansen on so I don't know how much it how much it's worth
digging into uh if you if you buy and read the elephant in the brain I think that mystery will be
or it won't it won't seem like the corporation is going against its own interests uh once you
understand what they're what they're going at it's kind of obvious but I wanted to plug
his book again because it was great I'm I'm just finishing up the last chapter on politics yeah
but yeah what I was getting to with all that is that um when I see the debate about net neutrality
like other people seem to see the little guy the populist groya rising up against uh the
monopolists trying to control their internet access and what I see is just giant corporations
going at it to see who gets the law to benefit their business the most I mean that's what it was
last time with netflix fighting against the isps and now that netflix got theirs they don't care
anymore they bowed out of the fight this last time the other side of that coin though I hate to interrupt
and is is like it's not like the isps are like the victim here right no no no so like so they're
also standing to make a bunch of money by getting there by getting their stuff so like yeah as long
as we're going to get to that because that's okay that's that is where I was going that it's
basically two giants I've referred to them as dragons Strossies as alien evaders but non-human
things fighting over the laws so that they can manipulate the laws to give them a bigger business
advantage to grab more wealth and our interests as people do not matter at all and so when people
are rallied to one side to me that looks like oh one side is very good at presenting their case
and being like we care about social justice and we care about the environment and aren't we great
and it to me it feels like like people are being used to support one side in a corporate battle
and thinking that they are supporting their own interests which kind of sickens me because I don't
ever want to be on a corporation side and I guess in some cases it can be to someone's advantage
to support one corporation or over another but what annoys me is that I would like there to not
be that battle in the first place which you can do by removing or reducing regulations the less
government is involved in deciding which dragon wins the dragon war the less they're going to spend
money trying to manipulate the government the less they're going to try to get the public rallying
to their side it just I would like it to not be a legal issue in the first place and to go along
with that in well you looked like you were about to say something well I was gonna say I think we'd
all like that not to be the case but you know as it is if the government regulations are keeping the
world's largest scariest dragon in checks that the other dragons can fight and you know they can
so like I guess the giant the world's largest dragon is busy fighting these smaller dragons
because government regulations are keeping the giant one from taking over the world
like that's a better state of affairs than when the government takes its reins off the
giant dragon and it's able to eat all of its opponents and then us right so like I think
that's how people feel about net neutrality right so if Netflix had a dog in the fight to make money
or whatever yes they were doing it for self-serving interests but the interests that they had was
like we want people to buy our shit and make it you know better and easier for them to get and
the interest of the ISPs aligned less with us than Netflix's do right yeah but I and the ISPs
are the bigger dragon in this yes but in the end there's still a dragon that wins people are still
not represented and our laws are being perverted for their wars instead of for actually serving
people I think if people really cared about this sort of thing they would vote to spend tax dollars
like we did up in I believe it was up in Longmont there's been a few uh cities and towns around
nation now who've run their own fiber for Collins won a battle like that recently too yeah and they
had to fight against the corporations to do it right yeah and they I think people would say they
only won because the corporations were had their hands tied in some areas legally to stop being
able to completely shutting them down okay and so without regulations they would have stood no chance
well no the regulations are the only thing which let the corporations
meddle in that in the first place I mean a corporation can't say no you can't run fiber
they don't have the cops they don't have the armies at their disposal if the government
wants to run fiber it fucking runs fiber unless there's regulations that makes the federal government
stepping in and say no city government you can't run fiber because of these rules where we have
made these deals with these dragons I mean it's the regulation that made it that they
Fort Collins had to fight okay I think I see your point so you're you're less anti-net neutrality
and you're more like if I could wave a wand and do away with all the regulations I would
but because I can't I'm willing to just try and get rid of the ones that I can well most regulations
that are legitimate right important yeah no I meant specifically with stuff like the internet
and the telecom and all that stuff right now yeah net neutrality related things so like because you
can't do away with all of them you're okay doing with way with a few of them on the way to all of
them is that your position maybe yes that in general I default to there being less regulation
and when I saw a number of economists and other tech people saying you know what this net neutrality
thing isn't really that big an issue and it might even be better some of them said it might even be
better without it then I was like okay okay I'm not saying I necessarily agree but I can see where
you're coming from yeah I mean obviously people don't agree with me I'm less informed than you
probably most of our listeners on this it's just like I think the end of having to you know being
able to do away with like the regulations and let people just finally get out and do their own
thing is great and you know whittling away at the regulations little by little might be the path there
but I think doing away with some rather than others you know on that path could lead to a lot of
harm so it's not like so as the things are now it sucks things could be worse with fewer and they
could be better with like almost none yeah but so like maybe on the path to almost none assuming we
ever get there could be very bumpy yeah you know and I I acknowledge that I just I hope that isn't
the case and I saw enough things from a few people I trust like uh well I mean like Tyler Cohen as I
said before I'm a fan of his that I thought okay it probably won't be that bad and I mean obviously
it hasn't been so far but it's also only been like a month or two right we haven't really had a chance
to feel any of the impacts yet yeah yeah we'll see how it goes yeah um however I do agree that
they should not be fucking advertising things as unlimited data and then sneakily throttling your
shit they should just straight up tell you how much data you get and or charge you by the gigabit
the other thing honesty thing but fucking piss me off there's there's another dishonesty thing
where it's like you pay for 75 megs a month or 75 megs a second and then the fine prints in your
contract says that's up to 75 megs a second so when you have five yeah like I frequently
have at my place where I pay for 75 um that's like oh you're not paying for 75 you're paying for
up to 75 so presumably if nobody else in in your surrounding three miles was using internet you
could have 75 but because they're using internet you know we have to we we only have so much to
give around just be fucking honest you know but if it was if I was paying for 10 and I was getting
10 I'd be like you know whatever I'm getting what I'm paying for but here it's like I feel like I'm
so you know yeah just just complaining about you know that's that's standard giant corporate stuff
though so exactly yeah although to be fair to to Netflix I haven't had an outage from Netflix in
years but when I used to it would be very you know seldom couple I remember there was a couple of
years where like there was maybe half a dozen outages and it was for a few hours they sent me
email and say hey you were down for six hours yesterday you might not have noticed but here's
like 83 cents back oh cool and it's like you know that's pennies literally to them and to me
but that was the amount of time that I lost being able to be on Netflix if I'd wanted it
that I was paying for which is a super awesome gesture never got that from Comcast and I never
will when we first moved in here we had some outages for the first few weeks and it sucked
and yeah no they they were like well I guess you're just paying us for those two days you
didn't have any internet yeah and when you pro rate down the days for Comcast like I pay like
three bucks a day and you know if I again it's six bucks what you know I'm not gonna break the bank
it's kind of just the principal yeah am I paying for the service or not I don't know that's just
me ranting at at Comcast in particular shakes fist at cloud yeah okay I had it pointed out to me
recently that having a choice between two things sometimes isn't really that much of a choice
and I mean I it's still something I'm glad for example that there's Lowe's and Home Depot because
they're competing against each other and that helps keep them honest helps keep the prices low but
like in the phone's market there's really only two options you're either getting an iPhone or
an Android right and they're different and I guess they helped keep each other's prices down but
like on an iPhone you can't buy anything from the Amazon Kindle app because in in order to
make an in-app purchase Apple gets a cut of it I don't know if it's like five percent I've
heard 30 percent or something but Amazon basically just said no we don't want to give you a cut of it
and Apple said okay fine then you don't you don't get to do in-app purchases on our phone
and if you want to buy something for your Kindle app you have to go through the website
and then download it and that's kind of a pain in the ass and they have not been pressured into
allowing that to be the case by the fact that Google that the Android phones exist they're
different enough that the competition pressures have not helped the consumer in that way because
it would be a boon to the consumer if we could do the in-app purchases and I mean that's that's a
fairly tame example I mean to me the idea like of having two major internet providers if one
wants to raise their prices a couple bucks especially like I still maintain that the main
my main contention here is that most people don't have access to two good ones and many people
like what 30 percent of Americans are lucky to have access to one good one yeah and so
like if that person wants to fuck you you're like okay well do I want internet in my house it's like
you know people argue about it like it's not a necessity and will you die without it probably
not but like a lot of people need it for their jobs a lot of people need it for like uh just
having a good life like you don't need um in lots of cases you can't interface with modern society
without a decent internet connection yeah I mean it's kind of like having a cell phone right like
you don't need one to have a life but like you almost do to have a life in the 21st century in
America it's a lot like having a car in most major cities you need one right there's a few
where the public transport is good enough that you don't but usually you do need a car and if
you don't have one you're crippled I feel the same way about internet and maybe a more dramatic
wave and so like the idea that the the competition as it exists now is enough I don't think it is
I don't think that's the point you're making you are arguing that it might get better or hopefully
will and I was arguing that sometimes the competition isn't all that competitive anyway
that they're distinct enough as as brands that there's some abilities to switch between the
two of them which keeps them from being runaway monopolies but not nearly as much as we would
like it's not like these services are a commodity yet yeah I think that's just that's like I said
before I think that's a factor of it being having a physical infrastructure right like you can't
neither iPhones nor the androids have any physical infrastructure I meant I meant
internet to your house oh that yeah yeah and I mean there's infrastructure of like connecting to
the internet from your phone those those that obviously you know has has stuff involved but
yeah it's it's a it's a whole thing we'll see how it's a complicated subject yeah I'm kind of just
like I mean obviously since we're past the point I mean I I still text that like the resist spot
that lets me send a letter to my representative and stuff about you know we care about this but
I don't think those do anything I mean well let me rephrase that do contact your people and bug
them because you know if they get enough people to get in there you know to to send in information
or send in comments saying I won't vote for you if you don't vote for net neutrality then they're
you know they'll say well if I want to keep my job I better do it I better actually do what I my
role is supposed to be which is you know abide by the will of my constituents so let them know
how you feel scratch that whole thing about me saying it doesn't matter I feel helpless and that's
why I said that but I don't think that's necessarily true so for anyone who cares about these things
enough a actual phone call is is worth more than you know something sent in online and an actual
letter is worth a ton because that takes effort like they don't get all that many letters I think
I heard like one letter is worth 30 phone calls and I don't even know how many bot messages you
know it takes to make up a phone call because that's costly to actually type something up and print
it out and put a stamp on an envelope and take it to a mailbox like if you write it out by hand
that's just insane you know so the more the the more obvious effort you have to put into something
the more it really matters so if you do it in the wood burning and then ship that to their office
then you know carve it in stone right at that point we may be getting a little excessive yeah
you should just buy them a dinner if you can afford to do that be a lobbyist
okay I think that's all we have and it's all we have to um I hope the episode came out okay with
the sound stuff I'm sure I don't know why I'm talking about this on the air I'm rambling it's
time to get off the time to time to get off the air so and once again many prompts to Kyle for
helping us sound good and making this episode and this podcast everything it can be Kyle more is a
the real reason why we still have a show people would people hated our editing because well
especially mine he knows what he's doing but they're also busy so yeah exactly anyway so thanks to
Kyle thank you very much all right goodbye y'all see you in a couple weeks later oh oh oh also um
I should throw this in as well I am going to be bringing back my old methods of rationality podcast
so there'll be more rationalist fiction soon next week it's starting up with a single short story
that I have gotten published in analog and then a month after that we will start into our full
novel length uh feature I guess you mean a week from today not a week from the airing of this
episode so no a week from the airing of this episode okay yeah and then a month after that I'm
going to start in on crystal society by max harms which is um you know I think well known ish in
rationalist fiction circles and very much loved and as a previous guest if you want a quick primer
on the the book I guess if you want any spoilers don't listen to it that's true there will be
lots of spoilers but max harms was on an episode and he's awesome so yeah uh anyway yeah all right
bye
