before I think that's a factor of it being having a physical infrastructure right like you can't
neither iPhones nor the androids have any physical infrastructure I meant I meant
internet to your house oh that yeah yeah and I mean there's infrastructure of like connecting to
the internet from your phone those those that obviously you know has has stuff involved but
yeah it's it's a it's a whole thing we'll see how it's a complicated subject yeah I'm kind of just
like I mean obviously since we're past the point I mean I I still text that like the resist spot
that lets me send a letter to my representative and stuff about you know we care about this but
I don't think those do anything I mean well let me rephrase that do contact your people and bug
them because you know if they get enough people to get in there you know to to send in information
or send in comments saying I won't vote for you if you don't vote for net neutrality then they're
you know they'll say well if I want to keep my job I better do it I better actually do what I my
role is supposed to be which is you know abide by the will of my constituents so let them know
how you feel scratch that whole thing about me saying it doesn't matter I feel helpless and that's
why I said that but I don't think that's necessarily true so for anyone who cares about these things
enough a actual phone call is is worth more than you know something sent in online and an actual
letter is worth a ton because that takes effort like they don't get all that many letters I think
I heard like one letter is worth 30 phone calls and I don't even know how many bot messages you
know it takes to make up a phone call because that's costly to actually type something up and print
it out and put a stamp on an envelope and take it to a mailbox like if you write it out by hand
that's just insane you know so the more the the more obvious effort you have to put into something
the more it really matters so if you do it in the wood burning and then ship that to their office
then you know carve it in stone right at that point we may be getting a little excessive yeah
you should just buy them a dinner if you can afford to do that be a lobbyist
okay I think that's all we have and it's all we have to um I hope the episode came out okay with
the sound stuff I'm sure I don't know why I'm talking about this on the air I'm rambling it's
time to get off the time to time to get off the air so and once again many prompts to Kyle for
helping us sound good and making this episode and this podcast everything it can be Kyle more is a
the real reason why we still have a show people would people hated our editing because well
especially mine he knows what he's doing but they're also busy so yeah exactly anyway so thanks to
Kyle thank you very much all right goodbye y'all see you in a couple weeks later oh oh oh also um
I should throw this in as well I am going to be bringing back my old methods of rationality podcast
so there'll be more rationalist fiction soon next week it's starting up with a single short story
that I have gotten published in analog and then a month after that we will start into our full
novel length uh feature I guess you mean a week from today not a week from the airing of this
episode so no a week from the airing of this episode okay yeah and then a month after that I'm
going to start in on crystal society by max harms which is um you know I think well known ish in
rationalist fiction circles and very much loved and as a previous guest if you want a quick primer
on the the book I guess if you want any spoilers don't listen to it that's true there will be
lots of spoilers but max harms was on an episode and he's awesome so yeah uh anyway yeah all right
bye
