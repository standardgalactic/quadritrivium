other concern like as far as the well they're interestingly not as pro it as they were in
the past although they were again the majority still pro it a decent by a decent amount yeah
and I guess that's interesting yeah you mentioned Netflix is you know weird example but not weird
in like dismissible but they're I think they're I'm wondering if they're atypical because they had
a particular big dog in the fight where you know so I think they I'm wondering if the analogy to
something like global warming lasts because nobody stands to make well not like any of the major
players hold on let me scratch that stand to make money from saying global warming is a problem
we should fix it it's not like you know a bunch of like new indie green energy companies are like
it's terrible we should stop it I'm sure they all were but that wasn't like the primary motivator
saying it was bad saying global warming is bad and real whereas like I think you know probably
well everybody who is stands to make a buck says net neutrality is terrible right and then there might
be some sane people who don't stand don't have anything in the fight but also say it's a bad
idea that we should do with the neutrality but I'm wondering if it's easy to separate those voices
right right the reason I went with the minority in this case even because they they had good
some good arguments they had some good technical points and I already have a bit of a bias against
government information against government regulation the I used to not I used to be very much for
we need to rein this shit in and put it under control but the more I see government regulation
and how it actually works in real life the more I'm disgusted by it because I have so with government
new regulations I'm a little bit negative but when it comes to corporations I grew up cyberpunk
and I have an intense loathing of all corporations and corporate America and what it does both to
our democratic system and to the people that it's supposedly is supposed to help and yes I know this
is very uneconomics of me to to have a thing against corporations I realize that they do wonderful
things for humanity or whatever but I personally hate them and when when I see the practical
effects of regulations it is always to it is it always comes down to corporations then start to
write the regulations like almost immediately because politicians don't have the expertise in
these industries that they would need to write good regulations so they get help and the help is
surprised by people who work in the industry and and that's the charitable version of how it actually
goes down right the possibly realist version would be like they're not even you know the the aim of
talking to lobbyists isn't even to bothering forming yourself it's to like you know levy
offers and see how much you can get from each one and say okay cool your offer's 80,000 well
there's 110 I'm gonna go ahead and take their offer and vote against this whatever right yeah I'd
like to think people aren't actually that malicious in politics I'm sure there are some I would like
to think that too but I think most of them aren't that bad but I have a hard time believing that
many of these bad decisions are just poor information that I wish I had known better okay I mean
especially when people are screaming in their faces and calling their offices every day and saying
this is a terrible idea and they're like if only someone had told me well I mean who are they gonna
believe constituents maybe or the people who are that are writing them checks like what what if half
your constituents believe that the earth was created 7,000 years ago I mean come on you gotta
so I guess that I mean fair point but I it's it's hard to from I we can talk about this another
time I don't have a lot to say other than like I would like to say that like hey Nash I'm gonna
tell you about this cool thing and here's $50,000 do you think I'm right right it sounds weird if
it also comes with a check or a promise or whatever you know because you can't literally hand them
cash legally but somehow you do so yeah I yeah I just I believe that corporations are only ever
motivated by profit because that is literally what they were created to do and Charles Strauss
has this term for them alien invaders because they're they're like non-human optimization
processes Ted Chang recently wrote an article which said it was unfortunate it said basically
the real ai's are are is modern economics and that's that's what we actually have to look at
okay I'm being uncharitable and summarizing it poorly no but I just heard that somewhere yeah
but he said basically we don't have to worry about AI because we already have non-human
optimization processes here they are corporations their only motivation is to create more wealth
for shareholders and they are already helping ruin the earth and I agree with him on all those
points except for when he says and therefore we don't have to worry about AI because to me this is
just like AI rich small these are non-human optimization processes and they are wreaking
havoc on the earth just imagine how bad it'll become once they have the intelligence of a
fucking AI behind them where did I know humans at all behind the wheel where did I hear this
paraphrase recently because your paraphrasing was like the exact same summary that I heard
somewhere like in the last two days and this oh I know damn it okay well I'm familiar with that
line thinking and I heard it very recently somewhere and I can't remember where it was
okay so so whenever corporations say something like we care about the environment or we care
about people I'm like no you care about your bottom line and you care about other people
thinking that you care about the you know the social justice or whatever it is because that
gets you more money but fuck you and you get you know you get to look good and bring on new
better people like for example you mentioned that your last job gave you like one business day
a year paid paid time to like do some bullshit charity blanket thing my job I was volunteering
whatever I wanted I got to actually volunteer at DCC and get paid for it then for Comic Con
yeah so this one my same my job lets me do that too let me pick my own charity and I don't
they're talking about like bringing on some for us to pick from if we want but we can do
whatever we want but it's like part of that is like don't we look good letting our you know
our employees are paying them to do the right you know to do charitable action on their own
but you know I mean we just had Robin Hansen on so I don't know how much it how much it's worth
digging into uh if you if you buy and read the elephant in the brain I think that mystery will be
or it won't it won't seem like the corporation is going against its own interests uh once you
understand what they're what they're going at it's kind of obvious but I wanted to plug
his book again because it was great I'm I'm just finishing up the last chapter on politics yeah
but yeah what I was getting to with all that is that um when I see the debate about net neutrality
like other people seem to see the little guy the populist groya rising up against uh the
monopolists trying to control their internet access and what I see is just giant corporations
going at it to see who gets the law to benefit their business the most I mean that's what it was
last time with netflix fighting against the isps and now that netflix got theirs they don't care
anymore they bowed out of the fight this last time the other side of that coin though I hate to interrupt
and is is like it's not like the isps are like the victim here right no no no so like so they're
also standing to make a bunch of money by getting there by getting their stuff so like yeah as long
as we're going to get to that because that's okay that's that is where I was going that it's
basically two giants I've referred to them as dragons Strossies as alien evaders but non-human
things fighting over the laws so that they can manipulate the laws to give them a bigger business
advantage to grab more wealth and our interests as people do not matter at all and so when people
are rallied to one side to me that looks like oh one side is very good at presenting their case
and being like we care about social justice and we care about the environment and aren't we great
and it to me it feels like like people are being used to support one side in a corporate battle
and thinking that they are supporting their own interests which kind of sickens me because I don't
ever want to be on a corporation side and I guess in some cases it can be to someone's advantage
to support one corporation or over another but what annoys me is that I would like there to not
be that battle in the first place which you can do by removing or reducing regulations the less
government is involved in deciding which dragon wins the dragon war the less they're going to spend
money trying to manipulate the government the less they're going to try to get the public rallying
to their side it just I would like it to not be a legal issue in the first place and to go along
with that in well you looked like you were about to say something well I was gonna say I think we'd
all like that not to be the case but you know as it is if the government regulations are keeping the
world's largest scariest dragon in checks that the other dragons can fight and you know they can
so like I guess the giant the world's largest dragon is busy fighting these smaller dragons
because government regulations are keeping the giant one from taking over the world
like that's a better state of affairs than when the government takes its reins off the
giant dragon and it's able to eat all of its opponents and then us right so like I think
that's how people feel about net neutrality right so if Netflix had a dog in the fight to make money
or whatever yes they were doing it for self-serving interests but the interests that they had was
like we want people to buy our shit and make it you know better and easier for them to get and
the interest of the ISPs aligned less with us than Netflix's do right yeah but I and the ISPs
are the bigger dragon in this yes but in the end there's still a dragon that wins people are still
not represented and our laws are being perverted for their wars instead of for actually serving
people I think if people really cared about this sort of thing they would vote to spend tax dollars
like we did up in I believe it was up in Longmont there's been a few uh cities and towns around
nation now who've run their own fiber for Collins won a battle like that recently too yeah and they
had to fight against the corporations to do it right yeah and they I think people would say they
only won because the corporations were had their hands tied in some areas legally to stop being
able to completely shutting them down okay and so without regulations they would have stood no chance
well no the regulations are the only thing which let the corporations
meddle in that in the first place I mean a corporation can't say no you can't run fiber
they don't have the cops they don't have the armies at their disposal if the government
wants to run fiber it fucking runs fiber unless there's regulations that makes the federal government
stepping in and say no city government you can't run fiber because of these rules where we have
made these deals with these dragons I mean it's the regulation that made it that they
Fort Collins had to fight okay I think I see your point so you're you're less anti-net neutrality
and you're more like if I could wave a wand and do away with all the regulations I would
but because I can't I'm willing to just try and get rid of the ones that I can well most regulations
that are legitimate right important yeah no I meant specifically with stuff like the internet
and the telecom and all that stuff right now yeah net neutrality related things so like because you
can't do away with all of them you're okay doing with way with a few of them on the way to all of
them is that your position maybe yes that in general I default to there being less regulation
and when I saw a number of economists and other tech people saying you know what this net neutrality
thing isn't really that big an issue and it might even be better some of them said it might even be
better without it then I was like okay okay I'm not saying I necessarily agree but I can see where
you're coming from yeah I mean obviously people don't agree with me I'm less informed than you
probably most of our listeners on this it's just like I think the end of having to you know being
able to do away with like the regulations and let people just finally get out and do their own
thing is great and you know whittling away at the regulations little by little might be the path there
but I think doing away with some rather than others you know on that path could lead to a lot of
harm so it's not like so as the things are now it sucks things could be worse with fewer and they
could be better with like almost none yeah but so like maybe on the path to almost none assuming we
ever get there could be very bumpy yeah you know and I I acknowledge that I just I hope that isn't
the case and I saw enough things from a few people I trust like uh well I mean like Tyler Cohen as I
said before I'm a fan of his that I thought okay it probably won't be that bad and I mean obviously
it hasn't been so far but it's also only been like a month or two right we haven't really had a chance
to feel any of the impacts yet yeah yeah we'll see how it goes yeah um however I do agree that
they should not be fucking advertising things as unlimited data and then sneakily throttling your
shit they should just straight up tell you how much data you get and or charge you by the gigabit
the other thing honesty thing but fucking piss me off there's there's another dishonesty thing
where it's like you pay for 75 megs a month or 75 megs a second and then the fine prints in your
contract says that's up to 75 megs a second so when you have five yeah like I frequently
have at my place where I pay for 75 um that's like oh you're not paying for 75 you're paying for
up to 75 so presumably if nobody else in in your surrounding three miles was using internet you
could have 75 but because they're using internet you know we have to we we only have so much to
give around just be fucking honest you know but if it was if I was paying for 10 and I was getting
10 I'd be like you know whatever I'm getting what I'm paying for but here it's like I feel like I'm
so you know yeah just just complaining about you know that's that's standard giant corporate stuff
though so exactly yeah although to be fair to to Netflix I haven't had an outage from Netflix in
years but when I used to it would be very you know seldom couple I remember there was a couple of
years where like there was maybe half a dozen outages and it was for a few hours they sent me
email and say hey you were down for six hours yesterday you might not have noticed but here's
like 83 cents back oh cool and it's like you know that's pennies literally to them and to me
but that was the amount of time that I lost being able to be on Netflix if I'd wanted it
that I was paying for which is a super awesome gesture never got that from Comcast and I never
will when we first moved in here we had some outages for the first few weeks and it sucked
and yeah no they they were like well I guess you're just paying us for those two days you
didn't have any internet yeah and when you pro rate down the days for Comcast like I pay like
three bucks a day and you know if I again it's six bucks what you know I'm not gonna break the bank
it's kind of just the principal yeah am I paying for the service or not I don't know that's just
me ranting at at Comcast in particular shakes fist at cloud yeah okay I had it pointed out to me
recently that having a choice between two things sometimes isn't really that much of a choice
and I mean I it's still something I'm glad for example that there's Lowe's and Home Depot because
they're competing against each other and that helps keep them honest helps keep the prices low but
like in the phone's market there's really only two options you're either getting an iPhone or
an Android right and they're different and I guess they helped keep each other's prices down but
like on an iPhone you can't buy anything from the Amazon Kindle app because in in order to
make an in-app purchase Apple gets a cut of it I don't know if it's like five percent I've
heard 30 percent or something but Amazon basically just said no we don't want to give you a cut of it
and Apple said okay fine then you don't you don't get to do in-app purchases on our phone
and if you want to buy something for your Kindle app you have to go through the website
and then download it and that's kind of a pain in the ass and they have not been pressured into
allowing that to be the case by the fact that Google that the Android phones exist they're
different enough that the competition pressures have not helped the consumer in that way because
it would be a boon to the consumer if we could do the in-app purchases and I mean that's that's a
fairly tame example I mean to me the idea like of having two major internet providers if one
wants to raise their prices a couple bucks especially like I still maintain that the main
my main contention here is that most people don't have access to two good ones and many people
like what 30 percent of Americans are lucky to have access to one good one yeah and so
like if that person wants to fuck you you're like okay well do I want internet in my house it's like
you know people argue about it like it's not a necessity and will you die without it probably
not but like a lot of people need it for their jobs a lot of people need it for like uh just
having a good life like you don't need um in lots of cases you can't interface with modern society
without a decent internet connection yeah I mean it's kind of like having a cell phone right like
you don't need one to have a life but like you almost do to have a life in the 21st century in
America it's a lot like having a car in most major cities you need one right there's a few
where the public transport is good enough that you don't but usually you do need a car and if
you don't have one you're crippled I feel the same way about internet and maybe a more dramatic
wave and so like the idea that the the competition as it exists now is enough I don't think it is
I don't think that's the point you're making you are arguing that it might get better or hopefully
will and I was arguing that sometimes the competition isn't all that competitive anyway
that they're distinct enough as as brands that there's some abilities to switch between the
two of them which keeps them from being runaway monopolies but not nearly as much as we would
like it's not like these services are a commodity yet yeah I think that's just that's like I said
