but it would have been kind of really annoying for her to keep,
like, they'd be like Harry Potter 2.0.
It's like, no, he's in the grown-up.
But like, that was never the point of the books, right?
So like having the seven years of school,
that kind of made sense.
So maybe it's easy to do when you have hard limits.
But like, there's like the cursed child.
We're going to pretend that didn't happen.
Right.
I read that it was so bad.
Oh, man, you're the only person I've ever
met who actually read it.
Oh my God, it was so bad.
No, yeah.
Or not.
I don't know if I want to.
No, I'll tell you.
I desperately want to.
One thing I just want to tell you one thing,
but I won't say it on the podcast because it's a spoiler.
We kind of know the podcast.
Although I don't know if anyone cares.
Oh, OK.
Spoiler for the cursed child coming up.
Stay tuned.
So there's, you know, the characters who are,
the main characters are the children of, you know,
Harry and Hermione, et cetera.
And then like, there's an antagonist.
And the reveal is that the antagonist
is Voldemort's daughter.
OK.
How did Voldemort have a daughter?
I don't get it.
How the haven expanded.
Wasn't there a large amount of time travel involved?
Yeah.
And like, that part of it was kind of cool on one hand,
but on the other hand, it just like, if you, you know,
are a rationalist, you're going to hate it
because they aren't much getting correctly.
Or at all.
Yeah.
Which is, I don't know.
I think I did hear about the time travel thing.
So wait, why is the fact that the protagonist
or the antagonist being Voldemort's daughter,
why is that a bad thing?
I don't think it landed for me.
Well, it's like they obfuscated like who the antagonist was
and then like it was like this big mystery.
And it's just like, I just, you know,
that's a really terrible decision.
Like.
And this takes place.
Oh, I guess I, this may be part of the setup.
This takes place when Harry's kids are at Hogwarts.
Yeah.
Oh, OK.
How did Voldemort have a kid that's their age?
I don't even, how do I not even remember that?
I hated this book so much that I think I like,
actually like forced myself to forget it.
That happens.
That's the way to do it.
That's not just creating it.
Because it was, it was also just really poorly written.
Like the, a lot of the dialogue felt really weird.
Did she write it or did she just endorse it?
I can't remember.
I think she did.
She didn't like write it all.
She, it was.
She was involved.
She was involved.
I don't know how much she was involved.
Yeah.
That's bummer.
Anyway, authorship sounds tough.
I'll stick around to not creating anything.
So.
You're creating a podcast.
I was going to say other than this.
OK.
Which, let's be honest, someone's going to say
Stephen's on a good author today too.
So.
Our final feedback is Captain QWERTY,
who in the subreddit posted a recipe for guilt-free chocolate
in response to just saying that there was no really good
sweets that we could eat yet.
So, I don't know.
I don't bake, but maybe you can give it a try.
I don't actually have the recipe here,
but I'll post a link to it on our website.
Thanks Captain QWERTY.
Yeah.
And finally.
Who said there were no good sweets?
Me.
For, I guess I missed.
No good sweets that don't have lots of calories.
I was getting annoyed about the fact that we haven't
like, you know, managed to come up with technology.
Oh, that's right.
You know, make healthy food, taste like unhealthy food.
Awesome.
Yeah.
I'd be down for some guilt-free cookies.
I mean, Alestra is something that I would probably love
because I love fats and salts, you know,
much more than I expect.
What is it?
Alestra, it's a substitute fat,
but apparently causes anal leakage.
So, there's a downside.
And I don't want to wear an adult diaper everywhere.
So, yeah.
Yeah, there was a Jeff Fox worthy joke from nearly 2000s
about like medications and that was one of the side effects.
And it's like, anal seepage.
It's not even fun to say.
Yeah, that's not a trade-off I'm prepared to make.
No.
It's kind of like, you know, yeah,
you can have lab-grown meat, but it's $3,000 a gram.
So, it's like, I'm not prepared to make that trade-off either.
Yeah.
There's some vegan meat that's actually pretty good.
Oh, totally.
But it's very overpriced.
It's compared to, you know, real meat.
Yeah.
Some real meat.
Yeah, some of the stuff.
Some of the stuff, you can get it safe way.
I don't, I have no idea how ethically sourced it is,
but it's vegan, like meat patties and stuff
from like, what, Morningstar or something?
Like, they come in a box that live in the freezer.
It's nothing fancy.
I'm not sure if it's even overpriced
and so much as real meat is underpriced
because of all the subsidies.
Could be, yeah.
And it tastes slightly worse than real meat.
So, like, I feel like you end up going back
to the real meat unless you have principles.
Or like, really strong willpower.
That's probably a fair point.
Or dietary restrictions.
Should we think of the Patreon?
Yeah, I think we should.
This week, we would like to think our Patreon.
Patreon?
Patreon.
I hate that freaking website is, yeah.
That reminds me, do you know what you get
if you give an Eevee cash to evolve?
If you give an Eevee?
Eevee the Pokemon?
You can't give them cash.
Well, you know, like, how you can give them, like,
the Firestone to turn them into a Flareon, whatever.
Oh, this is like a joke.
Yeah.
Okay, what do you get when you give an Eevee cash?
Patreon.
Okay, that was pretty good.
I knew it was coming and it's a little baby laugh.
That joke will either lose us Patreon supporters
or gain us a Patreon supporter.
If you would like to be one of our Patreons.
The Patreon we're thinking this week is Glenn Willen.
Thank you for supporting us, Glenn.
Thank you.
In general, people over the last several episodes
have been coming out and giving more support every week.
I see more names going up and it's fucking inspiring.
Thanks, guys.
Yeah, it means a lot.
And one of these days, we'll have the funds
to increase the quality of the podcast,
which I'm looking forward to.
So, me too.
Yeah, thanks, Glenn.
Thanks, everybody.
Woo!
All right.
All right, we're out.
