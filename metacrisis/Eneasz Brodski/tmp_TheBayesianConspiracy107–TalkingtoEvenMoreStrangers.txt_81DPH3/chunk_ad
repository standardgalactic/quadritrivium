explanations where like to you it feels I think maybe from the inside and I think I've done this
before too like they're not going to believe me unless I give them lots of details like oh no I
obviously couldn't have sent that text that day you know first let me go back to this morning I
was driving my car and you can ask but like this looks defensive to people right and I think part
of that actually isn't in honed or honed an instinct on mine for being defensive in elementary
school I've gotten trouble all the time because I wasn't a knowing student to have if you're an
elementary school teacher like I would ask a lot of questions and I think they interpreted that as
like me trying to make them look stupid doing dominance thanks to your teacher yeah well but
it wasn't even dominance it would be just more like actually I'm curious about that and then like
they would interpret it yeah they would interpret it as a dominance challenge but I wasn't meaning
it that way I just asked for clarification or something and they couldn't give it that's what
that says products articles about I know that I they almost they could have ruined me but anyway
so then yeah then they would look for shit to get in trouble for us that I'd always have a good
explanation because like there always was an explanation for why I did something
and then I feel like I have to get the entire thing and that sort of carried over to adulthood
and it is damn annoying for everybody I find it charming I'm working on it so that charm will
be going away no Steven's one good personality you have many good personality traits next chapter
I concur that Steven has many good personality traits I waved my hand dismissively
next chapter was about alcohol I think I talked about this one I don't know if I covered as much of
I talked about the the Bolivian village I don't know if I talked about the sexual assault
a lot of like one one whole chapter and a half or about sexual assault tell us about the sexual
well this is also related yeah it's it kind of the overarching thesis of the book they're all
interconnected but um the myopia um a fact that alcohol has the fact that we already have a very
hard time communicating with each other because of these other things going on default truth
transparency being mismatched when you add alcohol then what it does is it causes people
to get hyper focused on short term uh goals and wants and to dismiss things that are outside of
their current field of view so long term goals uh caring about consequences so a lot of people's
first drinking when they're developing brains uh happens in college and at parties when your
brain hasn't fully developed in like the you know types of relational and communicative ways that
are very important as well Gladwell says uh consent between people who've just met is really
entirely clear even before alcohol enters the mix and he cites uh 2015 uh washington post poll
which asked students what constituted consent career sexual activity 47 percent believe that
someone taking off their own clothes constitutes consent 18 believed not saying no constitutes
there was no clear consensus on any indicator of consent among any of the participants I don't
want to derail but only 18 percent thought that not saying no constituted consent that's 18 percent
more than I would like you need to do more than just not say no you can intimidate someone into
staying quiet if well okay yeah I guess I was picturing onto like an ordinary circumstance
you know like uh where where there's clearly positive signals and you're you're reading
the room right and it's okay cool they're into this you can't read the room um a lot of assigned
female people are raised to never say no and be people pleasing and then a lot of male assigned
people are raised to be assertive and aggressive and take what they want yeah see I don't have a
long dating history but I guess I most of the women I met were like the thing is you could
more strongly strongly person strongly uh positioned I guess to say like what they thought about
things and they could just be like no I'm good and especially like saying no could also be like a
response to like do you want to keep doing this and if they answer if they say yes then it's like
what else are you supposed to infer so like then in that sense they not they didn't say no so if a
yes isn't enough uh I guess this is this is derailing and just I find that confusing I yeah I feel
like a lot of people just have these list of rules and find ways to try to game them as opposed to
actually actively wanting to make sure that their partner wants to do this and is having a good time
to and it's a lot yeah I mean once you know somebody to be able to read them because you
know them that's the whole point of it but uh it's when you've just first met someone you can
do a lot of things like oh well you know technically she went along with everything I did and stuff and
it's it's it has to be a priority if it's someone you've just met like a very strong
priority of yours to make sure that they're absolutely wanting to do this yeah and that
should be like both or all parties responsibility because the most common thing is the you know
female assigned person getting like being people pleasing you the male assigned person being the
assertive one but in my case I've been on both sides of this and it's just you don't even have to
bring uh acting in bad faith into it both people can be acting in good faith on their part and you
get a situation where one partner here says that they've been raped by the other and the other
says I we I've tried as hard as I knew how to to like infer consent and so this this is a false
allegation we both consented of its own from both of their perspectives like you don't know their
history the one person maybe uh just like had PTSD got triggered by the interaction bringing
up old PTSD and then basically wearing an dissociative fugue the entire time it was happening
or you know alcohol can be in the mix and the person can totally forget about who the
fuck they are what's going on what they're supposed to be doing tomorrow I remember I had a
female psychology teacher in college explaining about how women couldn't consent when there's
alcohol in their system and I raised my hand and asked like what about men with alcohol in their
system and she woman explained to me that my dick wouldn't work if I was so drunk that I couldn't
consent okay and so I didn't push back and say I've been so drunk that I couldn't shower but
still able to get an erection because I was in a room full of 30 people who was the politician
that said that women who got raped couldn't get pregnant because the woman's fallopian tubes
right right the woman's body has ways of shutting that down if it's a legitimate rape was the the
quote right yeah are people bad at biology well I'm very much obviously a advocate of
getting consent and stuff I guess I'm just confused by that so like if if they say yes and
they act enthusiastic the whole time that's not enough I I think at that point it probably is
if they if they're enthusiastic the whole time then yeah okay see that's that's what I was
misunderstanding I thought that that you're saying like okay well if they if it triggered PTSD or
something but they never said anything no I mean it's still it's their responsibility to like
you know there's there's issues like that where neither person is at fault I think there's a
complicated they both could have tried harder to communicate and understand each other but
that's both of their responsibility okay see I thought that you're saying because like a lot of
assigned assigned female people are told not to whatever explain themselves or something
then it's like well that's not my fault if I asked and they said yes and like they they seemed into
it like it's like unless you're going to have a discussion with somebody you just met who you
think might want to hook up with you be like all right now let's talk rape allegations and consent
before we go home like that's a super off-putting conversation right no one wants to do that
yeah that's what a lot of people kind of recommend now and yeah I'm glad I'm married
in an ideal world they could teach like here's like consent rules in school from a very early age
so everybody has a like cultural understanding of here's how you communicate around this but
basically what this saw Washington Post poll shows that people have like whatever idea their
culture their friends their own minds came up with as far as this is what constitutes consent is
what they think constitutes consent it's a thing we don't talk about as a society like I actually
had my sex ed uh or the contraception specifically part of my sex ed curriculum ripped out of the
books and censored by my school because that if kids learned about contraception then they would have
sex because there wouldn't be consequences how terrible if the only consequence to sex was that
everyone has a great time that they go and have sex we can't be having that but no to Steven's point
like if someone is enthusiastically into it it's in my opinion totally fine it's just a matter of
you know actually being sure that they are enthusiastic and into it like every time you
escalate a little bit then they escalate a little bit back you can't be the only one pushing forward
every time because that's a clear sign that they might not be as into this as you are yeah and like
I don't know the is it clear I never had a lot of hookers somebody's a bad person for not like
grilling their partner in regard to consent either I mean like you should try to establish it but like
I would say if if two people I don't know if Joe and Sally uh had sex and then Sally had like a
was in a dissociative feud the entire time and but what was just saying yes yes yes everything
because to get it to stop I think it's always fault for not communicating or at least I don't
like to say that it's somebody's fault it's unfortunate but I don't think that Sally could
bring Joe to court and say that at some point you hooked up with Rachel for the first time right
like you guys didn't just start out having already had sex yeah um there I feel like if I was
misinterpreting the signals I could under no reasonable or even unreasonable circumstance
been okay um I guess this is this is more for like I mean it's like it's a it's a whole
own topic I'll leave you at that kind I've not been able to stop touching my face okay I've got
a question about that because my thinking is I haven't left the house in a week fine it yeah so
like nothing in the house has has germs on it so I've been touching I'll touch my face like mad
because my hands are clean so is everything in my house it's like if you go out yeah if nobody
comes over and if you and Rachel have been quarantined together and either of you've developed
symptoms then your house Rachel talking a lot of like decaying corpses uh not usually um even even
under yeah so she is still working she had she went out like maybe three times last week um they're
finally catching on it took them a while that and it helped with the fact that nursing homes aren't
letting people in um so she can't go visit patients at nursing homes anyway uh she went to go
one guy last week and had to swing by the office to get a mask and a gown to wear
and just told to reuse both of them um which just you know as I roll at the whole thing about
the medical establishment doesn't have enough fucking gloves and masks for everybody because
everyone's buying these things in bulk and I don't get it wrong I have gloves uh disposable gloves
that I bought a year ago to pair like raw meat with and if I wanted to wear those to safe way go
nuts I have a couple of germ masks because uh you know when I go to the doctor for random stuff
if they have them in the waiting room I'd grab one just to have a round you know like if I wanted
like I'll wear them on planes and stuff if I feel like it right right those masks are more for
protecting you and like for protecting those around you when you are sick and you have to go
outside I sort of figured like if they keep germs inside the mask they'll keep germs out
but I'll take the I'll take the word for it that um they probably don't do much uh if people say so
it doesn't make sense to me how it keeps things in but not out but I'm not a scientist so I'll
just take the scientist's word on it that said uh you know I'd grab them when they made me feel
better but I'd grab one or two when they weren't scarce the people now who'll walk into the ER and
like shove them all in their purse or in their coat pockets or something blows my people do that
yeah there aren't like it even like hospitals and medical um they're mentioning them at my hospital
medical professionals don't have enough of them to distribute well no I've heard that but like
people are stealing from ERs I can only assume so otherwise where else are they all going well
maybe they're using them all and they can't restock because of the shortage oh that's definitely
part of it um but I know that other people are stockpiling like stuff that's not theirs that's
the thing is like I understand the impulse to protect yourself I saw I'll find a great video um
and make a note of it there was just this great little breakdown that someone shared on one of
the work channels on Slack um of a of a dad who crunched the math for like you know all right so
this you know I saw someone at Costco buy four jumbo rolls of toilet paper here's how many
shits per day they'd have to take if they were going to burn through all of that in two weeks
it was like 120 or something per person uh to burn through all that toilet paper assuming 20 squares
of shit um and then it just had to them looking at the camera he was like calm down everybody
so the next few chapters were the ones I was having a hard time summarizing last time and
it was talking about um the sander bland case the woman who was pulled over for
failing to signal this ended in her committing suicide in jail the author frames this as
defaulting to truth at the wrong time and also brings in the yeah um they're talking about
before that chapter the policing uh that was developed to work in high crime areas the Kansas
City policing which doesn't make any sense in low crime areas because it's a really aggressive tactic
but cops because it worked really well work decided that they were going to just oh Kansas
City policing everywhere this led to cases like uh people like sander bland being pulled over
because in high crime areas they're expecting you pull somebody over for anything but what you're
really looking for is drugs or guns in sander bland's case she just had like there were some
things that didn't really make sense that would like trigger somebody look aha this i'm gonna pull
this person over they have license plates from a different state oh they're behaving in a way that
and again that's the uh starting to bring in a bunch of the examples behaving in a way that looks
suspicious quote unquote the cop not understanding that like sander bland had a bunch of she you
know was depressed and suicidal had a bunch of really high stress things going on in her life
at the time and responded in a way that looks to him like aggressiveness uh failure to cooperate
you know it was just making him more suspicious that this this person has something to hide this
person's acting like a criminal so there's the the mismatch and yeah so this officer uh ensina
ensina assume that he could interpret character from demeanor uh is is it just me or is it kind
of fucked up that they look for drugs and guns which are things that people should be legally
able to own anyway yeah yeah they do tend to be correlated with crime though so kind of from a
policing standpoint generally if you pull somebody over he's got a bunch of drugs and
guns they're not doing it for yourself defense and like you're like fun recreation time but yeah
i mean i agree um yeah these kinds of i don't know this makes there's a court case he talks about
in the beginning of the book too there's this case um all the examples kind of come together
instruct to show how these biases that uh make us really bad at talking to strangers are a big problem
um a lot of the institutions that we have are not like correctly informed about them
like court they had a court case or no it was a a bail judge compete against an ai um so the
bail judge was reviewing cases face to face with people seeing their own testimony uh the witnesses
watching their body language you know like they should have had the advantage but yeah they compared
their uh decisions about who would be safe to let out on bail and who was going to commit crimes
again um they ran humans against uh ai that could just read the trial papers the the bail case and
the ai outperform the humans the ai outperform the humans like in a majority of cases where you would
want like he would hope that humans would be good at these things like they have um a variety of
people take these kinds of tests not just the bail judge was all of those are the professionals but
like you know um cia operatives and humans always perform worse than the ai we're worse at what
criterion which which people should go to jail versus which should be left out on bail and then
after the fact which people committed crime again and were arrested again or which ones were safe
see i i absolutely believe this is the case because i just think ai's are better than humans
at this sort of thing because all they look at is the data but every time something like this gets
brought up people tend to go with well the data that the ai are trained on is all flawed because
we incarcerate black people more or we incarcerate people from this socioeconomic area more than
they should be incarcerated whatever like i i always hear these things but then like on the
actual objective metric they did better with classifying people but like what they're talking
about as far as like black's getting incarcerated more is that that's happening because of because
of human error because of these biases so like it's not the ai's fault no it's not but they keep
saying that like the ai's trained on worse data but apparently the ai did a better job than
than the humans even at predicting who would recommit crimes yeah the thing is that like
they're like oh that you know these people are incarcerated because of bias and i'm like yeah
but the people who are competing against the ai are also biased like why do you think that a human
is going to be better at like reviewing the case than an ai based on that you know a human is going
to be biased especially human court system who like arrested somebody wrongfully in the first place
and apparently the ai is biased less because it gets answers better more often answers right
more often yeah and that's even even as you pointed out working with this vlog data like
