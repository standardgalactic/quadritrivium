the ai was reading the court case or the the bail case that had been written by human
this is sort of an aside but that does raise the question i wonder like if i was in that
situation as a as a defendant like i feel like i'd want to make my case with people
not have some robot black box determine my fate that's apparently an emotional appeal
but that i wonder about that for myself like i i don't i don't know if i'd want a robot
determining my fate i'd want to be able to like talk to a judge or to people and say no look here's
what here's what i was thinking here's what was going on yeah i mean that's the same instinct
that's driving people to continue to have court cases reviewed by humans though yeah no i'm just
saying it i feel like it's an understandable impulse i think it might be good to be able to
have humans looped in to be able to veto the computer like no this is obviously a case of
the computer making an error but in general i don't know like what you're saying is you think
you'd be more convincing to a human who is easier to fool than to an ai right um i don't mean like
if i was a bad criminal i meant that like if things look bad but like no look there's all these
exonerating circumstances that make it clear that i'm not the kind of person who should spend
five years in jail or something or like it sounds like you're assuming a human will be able to reach
you but but they won't well i guess i when you say they read the court documents i guess i'm not
sure is that including the ones where i'm sitting there talking to the judge um what uh the judges
have access to the documents and then they also get to talk to the person and repeat like over
see the court case um whereas the computers only are reading the the document honestly you have all
the markers going in your favor you have like a good middle-class job you live in a decent middle
class area about the royal me white you don't like the royal i right no no i mean you specifically
yeah i'm not i'm not worried about me specifically i'm not committing crimes i mean like if i if i
got pulled over for uh i don't know no but but that's what i'm saying if you were to have gotten
pulled over for something and you are innocent of it you have all the markers that the air would
look like the only strike you have against you is that your male like you would be better off being
woman in this case but uh it all the other things are like yeah this person is a legit member of
society he's got no record the ai would totally give you bail whereas if you were to go up against a
human that human might be like huh this guy's kind of shifty looking he keeps acting like he's got a
pain in his lower back which is just a clear sign of criminality and like i think you'd have a better
chance with the ai than otherwise i i maybe me specifically i guess i was i was thinking more
generally like if i if i wasn't me but i was anybody i i i i well i understand that the the ai is
better at it and that's probably the way things should go i totally get the impulse of saying no i
want to be able to like plead my case to another human who i know understands people i get it real
but i don't think that like intellectually i think that if i were arrested i would want an ai
or be my case rather than a human because i know that i mismatched the way mandinox was yeah i i don't
perform things well enough to like fool people um on this spectrum i mean i'm thinking that i'm mad
because i will default to a toneless or blank expression when i'm stressed most people would
i do it it'd be a lottery of are you lucky enough to get the young judge who is not jaded and cynical
yet or the judge that has been going over bail cases for 10 years and has been lied to so many
times that he just assumes everyone's lying to him yeah like i said i'm not saying i necessarily
want this i understand the wisdom of it but i can understand the impulse of somebody saying
you mean i don't get to talk to a human to make this decision for me i mean i i i guess i i i i
frankly we shouldn't constrain our our judgments on what makes sense or what what people have to
do by what can be explained to the average person i just think it's a reasonable impulse to have
whether or not it's the optimal one which probably is to have at least some level of
of output that needs to be considered from uh a a black box ai that you know the judges and the
clerks don't understand right that kind of reminds me of something i was going to say earlier about
going all the way back to airplanes and terrorism there's an extent to which the
heightened security made sense from like making the people that were using the airlines feel safer
or like making people feel like something was being done uh keeping public peace i guess
so i can kind of see that too where if we did you know mandate tomorrow that all court cases are
going to be reviewed by ai's instead of humans people would panic i'm just trying to think even
if i was like a young black man late teens early 20s you know often targeted would i rather take
my chances with the ai who's just going to look at the rap sheet or like with the judge
who's probably going to look at what clothes i'm wearing and what my hairstyle is and make
assumptions based off that too that's a good point yeah like i don't know maybe maybe this
isn't the way i feel if i was in that position but yeah unfortunately i'm also um uh as another
thing that i'm studying right now is borderline personality disorder and personality disorders
in general and a bunch of um i'm finding a lot of very i guess disheartening data showing that a
lot of court cases are resolved due to emotions like people are more swayed by people who make
emotional appeals than they are by facts or reason yeah like there's a lot of um you know the worst
examples are people with like narcissistic or antisocial personality disorder who are able to
lie to people's faces and they're like very abused spouse trying to like beg to like let
them take custody of the children with the other you know they're just not like
coherent they're crying they're like and then the other person is just like able to be incredibly
charismatic and make whatever point they like know are going to infest the judges but like that's
the kind of thing too that the ai would be able to fix because there's a lot of cases of people
who are abusive getting custody of the children over and over again because they're able to convince
courts with their emotional appeals that they're the innocent victim and the other person or like
you know that some other circumstances happened they tend to eventually get found out if they keep
going back to the court or if they keep you know if they perpetuate abusive behavior eventually
gets found out and like no matter how good they lie there's going to be a long but like it takes
an overwhelming amount of evidence to sway people that's something that's a point that
Gladwell brings up a bunch of times that we default to truth until we see overwhelming
evidence that somebody is lying and it really should be like we should have the ability to
actually like review evidence in these cases like I would would have given custody of the
correct parent like based on just okay this person has one past instance of abuse in their
history where this other person doesn't but it gets to the point where they have to have like
abuse the children eight times before the human judges will be like oh maybe they have a problem
so instead of talking to strangers we should have ai's do everything or just get better at
like I my hope would be that these kinds of biases were more known thing like the kind of
the thing that I was really happy about with um pre-registering your hypotheses starting to like
be a thing that people know about and have been taking point to do um man that was phrased
awkwardly I'm starting to I've been going at this for a bit um we should probably wrap up here pretty
soon I feel like I think we can pretty much wrap up uh talking to strangers all right give us the
wrap up humans are out ai's are in yeah I mean um I'm glad that Gladwell wrote this book and coined
these phrases uh I might try to write like a less wrong article summarizing it if someone
hasn't already because I think that these are new cognitive biases that don't get like looked at or
talked about as much where we have ones that kind of concern more like scientific judgments that are
well known or points when people are debating there's two things that kind of occurs to me from
thinking about everything you've said about the book the first is that like the world is a far more
lonely place than we would like to think because it turns out we don't actually
know people all that well well not strangers anyway like people that we know maybe but strangers are
more alien and much harder to read than we thought yeah and the other thing that occurs to me is that
like this is probably more of a problem for the more neurotypical like I get the feeling that people
who are more autistic have always had more of a problem relating to people and understanding
strangers so this is kind of like yeah bro we've been here all along and you just were fooling
yourselves into thinking that you could see what other people were doing and how they react and
feel the more I learn about that the more it does kind of reassure me and I feel like kind of a dick
but um I guess I've always kind of felt like yeah okay like neurotypical people can just like have
this magic superpower being able to look at somebody and know what they're feeling and instead
their magical superpower is self deception the thing is that I I know autistic people and I think
I'm getting to be one of them who are very I would say much more skilled than average at um reading
people at like initiating conversations so forth and so on social skills because they have had to
learn it and when you come at it from without like the software that let that you know makes you
deceive yourself um you do actually have to update you have to register your hypotheses test them and
then like get good at you know I want to have a stockpile of t-shirts that say I'm neurotypical
my superpower is self deception and just give them out to people sometimes imagining like you had a
booth somewhere like some rationless confession um yeah that's that's that book I still recommend
reading it uh although I think I yeah that the summary still gives you um the points that he brings
up but reading the book and organically going through the examples and finding the ways that
like they all started to kind of come together at the end when they got to the sander blind case
was pretty it was a good experience for I think giving me a deeper like conceptual framework
of these ideas yeah that's what I think the difference is between reading distillations of
books or and like reading them in long form you just get more concrete models yep uh yep so yeah
cool well thank you very much no that was him uh yeah David and Goliath by Malcolm Gladwell
as the book that came before this one I think that he picks interesting stuff to focus on that
other people aren't really talking about yeah so David and Goliath is a sub title underdogs
misfits in the art of battling giants people who are disadvantaged in some way succeeding against
people with more resources who are more powerful little guy winning against big guy that sounds
awesome I think I should read that yeah it's really good very important for overthrowing the man
pretty much cool all right well um we should move on I would say listener feedback but one
of the listener feedbacks we got is that the episodes have been going really long lately
and also we've been at this for a while because it took us some time to get set up so do we
want to just go into thanking the patron I think that's a good idea I think the next one is Daniel
Conner yes really appreciate your support and I never know what to say during the
thank you person Daniel Conner even in hindsight your contribution is greatly appreciated corner
but yeah corner you're right Daniel corner no worries no we appreciate it thank you so much
for everything you guys do to help keep the lights on around here and uh you know we say the same
thing every time but that means that doesn't mean it's any less appreciated and it really does make
me feel I don't know about you guys but it makes me personally feel like I'm valued and my contribution
is important and that's just a really nice feeling it keeps me going sometimes when I am like do I
really want to record this week and I'm like yeah there's a lot of people that like this enough to
throw us a buck so I'm absolutely gonna go and then I'm always glad I did like I never regret
recording these I really enjoy especially like although I'm terrible at getting on the discord
ever but I'm happy that I'm more able to interact with some of the listeners now and yeah it's a
great feeling to know that people enjoy the stuff that you make and I agree with what you said
Eddie Oshavot like I don't know an important part of my psychology is like feeling like I'm
useful to the world it's like an important value and goal of mine yeah I feel like shit if I feel
like I'm just like you know playing video games and sticking around but like if I feel like I'm
creating things that are helping people that are of value that are even enjoyable then I yeah
one of the things that's done for me too is when we set up a patreon account and I realized like oh
okay people will like financially support small podcasts like this I immediately went out and
supported a lot more stuff it's the kind of thing that you know has an impact on everyone else too
so I try to make sure that everything that I enjoy well not everything that costs too much but
the stuff that I enjoy a lot that otherwise doesn't have a ton of money I try to give
money to so yeah anyway if you have the the resources and feel like it you're welcome to
throw us a buck or so a month or however much you want we have some tiered rewards but the
tiers aren't like greatly articulated or thought out so if there's it like anything you want
any reasonable amount of money just throw it our way we'll strongly consider it we're trying to do
it for you otherwise you can take a minute or two to review this on itunes a podcast platform of
your choice especially if you like it enough to leave five stars makes it easier to find and
shows people what they're getting into if they read some reviews before they subscribe so yeah
and also you can join the conversation if you like on the discord which is linked in the show notes
and we do still have a subreddit which does get some activity we would have read some feedback
from this but we ran out of time so we'll do that next week next episode yeah not not next week
well that's subreddit by the way it's the bezier conspiracy all right well thank you everybody
and see you next time bye everybody thanks everybody
that's good talking to you guys likewise you too
