hey everyone recording all right we are starting in five four three two one
welcome to the base in conspiracy i'm in ash brotsky i'm steven super i'm just sticky
and before we jump in uh last week we did the sequences at the top of the episode and we got
a fair bit of feedback not fair but we got some feedback saying hey that was much better
you guys should do that more often uh you guys want to do that more often
yeah we can do that every time excellent it's also worth pointing out that any lag or latency
or whatever people are hearing between us dialoguing we are uh i just trying to make a funny plug for
social distancing but yes we're doing the smart thing and recording remotely so um which is really
disappointing we just got back together and we were like hey seeing each other in person again
after a long break and now we got to be a pandemic yeah fucking pandemics are very inconvenient
yeah all right so shall we jump right into the less wrong posts i guess that's what we're doing
sounds good to me feels kind of weird having just going right into this without any sort of
warm-up chat but i guess that's what the last hour was for well while we're warm-up chatting
i've got a fun anecdote to share i was talking with my grandma last week who's you know obviously
in a high-risk group for this sort of thing and was relieved to hear that she is taking all of this
like exactly the right level of seriously um she's she's like oh yeah luckily i'm fortunate
that i don't have to leave the house at all um my doctors have canceled all their appointments
which sucks because she did a surgery scheduled for last week that she is now delayed on but
she had like a cardiac something checkup and that was canceled but the doctor personally called
like didn't have like an assistant call like hey how are you doing you know if you're really
concerned we can bring you in and um that was all nice but what i liked most about it was she was
saying oh yeah this isn't you know this is this is serious but i'm not the least bit worried i
remember when polio was ravaging the country and we didn't even have the ability to like uh to you
know disperse news that well like not even everyone had a radio huh so and she's not 100 years old
she's like in her 80s but she grew up in the middle of nowhere Nebraska to where like she
didn't have electricity till she was a teenager so like not everyone in her tiny one mile a one
mile town had a radio back then oh my god what did she do while she was shut in
i don't know if they stayed shut in i don't really like apparently polio did make it to beaver
city nebraska uh my uh her mom had it um so did my dad's dad um it was it was around you know
made made made its way around the country but i'm just amazed it made it to this tiny middle
of nowhere town i'm like who even brought it in like in the days before gps how did anyone
even find this place they asked the you know someone on the road and it's like you go down
yonder take a left at the grain silo that's right so yeah people vaccinate your kids prevents plagues
of polio from sweeping the country i guess that's not something really gotta tell rationalists so
yeah um we had a really thoughtful and concerned patron who um was writing and asking about if we
want if we wanted them to come on they're gonna come on at some point and talk about community
stuff or maybe some coronavirus stuff as well um i'm not sure if they want to go by their real
name or not so i'm not gonna name drop but uh like i feel like we're pretty well informed
as a community i feel like we're a bit ahead of the like not to like pat ourselves in the back
but like we were a bit ahead of the curve as far as like you know sorry or calling me uh
the panic alarms early and that sort of thing so um i wasn't feeling too shy yeah
and we're also not anti-science so we know that vaccinating our kids is a good thing
and i'm actually to be taken seriously yeah i wonder if they're gonna actually stop the uh
anti-vaxxers like six months from now they're just gonna disappear because there's a whole
COVID-19 thing there are a bunch of psychological studies that show that the more like people
try to argue with logic in facts and evidence against somebody who has an entrenched belief
the more they like cling to the entrenched belief yeah but no one's arguing with them right now
it's just you know a plague spreading across the nation yeah the question is is in a year are
they gonna be lining up lining up for a vaccine or not or are there are their kids gonna be the
ones that are barred from going to school because they're still carrying COVID-19 i could easily
imagine them being like the only reason the pandemic got so bad is because so many people
are vaccinating and we're not strengthening our natural immune systems the way god intended
you know like you can justify almost anything if you get it's true oh yeah if you're if you're a
fucking idiot you can you can justify anything yeah i think being isolated for so long has made me
grumpy so everyone fuck a lap the strong coast that kind of well is it relevant it's kind of relevant
and it'll cheer me up from thinking about dumb stuff so what's wrong post number one hindsight
bias youth and hindsight bias as many people might know is when people who knew the answer vastly
overestimate its predictability or obviousness the i knew it all along effect which i i'm sure
everyone can generate examples in their real life of doing this themselves which is important because
people do this shit all the time or talking to people who are like oh yeah i totally saw that
coming yeah i'm just like did you though right would you have bet on it no you didn't even know
about this a year ago or a month ago or whatever yeah this whole uh post is talking about the thing
that i was kind of like ranting about last week the preregistering or hypothesis um thing that more
scientific studies have been doing lately and people have been more i don't know i'm happy to
see more people being aware of and conscientious of this kind of bias in like the real world outside
of just the rational sphere yeah it's nice that we jumped on it 10 years ago but i i'll go ahead and
read the two of the examples given in the post about what hindsight bias is to make hindsight bias
is to make it more uh i don't know concrete for people uh says a researcher asked two groups to
estimate the probability of flood damage caused by blockage of a city-owned drawbridge the control
group was told only the background information information known to the city when it decided
not to hire a bridge watcher the experimental group was given this information plus the fact
that a flood had actually occurred uh this came from an actual court case uh so this was relevant
to something happening in the world instruction what's that do you know what a bridge watcher is
i would imagine it's someone who watches a bridge to see if there's a blockage
it seems like an incredibly boring job kind of like uh what was it Hemingway had the job where
he would just sit in a tower and watch for fires and so that is where he wrote a lot of his shit
because you have nothing to do but look out a window and see that yep forest still is burning
don't exist as much anymore like that would have been great it's all based upon is about
having a job like that where it's like i'm hired to basically listen to audiobooks or this is going
off topic but anyway also with minimum wage laws there's no way a job like that could exist nowadays
like maybe someone would be worth paying a dollar an hour just to sit and look for fires but not
whatever is the required minimum now um anyways uh the experimental group was given the information
that the city had plus the fact that the flood had actually occurred instruction stated that the
city was negligent if the foreseeable probability of flooding was greater than 10% 76% of the control
group concluded that the flood was so unlikely that no precautions were necessary 57% of the
experimental group concluded that the flood was so likely that failure to take precautions was
legally negligent uh the other example was that after september 11th the FAA prohibited box cutters
on airplanes as if that had been the problem uh and the the general lesson is that the cost of
effective uh caution is very high because you have to attend to problems that are not obvious now
as past problems might seem in hindsight that it's you know very expensive to hire a watcher for
every single bridge and and every other possible thing that could go wrong with that bridge to to
uh account for cost a lot of money so you know you take a calculated risk as to whether it's
worth it or not but in hindsight people are like oh they totally should have seen that it was negligent
not to do that one specific thing like it was negligent to allow box cutters on planes how dare
they i remember being a kid when that was happening the whole like banning very i don't know that
planes just getting insane about what things they were banning and every time a terrorist used
something new they banned that thing and i remember being a kid and just thinking like you know how
many other ways you could hijack a plane then hit using a box cutter like i was just i was sitting on
a plane at one point and i did a thought experiment where i was just doing the thing for methods
of rationality where it was like the how many ways could you kill like the other students
creatively in this classroom but i was doing like how many creative ways could i hijack a plane
which i probably should not have been doing anything that's me it was a good thing to think
about that stuff writing it down is a really stupid idea
on a plane is the worst place to do it yeah yeah that's what i was gonna say writing it down in
your seat i'm glad no one looked over your shoulder and being like what the fuck is going on there
well you were a kid right oh right sorry i didn't think about that i remember after the uh shoe
bomber incident and they made people take off their shoes before going on planes and there was
a meme that went around uh now the terrorists are going to put under bombs in their underwear not to
blow anything up just to make a strip before we have to go on planes and like three months later
a guy was stopped trying to get onto a plane with a bomb in his underwear and i was like yeah
yeah you you literally yeah that's great stuff yeah i do like the disparity though what we really
need to do is have everyone stripped down naked and only have their glasses and their wand on
before they get into a plane yeah what could go wrong yeah just hire just hire mad i moody
with an insane budget and say go totally fucking nuts and security yeah but i like those the
disparity just to to refresh on the numbers from the the bridge incident so um the instructions
have stated that the city was negligent if the if the foreseeable probability of flooding was
greater than 10 percent 76 percent of the control group who hadn't been told that the bridge flooded
said yeah that's or that no that that flood doesn't sound likely they took reasonable precautions
right but then if you say oh yeah and the flood happened they're like oh then they were totally
not really they were totally not fair and that that judgment shouldn't come into how likely
thing something was to happen it's just i i think i can't think of a cleaner example yeah i get this
a lot with people who say man in hindsight i really wish i would have done that thing differently
and i i try to tell them you should not regret things that you made the right decision based
on the information you had like sure if you knew about what was going to be happening in the future
you'd change things but i would do a lot of things different if i knew the future i'm sure it's you
go with the information you had and if you rewind time and you made the right decision based on what
you had at the time don't you know i know it's impossible to say don't regret it because you're
going to regret things anyway but at least don't feel like you're a terrible person yeah yeah i've
done this uh i had this fantasy for a long time uh of being able to go back in time like jump into
my past self's body and make different decisions but like it stopped being a fun fantasy once i got
older and when i was thinking about how far back i would go and like how different life would be as
a result of all the random stuff that way it's just like i would just be a different person at
this point so there's no point even thinking about this yeah there's only a certain amount you can
jump back in time and really have it be worthwhile yeah i would try and do like quiet things because
i like most of my life now um so i would i would try to do things that would not disrupt my timeline
what i would do is just buy like i don't know 50 bitcoin when they're crazy cheap or like you know
many many thousands of them when they're crazy crazy cheap and like then that would be the only
change i wouldn't tell anybody and then just live out the rest of my life as i did the first time
and then in december of 2017 or whatever i would sell all of them and become a millionaire and also
not tell anybody i would go back about a year and just really hammered into my head how important
it is not to injure your lower back that's the biggest regret i have right now in my life
yeah if i had an isolated incident that i could point to like oh that's when i fucked up i would
not do that but i'm not sure what i did to it so um so anyways continuing on uh this because
we're getting distracted again uh the test of a model is how much probability it assigns to the
observed outcome when you're you know testing your models of reality hindsight bias systematically
distorts this test that's why you have to write down your predictions in advance as just was saying
and as a lot of people are doing more now uh but as feischoff put it in 1982 this is a quote from
someone we systematically underestimate the surprises that the past held and holds for us
subjecting our this subjects are i'm paraphrasing here this subjects our hypotheses to inordinately
weak tests and presumably we find little reason to change them so yeah that's why you should write
things down beforehand because as a rationalist your superpower is noticing your ability to be
confused and if you keep thinking back on the past was like oh yeah i totally would have predicted that
then you never will update your model for uh how it should be updated when new evidence comes in
because you'll always discount the evidence as in like oh yeah my model totally would have predicted
that when you know if you write down beforehand you can see where it didn't or wouldn't have
and that's how you build a better model you notice your own mistakes and you become stronger
at making predictions um i've said this before but i still highly recommend that people in the
rationalist community make predictions about things record them and then check themselves
even just doing that a little bit has dramatically improved my ability to estimate like how long
something is going to take for example has been one of the most useful things to get better at
predicting yeah i had a lot of um what is the failure mode where you underestimate how long
something is going to take the planning fallacy yeah i had like i continued to really struggle
with planning fallacy related issues but it was still funny remembering myself going through
that period of reading about the planning fallacy being like now i know about the planning fallacy
i'll never fall prey to that again nice what i love about that this is one of the things that
you know make it comes out clearer on like a slower read through uh
plug for we want more uh the podcast and deal with brian deacon um like harry gives this
lifelong lecture to hermione on the planning fallacy and the first thing he does is fallaciously plan
the shit out of his scientific uh experimental regiment and hermione just has the shit even
grin and it's like oh we should we should call it harry bias that's that's way above the top and
it even before that this is i one of my favorite lines by uh anonymous who did hermione granger's
voice was uh early on when they had the book reading contest and harry was like oh i totally
got this is like almost the very first thing they did i totally got this i got a time turner
everything and then she beats him because some unexpected shit cropped up and he didn't have
enough time to read you know and so he goes and he gives his excuses and hermione's like
aw looks like someone fell prey to the planning fallacy and that is not how i had her with his
mouth open and he's like oh shit she's learning and she's slap me right in the face with one of
my favorite words yes and that's not how i had read it at all in my head but when she delivered
that line i was like oh that is absolutely perfect i love it and then i actually like almost just
asked you oh yeah he was anonymous probably they're anonymous because they don't want their name to be
known but uh they did a really good job yeah so they're anonymous because they didn't want to be
like i don't know necessarily associated with this but it was scarlett johansson
every now and then they live not too far out of the city every now and then i see him and
they're forever in the same room at the same time i will introduce you guys
yeah that'd be cool yeah um all right on to hindsight the value science
yeah let me see if there's anything else i wanted to say about that one
no it's gone okay day after day social scientists got into the world day after day they discover
people's behaviors pretty much what you'd expect of course the expectation is all hindsight uh
basically applying the hindsight bias to the social sciences and then um
this is he writes sorry go ahead oh i was just gonna say like as an introduction this next thing
that he does is really cool yeah um if i might if i might also interject i don't think that this
was an original yudkowsky i had the same thing done to me in high school oh really by my psych teacher
yeah i think this is this is a common way of presenting this information uh um and right one
in the same uh the same style but it's specifically done in the social sciences so i'm glad that this
is also something that is known that i know problem in the social sciences now okay yeah
anyway so now we can actually tell people what we're talking about yes um there were a list of
facts about world war two that social scientists discovered about soldiers uh one being better
educated soldiers suffered more adjustment problems than less educated soldiers and then each one has
a little uh for for this one for example intellectuals were less prepared for battle
stresses than street smart people so that's probably why that is yeah so each one there's
like five items they come with like an observation and then a parenthetical like explanation for what
social scientists start you want to go through them real fast yeah yeah actually i think we
could probably read all of them uh southern soldiers coped better with the hot south sea island
climate than northern soldiers because southerners are more accustomed to hot weather uh that was two
three is white privates were more eager to be promoted to non-commissioned officers than black
privates because years of oppression take a toll on achievement motivation four is southern blacks
preferred southern to northern white officers because southern officers were more experienced
and skilled in interacting with blacks that's awkwardly phrased this is an older study i know as
long as the fighting continued soldiers were more eager to return home than after the war ended
because during the fighting soldiers knew they were in mortal danger and i'd like to point out
that uh the historian arthur schlesinger jr dismissed these studies because they were just
ponderous demonstrations of common sense yeah so when you read through this list originally uh i think
they're all intended to be intuitive like yeah and then you can ask so how many of these findings
do you think you could have predicted in advance or any of them cases where you would have predicted
the opposite and like just as an exercise not a bad idea to pause here and just you know maybe
consider that for a second if you haven't read this post yet
and then he drops on us that all the findings above are actually the opposite of what was found
he switched it up on us so now you know how obvious was what you thought in hindsight
and uh are you like oh snap i just got owned or are you like oh okay well that makes sense in the
places where i was a bit confused and then at the very end he says unless of course i actually
reported them right the first time and he doesn't actually tell us which way is the the right way
or if some were inverted and some weren't or whatever and i'm sure we could look it up ourselves
but i never did i just took his point as it was meant yeah i didn't care enough about the like
actual data to go investigate but this this is a just a good example of like the sort of thing where
once in a while it seems like once a week maybe i should be writing these down um and then i could
bring them to the podcast and people were like oh that's actually like a minor use of the sort of
thing um well you get requests somewhat frequently since the show began like four years ago to do
stuff on like how do you do rationalist stuff every day um if i could do here's something like this
i am capable of saying wait that doesn't make sense or oh yeah i guess i could see that and then i'll
like my immediate mental reflex is to say wait would i guess that advanced and i'll say no probably
not and that means that actually i have no idea about any of this so i'll just take you know if
i'm hearing something about uh some insane shit that the medical industry does for hospice care for
my wife i'll be like okay yeah since i guess i could have predicted that either way i'm gonna
just say that i had no fucking clue um and sick with the fact that i have no clue what i'm talking
about and take your word for it because that's all the evidence i have it's it's good to again
actually notice when you're confused as opposed to saying oh yeah i totally would have seen that
well then this it's not even confusion this is me hearing something and saying oh i'm not confused
that makes perfect sense but wait a minute right but does it and yet exactly should you have been
confused maybe right yeah there was that great slated star codex post a couple weeks ago um
that i don't have that aim of and i'm not going to dig up right now but i will put it in the show
notes uh where it's like a kid is asking like the teacher explaining to some child about
like germs and the kid asks look well uh why don't people just stay home for two weeks and
then kill all the germs and the two that that was such a good post i actually want to do like an
episode about that oh okay we'll do that uh if we don't get uh mr hoffman on next week then we'll
do that next week instead yeah or at least like uh i don't know i'll do a longer coverage of that
post just because steven i remembered the name of it too but i know the one you're talking about
and that was something that like a lot of um slate star codex a lot of scouts posts are like
something that i've kind of had in the back of my mind like a portion of and i just couldn't
articulate it and then like that's what i love about slate star codex that occasionally scott will
like it feels like go into my brain and then we like do a really good version of the thing i've
been wondering about or had kind of a like shitty version of the thing but like yeah that thing like
read on the next post oh yeah that thing man he did such a good yeah exactly this i just
run around with my phone like with a slate star codex article and just like show it to people on
the street excitedly going yeah this and this is what i was trying to tell you and they're like i'm
on the street i got 30 seconds i'm not going to read this whole thing right now i have 20 minutes
to read this or better yet i'm sorry i can't read your phone from six feet away you're right
or scott alexander isn't he an alt-right incel didn't he do a favorable book review of
wooden jordan peterson's books that means he endorses everything that guy ever said right
that was actually the funniest book review because i feel like it was just kind of a repetition of
man i fucking hate this guy and this book is irritating and yet i think this is a good point
or like even this is really stupid and yet it kind of works yeah i thought i thought it was awesome
i thought it was a great book review um and and and it shows that like you shouldn't necessarily
discount uh at what somebody has to say just because they say one or two objectionable things
yeah or even if they say 90 objectionable things yeah like they might they might still have a point
to make on some things that are in our demand of expertise right yeah and also you can write
entertaining things even if you are personally a terrible person like i have no idea a fortune
scott card is a bad person or a good person or whatever there's at this point so much
misinformation out there i don't even care to speculate but i don't have to because the fiction
he writes is good regardless of who he is as a person i mean that's the thing is like also people
aren't good or bad people or since got card is a complicated person so i just joined the uh duph um
the duph uh discord recently again i had to have joined it a long time ago when i first started
sporting them but i hadn't you know checked it in a long time anyways and uh not matt who's the other
matt scott was saying that there's been several kevin spacey uh things where he said some great
things about kevin spacey in them and like now he feels like should he go back and put an apology
or take them down or something i'm like no no you shouldn't kevin spacey did an amazing job
and he's a horrible person in the real world but that doesn't mean that he isn't an amazing actor
and did a great job in this movie yeah we saw i mean like how you feel about his acting does not
reflect on how you feel about him as a person or about how you who you are as a person and that's
one of those tough things where i think it can get muddy like um i don't know uh actually i just
texted rachel a picture yesterday it was like hey instead of like seeing all this covet 19 stuff
check out this nice painting and then like beneath it is like congrats you just enjoyed a painting
that was drawn by hitler uh like people get that way about fogner like that was one of the reasons
that the uh traditional wedding march was changed is because he was kind of a nazi supporter and
i'm like the dude's been dead for a long time he wrote some music that is just music there aren't
even any words to it right some of it may have words but no one knows what they are they're in
a different language i don't know certainly the wedding march didn't have any words i'm like what is
what is your problem you're not supporting nazism you're not supporting him it's just music at this
point they're like no no if we play his music it means that we are secretly nazi endorsers
i don't know people are weird people are desperate to read between the lines people people are really
really love their signaling games and think that it's as important things about them if they like
that music i don't know anyways in hindsight they should all be shot
would you would you have predicted would you have predicted that in advance that's the
important thing that i feel i would have because i don't know so the to wrap up hindsight devaluing
science and we already said the last point here which was that hindsight will lead us to systematically
undervalue the surprisingness of scientific findings and this unfairly devalues the contribution
of the researchers and worse it'll prevent you from noticing when you are seeing evidence that
doesn't fit what you really would have expected we need to make a conscious effort to be shocked
enough yeah uh i wanted to say a few things about that like the whole i'm really a fan of the idea
of learning to be more shocked by things um i think it kind of goes hand in hand with
kind of learning to be like maybe gratitude exercises i was thinking about the way that
my life improved significantly when i started taking a conscious effort to just like be amazed
by stuff like i can take a hot shower anytime i want like uh that is pretty cool just like
life is life is freaking cool like looking at a flower growing out of cement sometimes it's just
like i just want to let my mind continue to be blown by things that are that people don't look at
anymore normally um and the same goes for yeah when you learn things like i don't know i keep
thinking of the example of my dad who doesn't listen to this podcast uh just being really like
anti-science in some ways like more recently he had called and was complaining about how
everybody's just panicking unnecessarily about this stupid pandemic and it's just cold and it's fine
and i'm just like i don't know
amazed at people's ability to think that like they're common sense like ideas about the world are
just super obvious but like some of them were just random shit that they made up themselves or
they heard from other people some of the stuff they learned in school that was very difficult to
discover and not intuitive at all at the time that reminds me on pandemic stuff i have one more
quick note my sister is due for a second baby in like three weeks and she just pulled her daughter
out at daycare later than i think she should have um although if she was going to get sick she would
have by now but she did it after learning that apparently she was told by the hospital that
if she comes in for a delivery and she is presenting with COVID-19 symptoms it will hold onto her
baby for a couple of weeks till she is clear um and she was like fuck that so now she's actually
socially distancing and is considering a home birth um i don't know i mean like three of my
co-workers at my company are pregnant or at least recent moms or something and none of them mentioned
anything like that so i'm wondering if maybe that's just this one hospital or if my sister's misinformed
or had a paranoid person that on the phone that told her that or what um i don't know i mean that
might be a good idea well that's the thing is it sounds like a good and i that's that was my
thought i didn't say that to her but i did say that to my mom when we were discussing it because
i'm like oh yeah it's super practical we don't know what the long-term effects are if you catch
this as a newborn um obviously because it's been around for like four months right so um
like she's like yeah but it's still terrible and i'm like yeah it's not like it's not it's not great
yeah exactly yeah that said i wouldn't love to keep my baby in a hospital where everyone in
there has fucking coronavirus right so i'm also based on how much i know about how nowadays the
medical establishment is very much against separating children from or babies from their parents
it seems that seems very unlikely to me it seems much more like the paranoid ranting of someone
who's like they're taking our babies which you know you hear uh i don't know i mean the i might just
have a skewed example because my hospital is very good but i would feel very safe and comfortable
of being in that hospital as opposed to being anywhere else aside from you know socially
distancing at my own house like they're doing a very good job uh containing it uh and they do
as common practice at least in my cancer clinic separate children from parents because if one of
them has uh cancer and is immunocompromised then absolutely like the the biggest concern is that
person's safety more than like like we did have a mom who had to have her be separated from her baby
and it was sad it sucked everybody was like super depressed about it the mom had cancer and
babies are little disease vectors it'd be much worse for that kid to grow up without a mom
than to have to be separated for a few weeks while she undergoes chemo uh or lympho depleting therapy
yeah that sucks it does but i mean sometimes things suck but like they're to prevent worse
right uh sorry if i kind of went on a tangent about that it was just something on my mind no
that was that was the least tended tangential tangent we've had so far today i'm not so sure
i don't even remember what we're talking about are we still finishing the last uh
i think we're just dropping up we're done all right should we jump into today's actual topic then
i i think we should cool um oh i just nodded like because you guys can see me but the audience
can't so yes i i concur yeah we're um you know recording remote and we're on video chat so we
can see each other but you still can't see us listener so jess we are here to grill you on
the details of how to talk to strangers chapter one what's the major point go if i'm not good
at talking to strangers by the end of this then you get a d no the thing is i mean the book is not
about how to talk to strangers it's um bad title zero out of ten sorry i'm teasing no i just i didn't
hear you said i said bad title zero out of ten it's a good point though the title is somewhat
misleading i don't know i was drawn to the title like yeah but did you when you were drawn to the
title did you think this would be a treatise about how people talk to strangers or did you think
it would be like how you can get better at talking to strangers i mean i thought it was the latter
thing which is a substantive interest of mine i was actually just about to talk about marketing
things and about how authors don't get to pick their own titles and they focus test titles and so it
might not have even been mcgladwall's fault that this was the title of the book i don't blame him
but i'm just saying it is sort of a deceptive title even though yeah the book is not a here's how
to talk to strangers but it's more specifically about here's the ways that we fail to talk to
strangers or here's a bunch of a bunch of kind of new cognitive biases that i found to be really
interesting so yeah that was the name of the site before it turned out to be the real name of the
site that was a reference to overcoming bias where the awesomely nice guy robin hanson still blocks
i don't mean to dig all that out nobody knows what we're talking about anyway because that was
before we started recording oh i know yeah yeah so let's not get into it but um yeah hanson is
capable of entertaining some really weird shit so i'd start with this more like uh user friendly
posts if you've never been there before but or better yet start with his book um the elephant
in the brain i loved it i like as far as like pop science consumption like it was a page turner
i i was excited to keep going i went back and reread parts like it was great i can't uh pitch
that book hard and we'll post a link in our show notes that's right and well if you guys can want
to look back he actually came on it on the on our podcast talked about it yes he did i don't remember
what episode now i wish i'd been on at the time just search for him and we'll link in the show notes
as well all right someone gets to look it up then okay um so yeah i did like a very kind of rambling
discussion of talking to strangers last time uh this time i wanted to just actually kind of
summarize each of the chapters or each of the biases that he brought up um
um that sounds like exactly what i'm here for so rock on thank you the first one that he talks about
is default to truth where
he starts this off with um talking about chamberlain and hitler
oh he uh it went to germany talk to hitler before hitler started a world war two and
apparently says oh i've talked to him and i am convinced that he is trustworthy there was
a bunch of other examples then about uh annamantes who was a intelligence analyst at the defense
intelligence agency the di a who was also a cuban spy and again talking about hindsight
in hindsight there were a ton of red flags uh she wrote reports that parroted cuban viewpoints
and she would disappear during crises and it was just it would have seemed very obvious in retrospect
if you would know uh because of hindsight bias they brought up these examples and then was like okay
so why did people fail to notice these things they talk about um a psychologist who got a
bunch of test subjects to watch videos of people who were made to take a test and then either had
been given the opportunity to cheat or not cheat and then they received uh they had somebody um
give them the interview afterwards where they asked a bunch of questions and they said did you
cheat did you like think about cheating uh if i ask your partner who also took the test whether
or not you cheated you think they'd give you the same answer and some people lied and some fessed up
uh some did cheat some didn't cheat they showed these videos to a bunch of people and asked them
to like okay who's telling the truth who's lying and how confident are you consistently
these kinds of psychological studies show that people think that most people are telling the
truth so he called this uh default to truth and basically we're just really bad at telling when
people are lying yeah um and it seems to be adaptive which was the point that he goes on to
make later where society would kind of break if people went around being distrustful all the time
there's a chapter talking about what they call in some societies the uh holy fool a character who
exists in lots of folk tales and stories and they have a virtue of being outside of society in some
way so they're allowed to be critical of things or notice when people are lying an example of this
they brought up was uh the emperor's new clothes yeah the little child he's like he's not wearing
anything in some in a bunch of russian uh folk tales they have like the village idiot is always the
one that's like points out some obvious thing that everybody else couldn't talk about there's an example
of uh everybody uh being really amazed by this beautiful statue of the virgin mary and then the
village idiot coming over and saying can't you see that that's the work of the devil and everyone's
like how could you say such a thing and then the somebody touches the statue and it cracks and
reveals like a statue of the devil and there's something like that which seems like a strange
example of what these are the kinds of stories that exist in lots of societies you know it's
it's interesting because it does i don't know it's it's individually useful to be paranoid of
other people because sometimes people are cheating you but i've you know the societies where everyone
is constantly thinking everyone else is out to screw them and so they're trying to get theirs
first are really bad like like they brought up the example or go ahead oh i'm curious to hear more
about that actually oh it's just you like what what are you talking about what society is so uh
the the one i'm thinking of is basically any uh anytime you go to a tourist location outside the
U.S. there's often that kind of mentality once you get to kind of like the interstitial areas where
the the normal people are interacting with the not the normal people the
were you expected to haggle or do like hard so not just expected to haggle but like the people
literally assume that americans are just uh there to be taken advantage of because they have so
much wealth that it's a moral for them to keep any of it and it is the right thing to do to take
as much as you can from them but uh i mean we're protected somewhat when we go there by the institutions
that are there to make sure the tourists keep coming right but some of the experiences my parents
had like in egypt and just the even the stories i hear from people from other countries where their
politics tends to break down because everyone assumes everyone is in it for themselves and
the main thing you do when you get a political position is use it to help advance uh your interests
and your family's fortunes because if you don't someone else will and really the only people you
can trust are your family so better to make them as well off as possible and it leads to a lot of
social dysfunction whereas in like really high trust societies where that kind of thing is viewed
as evil instead of just you know run of the mill business the way everyone does things they tend to
be much richer and much better at implementing yeah you know we look at our qualities of life
and societies that are more uh that are higher trust that are able to be higher trust but every
now and then you do get taken advantage of it was one of the things i liked about being with melissa
she was very paranoid now is very trusting and so we made a good team we're generally i was always
like now let's cooperate with everyone but every now and then she saved my ass yeah i mean like
that's it's useful to have a holy fool around but society can't be composed of them like club all
brings up the example of somebody waiting in line at starbucks like oh that's gonna be five like 44
and they like whip out their phone like i'm gonna do that calculation myself and hold up the whole
and then you know like there's certain things that just kind of will grind to a halt if everybody's
watching their own ass all the time and questioning everybody's moves every move so so you can see
why it's adaptive and then also why we do get tricked in these ways that are baffling unless
you understand the psychology if david use of this thing he's totally like writing or say something
as well and we'll read it on the next listener feedback because i know he's had a lot of experience
with egypt with him being raised there and all right yeah uh i pulled out this quote but the
issue with spies is not that there's something brilliant about them so that there's something
wrong with the rest of us where uh and yeah the one more example was uh this person harry
marcapolis who was the independent fraud investigator who um wasn't fooled by bernie maddoff
defrauding thousands of investors like getting 60 billion dollars and then making like really
transparent lies about them everybody else assumed that like well obviously somebody
else is watching out for fraud on that scale and you know and maddoff doesn't look like a lie
and this guy was just that harry like was like obviously he's like imbezzling money and he warned
the securities and exchange commission uh in 2000 and then 2001 and 2005 and 2007 and 2008
each time they'll be listened to one thing i would say definitely if you're if you're ever
having anything seriously major done to your body or there's a big financial decision google it first
like never ever going for a surgery without first googling get find your paranoid friend yes
get to reveal it i need to figure out who that is in my social circle well i i know it's not me
i tend to be easily fooled i know that i am though like the thing that i thought you were
gonna well yeah yeah the thing that you were kind of talking about in the ash about like uh
there's yeah there's certain cultures or sales tactics really that like are just
poisoned to me and i just try to avoid them like i know anytime uh there's like a what is it uh um
what are what are those like really scammy things where you share a house for a certain number of
weeks yeah time share like how they get people and i watched my parents get like fooled like this as a
kid um is the like okay we'll give you like basically ever i highly discounted or like
basically free vacation at like this house in florida and then you're just gonna have to listen
to a timeshare pitch but you can say no yeah you say no like they like are very skilled at selling
people's higher shares and using all of the uh manipulative or persuasive tactics that work on
people because we do have psychologies and have like just had like built these kind of cultural
institutions of defaulting to truth it's nice this is another good time to plug uh robert
childini's influence science and practice as well as some good anecdotes on the uh
fun or what are they called a personal finance subreddit just jump there i think there's some
on the sidebar about time shares but you can also just search around for it and people will
share their experiences of like how skilled these hucksters are and they i i could go on at length
but it is uh it's advanced level um shy sting let's put it that way so i actually you do use one of
these things uh because i already knew about all this terrible awful stuff that they do right
and what you use uh a timeshare vacation yeah a timeshare vacation i saved several hundred dollars
and i just like went in with no matter what they say no matter what they do as soon as the two
hours are up i'm walking out and i basically tuned out entirely while he was talking and after two
hours was up i walked out and that was it and then i guess didn't get a very skilled one maybe
maybe that was it i think a large part of it is if you just you know think of this person as a
literal incarnation of the devil and signing anything with them is akin to signing over your
soul it's much easier just to be like peace out thanks for the vacation homie well the the ones
that tricked my parents didn't just uh like they did the thing of like making them make a promise
making them make another promise like uh i don't know they use basically all of the techniques
that shaldini talks about and like i watched like my parents you know go in saying definitely no
matter what we're going to just say no and they turn they turn them against each other like
they like did a bunch of like they had staff that was like being incredibly nice to children
in order to like turn the kids to their side i went without kids that helped i also skipped one
of the meetings entirely i was like eh whatever i think i only actually got a half hour of pitch
because then uh there was supposed to be a second one or something and i just didn't go
well yeah they kept escalating the pitches where they would like offer a free service
and then say that you also like you know the caveat is you have to listen to a five minute
pitch but it was like hey we'll give you a free boat ride but you got to listen to this five minute
pitch but like you know even your family can get on here and this okay so did your parents actually
end up losing money on the uh timeshare they bought a timeshare and i think they might still have it
or at least they kept it for years like over 10 years at least and never used it oh yeah see
they're never using it as a problem well that that was the yeah the thing i was about to bring
up which was that they kept adding more stuff that made it seem like this incredibly good deal that like
was too good to be true and it actually was a lot of it was you get this thing if you do this
trivial inconvenience in order to get it and we can give you this other thing for free but you
have to do this other trivial inconvenience where it was like we could have had these like
basically free vacations once a year if we've been willing to do a bunch of trivial inconveniences
which nobody does i believe there's a blog post about beware trivial inconveniences
yeah should probably put a link to that too so we believe people way too much yes although
generally it works out yeah it's a good thing so the next sort of bias that he talks about
is transparency he talks about the show friends and about how if you're watching
friends you can actually turn off the sound and usually still follow the class
because the actors are just very good at projecting with their body language and facial
expressions what they're feeling uh how you know when they're interacting with each other you can
tell if they're in love or sad or furious um pretty good acting but you're still left to the
question of why ross the largest friends simply doesn't just eat the smaller friends
haven't actually watched it so i love this part uh there was this psychological study that they
did where they got a bunch of participants to um they go down this long hallway into a dark room
and then they have to listen to a short story by france kafka and then you step out of the room
and while you're in the room a team of people uh altered the space that you walked in and
completely changed the hallway they say it was just this normal blank hallway and then
when you come out it's got bright green walls like bright overhead lights above a red chair
sitting in the chair staring at you like something out of a horror movie is your best friend
so they got these people's friends to coordinate with this whole thing
they reported their reactions there was about 60 test subjects they did pre-record
their hypothesis that people were going to look surprised in particular ways
but only five percent of the participants showed the classic wide eyes jaw drop raised eyebrows
those those three facial expressions only only five percent of people did those
and then only 17 percent of people did two of them most of them showed nothing clearly
identifiable a surprise at all so the conclusion of that is that we have kind of a folk psychology
that things like friends or novels draw from you know where they describe his eyes went wide
and his mouth dropped open this is not what people actually do okay so the thing is people
have this idea that you can read people's faces and it's actually not true well were those people
not surprised they were they were very surprised I mean they gave them an interview after the fact
and they were like yeah Jesus Christ scared the shit out of me okay look scared or look surprised
so yeah there's this other quote uh we think we can easily see into the hearts of others
based on the flimsiest of clues that's kind of going back to um Chamberlain and Hitler where
by talking with somebody by like having a conversation and by looking at their face
their expressions their body language people think that you can read people
as a personal anecdote this is a great way to get over stage fright and it's what helped me
no one can tell if you're faking like you just go up and you say the things and you like you know
try to smile and nobody knows that you're secretly fucking terrified and have no idea what's going on
and I mean that that even works like just with talking with people in general it helped me
overcome social anxiety too is like nobody knows that I'm full of shit and I'm terrified to be here
right now and it's it's true no one really pays that much attention or I guess even if you pay
attention they can't tell from your body language I found that to be the case too like uh the the
whole fake it till you make it thing like really works with social anxiety you just keep going to
parties and pretend you're having a great time eventually you'll start having a great time at
parties like the first few times you might be having a panic attack the entire time and go home
and cry but no one can tell I I'm in this picture yeah I know like I'm actually um currently like
working on a essay or a book or something about um how I learned to do social skills
there's like advice that I've had a hard time giving to people or things like that where it
sounds like a very cruel thing to say to somebody that like yeah you need to just do it anyway
I've had I've encountered a lot of pushback from people when they're like but you're so good at
talking to people and I just suck at it and then like I was I was worse than you
and then like literally the thing that you do is you just keep pretending you're good at it and
then you like start being read as being good at it I mean if enough people tell you you're good at
talking to them maybe that means you're actually good at talking to them though I'm good at faking
being good at talking to people but like is there a difference if they can't tell no I mean yeah it's
kind of weird during test stuff I guess I'm really good at faking being able to lift heavy things
I always managed to lift them even though it's all faking yeah that that might be an
actual example of having faked it until you made it and now you've actually made it right yeah
to some extent I mean there's something I still find social interactions to be really difficult
it feels like and maybe everybody finds them to be difficult I'm not I don't think so though I
think some people do find them to be natural and intuitive and comfortable I really enjoy them
but I find them to be very energy intensive I need to rest after exactly yeah as an introvert I need
to decomp a lot more than I do I want to talk about Amanda Knox too this was another case of
misjudging someone the bias that he called being mismatched okay and it's related to the previous
one transparency in 2007 a British student Meredith Ketcher Kertcher was murdered by
a local criminal Rudy Guide the case against Guide was damning he had his DNA everywhere like
but um for a very long time the media followed uh suspected her classmate Amanda Knox she was the
one who found her body called the police and then when they showed up she behaved weirdly
and the police officer had this weird fetish or something going on where he's like
was really trying to convince everybody that like obviously Knox was interested in
drug field dangerous sex games that led to the murder of this student
or like I think the police officer had like made this kind of claim about people before like he
seemed just really obsessed with trying to prove that people were involved in drug field sex games
all the time but um she acted guilty when the police showed up and in like subsequent trials
and guilty in scare quotes uh so her friends reported that while everybody else was crying
Knox didn't cry she was like making out with her boyfriend she looked happy when
somebody said I hope she didn't suffer Knox was like what do you think they cut her throat she
fucking bled to death of course she suffered which seemed like a horrifying shocking thing
to everyone to say I I'm sorry is it is it bad if someone says a true thing apparently I had this
exact same thing happen to me well not you didn't go to court I almost go to jail yeah the thing is
based on the descriptions of Amanda Knox uh I read her as being maybe on the autism spectrum
so the thing that happened to me when I was a kid one of my sister's friends died uh in high
school he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree and when I heard that I said what a stupid way to
die and I said it angrily because what I what I was trying to express was get more rest what an
like what an unfair way to die or like what a terrible you know like not not stupid people die
this way yeah yeah but because I said a thing that wasn't one of the scripts that you're supposed
to say to grieving people then my sister thought that I was being incredibly like rude and callous
and so met her friend was stupid I don't know if she's ever actually like forgiven me but I made
the same mistake a lot of times of all there are things that you're like supposed to there's a way
you're supposed to act I never knew how to do these things I would kind of like copy the people
around me but I always felt like oh my god like I'm I'm not doing gratitude right how do you do
gratitude like a relative gives you a gift I'm like oh my god what do I do how do I how do I do
the correct gratitude thing so they know that I'm actually grateful they went um back in this chapter
also to the study of the students who are asked to cheat they had people who do the video interviews
later so there was the girl that they nicknamed nervous Nellie who got really defensive when
the interviewer was asking her if she cheated she was fidgeting she repeated herself over and over
again halted mid-sentence was clearly agitated everybody was convinced she was lying but she
was telling the truth she was just nervous being mismatched is when somebody well we think that
liars will show agitation but Gleibwell says plenty of liars will look you in the eye and lie
right to your face and plenty of honest people will look like they're lying did we talk about
that's I'm sure we did about when we did the last episode I've been in a situation where I've been
assumed to be lying when I'm not yeah okay we covered this and it's a it's a really weird
situation to be in yeah like I think the thing that you described was a kind of giving long
explanations where like to you it feels I think maybe from the inside and I think I've done this
before too like they're not going to believe me unless I give them lots of details like oh no I
obviously couldn't have sent that text that day you know first let me go back to this morning I
was driving my car and you can ask but like this looks defensive to people right and I think part
of that actually isn't in honed or honed an instinct on mine for being defensive in elementary
school I've gotten trouble all the time because I wasn't a knowing student to have if you're an
elementary school teacher like I would ask a lot of questions and I think they interpreted that as
like me trying to make them look stupid doing dominance thanks to your teacher yeah well but
it wasn't even dominance it would be just more like actually I'm curious about that and then like
they would interpret it yeah they would interpret it as a dominance challenge but I wasn't meaning
it that way I just asked for clarification or something and they couldn't give it that's what
that says products articles about I know that I they almost they could have ruined me but anyway
so then yeah then they would look for shit to get in trouble for us that I'd always have a good
explanation because like there always was an explanation for why I did something
and then I feel like I have to get the entire thing and that sort of carried over to adulthood
and it is damn annoying for everybody I find it charming I'm working on it so that charm will
be going away no Steven's one good personality you have many good personality traits next chapter
I concur that Steven has many good personality traits I waved my hand dismissively
next chapter was about alcohol I think I talked about this one I don't know if I covered as much of
I talked about the the Bolivian village I don't know if I talked about the sexual assault
a lot of like one one whole chapter and a half or about sexual assault tell us about the sexual
well this is also related yeah it's it kind of the overarching thesis of the book they're all
interconnected but um the myopia um a fact that alcohol has the fact that we already have a very
hard time communicating with each other because of these other things going on default truth
transparency being mismatched when you add alcohol then what it does is it causes people
to get hyper focused on short term uh goals and wants and to dismiss things that are outside of
their current field of view so long term goals uh caring about consequences so a lot of people's
first drinking when they're developing brains uh happens in college and at parties when your
brain hasn't fully developed in like the you know types of relational and communicative ways that
are very important as well Gladwell says uh consent between people who've just met is really
entirely clear even before alcohol enters the mix and he cites uh 2015 uh washington post poll
which asked students what constituted consent career sexual activity 47 percent believe that
someone taking off their own clothes constitutes consent 18 believed not saying no constitutes
there was no clear consensus on any indicator of consent among any of the participants I don't
want to derail but only 18 percent thought that not saying no constituted consent that's 18 percent
more than I would like you need to do more than just not say no you can intimidate someone into
staying quiet if well okay yeah I guess I was picturing onto like an ordinary circumstance
you know like uh where where there's clearly positive signals and you're you're reading
the room right and it's okay cool they're into this you can't read the room um a lot of assigned
female people are raised to never say no and be people pleasing and then a lot of male assigned
people are raised to be assertive and aggressive and take what they want yeah see I don't have a
long dating history but I guess I most of the women I met were like the thing is you could
more strongly strongly person strongly uh positioned I guess to say like what they thought about
things and they could just be like no I'm good and especially like saying no could also be like a
response to like do you want to keep doing this and if they answer if they say yes then it's like
what else are you supposed to infer so like then in that sense they not they didn't say no so if a
yes isn't enough uh I guess this is this is derailing and just I find that confusing I yeah I feel
like a lot of people just have these list of rules and find ways to try to game them as opposed to
actually actively wanting to make sure that their partner wants to do this and is having a good time
to and it's a lot yeah I mean once you know somebody to be able to read them because you
know them that's the whole point of it but uh it's when you've just first met someone you can
do a lot of things like oh well you know technically she went along with everything I did and stuff and
it's it's it has to be a priority if it's someone you've just met like a very strong
priority of yours to make sure that they're absolutely wanting to do this yeah and that
should be like both or all parties responsibility because the most common thing is the you know
female assigned person getting like being people pleasing you the male assigned person being the
assertive one but in my case I've been on both sides of this and it's just you don't even have to
bring uh acting in bad faith into it both people can be acting in good faith on their part and you
get a situation where one partner here says that they've been raped by the other and the other
says I we I've tried as hard as I knew how to to like infer consent and so this this is a false
allegation we both consented of its own from both of their perspectives like you don't know their
history the one person maybe uh just like had PTSD got triggered by the interaction bringing
up old PTSD and then basically wearing an dissociative fugue the entire time it was happening
or you know alcohol can be in the mix and the person can totally forget about who the
fuck they are what's going on what they're supposed to be doing tomorrow I remember I had a
female psychology teacher in college explaining about how women couldn't consent when there's
alcohol in their system and I raised my hand and asked like what about men with alcohol in their
system and she woman explained to me that my dick wouldn't work if I was so drunk that I couldn't
consent okay and so I didn't push back and say I've been so drunk that I couldn't shower but
still able to get an erection because I was in a room full of 30 people who was the politician
that said that women who got raped couldn't get pregnant because the woman's fallopian tubes
right right the woman's body has ways of shutting that down if it's a legitimate rape was the the
quote right yeah are people bad at biology well I'm very much obviously a advocate of
getting consent and stuff I guess I'm just confused by that so like if if they say yes and
they act enthusiastic the whole time that's not enough I I think at that point it probably is
if they if they're enthusiastic the whole time then yeah okay see that's that's what I was
misunderstanding I thought that that you're saying like okay well if they if it triggered PTSD or
something but they never said anything no I mean it's still it's their responsibility to like
you know there's there's issues like that where neither person is at fault I think there's a
complicated they both could have tried harder to communicate and understand each other but
that's both of their responsibility okay see I thought that you're saying because like a lot of
assigned assigned female people are told not to whatever explain themselves or something
then it's like well that's not my fault if I asked and they said yes and like they they seemed into
it like it's like unless you're going to have a discussion with somebody you just met who you
think might want to hook up with you be like all right now let's talk rape allegations and consent
before we go home like that's a super off-putting conversation right no one wants to do that
yeah that's what a lot of people kind of recommend now and yeah I'm glad I'm married
in an ideal world they could teach like here's like consent rules in school from a very early age
so everybody has a like cultural understanding of here's how you communicate around this but
basically what this saw Washington Post poll shows that people have like whatever idea their
culture their friends their own minds came up with as far as this is what constitutes consent is
what they think constitutes consent it's a thing we don't talk about as a society like I actually
had my sex ed uh or the contraception specifically part of my sex ed curriculum ripped out of the
books and censored by my school because that if kids learned about contraception then they would have
sex because there wouldn't be consequences how terrible if the only consequence to sex was that
everyone has a great time that they go and have sex we can't be having that but no to Steven's point
like if someone is enthusiastically into it it's in my opinion totally fine it's just a matter of
you know actually being sure that they are enthusiastic and into it like every time you
escalate a little bit then they escalate a little bit back you can't be the only one pushing forward
every time because that's a clear sign that they might not be as into this as you are yeah and like
I don't know the is it clear I never had a lot of hookers somebody's a bad person for not like
grilling their partner in regard to consent either I mean like you should try to establish it but like
I would say if if two people I don't know if Joe and Sally uh had sex and then Sally had like a
was in a dissociative feud the entire time and but what was just saying yes yes yes everything
because to get it to stop I think it's always fault for not communicating or at least I don't
like to say that it's somebody's fault it's unfortunate but I don't think that Sally could
bring Joe to court and say that at some point you hooked up with Rachel for the first time right
like you guys didn't just start out having already had sex yeah um there I feel like if I was
misinterpreting the signals I could under no reasonable or even unreasonable circumstance
been okay um I guess this is this is more for like I mean it's like it's a it's a whole
own topic I'll leave you at that kind I've not been able to stop touching my face okay I've got
a question about that because my thinking is I haven't left the house in a week fine it yeah so
like nothing in the house has has germs on it so I've been touching I'll touch my face like mad
because my hands are clean so is everything in my house it's like if you go out yeah if nobody
comes over and if you and Rachel have been quarantined together and either of you've developed
symptoms then your house Rachel talking a lot of like decaying corpses uh not usually um even even
under yeah so she is still working she had she went out like maybe three times last week um they're
finally catching on it took them a while that and it helped with the fact that nursing homes aren't
letting people in um so she can't go visit patients at nursing homes anyway uh she went to go
one guy last week and had to swing by the office to get a mask and a gown to wear
and just told to reuse both of them um which just you know as I roll at the whole thing about
the medical establishment doesn't have enough fucking gloves and masks for everybody because
everyone's buying these things in bulk and I don't get it wrong I have gloves uh disposable gloves
that I bought a year ago to pair like raw meat with and if I wanted to wear those to safe way go
nuts I have a couple of germ masks because uh you know when I go to the doctor for random stuff
if they have them in the waiting room I'd grab one just to have a round you know like if I wanted
like I'll wear them on planes and stuff if I feel like it right right those masks are more for
protecting you and like for protecting those around you when you are sick and you have to go
outside I sort of figured like if they keep germs inside the mask they'll keep germs out
but I'll take the I'll take the word for it that um they probably don't do much uh if people say so
it doesn't make sense to me how it keeps things in but not out but I'm not a scientist so I'll
just take the scientist's word on it that said uh you know I'd grab them when they made me feel
better but I'd grab one or two when they weren't scarce the people now who'll walk into the ER and
like shove them all in their purse or in their coat pockets or something blows my people do that
yeah there aren't like it even like hospitals and medical um they're mentioning them at my hospital
medical professionals don't have enough of them to distribute well no I've heard that but like
people are stealing from ERs I can only assume so otherwise where else are they all going well
maybe they're using them all and they can't restock because of the shortage oh that's definitely
part of it um but I know that other people are stockpiling like stuff that's not theirs that's
the thing is like I understand the impulse to protect yourself I saw I'll find a great video um
and make a note of it there was just this great little breakdown that someone shared on one of
the work channels on Slack um of a of a dad who crunched the math for like you know all right so
this you know I saw someone at Costco buy four jumbo rolls of toilet paper here's how many
shits per day they'd have to take if they were going to burn through all of that in two weeks
it was like 120 or something per person uh to burn through all that toilet paper assuming 20 squares
of shit um and then it just had to them looking at the camera he was like calm down everybody
so the next few chapters were the ones I was having a hard time summarizing last time and
it was talking about um the sander bland case the woman who was pulled over for
failing to signal this ended in her committing suicide in jail the author frames this as
defaulting to truth at the wrong time and also brings in the yeah um they're talking about
before that chapter the policing uh that was developed to work in high crime areas the Kansas
City policing which doesn't make any sense in low crime areas because it's a really aggressive tactic
but cops because it worked really well work decided that they were going to just oh Kansas
City policing everywhere this led to cases like uh people like sander bland being pulled over
because in high crime areas they're expecting you pull somebody over for anything but what you're
really looking for is drugs or guns in sander bland's case she just had like there were some
things that didn't really make sense that would like trigger somebody look aha this i'm gonna pull
this person over they have license plates from a different state oh they're behaving in a way that
and again that's the uh starting to bring in a bunch of the examples behaving in a way that looks
suspicious quote unquote the cop not understanding that like sander bland had a bunch of she you
know was depressed and suicidal had a bunch of really high stress things going on in her life
at the time and responded in a way that looks to him like aggressiveness uh failure to cooperate
you know it was just making him more suspicious that this this person has something to hide this
person's acting like a criminal so there's the the mismatch and yeah so this officer uh ensina
ensina assume that he could interpret character from demeanor uh is is it just me or is it kind
of fucked up that they look for drugs and guns which are things that people should be legally
able to own anyway yeah yeah they do tend to be correlated with crime though so kind of from a
policing standpoint generally if you pull somebody over he's got a bunch of drugs and
guns they're not doing it for yourself defense and like you're like fun recreation time but yeah
i mean i agree um yeah these kinds of i don't know this makes there's a court case he talks about
in the beginning of the book too there's this case um all the examples kind of come together
instruct to show how these biases that uh make us really bad at talking to strangers are a big problem
um a lot of the institutions that we have are not like correctly informed about them
like court they had a court case or no it was a a bail judge compete against an ai um so the
bail judge was reviewing cases face to face with people seeing their own testimony uh the witnesses
watching their body language you know like they should have had the advantage but yeah they compared
their uh decisions about who would be safe to let out on bail and who was going to commit crimes
again um they ran humans against uh ai that could just read the trial papers the the bail case and
the ai outperform the humans the ai outperform the humans like in a majority of cases where you would
want like he would hope that humans would be good at these things like they have um a variety of
people take these kinds of tests not just the bail judge was all of those are the professionals but
like you know um cia operatives and humans always perform worse than the ai we're worse at what
criterion which which people should go to jail versus which should be left out on bail and then
after the fact which people committed crime again and were arrested again or which ones were safe
see i i absolutely believe this is the case because i just think ai's are better than humans
at this sort of thing because all they look at is the data but every time something like this gets
brought up people tend to go with well the data that the ai are trained on is all flawed because
we incarcerate black people more or we incarcerate people from this socioeconomic area more than
they should be incarcerated whatever like i i always hear these things but then like on the
actual objective metric they did better with classifying people but like what they're talking
about as far as like black's getting incarcerated more is that that's happening because of because
of human error because of these biases so like it's not the ai's fault no it's not but they keep
saying that like the ai's trained on worse data but apparently the ai did a better job than
than the humans even at predicting who would recommit crimes yeah the thing is that like
they're like oh that you know these people are incarcerated because of bias and i'm like yeah
but the people who are competing against the ai are also biased like why do you think that a human
is going to be better at like reviewing the case than an ai based on that you know a human is going
to be biased especially human court system who like arrested somebody wrongfully in the first place
and apparently the ai is biased less because it gets answers better more often answers right
more often yeah and that's even even as you pointed out working with this vlog data like
the ai was reading the court case or the the bail case that had been written by human
this is sort of an aside but that does raise the question i wonder like if i was in that
situation as a as a defendant like i feel like i'd want to make my case with people
not have some robot black box determine my fate that's apparently an emotional appeal
but that i wonder about that for myself like i i don't i don't know if i'd want a robot
determining my fate i'd want to be able to like talk to a judge or to people and say no look here's
what here's what i was thinking here's what was going on yeah i mean that's the same instinct
that's driving people to continue to have court cases reviewed by humans though yeah no i'm just
saying it i feel like it's an understandable impulse i think it might be good to be able to
have humans looped in to be able to veto the computer like no this is obviously a case of
the computer making an error but in general i don't know like what you're saying is you think
you'd be more convincing to a human who is easier to fool than to an ai right um i don't mean like
if i was a bad criminal i meant that like if things look bad but like no look there's all these
exonerating circumstances that make it clear that i'm not the kind of person who should spend
five years in jail or something or like it sounds like you're assuming a human will be able to reach
you but but they won't well i guess i when you say they read the court documents i guess i'm not
sure is that including the ones where i'm sitting there talking to the judge um what uh the judges
have access to the documents and then they also get to talk to the person and repeat like over
see the court case um whereas the computers only are reading the the document honestly you have all
the markers going in your favor you have like a good middle-class job you live in a decent middle
class area about the royal me white you don't like the royal i right no no i mean you specifically
yeah i'm not i'm not worried about me specifically i'm not committing crimes i mean like if i if i
got pulled over for uh i don't know no but but that's what i'm saying if you were to have gotten
pulled over for something and you are innocent of it you have all the markers that the air would
look like the only strike you have against you is that your male like you would be better off being
woman in this case but uh it all the other things are like yeah this person is a legit member of
society he's got no record the ai would totally give you bail whereas if you were to go up against a
human that human might be like huh this guy's kind of shifty looking he keeps acting like he's got a
pain in his lower back which is just a clear sign of criminality and like i think you'd have a better
chance with the ai than otherwise i i maybe me specifically i guess i was i was thinking more
generally like if i if i wasn't me but i was anybody i i i i well i understand that the the ai is
better at it and that's probably the way things should go i totally get the impulse of saying no i
want to be able to like plead my case to another human who i know understands people i get it real
but i don't think that like intellectually i think that if i were arrested i would want an ai
or be my case rather than a human because i know that i mismatched the way mandinox was yeah i i don't
perform things well enough to like fool people um on this spectrum i mean i'm thinking that i'm mad
because i will default to a toneless or blank expression when i'm stressed most people would
i do it it'd be a lottery of are you lucky enough to get the young judge who is not jaded and cynical
yet or the judge that has been going over bail cases for 10 years and has been lied to so many
times that he just assumes everyone's lying to him yeah like i said i'm not saying i necessarily
want this i understand the wisdom of it but i can understand the impulse of somebody saying
you mean i don't get to talk to a human to make this decision for me i mean i i i guess i i i i
frankly we shouldn't constrain our our judgments on what makes sense or what what people have to
do by what can be explained to the average person i just think it's a reasonable impulse to have
whether or not it's the optimal one which probably is to have at least some level of
of output that needs to be considered from uh a a black box ai that you know the judges and the
clerks don't understand right that kind of reminds me of something i was going to say earlier about
going all the way back to airplanes and terrorism there's an extent to which the
heightened security made sense from like making the people that were using the airlines feel safer
or like making people feel like something was being done uh keeping public peace i guess
so i can kind of see that too where if we did you know mandate tomorrow that all court cases are
going to be reviewed by ai's instead of humans people would panic i'm just trying to think even
if i was like a young black man late teens early 20s you know often targeted would i rather take
my chances with the ai who's just going to look at the rap sheet or like with the judge
who's probably going to look at what clothes i'm wearing and what my hairstyle is and make
assumptions based off that too that's a good point yeah like i don't know maybe maybe this
isn't the way i feel if i was in that position but yeah unfortunately i'm also um uh as another
thing that i'm studying right now is borderline personality disorder and personality disorders
in general and a bunch of um i'm finding a lot of very i guess disheartening data showing that a
lot of court cases are resolved due to emotions like people are more swayed by people who make
emotional appeals than they are by facts or reason yeah like there's a lot of um you know the worst
examples are people with like narcissistic or antisocial personality disorder who are able to
lie to people's faces and they're like very abused spouse trying to like beg to like let
them take custody of the children with the other you know they're just not like
coherent they're crying they're like and then the other person is just like able to be incredibly
charismatic and make whatever point they like know are going to infest the judges but like that's
the kind of thing too that the ai would be able to fix because there's a lot of cases of people
who are abusive getting custody of the children over and over again because they're able to convince
courts with their emotional appeals that they're the innocent victim and the other person or like
you know that some other circumstances happened they tend to eventually get found out if they keep
going back to the court or if they keep you know if they perpetuate abusive behavior eventually
gets found out and like no matter how good they lie there's going to be a long but like it takes
an overwhelming amount of evidence to sway people that's something that's a point that
Gladwell brings up a bunch of times that we default to truth until we see overwhelming
evidence that somebody is lying and it really should be like we should have the ability to
actually like review evidence in these cases like I would would have given custody of the
correct parent like based on just okay this person has one past instance of abuse in their
history where this other person doesn't but it gets to the point where they have to have like
abuse the children eight times before the human judges will be like oh maybe they have a problem
so instead of talking to strangers we should have ai's do everything or just get better at
like I my hope would be that these kinds of biases were more known thing like the kind of
the thing that I was really happy about with um pre-registering your hypotheses starting to like
be a thing that people know about and have been taking point to do um man that was phrased
awkwardly I'm starting to I've been going at this for a bit um we should probably wrap up here pretty
soon I feel like I think we can pretty much wrap up uh talking to strangers all right give us the
wrap up humans are out ai's are in yeah I mean um I'm glad that Gladwell wrote this book and coined
these phrases uh I might try to write like a less wrong article summarizing it if someone
hasn't already because I think that these are new cognitive biases that don't get like looked at or
talked about as much where we have ones that kind of concern more like scientific judgments that are
well known or points when people are debating there's two things that kind of occurs to me from
thinking about everything you've said about the book the first is that like the world is a far more
lonely place than we would like to think because it turns out we don't actually
know people all that well well not strangers anyway like people that we know maybe but strangers are
more alien and much harder to read than we thought yeah and the other thing that occurs to me is that
like this is probably more of a problem for the more neurotypical like I get the feeling that people
who are more autistic have always had more of a problem relating to people and understanding
strangers so this is kind of like yeah bro we've been here all along and you just were fooling
yourselves into thinking that you could see what other people were doing and how they react and
feel the more I learn about that the more it does kind of reassure me and I feel like kind of a dick
but um I guess I've always kind of felt like yeah okay like neurotypical people can just like have
this magic superpower being able to look at somebody and know what they're feeling and instead
their magical superpower is self deception the thing is that I I know autistic people and I think
I'm getting to be one of them who are very I would say much more skilled than average at um reading
people at like initiating conversations so forth and so on social skills because they have had to
learn it and when you come at it from without like the software that let that you know makes you
deceive yourself um you do actually have to update you have to register your hypotheses test them and
then like get good at you know I want to have a stockpile of t-shirts that say I'm neurotypical
my superpower is self deception and just give them out to people sometimes imagining like you had a
booth somewhere like some rationless confession um yeah that's that's that book I still recommend
reading it uh although I think I yeah that the summary still gives you um the points that he brings
up but reading the book and organically going through the examples and finding the ways that
like they all started to kind of come together at the end when they got to the sander blind case
was pretty it was a good experience for I think giving me a deeper like conceptual framework
of these ideas yeah that's what I think the difference is between reading distillations of
books or and like reading them in long form you just get more concrete models yep uh yep so yeah
cool well thank you very much no that was him uh yeah David and Goliath by Malcolm Gladwell
as the book that came before this one I think that he picks interesting stuff to focus on that
other people aren't really talking about yeah so David and Goliath is a sub title underdogs
misfits in the art of battling giants people who are disadvantaged in some way succeeding against
people with more resources who are more powerful little guy winning against big guy that sounds
awesome I think I should read that yeah it's really good very important for overthrowing the man
pretty much cool all right well um we should move on I would say listener feedback but one
of the listener feedbacks we got is that the episodes have been going really long lately
and also we've been at this for a while because it took us some time to get set up so do we
want to just go into thanking the patron I think that's a good idea I think the next one is Daniel
Conner yes really appreciate your support and I never know what to say during the
thank you person Daniel Conner even in hindsight your contribution is greatly appreciated corner
but yeah corner you're right Daniel corner no worries no we appreciate it thank you so much
for everything you guys do to help keep the lights on around here and uh you know we say the same
thing every time but that means that doesn't mean it's any less appreciated and it really does make
me feel I don't know about you guys but it makes me personally feel like I'm valued and my contribution
is important and that's just a really nice feeling it keeps me going sometimes when I am like do I
really want to record this week and I'm like yeah there's a lot of people that like this enough to
throw us a buck so I'm absolutely gonna go and then I'm always glad I did like I never regret
recording these I really enjoy especially like although I'm terrible at getting on the discord
ever but I'm happy that I'm more able to interact with some of the listeners now and yeah it's a
great feeling to know that people enjoy the stuff that you make and I agree with what you said
Eddie Oshavot like I don't know an important part of my psychology is like feeling like I'm
useful to the world it's like an important value and goal of mine yeah I feel like shit if I feel
like I'm just like you know playing video games and sticking around but like if I feel like I'm
creating things that are helping people that are of value that are even enjoyable then I yeah
one of the things that's done for me too is when we set up a patreon account and I realized like oh
okay people will like financially support small podcasts like this I immediately went out and
supported a lot more stuff it's the kind of thing that you know has an impact on everyone else too
so I try to make sure that everything that I enjoy well not everything that costs too much but
the stuff that I enjoy a lot that otherwise doesn't have a ton of money I try to give
money to so yeah anyway if you have the the resources and feel like it you're welcome to
throw us a buck or so a month or however much you want we have some tiered rewards but the
tiers aren't like greatly articulated or thought out so if there's it like anything you want
any reasonable amount of money just throw it our way we'll strongly consider it we're trying to do
it for you otherwise you can take a minute or two to review this on itunes a podcast platform of
your choice especially if you like it enough to leave five stars makes it easier to find and
shows people what they're getting into if they read some reviews before they subscribe so yeah
and also you can join the conversation if you like on the discord which is linked in the show notes
and we do still have a subreddit which does get some activity we would have read some feedback
from this but we ran out of time so we'll do that next week next episode yeah not not next week
well that's subreddit by the way it's the bezier conspiracy all right well thank you everybody
and see you next time bye everybody thanks everybody
that's good talking to you guys likewise you too
