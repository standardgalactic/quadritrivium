hey everyone recording all right we are starting in five four three two one
welcome to the base in conspiracy i'm in ash brotsky i'm steven super i'm just sticky
and before we jump in uh last week we did the sequences at the top of the episode and we got
a fair bit of feedback not fair but we got some feedback saying hey that was much better
you guys should do that more often uh you guys want to do that more often
yeah we can do that every time excellent it's also worth pointing out that any lag or latency
or whatever people are hearing between us dialoguing we are uh i just trying to make a funny plug for
social distancing but yes we're doing the smart thing and recording remotely so um which is really
disappointing we just got back together and we were like hey seeing each other in person again
after a long break and now we got to be a pandemic yeah fucking pandemics are very inconvenient
yeah all right so shall we jump right into the less wrong posts i guess that's what we're doing
sounds good to me feels kind of weird having just going right into this without any sort of
warm-up chat but i guess that's what the last hour was for well while we're warm-up chatting
i've got a fun anecdote to share i was talking with my grandma last week who's you know obviously
in a high-risk group for this sort of thing and was relieved to hear that she is taking all of this
like exactly the right level of seriously um she's she's like oh yeah luckily i'm fortunate
that i don't have to leave the house at all um my doctors have canceled all their appointments
which sucks because she did a surgery scheduled for last week that she is now delayed on but
she had like a cardiac something checkup and that was canceled but the doctor personally called
like didn't have like an assistant call like hey how are you doing you know if you're really
concerned we can bring you in and um that was all nice but what i liked most about it was she was
saying oh yeah this isn't you know this is this is serious but i'm not the least bit worried i
remember when polio was ravaging the country and we didn't even have the ability to like uh to you
know disperse news that well like not even everyone had a radio huh so and she's not 100 years old
she's like in her 80s but she grew up in the middle of nowhere Nebraska to where like she
didn't have electricity till she was a teenager so like not everyone in her tiny one mile a one
mile town had a radio back then oh my god what did she do while she was shut in
i don't know if they stayed shut in i don't really like apparently polio did make it to beaver
city nebraska uh my uh her mom had it um so did my dad's dad um it was it was around you know
made made made its way around the country but i'm just amazed it made it to this tiny middle
of nowhere town i'm like who even brought it in like in the days before gps how did anyone
even find this place they asked the you know someone on the road and it's like you go down
yonder take a left at the grain silo that's right so yeah people vaccinate your kids prevents plagues
of polio from sweeping the country i guess that's not something really gotta tell rationalists so
yeah um we had a really thoughtful and concerned patron who um was writing and asking about if we
want if we wanted them to come on they're gonna come on at some point and talk about community
stuff or maybe some coronavirus stuff as well um i'm not sure if they want to go by their real
name or not so i'm not gonna name drop but uh like i feel like we're pretty well informed
as a community i feel like we're a bit ahead of the like not to like pat ourselves in the back
but like we were a bit ahead of the curve as far as like you know sorry or calling me uh
the panic alarms early and that sort of thing so um i wasn't feeling too shy yeah
and we're also not anti-science so we know that vaccinating our kids is a good thing
and i'm actually to be taken seriously yeah i wonder if they're gonna actually stop the uh
anti-vaxxers like six months from now they're just gonna disappear because there's a whole
COVID-19 thing there are a bunch of psychological studies that show that the more like people
try to argue with logic in facts and evidence against somebody who has an entrenched belief
the more they like cling to the entrenched belief yeah but no one's arguing with them right now
it's just you know a plague spreading across the nation yeah the question is is in a year are
they gonna be lining up lining up for a vaccine or not or are there are their kids gonna be the
ones that are barred from going to school because they're still carrying COVID-19 i could easily
imagine them being like the only reason the pandemic got so bad is because so many people
are vaccinating and we're not strengthening our natural immune systems the way god intended
you know like you can justify almost anything if you get it's true oh yeah if you're if you're a
fucking idiot you can you can justify anything yeah i think being isolated for so long has made me
grumpy so everyone fuck a lap the strong coast that kind of well is it relevant it's kind of relevant
and it'll cheer me up from thinking about dumb stuff so what's wrong post number one hindsight
bias youth and hindsight bias as many people might know is when people who knew the answer vastly
overestimate its predictability or obviousness the i knew it all along effect which i i'm sure
everyone can generate examples in their real life of doing this themselves which is important because
people do this shit all the time or talking to people who are like oh yeah i totally saw that
coming yeah i'm just like did you though right would you have bet on it no you didn't even know
about this a year ago or a month ago or whatever yeah this whole uh post is talking about the thing
that i was kind of like ranting about last week the preregistering or hypothesis um thing that more
scientific studies have been doing lately and people have been more i don't know i'm happy to
see more people being aware of and conscientious of this kind of bias in like the real world outside
of just the rational sphere yeah it's nice that we jumped on it 10 years ago but i i'll go ahead and
read the two of the examples given in the post about what hindsight bias is to make hindsight bias
is to make it more uh i don't know concrete for people uh says a researcher asked two groups to
estimate the probability of flood damage caused by blockage of a city-owned drawbridge the control
group was told only the background information information known to the city when it decided
not to hire a bridge watcher the experimental group was given this information plus the fact
that a flood had actually occurred uh this came from an actual court case uh so this was relevant
to something happening in the world instruction what's that do you know what a bridge watcher is
i would imagine it's someone who watches a bridge to see if there's a blockage
it seems like an incredibly boring job kind of like uh what was it Hemingway had the job where
he would just sit in a tower and watch for fires and so that is where he wrote a lot of his shit
because you have nothing to do but look out a window and see that yep forest still is burning
don't exist as much anymore like that would have been great it's all based upon is about
having a job like that where it's like i'm hired to basically listen to audiobooks or this is going
off topic but anyway also with minimum wage laws there's no way a job like that could exist nowadays
like maybe someone would be worth paying a dollar an hour just to sit and look for fires but not
whatever is the required minimum now um anyways uh the experimental group was given the information
that the city had plus the fact that the flood had actually occurred instruction stated that the
city was negligent if the foreseeable probability of flooding was greater than 10% 76% of the control
group concluded that the flood was so unlikely that no precautions were necessary 57% of the
experimental group concluded that the flood was so likely that failure to take precautions was
legally negligent uh the other example was that after september 11th the FAA prohibited box cutters
on airplanes as if that had been the problem uh and the the general lesson is that the cost of
effective uh caution is very high because you have to attend to problems that are not obvious now
as past problems might seem in hindsight that it's you know very expensive to hire a watcher for
every single bridge and and every other possible thing that could go wrong with that bridge to to
uh account for cost a lot of money so you know you take a calculated risk as to whether it's
worth it or not but in hindsight people are like oh they totally should have seen that it was negligent
not to do that one specific thing like it was negligent to allow box cutters on planes how dare
they i remember being a kid when that was happening the whole like banning very i don't know that
planes just getting insane about what things they were banning and every time a terrorist used
something new they banned that thing and i remember being a kid and just thinking like you know how
many other ways you could hijack a plane then hit using a box cutter like i was just i was sitting on
a plane at one point and i did a thought experiment where i was just doing the thing for methods
of rationality where it was like the how many ways could you kill like the other students
creatively in this classroom but i was doing like how many creative ways could i hijack a plane
which i probably should not have been doing anything that's me it was a good thing to think
about that stuff writing it down is a really stupid idea
on a plane is the worst place to do it yeah yeah that's what i was gonna say writing it down in
your seat i'm glad no one looked over your shoulder and being like what the fuck is going on there
well you were a kid right oh right sorry i didn't think about that i remember after the uh shoe
bomber incident and they made people take off their shoes before going on planes and there was
a meme that went around uh now the terrorists are going to put under bombs in their underwear not to
blow anything up just to make a strip before we have to go on planes and like three months later
a guy was stopped trying to get onto a plane with a bomb in his underwear and i was like yeah
yeah you you literally yeah that's great stuff yeah i do like the disparity though what we really
need to do is have everyone stripped down naked and only have their glasses and their wand on
before they get into a plane yeah what could go wrong yeah just hire just hire mad i moody
with an insane budget and say go totally fucking nuts and security yeah but i like those the
disparity just to to refresh on the numbers from the the bridge incident so um the instructions
have stated that the city was negligent if the if the foreseeable probability of flooding was
greater than 10 percent 76 percent of the control group who hadn't been told that the bridge flooded
said yeah that's or that no that that flood doesn't sound likely they took reasonable precautions
right but then if you say oh yeah and the flood happened they're like oh then they were totally
not really they were totally not fair and that that judgment shouldn't come into how likely
thing something was to happen it's just i i think i can't think of a cleaner example yeah i get this
a lot with people who say man in hindsight i really wish i would have done that thing differently
and i i try to tell them you should not regret things that you made the right decision based
on the information you had like sure if you knew about what was going to be happening in the future
you'd change things but i would do a lot of things different if i knew the future i'm sure it's you
go with the information you had and if you rewind time and you made the right decision based on what
you had at the time don't you know i know it's impossible to say don't regret it because you're
going to regret things anyway but at least don't feel like you're a terrible person yeah yeah i've
done this uh i had this fantasy for a long time uh of being able to go back in time like jump into
my past self's body and make different decisions but like it stopped being a fun fantasy once i got
older and when i was thinking about how far back i would go and like how different life would be as
a result of all the random stuff that way it's just like i would just be a different person at
this point so there's no point even thinking about this yeah there's only a certain amount you can
jump back in time and really have it be worthwhile yeah i would try and do like quiet things because
i like most of my life now um so i would i would try to do things that would not disrupt my timeline
what i would do is just buy like i don't know 50 bitcoin when they're crazy cheap or like you know
many many thousands of them when they're crazy crazy cheap and like then that would be the only
change i wouldn't tell anybody and then just live out the rest of my life as i did the first time
and then in december of 2017 or whatever i would sell all of them and become a millionaire and also
not tell anybody i would go back about a year and just really hammered into my head how important
it is not to injure your lower back that's the biggest regret i have right now in my life
yeah if i had an isolated incident that i could point to like oh that's when i fucked up i would
not do that but i'm not sure what i did to it so um so anyways continuing on uh this because
we're getting distracted again uh the test of a model is how much probability it assigns to the
observed outcome when you're you know testing your models of reality hindsight bias systematically
distorts this test that's why you have to write down your predictions in advance as just was saying
and as a lot of people are doing more now uh but as feischoff put it in 1982 this is a quote from
someone we systematically underestimate the surprises that the past held and holds for us
subjecting our this subjects are i'm paraphrasing here this subjects our hypotheses to inordinately
weak tests and presumably we find little reason to change them so yeah that's why you should write
things down beforehand because as a rationalist your superpower is noticing your ability to be
confused and if you keep thinking back on the past was like oh yeah i totally would have predicted that
then you never will update your model for uh how it should be updated when new evidence comes in
because you'll always discount the evidence as in like oh yeah my model totally would have predicted
that when you know if you write down beforehand you can see where it didn't or wouldn't have
and that's how you build a better model you notice your own mistakes and you become stronger
at making predictions um i've said this before but i still highly recommend that people in the
rationalist community make predictions about things record them and then check themselves
even just doing that a little bit has dramatically improved my ability to estimate like how long
something is going to take for example has been one of the most useful things to get better at
predicting yeah i had a lot of um what is the failure mode where you underestimate how long
something is going to take the planning fallacy yeah i had like i continued to really struggle
with planning fallacy related issues but it was still funny remembering myself going through
that period of reading about the planning fallacy being like now i know about the planning fallacy
i'll never fall prey to that again nice what i love about that this is one of the things that
you know make it comes out clearer on like a slower read through uh
plug for we want more uh the podcast and deal with brian deacon um like harry gives this
lifelong lecture to hermione on the planning fallacy and the first thing he does is fallaciously plan
the shit out of his scientific uh experimental regiment and hermione just has the shit even
grin and it's like oh we should we should call it harry bias that's that's way above the top and
it even before that this is i one of my favorite lines by uh anonymous who did hermione granger's
voice was uh early on when they had the book reading contest and harry was like oh i totally
got this is like almost the very first thing they did i totally got this i got a time turner
everything and then she beats him because some unexpected shit cropped up and he didn't have
enough time to read you know and so he goes and he gives his excuses and hermione's like
aw looks like someone fell prey to the planning fallacy and that is not how i had her with his
mouth open and he's like oh shit she's learning and she's slap me right in the face with one of
my favorite words yes and that's not how i had read it at all in my head but when she delivered
that line i was like oh that is absolutely perfect i love it and then i actually like almost just
asked you oh yeah he was anonymous probably they're anonymous because they don't want their name to be
known but uh they did a really good job yeah so they're anonymous because they didn't want to be
like i don't know necessarily associated with this but it was scarlett johansson
every now and then they live not too far out of the city every now and then i see him and
they're forever in the same room at the same time i will introduce you guys
yeah that'd be cool yeah um all right on to hindsight the value science
yeah let me see if there's anything else i wanted to say about that one
no it's gone okay day after day social scientists got into the world day after day they discover
people's behaviors pretty much what you'd expect of course the expectation is all hindsight uh
basically applying the hindsight bias to the social sciences and then um
this is he writes sorry go ahead oh i was just gonna say like as an introduction this next thing
that he does is really cool yeah um if i might if i might also interject i don't think that this
was an original yudkowsky i had the same thing done to me in high school oh really by my psych teacher
yeah i think this is this is a common way of presenting this information uh um and right one
in the same uh the same style but it's specifically done in the social sciences so i'm glad that this
is also something that is known that i know problem in the social sciences now okay yeah
anyway so now we can actually tell people what we're talking about yes um there were a list of
facts about world war two that social scientists discovered about soldiers uh one being better
educated soldiers suffered more adjustment problems than less educated soldiers and then each one has
a little uh for for this one for example intellectuals were less prepared for battle
stresses than street smart people so that's probably why that is yeah so each one there's
