like five items they come with like an observation and then a parenthetical like explanation for what
social scientists start you want to go through them real fast yeah yeah actually i think we
could probably read all of them uh southern soldiers coped better with the hot south sea island
climate than northern soldiers because southerners are more accustomed to hot weather uh that was two
three is white privates were more eager to be promoted to non-commissioned officers than black
privates because years of oppression take a toll on achievement motivation four is southern blacks
preferred southern to northern white officers because southern officers were more experienced
and skilled in interacting with blacks that's awkwardly phrased this is an older study i know as
long as the fighting continued soldiers were more eager to return home than after the war ended
because during the fighting soldiers knew they were in mortal danger and i'd like to point out
that uh the historian arthur schlesinger jr dismissed these studies because they were just
ponderous demonstrations of common sense yeah so when you read through this list originally uh i think
they're all intended to be intuitive like yeah and then you can ask so how many of these findings
do you think you could have predicted in advance or any of them cases where you would have predicted
the opposite and like just as an exercise not a bad idea to pause here and just you know maybe
consider that for a second if you haven't read this post yet
and then he drops on us that all the findings above are actually the opposite of what was found
he switched it up on us so now you know how obvious was what you thought in hindsight
and uh are you like oh snap i just got owned or are you like oh okay well that makes sense in the
places where i was a bit confused and then at the very end he says unless of course i actually
reported them right the first time and he doesn't actually tell us which way is the the right way
or if some were inverted and some weren't or whatever and i'm sure we could look it up ourselves
but i never did i just took his point as it was meant yeah i didn't care enough about the like
actual data to go investigate but this this is a just a good example of like the sort of thing where
once in a while it seems like once a week maybe i should be writing these down um and then i could
bring them to the podcast and people were like oh that's actually like a minor use of the sort of
thing um well you get requests somewhat frequently since the show began like four years ago to do
stuff on like how do you do rationalist stuff every day um if i could do here's something like this
i am capable of saying wait that doesn't make sense or oh yeah i guess i could see that and then i'll
like my immediate mental reflex is to say wait would i guess that advanced and i'll say no probably
not and that means that actually i have no idea about any of this so i'll just take you know if
i'm hearing something about uh some insane shit that the medical industry does for hospice care for
my wife i'll be like okay yeah since i guess i could have predicted that either way i'm gonna
just say that i had no fucking clue um and sick with the fact that i have no clue what i'm talking
about and take your word for it because that's all the evidence i have it's it's good to again
actually notice when you're confused as opposed to saying oh yeah i totally would have seen that
well then this it's not even confusion this is me hearing something and saying oh i'm not confused
that makes perfect sense but wait a minute right but does it and yet exactly should you have been
confused maybe right yeah there was that great slated star codex post a couple weeks ago um
that i don't have that aim of and i'm not going to dig up right now but i will put it in the show
notes uh where it's like a kid is asking like the teacher explaining to some child about
like germs and the kid asks look well uh why don't people just stay home for two weeks and
then kill all the germs and the two that that was such a good post i actually want to do like an
episode about that oh okay we'll do that uh if we don't get uh mr hoffman on next week then we'll
do that next week instead yeah or at least like uh i don't know i'll do a longer coverage of that
post just because steven i remembered the name of it too but i know the one you're talking about
and that was something that like a lot of um slate star codex a lot of scouts posts are like
something that i've kind of had in the back of my mind like a portion of and i just couldn't
articulate it and then like that's what i love about slate star codex that occasionally scott will
like it feels like go into my brain and then we like do a really good version of the thing i've
been wondering about or had kind of a like shitty version of the thing but like yeah that thing like
read on the next post oh yeah that thing man he did such a good yeah exactly this i just
run around with my phone like with a slate star codex article and just like show it to people on
the street excitedly going yeah this and this is what i was trying to tell you and they're like i'm
on the street i got 30 seconds i'm not going to read this whole thing right now i have 20 minutes
to read this or better yet i'm sorry i can't read your phone from six feet away you're right
or scott alexander isn't he an alt-right incel didn't he do a favorable book review of
wooden jordan peterson's books that means he endorses everything that guy ever said right
that was actually the funniest book review because i feel like it was just kind of a repetition of
man i fucking hate this guy and this book is irritating and yet i think this is a good point
or like even this is really stupid and yet it kind of works yeah i thought i thought it was awesome
i thought it was a great book review um and and and it shows that like you shouldn't necessarily
discount uh at what somebody has to say just because they say one or two objectionable things
yeah or even if they say 90 objectionable things yeah like they might they might still have a point
to make on some things that are in our demand of expertise right yeah and also you can write
entertaining things even if you are personally a terrible person like i have no idea a fortune
scott card is a bad person or a good person or whatever there's at this point so much
misinformation out there i don't even care to speculate but i don't have to because the fiction
he writes is good regardless of who he is as a person i mean that's the thing is like also people
aren't good or bad people or since got card is a complicated person so i just joined the uh duph um
the duph uh discord recently again i had to have joined it a long time ago when i first started
sporting them but i hadn't you know checked it in a long time anyways and uh not matt who's the other
matt scott was saying that there's been several kevin spacey uh things where he said some great
things about kevin spacey in them and like now he feels like should he go back and put an apology
or take them down or something i'm like no no you shouldn't kevin spacey did an amazing job
and he's a horrible person in the real world but that doesn't mean that he isn't an amazing actor
and did a great job in this movie yeah we saw i mean like how you feel about his acting does not
reflect on how you feel about him as a person or about how you who you are as a person and that's
one of those tough things where i think it can get muddy like um i don't know uh actually i just
texted rachel a picture yesterday it was like hey instead of like seeing all this covet 19 stuff
check out this nice painting and then like beneath it is like congrats you just enjoyed a painting
that was drawn by hitler uh like people get that way about fogner like that was one of the reasons
that the uh traditional wedding march was changed is because he was kind of a nazi supporter and
i'm like the dude's been dead for a long time he wrote some music that is just music there aren't
even any words to it right some of it may have words but no one knows what they are they're in
a different language i don't know certainly the wedding march didn't have any words i'm like what is
what is your problem you're not supporting nazism you're not supporting him it's just music at this
point they're like no no if we play his music it means that we are secretly nazi endorsers
i don't know people are weird people are desperate to read between the lines people people are really
really love their signaling games and think that it's as important things about them if they like
that music i don't know anyways in hindsight they should all be shot
would you would you have predicted would you have predicted that in advance that's the
important thing that i feel i would have because i don't know so the to wrap up hindsight devaluing
science and we already said the last point here which was that hindsight will lead us to systematically
undervalue the surprisingness of scientific findings and this unfairly devalues the contribution
of the researchers and worse it'll prevent you from noticing when you are seeing evidence that
doesn't fit what you really would have expected we need to make a conscious effort to be shocked
enough yeah uh i wanted to say a few things about that like the whole i'm really a fan of the idea
of learning to be more shocked by things um i think it kind of goes hand in hand with
kind of learning to be like maybe gratitude exercises i was thinking about the way that
my life improved significantly when i started taking a conscious effort to just like be amazed
by stuff like i can take a hot shower anytime i want like uh that is pretty cool just like
life is life is freaking cool like looking at a flower growing out of cement sometimes it's just
like i just want to let my mind continue to be blown by things that are that people don't look at
anymore normally um and the same goes for yeah when you learn things like i don't know i keep
thinking of the example of my dad who doesn't listen to this podcast uh just being really like
anti-science in some ways like more recently he had called and was complaining about how
everybody's just panicking unnecessarily about this stupid pandemic and it's just cold and it's fine
and i'm just like i don't know
amazed at people's ability to think that like they're common sense like ideas about the world are
just super obvious but like some of them were just random shit that they made up themselves or
they heard from other people some of the stuff they learned in school that was very difficult to
discover and not intuitive at all at the time that reminds me on pandemic stuff i have one more
quick note my sister is due for a second baby in like three weeks and she just pulled her daughter
out at daycare later than i think she should have um although if she was going to get sick she would
have by now but she did it after learning that apparently she was told by the hospital that
if she comes in for a delivery and she is presenting with COVID-19 symptoms it will hold onto her
baby for a couple of weeks till she is clear um and she was like fuck that so now she's actually
socially distancing and is considering a home birth um i don't know i mean like three of my
co-workers at my company are pregnant or at least recent moms or something and none of them mentioned
anything like that so i'm wondering if maybe that's just this one hospital or if my sister's misinformed
or had a paranoid person that on the phone that told her that or what um i don't know i mean that
might be a good idea well that's the thing is it sounds like a good and i that's that was my
thought i didn't say that to her but i did say that to my mom when we were discussing it because
i'm like oh yeah it's super practical we don't know what the long-term effects are if you catch
this as a newborn um obviously because it's been around for like four months right so um
like she's like yeah but it's still terrible and i'm like yeah it's not like it's not it's not great
yeah exactly yeah that said i wouldn't love to keep my baby in a hospital where everyone in
there has fucking coronavirus right so i'm also based on how much i know about how nowadays the
medical establishment is very much against separating children from or babies from their parents
it seems that seems very unlikely to me it seems much more like the paranoid ranting of someone
who's like they're taking our babies which you know you hear uh i don't know i mean the i might just
have a skewed example because my hospital is very good but i would feel very safe and comfortable
of being in that hospital as opposed to being anywhere else aside from you know socially
distancing at my own house like they're doing a very good job uh containing it uh and they do
as common practice at least in my cancer clinic separate children from parents because if one of
them has uh cancer and is immunocompromised then absolutely like the the biggest concern is that
person's safety more than like like we did have a mom who had to have her be separated from her baby
and it was sad it sucked everybody was like super depressed about it the mom had cancer and
babies are little disease vectors it'd be much worse for that kid to grow up without a mom
than to have to be separated for a few weeks while she undergoes chemo uh or lympho depleting therapy
yeah that sucks it does but i mean sometimes things suck but like they're to prevent worse
right uh sorry if i kind of went on a tangent about that it was just something on my mind no
that was that was the least tended tangential tangent we've had so far today i'm not so sure
i don't even remember what we're talking about are we still finishing the last uh
i think we're just dropping up we're done all right should we jump into today's actual topic then
i i think we should cool um oh i just nodded like because you guys can see me but the audience
can't so yes i i concur yeah we're um you know recording remote and we're on video chat so we
can see each other but you still can't see us listener so jess we are here to grill you on
the details of how to talk to strangers chapter one what's the major point go if i'm not good
at talking to strangers by the end of this then you get a d no the thing is i mean the book is not
about how to talk to strangers it's um bad title zero out of ten sorry i'm teasing no i just i didn't
hear you said i said bad title zero out of ten it's a good point though the title is somewhat
misleading i don't know i was drawn to the title like yeah but did you when you were drawn to the
title did you think this would be a treatise about how people talk to strangers or did you think
it would be like how you can get better at talking to strangers i mean i thought it was the latter
thing which is a substantive interest of mine i was actually just about to talk about marketing
things and about how authors don't get to pick their own titles and they focus test titles and so it
might not have even been mcgladwall's fault that this was the title of the book i don't blame him
but i'm just saying it is sort of a deceptive title even though yeah the book is not a here's how
to talk to strangers but it's more specifically about here's the ways that we fail to talk to
strangers or here's a bunch of a bunch of kind of new cognitive biases that i found to be really
interesting so yeah that was the name of the site before it turned out to be the real name of the
site that was a reference to overcoming bias where the awesomely nice guy robin hanson still blocks
i don't mean to dig all that out nobody knows what we're talking about anyway because that was
before we started recording oh i know yeah yeah so let's not get into it but um yeah hanson is
capable of entertaining some really weird shit so i'd start with this more like uh user friendly
posts if you've never been there before but or better yet start with his book um the elephant
in the brain i loved it i like as far as like pop science consumption like it was a page turner
i i was excited to keep going i went back and reread parts like it was great i can't uh pitch
that book hard and we'll post a link in our show notes that's right and well if you guys can want
to look back he actually came on it on the on our podcast talked about it yes he did i don't remember
what episode now i wish i'd been on at the time just search for him and we'll link in the show notes
as well all right someone gets to look it up then okay um so yeah i did like a very kind of rambling
discussion of talking to strangers last time uh this time i wanted to just actually kind of
summarize each of the chapters or each of the biases that he brought up um
um that sounds like exactly what i'm here for so rock on thank you the first one that he talks about
is default to truth where
he starts this off with um talking about chamberlain and hitler
oh he uh it went to germany talk to hitler before hitler started a world war two and
apparently says oh i've talked to him and i am convinced that he is trustworthy there was
a bunch of other examples then about uh annamantes who was a intelligence analyst at the defense
intelligence agency the di a who was also a cuban spy and again talking about hindsight
in hindsight there were a ton of red flags uh she wrote reports that parroted cuban viewpoints
and she would disappear during crises and it was just it would have seemed very obvious in retrospect
if you would know uh because of hindsight bias they brought up these examples and then was like okay
so why did people fail to notice these things they talk about um a psychologist who got a
bunch of test subjects to watch videos of people who were made to take a test and then either had
been given the opportunity to cheat or not cheat and then they received uh they had somebody um
give them the interview afterwards where they asked a bunch of questions and they said did you
cheat did you like think about cheating uh if i ask your partner who also took the test whether
or not you cheated you think they'd give you the same answer and some people lied and some fessed up
uh some did cheat some didn't cheat they showed these videos to a bunch of people and asked them
to like okay who's telling the truth who's lying and how confident are you consistently
these kinds of psychological studies show that people think that most people are telling the
truth so he called this uh default to truth and basically we're just really bad at telling when
people are lying yeah um and it seems to be adaptive which was the point that he goes on to
make later where society would kind of break if people went around being distrustful all the time
there's a chapter talking about what they call in some societies the uh holy fool a character who
exists in lots of folk tales and stories and they have a virtue of being outside of society in some
