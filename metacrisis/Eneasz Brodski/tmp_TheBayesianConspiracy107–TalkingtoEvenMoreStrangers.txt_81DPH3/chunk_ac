way so they're allowed to be critical of things or notice when people are lying an example of this
they brought up was uh the emperor's new clothes yeah the little child he's like he's not wearing
anything in some in a bunch of russian uh folk tales they have like the village idiot is always the
one that's like points out some obvious thing that everybody else couldn't talk about there's an example
of uh everybody uh being really amazed by this beautiful statue of the virgin mary and then the
village idiot coming over and saying can't you see that that's the work of the devil and everyone's
like how could you say such a thing and then the somebody touches the statue and it cracks and
reveals like a statue of the devil and there's something like that which seems like a strange
example of what these are the kinds of stories that exist in lots of societies you know it's
it's interesting because it does i don't know it's it's individually useful to be paranoid of
other people because sometimes people are cheating you but i've you know the societies where everyone
is constantly thinking everyone else is out to screw them and so they're trying to get theirs
first are really bad like like they brought up the example or go ahead oh i'm curious to hear more
about that actually oh it's just you like what what are you talking about what society is so uh
the the one i'm thinking of is basically any uh anytime you go to a tourist location outside the
U.S. there's often that kind of mentality once you get to kind of like the interstitial areas where
the the normal people are interacting with the not the normal people the
were you expected to haggle or do like hard so not just expected to haggle but like the people
literally assume that americans are just uh there to be taken advantage of because they have so
much wealth that it's a moral for them to keep any of it and it is the right thing to do to take
as much as you can from them but uh i mean we're protected somewhat when we go there by the institutions
that are there to make sure the tourists keep coming right but some of the experiences my parents
had like in egypt and just the even the stories i hear from people from other countries where their
politics tends to break down because everyone assumes everyone is in it for themselves and
the main thing you do when you get a political position is use it to help advance uh your interests
and your family's fortunes because if you don't someone else will and really the only people you
can trust are your family so better to make them as well off as possible and it leads to a lot of
social dysfunction whereas in like really high trust societies where that kind of thing is viewed
as evil instead of just you know run of the mill business the way everyone does things they tend to
be much richer and much better at implementing yeah you know we look at our qualities of life
and societies that are more uh that are higher trust that are able to be higher trust but every
now and then you do get taken advantage of it was one of the things i liked about being with melissa
she was very paranoid now is very trusting and so we made a good team we're generally i was always
like now let's cooperate with everyone but every now and then she saved my ass yeah i mean like
that's it's useful to have a holy fool around but society can't be composed of them like club all
brings up the example of somebody waiting in line at starbucks like oh that's gonna be five like 44
and they like whip out their phone like i'm gonna do that calculation myself and hold up the whole
and then you know like there's certain things that just kind of will grind to a halt if everybody's
watching their own ass all the time and questioning everybody's moves every move so so you can see
why it's adaptive and then also why we do get tricked in these ways that are baffling unless
you understand the psychology if david use of this thing he's totally like writing or say something
as well and we'll read it on the next listener feedback because i know he's had a lot of experience
with egypt with him being raised there and all right yeah uh i pulled out this quote but the
issue with spies is not that there's something brilliant about them so that there's something
wrong with the rest of us where uh and yeah the one more example was uh this person harry
marcapolis who was the independent fraud investigator who um wasn't fooled by bernie maddoff
defrauding thousands of investors like getting 60 billion dollars and then making like really
transparent lies about them everybody else assumed that like well obviously somebody
else is watching out for fraud on that scale and you know and maddoff doesn't look like a lie
and this guy was just that harry like was like obviously he's like imbezzling money and he warned
the securities and exchange commission uh in 2000 and then 2001 and 2005 and 2007 and 2008
each time they'll be listened to one thing i would say definitely if you're if you're ever
having anything seriously major done to your body or there's a big financial decision google it first
like never ever going for a surgery without first googling get find your paranoid friend yes
get to reveal it i need to figure out who that is in my social circle well i i know it's not me
i tend to be easily fooled i know that i am though like the thing that i thought you were
gonna well yeah yeah the thing that you were kind of talking about in the ash about like uh
there's yeah there's certain cultures or sales tactics really that like are just
poisoned to me and i just try to avoid them like i know anytime uh there's like a what is it uh um
what are what are those like really scammy things where you share a house for a certain number of
weeks yeah time share like how they get people and i watched my parents get like fooled like this as a
kid um is the like okay we'll give you like basically ever i highly discounted or like
basically free vacation at like this house in florida and then you're just gonna have to listen
to a timeshare pitch but you can say no yeah you say no like they like are very skilled at selling
people's higher shares and using all of the uh manipulative or persuasive tactics that work on
people because we do have psychologies and have like just had like built these kind of cultural
institutions of defaulting to truth it's nice this is another good time to plug uh robert
childini's influence science and practice as well as some good anecdotes on the uh
fun or what are they called a personal finance subreddit just jump there i think there's some
on the sidebar about time shares but you can also just search around for it and people will
share their experiences of like how skilled these hucksters are and they i i could go on at length
but it is uh it's advanced level um shy sting let's put it that way so i actually you do use one of
these things uh because i already knew about all this terrible awful stuff that they do right
and what you use uh a timeshare vacation yeah a timeshare vacation i saved several hundred dollars
and i just like went in with no matter what they say no matter what they do as soon as the two
hours are up i'm walking out and i basically tuned out entirely while he was talking and after two
hours was up i walked out and that was it and then i guess didn't get a very skilled one maybe
maybe that was it i think a large part of it is if you just you know think of this person as a
literal incarnation of the devil and signing anything with them is akin to signing over your
soul it's much easier just to be like peace out thanks for the vacation homie well the the ones
that tricked my parents didn't just uh like they did the thing of like making them make a promise
making them make another promise like uh i don't know they use basically all of the techniques
that shaldini talks about and like i watched like my parents you know go in saying definitely no
matter what we're going to just say no and they turn they turn them against each other like
they like did a bunch of like they had staff that was like being incredibly nice to children
in order to like turn the kids to their side i went without kids that helped i also skipped one
of the meetings entirely i was like eh whatever i think i only actually got a half hour of pitch
because then uh there was supposed to be a second one or something and i just didn't go
well yeah they kept escalating the pitches where they would like offer a free service
and then say that you also like you know the caveat is you have to listen to a five minute
pitch but it was like hey we'll give you a free boat ride but you got to listen to this five minute
pitch but like you know even your family can get on here and this okay so did your parents actually
end up losing money on the uh timeshare they bought a timeshare and i think they might still have it
or at least they kept it for years like over 10 years at least and never used it oh yeah see
they're never using it as a problem well that that was the yeah the thing i was about to bring
up which was that they kept adding more stuff that made it seem like this incredibly good deal that like
was too good to be true and it actually was a lot of it was you get this thing if you do this
trivial inconvenience in order to get it and we can give you this other thing for free but you
have to do this other trivial inconvenience where it was like we could have had these like
basically free vacations once a year if we've been willing to do a bunch of trivial inconveniences
which nobody does i believe there's a blog post about beware trivial inconveniences
yeah should probably put a link to that too so we believe people way too much yes although
generally it works out yeah it's a good thing so the next sort of bias that he talks about
is transparency he talks about the show friends and about how if you're watching
friends you can actually turn off the sound and usually still follow the class
because the actors are just very good at projecting with their body language and facial
expressions what they're feeling uh how you know when they're interacting with each other you can
tell if they're in love or sad or furious um pretty good acting but you're still left to the
question of why ross the largest friends simply doesn't just eat the smaller friends
haven't actually watched it so i love this part uh there was this psychological study that they
did where they got a bunch of participants to um they go down this long hallway into a dark room
and then they have to listen to a short story by france kafka and then you step out of the room
and while you're in the room a team of people uh altered the space that you walked in and
completely changed the hallway they say it was just this normal blank hallway and then
when you come out it's got bright green walls like bright overhead lights above a red chair
sitting in the chair staring at you like something out of a horror movie is your best friend
so they got these people's friends to coordinate with this whole thing
they reported their reactions there was about 60 test subjects they did pre-record
their hypothesis that people were going to look surprised in particular ways
but only five percent of the participants showed the classic wide eyes jaw drop raised eyebrows
those those three facial expressions only only five percent of people did those
and then only 17 percent of people did two of them most of them showed nothing clearly
identifiable a surprise at all so the conclusion of that is that we have kind of a folk psychology
that things like friends or novels draw from you know where they describe his eyes went wide
and his mouth dropped open this is not what people actually do okay so the thing is people
have this idea that you can read people's faces and it's actually not true well were those people
not surprised they were they were very surprised I mean they gave them an interview after the fact
and they were like yeah Jesus Christ scared the shit out of me okay look scared or look surprised
so yeah there's this other quote uh we think we can easily see into the hearts of others
based on the flimsiest of clues that's kind of going back to um Chamberlain and Hitler where
by talking with somebody by like having a conversation and by looking at their face
their expressions their body language people think that you can read people
as a personal anecdote this is a great way to get over stage fright and it's what helped me
no one can tell if you're faking like you just go up and you say the things and you like you know
try to smile and nobody knows that you're secretly fucking terrified and have no idea what's going on
and I mean that that even works like just with talking with people in general it helped me
overcome social anxiety too is like nobody knows that I'm full of shit and I'm terrified to be here
right now and it's it's true no one really pays that much attention or I guess even if you pay
attention they can't tell from your body language I found that to be the case too like uh the the
whole fake it till you make it thing like really works with social anxiety you just keep going to
parties and pretend you're having a great time eventually you'll start having a great time at
parties like the first few times you might be having a panic attack the entire time and go home
and cry but no one can tell I I'm in this picture yeah I know like I'm actually um currently like
working on a essay or a book or something about um how I learned to do social skills
there's like advice that I've had a hard time giving to people or things like that where it
sounds like a very cruel thing to say to somebody that like yeah you need to just do it anyway
I've had I've encountered a lot of pushback from people when they're like but you're so good at
talking to people and I just suck at it and then like I was I was worse than you
and then like literally the thing that you do is you just keep pretending you're good at it and
then you like start being read as being good at it I mean if enough people tell you you're good at
talking to them maybe that means you're actually good at talking to them though I'm good at faking
being good at talking to people but like is there a difference if they can't tell no I mean yeah it's
kind of weird during test stuff I guess I'm really good at faking being able to lift heavy things
I always managed to lift them even though it's all faking yeah that that might be an
actual example of having faked it until you made it and now you've actually made it right yeah
to some extent I mean there's something I still find social interactions to be really difficult
it feels like and maybe everybody finds them to be difficult I'm not I don't think so though I
think some people do find them to be natural and intuitive and comfortable I really enjoy them
but I find them to be very energy intensive I need to rest after exactly yeah as an introvert I need
to decomp a lot more than I do I want to talk about Amanda Knox too this was another case of
misjudging someone the bias that he called being mismatched okay and it's related to the previous
one transparency in 2007 a British student Meredith Ketcher Kertcher was murdered by
a local criminal Rudy Guide the case against Guide was damning he had his DNA everywhere like
but um for a very long time the media followed uh suspected her classmate Amanda Knox she was the
one who found her body called the police and then when they showed up she behaved weirdly
and the police officer had this weird fetish or something going on where he's like
was really trying to convince everybody that like obviously Knox was interested in
drug field dangerous sex games that led to the murder of this student
or like I think the police officer had like made this kind of claim about people before like he
seemed just really obsessed with trying to prove that people were involved in drug field sex games
all the time but um she acted guilty when the police showed up and in like subsequent trials
and guilty in scare quotes uh so her friends reported that while everybody else was crying
Knox didn't cry she was like making out with her boyfriend she looked happy when
somebody said I hope she didn't suffer Knox was like what do you think they cut her throat she
fucking bled to death of course she suffered which seemed like a horrifying shocking thing
to everyone to say I I'm sorry is it is it bad if someone says a true thing apparently I had this
exact same thing happen to me well not you didn't go to court I almost go to jail yeah the thing is
based on the descriptions of Amanda Knox uh I read her as being maybe on the autism spectrum
so the thing that happened to me when I was a kid one of my sister's friends died uh in high
school he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree and when I heard that I said what a stupid way to
die and I said it angrily because what I what I was trying to express was get more rest what an
like what an unfair way to die or like what a terrible you know like not not stupid people die
this way yeah yeah but because I said a thing that wasn't one of the scripts that you're supposed
to say to grieving people then my sister thought that I was being incredibly like rude and callous
and so met her friend was stupid I don't know if she's ever actually like forgiven me but I made
the same mistake a lot of times of all there are things that you're like supposed to there's a way
you're supposed to act I never knew how to do these things I would kind of like copy the people
around me but I always felt like oh my god like I'm I'm not doing gratitude right how do you do
gratitude like a relative gives you a gift I'm like oh my god what do I do how do I how do I do
the correct gratitude thing so they know that I'm actually grateful they went um back in this chapter
also to the study of the students who are asked to cheat they had people who do the video interviews
later so there was the girl that they nicknamed nervous Nellie who got really defensive when
the interviewer was asking her if she cheated she was fidgeting she repeated herself over and over
again halted mid-sentence was clearly agitated everybody was convinced she was lying but she
was telling the truth she was just nervous being mismatched is when somebody well we think that
liars will show agitation but Gleibwell says plenty of liars will look you in the eye and lie
right to your face and plenty of honest people will look like they're lying did we talk about
that's I'm sure we did about when we did the last episode I've been in a situation where I've been
assumed to be lying when I'm not yeah okay we covered this and it's a it's a really weird
situation to be in yeah like I think the thing that you described was a kind of giving long
