when pornographic websites ban violent or non-consent categories, they're disproportionately
reducing women's access to preferred porn, which I don't know, that was an awesome,
I don't want to call it galaxy brain necessarily, but like one of those great flip the tables on
the people thing where they're trying to help them and you're like, actually, the women are the
group you are fucking most by doing this. Yeah, fucking softly and gently the way they don't
exactly.
Yeah, it's so dumb. It's so fucking dumb. But like, who's gonna fight for it? Right? Like,
this is one of those shit things that like, it doesn't look good. You're like, no, please
leave that video up of like, the man strangling the woman as she's crying. Like,
you can't just, it's just a bad look, you know, it's hard to fight for.
This is why we need people who they don't have their income tied to being employed by
some public facing company. I can just say, yeah, actually, you know, women do kind of like this
thing a lot. And we shouldn't take it away because you're harming innocent adult consenting people.
Yeah, so dumb.
