glad that i'm white i'm so glad that i'm male that i've never had to deal with like i've never had
to deal with like going down the street and have a cop see me and i get like yeah anxious or defensive
because you know i don't know what might happen that's never been a concern of mine right um
a decent way to simulate that might be to be like deliberately breaking the law
like seriously walk walk down the street with a ziplock bag full of cocaine in your pocket
holy shit and uh then then like again you're not doing anything but then you see a cop car drive by
and that panic you get might actually simulate what it's like to not have the luxury of being pretty
sure the cops won't bug you um i mean i guess you still have the the low prior factor of like well
they're not going to stop you because you're white and stuff but uh like the fact yeah like
just what you said just uh like if you're on the wrong side of the law uh whether because you're
committing committing a crime or because the law hates you for no good reason um they can both kind
of get that that sense of panic i had this last thought i wanted to say about the uh you know the
the mob kind of continuing going um and you know in this in the case of like Weinstein and Cosby the
mob we don't call it the mob because they did the right thing um but we were talking about like
something like hate feels good i think some people and you know you mentioned every revolution just
keeps going like those people who enjoyed the the fight if you want to call it that um and they're
they will they will keep finding targets because they love that so much right i just thought that
that callback is the only thing i could find just to say that i i think my uh my contributions are
waning even though they weren't that strong to begin with well the one thing i do want to bring
back to is um that less wrong post which was uh making history available right i was thinking
about that a lot in the context of like race and gender and i i don't think it's how he meant it
but when people say check your privilege um like there's a lot of that sentiment in that post
where he's talking about just like think about what it would feel like to have actually been
like you know living under Jim Crow right or i don't know i i think about that a lot in the
context of especially the cancel culture type stuff as far as because i i don't know i none of it
really affects me very much i don't have any skin in the game um i make money through writing
which makes me more at the same time more and less susceptible to ever being cancelled but
like that's not my core audience of the people who are gonna like oh man he said something that was
politically unorthodox i don't it's not really the audience that i have but i i i tried i tried
to think about about what it feels like to kind of live in one of these work cultures that is toxic
and it's a bunch of little things and they just build up over time and you can't really
assemble evidence unless you want to start making a spreadsheet of every single time
that you felt demeaned and no one actually does that because it's not it's that would be kind of
it's self-toxic right that would be dwelling on the all the bad shit and some people do that but
it sucks yeah and and well some some of it you don't even know right you don't know whether it was
a comment about about your gender or about your race or or anything like that you don't know if it
if it actually was intended as that or if you're reading into it or whatever and then i also do
think you know that fear of oh man i said some stuff that i realized now is wrong but i'm not
gonna get any clemency for it no one's gonna i'm gonna have to weather the storm of public shame
for something i don't even agree with anymore you know
although a lot of a lot of the people uh like kevin hart got canceled in the sense that he's
makes millions of dollars and it's still a well-known comedian he got quote unquote cancelled right
i'm not familiar with kevin hart what happened he made a joke he made a joke that was basically
he would kill his son of his son so i laughed already because i'm assuming he did not mean this
seriously right okay okay um like it's a luicy k kind of thing right uh let me see if i can find
the tweet um no i can't i can't find it but it was it was basically a joke but it wasn't like
it was it fell very flat and it was a very uh dicey subject for a fall flat joke it was like
the woman who said yeah she wasn't gonna get aids in africa right yeah um which was a funny story
because she was like she like made that she made that tweet and then like got on an airplane and
missed the whole twitter story yeah and then eight hours later she finds out she doesn't have a job
or any friends anymore when she lands yeah um but yeah kevin hart was was one of those examples
where it was it was something about you know killing his gay son or something and people were
like wow it's not funny and also super homophobic um and then he didn't apologize for it uh which made
the whole thing kind of like okay so like this this isn't a thing where you're like where you don't
agree with it anymore you're just people are being too sensitive and whatever um that happens a lot
there's there's a book that's uh i would recommend called so you've been publicly shamed i've heard
of it um did you read it it's pretty yeah yeah it's uh it's pretty good it's pretty good it's
quite old now i think i mean in in internet years but um it's about 16 months old yeah um
but it's it's sort of a a bunch of issues that i guess it's 2015 that's recent right but but a lot
of it is is about the more general issues of of cancel culture and how people should respond to it
if they want to weather the storm i think it's and i think oh go ahead sorry i think that one
of the norms that i would like that i actually think can be changed is for people to understand
the pr position of like how to deliver how to acknowledge that you're not a perfect person
or whatever you know because i think that's one of the things that actually does defuse the cancel
mob and i think after probably after your fourth time trying to cancel contra points maybe you
start to get the idea that it's not going to work and you should stop doing it has it really been
that many times uh i know i know of at least three uh i'm fuzzy on the third there was one where she
had some tweet a tweet that was like uh i i don't even want to stop it was dumb twitter twitter
twitter is twitter as a kevin heart thing yeah the kevin heart thing was was beyond twitter because
it was um that was not just a twitter mob because it was uh it extended into like
old media as well um but yeah i but yeah there are a lot a lot of people who get cancelled just
they keep on going and they they are negatively affected in that they get a lot of harassment
and maybe they lose some subscribers or some income or whatever a lot a lot of the people
get cancelled are public facing right like as a software engineer um i did practically nothing
that was public facing right so the more public facing you are the more risk there is that someone
will take issue with you especially if you're a more extreme personality but i don't know that's
kind of off track so we've been going for almost two hours uh actually no over two hours i'm sorry
uh it's and what i wanted to kind of bring it to and and is there like final points things
that you would like to cover that we didn't get to or things you would like to reply to
no i'm fine my only point is that i'm not i'm a structuralist i'm a structuralist and a
consequentialist i think censor censorship gets a bad rap all right specifically because of
the slippery slope which uh i don't know if it's actually that slippery right that's that's
that's my the sum the summary of my opinion we didn't need to spend two hours well i mean
i had a good time though and i i that only did i enjoy talking to you i feel like it helped iron
out a lot of things that i was confused about i feel like we are not as different in opinion as i
thought we were before we started this i think we mostly agree on the problems and not necessarily
yeah i am i am much more on the side of you know we we shouldn't stop anyone talking but we should
definitely start to put up some sort of structure for for people to oppose the the censorship and
feel like they can do it without losing losing everything i guess and bolden the employers
because we are on the side of big business and landlords no i i mean i as basically a listener
to this episode i had fun with it so i think that like there is there seems to be less daylight
between your guys's positions than maybe it seems like you guys when you're starting out i do get
you know i don't want to say and now we all agree but yeah like you know the problems are problems
and the solution the proposed solutions are myriad and i don't have anything else to say
apparently so i i really enjoyed like i said mostly listening to this and i thought this was a lot
of fun um so once again at least for me thanks alexander for coming on and and doing this with us
yeah for sure i had a good time and everybody you have just heard how um intelligent and
thoughtful and kind alexander is his fiction is the same way it's really good stuff if you like
the kind of intelligent and kind of stuff it's read his things specifically right now worth the
candle is what is in progress and if you're somehow listening to this and haven't read uh
metropolitan man which isn't a 1.3 million word investment um i i think it's like the it is my
favorite points to an example of like rationalist fiction um not necessarily like my favorite work
ever but uh it's definitely got to be top three rationalist fiction probably top two tied for
first with methods of rationality but it's my favorite to direct people towards because it's
way more consumable and uh you know if like a lot of people are turned off from methods because uh
you know they don't like harry you don't run into that problem with lex luther you're not supposed
to love him as a person you're supposed to love like oh my god he is the best villain ever and uh
the best villain ever is the one who has really good points and i don't know if we mentioned this
in your arm before but basically your point was so good that they stole it for batman versus superman
or yeah which was uh you know his the whole thing with that where he 100 flip flops his position
for no reason by the by the second movie um he has aligned the exact opposite of lex luther's
which was stolen from your book i'm convinced uh in the first one where he says like if there's a
one percent chance that you know he will turn on the world we need to take that he says we need to
take it as a certainty which is not how lex would have put it but then in the second in whatever
don of justice he says if there's one percent chance that this will work we need to take it as
a certainty or something and i'm like you're reversing your argument there's a 99 chance you
could unleash dark superman like what what are you doing but anyway i mean the movies were a
disaster but my point is they were good and they were your book was good enough to inspire
hallowed movies whether they'll admit it or not so yeah yeah metropolitan man is actually like
six or seven years old it it's astonishing to me to think that because it seems like i don't know
it does not seem that old but yeah it it actually wondered man of steel came out i think it might
i think it might have preceded man of steel uh yeah in uh internet years same same year same
year in internet years though that's a really long time yeah in internet years that's that's
very very long so if you would like a smaller easier to consume sample of axander before you
commit to something huge metropolitan man is great uh great sampler yep all right awesome well
thank you for joining us um oh we should thank our patron before we call it a night of course
we can't call it a night without thanking our patrons who keep the lights on around here and
make this show possible this show is is responsible or wait is possible only because of listeners
like you and by you i mean explicitly mars olivia thank you mars you make this possible you let us
speak to alexander wales and broadcast it to everyone so you you have helped uh have speech
promulgate across the internet yes thank you so much we really appreciate it the debate will
continue because of your your contribution awesome well i think that's it then for this episode
we'll see you guys back in a couple of weeks for more bayesian conspiracy okay thank you
everyone for joining us and thank you again alexander yep thanks thanks again one quick
piece of listener feedback that i remembered just at the last minute uh a a person in the discord
said that i should come with sources available if i am going to cite conspiracy theory type
material in the podcast uh and what they were referring to was my statement that the cdc used
really inflated numbers for flu deaths and it came around to bite them in the butt when
covet happened because people could say covet was only twice as bad as the flu when they were using
code uh covet actual deaths versus the flu maximum estimated number and uh first of all
want to say that i don't really think that's conspiracy theory stuff because it seems like a
pretty um normal claim for me to say that a agency could use the highest end estimate of a death
for you know purposes of the public good and then it comes around to bite them in the butt
but um i admit i did not have them in front of me at the time the the sources that i have were
linked on our website the basin conspiracy dot com so people can go there to look them up if they
want to they include a letter from the assistant secretary of the u.s department of health and
human services which made this assertion uh that the flu deaths were inflated at least five times
higher than what they actually are and uh also the journal for the american medical association
so both uh saying basically the same thing so both you know reputable sources that uh have
linked documents on our website so there you go actual source i was not trying to do conspiracy
theory shit didn't we also put that in the episode description yeah it's it's in the episode
description too it was just i didn't cite what they were from directly in the episode and that was
considered a foul on my part i don't know i i don't know who called you out for that or like
how generalizable this is because now we're we're running pretty late but like so my thoughts aren't
100 in order but like i feel like it's okay to say i read this somewhere i can't remember the
name of the book and then drop the book you know as a uh as a in the show notes like i don't think
it's it's fair to say you didn't come with sources if you don't click the the show notes or the you
know go to the website for the you know whatever it is you're listening to to see if it's on there
if like you're just saying shit and you don't back it up then that's really annoying
but if you if you can't back it up in real time on the air as it comes up improv too
that i don't think should prohibit you from saying it yeah i i agree i think this is the
reason we have show notes right in order to put these linking documents in and we don't have to
stop a voice conversation right in the middle to do searches friendly reminder we have show
notes for every episode in the show notes you can find a link to our discord where this piece
of feedback came in um and uh usually follow up stuff on things that we discussed in the episode
so like you know we we mentioned the harper the harper's letter um and like we didn't read it on
here but it also didn't like give you a url to find it but you can click a url in the show notes
and read it there exactly so you can always find that at the basinconspiracy.com or in the show
notes perfect and yeah i mean i'm not sure what like apple's podcast app does these days but my
my podcast app of choice on iphone is uh overcast is that what it's called i don't know what it is
well i know but it just that doesn't sound like thinking out ahead yes well and yeah so i can't
cite that because i can't remember so i think it's overcast that sounds right there will be a link
to your pod catcher in the show notes now i have to find it um the uh like you just swipe right from
like the little play window and it takes you to the show notes and an embedded thing inside the
player and from there you can open it it doesn't even take you to an external browser you can open
it while not leaving your apps so nice yeah it's it's the future guys tech is tight
all right uh that's all i had so thank you oh yeah of course and for anyone listening is confused
where alexander went uh this was brought up like immediately after we ended the episode
he was like all right well uh well wait after we have to up with him and then enash was like oh
i had a piece of feedback so we just jumped back on for that so actually this is the second week
in a row we've done that right i think so yeah yeah or a second episode in a row yeah let's see
how long we keep the trend running of a post-show content all right we'll see you in a couple weeks
bye
you
