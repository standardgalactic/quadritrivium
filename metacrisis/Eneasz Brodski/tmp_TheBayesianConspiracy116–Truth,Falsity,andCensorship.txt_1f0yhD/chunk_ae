like it sounds like I you know I'm the the Harper letter Harper's letter excuse me doesn't seem to
like I mean yes a handful of intellectuals can take a public commitment to saying this is bad and
well we won't uh like make the choice of you know this whatever the false choice between
justice and freedom um like that that doesn't seem like a solution um you know it like if you
own a small business and uh whatever like Twitter accuses one of your employees of in 1983 writing
a letter of what was then I'm assuming a fairly mainstream opinion I'm thinking of that guy you
mentioned that uh said that women shouldn't be in combat or something yeah like I think 40 years
ago that was a pretty popular thought and so for whatever reason you know the this guy got unlucky
and somebody found that and and whatever doxed him with his employer or something like uh I mean
if you own the business and your town is saying we'll refuse to shop here until you fire that guy
you're like well then I'm going out of business because I'm principled like no one's gonna do that
so like I I even if you sign this letter you're like well I also have to feed my family and have
health insurance or whatever so like I don't see how that's a solution I don't think that
I'm I'm in strongly favor of the ideals of it and I and like as individuals we should all make that
choice but like I guess what I'm getting at is I'm not sure a how that's a solution to any
problem that's going on right now and b like what is being proposed that you have a disagreement with
like as far as solving the easy problem of twitter mobs or like or we can pivot to like a more general
case well so um and I'll I'll let alexander reply to but my my takeaway uh my major takeaway was
that um I mentioned this on the mind killers I was so surprised that the harper's letter was even
controversial that I didn't mention it on our episode when it first came out because I thought
how could anyone disagree with this but the thing is um Europe went through a hundred years of war
and murder over this conflict of ideas and the solution they finally came up with was the liberal
ideals and uh specifically the in this case the ideal of freedom of speech that anyone can say
anything as long as they uh do not like do direct deliberate harm with it uh you let people say what
they want argument gets counter argument it never gets a bullet and this is I mean it's kind of
unintuitive to humans in general but it is a social norm it took like I said almost a century
of killing to get to this point but it becomes a thing that society upholds it is a principle
that people have to stand by even when it costs them personally and it is how they solved this
problem and now it seems to me like we some aspects of society have forgotten that or don't
care and want to uh change things and I think it is very important to stay true to the ideal
that you don't censor people you don't try to silence them by uh threatening them with violence
or threatening their families or threatening their employment and uh you respect people's
ability to speak even when what they're saying is bad and dangerous and will cause your children to
go to hell um or will possibly uh endanger your children's health because that is still better
than the alternative of 100 years of warfare um and that is what I basically saw the harper's
letter as saying that hey guys freedom of speech remember this thing it's a great thing let's all
remember that it stays in place only due to principled people still holding to that and the
social pressure to conform to that and I was shocked when such a vast number of people were
like this letter is bullshit and terrible and how dare people sign on to it well okay so and I know
you didn't personally say that some people did you were much more moderate so I'm sorry I did not
intend to I'm much more moderate but I guess the way I see it is let's say that you are trans right
and you see J.K. Rowling who has an enormous audience uh and whose audience is not really
because she has great ideas right right I mean I mean great great political ideas certainly
no no one is following okay I'm sure some people are but for the most part people follow J.K. Rowling
on Twitter because she wrote a bunch of books that were important to their childhood or whatever
right uh and they want to keep up on harry potter stuff and so J.K. Rowling gets on platform
or gets on Twitter and she uses her platform to say things like you know uh well I'm trying to
not misquote her but um one of the really bad ones that I think she should apologize for was when
she said that uh the movement gives cover for violent predators yeah well J.K. Rowling's position
is you know basically that uh trans women are not real women they are predators who you know
are invading women's spaces and trans men don't exist and uh transition is basically conversion
therapy and a bunch of stuff like that I don't think that's a fair way to point out her position
but she's definitely trending in that direction well she she she did say specifically that transition
was a form of conversion therapy that one I know she's okay um I mean you can certainly fact check
me after I do I do remember something about conversion therapy in the post I don't remember
the details right now but yeah we can trust that no one will actually put in a legwork to fact check
to anybody because of the air we live in yes um but I I do for myself try to hold to the truth
as closely as possible I'm pretty sure that that is it is a slightly uncharitable and it puts all
that stuff that was kind of spread out and tiptoed around in one place but um let's say you're
trans person and you see that I think that you your first instinct might be might be to say
okay well she can say that and freedom of speech that's great and then you think about
whether that's gonna like change anyone's mind and you don't have the platform that jk Rowling
does right jk Rowling has so many I I don't I don't have the numbers but she has a lot of followers
right and that is gonna go out to everyone and even if you reply to her in a tweet maybe she'll
block you maybe just no one sees it right and if it changes people's mind then it's going to change
you know their perception of you personally it's going to cause real actual harm to you
especially if those people start you know voting for people who are going to start taking away
your your medicine that you need for transition or that are going to restrict what services are
available to you from the state um and you look at that and you're like well why you know I I'm
am I going to selflessly give up aspects of my life am I going to allow this harm caused me by
this speech that has like actual real consequences in the real world right or am I going to just
sit there and stand by free speech and for me it's the same thing with the anti-vax stuff right it's
like I you know if it were just speech I'd be fine with it but it's not just speech it's people
vaccinating their kids and my son possibly getting a disease because of that speech and I think that
applies to a lot of these things a lot of these things that where people are upset about what
others have said and why you know cancellation is basically the only recourse if you think that
talking isn't going to work and talking obviously cancellation feels good for those people right
I've never canceled anyone but I imagine that it probably feels good to just be like hey
fuck that guy for all the stuff that he said that is is going to do you know it's going to
negatively impact me he hates me and you know cancellation probably feels good I think it's
also easier than dialogue which is what tracks people to it but when people are kind of iffy on
free speech or the totality of free speech I think that's where they're coming from I think they're
thinking about in the real world I think especially for LGBT people that's they're thinking about how
things used to be where like it used to be that there would be people who'd hang out outside
gay nightclubs with their cameras and they would take covert pictures of people coming out of
these nightclubs and then they would send it to these people's employers you know
and now to be asked to be asked to show leniency and understanding to these people who showed you
no leniency and understanding who I we've said that you know free speech has done fairly well
it's got a checkered history you know McCarthyism definitely happened there have been a lot of
instances of of people um acting out against employers that like cancel culture not only is
it not just the left it's it's also not new it's been going on for a long time that that people's
jobs have been lost for things that they said it's just now so many people have yeah there was their
history discoverable that that it's getting to be a bigger problem it was cancelled yeah but it was
always a bad thing the whole time it was happening yeah no it was always a bad yeah start becoming
good now just because the targets are the quote unquote right targets no no I think I just think
that a lot of people who argue a lot of the argument that is made is made from a position of
why would we not use these tools right I think saying you know we got to be better than our enemies
is is true but yeah okay thank you I would like to say the reason that we don't want to use these
tools is like first of all I I do still think you're the that JK Rowling was slightly misrepresented
to you like she didn't say uh from my recollection that trans people are predators uh the thing she
said was that the movement gives cover to predators which is a slightly different thing it's still
bad like I said this is something I think she should apologize for because it's it's just not the
case and it is highly inflammatory and like you said could hurt people um but my my problem isn't
with people necessarily saying JK Rowling is awful it's the fact that uh if JK Rowling signed the
Harper's letter uh now no one else can sign the Harper's letter or they are in in jeopardy of being
canceled uh it is it is that sort of thing like I know I've made this example before but if Hitler
himself signed the Harper's letter I still think the Harper's letter uh principles are correct and
true and I would still sign it even though I am not for the extermination of Jews at all
or any other minority group uh and that's the sort of thing you see people don't have the power
to cancel JK Rowling directly so they go after anyone who could be uh slightly associated with her
to create a culture of fear uh so that no one dares say anything that might be construed as
remotely positive of Rowling or um or or to be supporting something that Rowling might also support
it is it's like a really horrible chilling terrorizing effect to to have these people
out there ready to cancel anyone who might have uh been near someone who said something
that is uh that is cancelable I think most recently I love Natalie Wynn I watch all the
contra points videos as they come out not always the same day they come out because they're fucking
long but usually within a week or so and um she got canceled not too long ago because she had Buck
Angel as a voice actor to uh read one line for her and Buck Angel is a trans man a porn star
as like 40 years old now super uh super active in the gay community and the trans community
over his years fighting for gay and trans rights and uh Buck Angel is currently canceled because
he has some opinions about the trans uh trans trenders as uh they are sometimes referred to
the idea that some people are transitioning not because they're genuinely uh gender dysphoric
but more because it's a status move and all their friends are doing it and whatever I don't know
I don't really have an opinion on that but Buck Angel huge got huge in the uh gay and
trans rights uh community got canceled and then Natalie Wynn trans woman had him do a voice for
her like one line voice um because he was such a big figure in the trans rights community and now
she was canceled for having that association with him and it's it's this sort of thing that I think
is not just lunacy but like outright dangerous that makes everyone terrified to say anything or
to be associated with anyone who might have ever said anything um I think to some extent it's kind
of like it it's kind of like the war on terror where terrorism was not you forgive me for saying
this terrorism was not a big deal right right it didn't actually kill that many people and now
there's like this culture of fear and the culture of fear is worse than the actual thing that happened
exactly yeah and I just I don't know also contra points has been canceled like three or four times
it's a thing a lot of a lot of people you know um peter coffin is is a youtuber and it's not
as big but he's he's talked about you know he's he's been canceled like you know six or seven times
and it's it's tough to deal with the the harassment that you get first for just saying what you thought
and it's like come on we're on like nominally the same side why are you even doing this it's not
gonna change my mind it's just gonna like it's just gonna piss me off and like cancellation doesn't
help anyone right can I get a definition then of what it means to be canceled like if jk rolling
is canceled like she still has twitter her books are still available um if this one person this
youtuber has been canceled four times like what does it even mean right that's that's the other
problem is basically it just means that people are in some sense the the soft version is basically
just a boycott right you are declaring that you are boycotting someone because you don't agree with
things they said you don't want to financially and that would be fine uh the the hard version of
canceling is going after um going after a person's well it's it's difficult because boycotting is
going after someone's employment in a sense um it's just a matter of like intent then right um
but yeah going after going to someone's employer and saying hey you got fired this guy or going to
advertisers and saying hey if you don't you know drop this your sponsorship of this person
i'm not gonna buy any more stuff right that's usually what it is sometimes it goes further to uh
oh man when it's really bad is when anyone who is associated with you starts to get boycotted
and get the same employer harassment and those things like it is it is at its worst it is the
um attempt to make someone socially toxic so everyone else will have to cut them out of their
lives or suffer the same fate as well yeah and usually that does not work that that you usually
that is not like you have to be i don't know the the fact that a lot of people get canceled
so many times and just never sticks and jk rellen can't can't be canceled uh all right but it still
puts people are making attempts it still puts all that person's friends like through a lot of stress
like your life gets well yeah i'm not arguing that i'm not arguing that these tactics are they're
or yeah but i don't know it's i i at times feel like it's overblown because so many people
just get canceled and then are fine the the real danger is if you are very very small yeah and and
but that's like public shaming right well that's not the problem is like the powerful never have
the rich and the powerful never have that huge of a problem because they're already rich and
powerful the problem is like uh when um when andrew sullivan gets uh gets kicked off of uh
god what the new york magazine was it or the new yorker i i don't remember the exact name right
he's gonna be fine he's already rich he's already famous he has book deals it's all the people in
their early to mid 20s who are working there they just started their careers they're trying to make
it big in journalism which is already a dying industry that it's really hard to make it in
and they see this thing happen and they just shut the fuck up if they have any opinions that aren't
towing the uh the orthodoxy of whoever is leading the cancel mobs and that i think is genuinely
harmful i don't i don't even think that the cancel moms necessarily have an orthodoxy i think
they're just i i think there's something that you can absolutely say is orthodoxy that uh
cis white people are fair game for anything um that uh trans people and uh racial minorities
are are what's the term here they they to be protected is not the right term they're almost
fetishized um yeah i i mostly just think that the mob is not like an intelligent thing yeah but
but the mob knows what's a lot of a lot of the pile on is not like is not like oh that's like
you know we're making a principled stand here it's principled it feels like a principled stand it
feels good to attack people but the mob has an intuitive sense of who they can uh victimize next
and if you watch them you can tell you know some of the signs well i mean the mob
puts out feelers right it's uh if if there are if there are flock of birds you have some birds that
fly like at the edge of the flock and then get brought back in because it didn't work um i i just i
think a lot of it is needs to be analyzed in in terms of of how mobs function and how mobs dispense
justice right like and i don't i don't think i i think yeah there's there there's usually some
ideological underpinning at some point but most of it is just like three minutes hate
or whatever it's just it's just it's just that gathering of hatred toward what may or may not
be an acceptable target and it's not actually about it's not actually about the the object level
thing so much as it is about the emotional feeling right i do have um i'm sorry i was just
gonna say that i i appreciated that uh like i said to you gave me i've been looking around for a while
for like what is meant by the word harm in cases where like that tweet harms people um and like
you know the intuitive sense of harm is you know swinging a fist at somebody and the the
the layout you gave of uh the you know rolling tweet storm was the first articulate example that
actually drove the point home for me so thanks for that i just i i had the thought immediately
after you said it forgot it then i remembered it again and i it's like i knew i was gonna let it
slip if i didn't get it out so so i i guess now we are you seem to be or at least i sort of feel
like i'm just talking about like er the kids and they're canceling these days and i don't want to
be that guy i just i am very much in favor of a freedom of speech even if it has some harmful
effects because i think on net it's good and that was the main thing i guess i came to say because
you seem to be more about censorship is good and justified sometimes yet the other thing i wanted
to kind of drive us back to was like i don't think anyone here loves twitter mobs like and no one
here really loves cancel culture to the extent that it's an actual problem that actually affects
people like i don't i mean i don't want to put words in either of your mouths but i think that
no one's on here saying yes uh that guy who wrote that you know thing in 1983 should have been fired
