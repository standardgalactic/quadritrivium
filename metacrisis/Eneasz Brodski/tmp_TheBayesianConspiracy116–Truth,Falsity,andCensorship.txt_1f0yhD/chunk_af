like none of us are that so like i was i was more interested in like what proposed solutions we would
have uh to solve like misinformation problems and there was an interesting you know the the thing
he said over earlier about um uh you know truth maybe not being the best weapon here i i thought
that was really interesting and if we have time i definitely want to hit that yeah i guess i guess
for me yeah i mean i'll finish up the thoughts they were having on this i don't want to like
say all right conversation over but i i don't know how like that you'll find a resolution
i i don't think there is really resolution to this i because it's it's a difficult problem i just
i think that i mean we have limits on free speech already right we have
some degree of censorship already it's just a question of degree and in in what circumstances
it's appropriate right i mean i i i know a lot of um free speech absolutists uh i they're very
common online who but um my experience being a moderator for communities is that you just there's
a lot of stuff that you just you can allow some amount of disutility to happen if you just do
absolutist free speech because a lot of people will just will just come in and and be a net
negative on your community and there's certain elements of speech that can be a net negative
on a community and um it is it's a problem that can have different solutions to it and
i do think due process is you know good and a thing to be strived for i just i don't think you can
really it's hard i i'm i'm struggling to think of a legislative framework that you could introduce
that for what's essentially a social problem well i think a lot of it is measuring the the
costs versus the benefits like kicking someone off a discord does not have a lot of cost
to their personal lives they're not gonna lose their jobs or their families whereas
going after their job may lose them their job so their sin would have had to have been far
greater to justify doing that sort of thing to someone like why would scott alexander
getting doxxed by the new york times there was no justification for that well i mean they had
a justification it just wasn't okay um yeah no and and that's not even that wasn't even a case of
presumably that was not a case of of them like attempting to cancel in it was just yeah presumably
speaking of his posts are back on his website as of a couple days ago yep he's come back i think the
new yorker put out a piece on it and then the new york times piece is probably not gonna run because
of that yeah i think we talked about the new yorker piece uh episode or two ago um all time it's
fuzzy now but we just hadn't mentioned that yet that ssc was back up and that's exciting um yeah
like so it seems to me like one interim proposed like avenue to at least making things less shitty
i don't know what this would do to like fight the cancel mob but like i i mean i have a very
like small amount of concern for that like not just because i'm too small of a target
friend i want to give a shit about but um like it it doesn't seem to work on a lot of big figures
and it doesn't go after a lot of small figures so like it's bad but it's not like uh you know
as far as like where i can direct my effort like before we started talking we were talking about
effective altruism right like effective effort here um i don't feel like the best use of my time
is fighting cancel culture because it's not like the world's biggest problem but like misinformation
is you know like on the subject it's not the biggest problem but it's a bigger problem and so
like you know if if twitter had uh smarter bots that flagged more content and they're like hey we
noticed you put out a tweet about uh the aggression or the violent aggression rates of trans women
or something here are the actual statistics on that and it had that same sort of badge that it has
for trump tweeting about kung flu right um like yeah that that sounds like a not bad thing to do
it's not censorship you know the tweet stays up um it's uh to be a thousand percent clear again
because you don't let me very well alexander i don't call it kung flu i was making fun of the
president so yeah uh like i think that that might be the way to go there um like i not not to let
anyone i guess not to just force the conversation there but like as far as fighting misinformation
it doesn't seem like truth has the stopping power that we'd like it to have at least not in
the medium term like i don't have current numbers on anti-vaxxers although i do have
approximate estimations on the number of kids getting you know measles and shit which is more
than it was 10 years ago when i last looked into this sort of thing so i'm guessing anti-vaxxing is
at least as much if not more of our problem than ever despite the truth telling them hey you guys
are wrong and do you have like alternate proposals for how to deal with general misinformation
or am i pivoting us way too hard or alex alexander just because it was in the like an email talking
about how like you had said that you know truth might offer an asymmetry but the bigger asymmetry
is on the side of lies which can maximize for emotional impact far better than the truth can
and like that's true yeah um yeah the anti-vaxx stuff especially is um a lot of the a lot of its
emotional appeal uh especially for especially for autism there people want to have an explanation
for why their kid is autistic and they want it to be someone's fault you know that that's one of
the things that's very appealing about the anti-vaxx stuff from an emotional standpoint right
obviously not true but that that's where it's come from as far as remedies go the government is very
very uh slow um i wouldn't want a government solution for for any of these problems basically
i think these are all structural problems right cancel culture is a a structural problem the mob
is created by the structure that the mob sits within um and you know to some extent human nature
right it's it's humans driving that it's human nature driving it rather than humans themselves
and the misinformation stuff is also to my mind structural it's um it is a society that has
sort of blurred the line between information and entertainment and promoted a lot of people who
just basically don't care about the truth whatsoever um opera being one of them right and
have no consequences whatsoever for spreading information um and the the solution for structural
problems it has to be a structural solution right you need to change the underlying issues um
most of it is just most of it is just capitalism honestly it is is inherent problems to capitalism
that have sort of run away and i'm not saying socialism is the answer but um you know what
do you do you have like vague outline ideas of possible solutions i mean you can you can
increase the laws you can make defamation laws more strict or with um higher degrees of liability
like i said uh the united states is uh among the countries with the weakest defamation laws
um in the world so like uh the the standards for defamation are extremely high especially
if you're a public figure right and a lot of the problem with uh these twitter mobs is that
they're just spreading lies right um and there there's no consequence whatsoever right i could
i could lie about someone on twitter and twitter first of all is not going to do anything about it
partly for a lot of these platforms it's because uh doing anything about it would require
artificial intelligence of some kind um like what probably a week one to to go look through
and just be like hey that's actually not true and like we know it's not true and it's not like a
corner case it's not like a matter of arguing opinion it's just it's just false um it's a hoax
or or whatever or it's a misquote um the problem from a lot of these social media platforms is that
they to do any kind of fact-checking at all uh is so burdensome that they would not be
able to stay in business um at the moment right so you can have technological solutions to this
where the open discourse would still happen there would be no censorship whatsoever right
or only to a marginal extent but um the open discourse would still happen it's just that
you would have artificial intelligence that was arguing for uh arguing on the side of truth right
to to keep truth at least somewhat in the mix instead of just an echo chamber of of misinformation
lies um the problem is if you can do that then you can set up the opposite right uh you could set up
bots that will argue any position which i think is um a more substantial danger than censorship
personally but like um other proposed solutions i i think that the platforms can do more in terms of
at least slowing the velocity of the mob like if you can see if you can see the mob forming
and make some effort to disperse it or make some effort to protect against it a lot of it's just
going to come in the form of norms and i think a lot of those norms are going to be in terms of
people protecting their own identity more like i can't imagine starting out on the internet today
as opposed to uh like late 90s when i first got on the internet and maintaining a persistent
identity like i have now that where like doxing me is not you know not even remotely difficult
but i also live my life not putting anything on the internet that i wouldn't want read in court
so i i think that that kind of norm is gonna probably come up a lot more and i i think that
that's a chilling effect of a chilling effect of the cancel mobs right um i would hope that to some
extent people will start changing their own behaviors to prevent misinformation but i
i think that has to start with better education and better critical thinking and i i just don't
know how you how you get that to happen because it feels like we've been on a backwards track
at least in america for the last couple decades i i actually strongly agree with you on
on the the whole better education kind of thing the whole raising the sanity waterline thing would
solve so many problems yeah it's just hard to do it's hard to do yeah i i don't know i i think
automated tools are probably gonna come around i know twitter's been doing twitter's been doing
a lot more to try to do its part to not be a toxic cesspit um they don't do enough but but
they've been they've been starting to try um google's been starting to try starting to to just
be like okay we we do have some responsibility for our algorithm uh and to not just put out an
algorithm that that will push people in whatever direction we'll we'll get the most engagement
right i think that's that's one things that a lot of social media companies have been doing
that's been incredibly toxic um yeah it's promoting engagement they built these yeah they
well they built these algorithms and then it was just sort of the unintended consequences of that
because the most engaging thing is the thing that outrages you and sends you on a on a crazy rant
the most engaging thing is getting triggered yeah um and and a lot of it is just you know
these seductive lies being told that that you are special and the only reason you didn't make it
or the only reason you don't have a perfectly fulfilling life is that someone took it away from
you and you know how dare they i think that for a lot of people especially maybe not necessarily my
age but younger um growing up in the world that they're growing up into uh a lot of that there's
a lot of attempt to take this disillusionment and turn it into um an oppression fantasy yeah
in some sense if something's not fair it's uh it's somebody's fault yeah if something's not fair
it's somebody's fault and you know this this is this is not about you this is you've you've been
wronged and it's you should hate people because that's you know it and and then it feels good to
hate people i know some people don't feel that way like i've gotten pushback on that when i say
it like sometimes it feels good to just so as feel that as someone who is very very much into
revenge fiction hate can feel awesome especially when you get to you know you see that hate fulfilled
by having the the objects that the people that wronged you destroyed for it so i i mean like
anyone who who says that uh hate doesn't feel good i mean like i i don't have hate in my real life
i don't have the i i'm the kind of person who doesn't have the the want or temperament for that
but uh i mean if anyone says oh no that's a terrible thing they've never seen and enjoyed
john wick exactly right not to generalize for fictional evidence but you want to see people
who killed his dog die exactly so this isn't generalizing like truth from fictional evidence
this is just generalizing like an emotion or not generalizing this is internalized this is
synthesizing an emotion that you don't have to go through it yourself but like the only thing
that makes his dog being murdered in the beginning of that movie okay is how many people die because
of it yes right yeah and like that feels great um it's uh yeah i i that was my sidebar there
just to relate that i yeah so i think i think that the algorithms cause a lot of this problem
and then the base structures aside from the algorithms also cause a lot of these problems
and that changing the platforms would help a lot with with various different aspects of of
these structural problems um which includes twitter mobs and includes just disinformation
campaigns and um real harm that's being done to people uh the problem is do you think it it
depends i think in to some extent on altruism yeah i was i was about to say do you think that
principles can count as a structural change like a a principle to uh to not um attack someone's
family i i mean i want to say even the mob uh i don't know if this is actually true if this is
just hollywood uh stuff that i seen in movies but even the mob has rules against attacking the family
members of people in in rival gangs right like there are some principles that we can hold each other
to and if that was really codified deep into uh a society's cultural dna that is that not a systemic
change or are you talking specifically about no i i think it can be no i i think it can be i think
it's just way way more difficult um i i guess the way i see it is that there's this meme of not
attacking or this norm that you need to install and i if if it were easy to install norms into a
society that's like already running and doing its own thing i think you'd see that a lot more and i
think historically when new ideas and new norms have been installed into society it's been always
accompanied by uh by bloodshed of one kind or another right like i just i think about revolutions
and how rare it is to get one that's even relatively bloodless um i don't know i think this
i think this is one of the reasons i feel strongly about some of the principles
needing to be stuck to because they are hard to both instill and uh to keep around afterwards but
it's much harder to instill them in the first place so i don't want to see them destroyed
and and so i worry maybe over much like maybe some some level of of greater change is needed
yeah i i don't know i don't have i don't have a good answer to that i from my perspective i'm i'm
i'm worried about a lot of the same things i'm worried about a destruction of norms i just
and god talking about destruction of norms if the last four years haven't been just a bloodbath of
norms right that most of my worry about the destruction of norms comes from
the right rather than the left uh and i think a lot of you know a lot of when we talk about
harper's letter it seems to me to be directed at the left specifically because a lot of it seems
like it's a defense of um of some people who are in institutions that are just being protected
because they've been there i guess i don't know i i i see a lot of the a lot of the cancel culture
i i am sympathetic to it as is coming out of this place of people who have not previously been able
to um air their grievances or who have been able to air their grievances but just no one listens
and nothing happens you know um like the me too stuff i think that's on balance been good i think
a lot of people got caught up in that that did not deserve it and it started in a good place
it started in a good place and i think you know bill cosby got cancelled right yeah he did get
and i mean i think that's that's one that you mean sent to jail for rape yeah well but i mean like
this might not have happened without the mob fine like this was like his misconduct if you
want to call it that was an open secret for if not decades at least years before fuck all got
done about it and it wasn't until this thing sort of took off online that enough traction
got underneath it to finally bring this down right yeah and i think that's been that's been
a way for the lot of a lot of these cases and i think people do get they get overzealous and then
they they enjoy taking down powerful people who need to be taken down and then they keep looking
for targets i think that is that has been the case for every movement ever that they you know
it is a very rare movement that has accomplished their goal and then just shut down and said hey
we did our part you know you start with Louis 14 and you keep going until you get to you
to yeah to make it perfectly clear i wasn't like endorsing cancel culture i was just bringing up
like a yeah i the i always like finding just like the contrary example of like well look here's
here's a good outcome of it um and harvey once i deserve that shit like a motherfucker right yeah
and and this yeah no there are a lot of people who you know a lot of it had to be in the court of
public opinion because the i mean the actual courts take more than you know four witnesses right
of separate events that are that are yours apart like to actually know i mean the standards of
proof in court are higher and i think especially for public opinion they should be a little lower
i don't think they should be so low as they are now but i i don't know i think i think having
a reckoning for some of these people has been a good thing and i think to some extent when you
have people like jk Rowling who who are talking shit basically i think it'd be good for it to
be the norm to at least have a little bit more empathy for other people than she has shown you
know and and that that is my ideal outcome i don't think that's a real outcome i think a lot of
people are just going to be quiet when they think things and i don't know maybe that maybe
that some good will come out of that of people just like not saying their bigoted stuff that they
think like that might be good for uh for that to be the norm um but but it's hard it's hard to to
not see that chilling effect on speech and be a little worried i i think i think i do agree with
that i i think i see that and agree with it but i don't know at the same time it's just like i'm so
