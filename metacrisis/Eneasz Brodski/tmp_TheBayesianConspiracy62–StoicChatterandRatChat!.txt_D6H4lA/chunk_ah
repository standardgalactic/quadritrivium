people who are trying to impose their will just by being strong uh what about uh everyone gets
together and says we must all do these things for our common good and the problem with that is
always the free rider problem the one person who doesn't do anything still gets all the benefit
and uh when it comes down to it everyone can do that and if nothing gets done at all
so why is it that selfish individuals motivated you know for their own self-interest
still get together and manage to work as single organisms that benefit everyone in the end and
what the propose and which I think is I've seen echoed elsewhere too and which I really
like as a take is that nature or evolution azathoth came up with an incredible hack
which works really well being that we don't consider it work to admire people and praise them
like when we see someone really fucking awesome like Thor or Captain America or someone we really
admire now you're speaking my language yeah we want to go up to them and we were like dude you
are badass I want to hang around with you can I like buy you a drink or something or just like
you know I do it doesn't feel like work to praise people right you want to like praise people that
you really admire and likewise uh being admired like that is an amazing payment it feels really
good and so people will do things for the common good because it feels good to get that praise
and people don't consider it work to praise people because it feels good to do that
and that is just the hack that nature invented that uh social in this article they call it social
prestige in other articles I've heard it called um crap something similar but just the or status
prestige just the fact that admiration is how we pay people is what helps people work together
and which is also I think a reason we should try to focus a little more on in-person communities
because it's really easy to admire people in person face to face it's much harder to do it
over the internet well it's easy to scream into it's easy to say it and no one hears it right so
like you know we're talking about Yudkowski earlier you know Harris or some people with Peterson
you know they don't know that you exist they're they're glad that you exist and they're happy
that you like their stuff but like they don't hear your praise personally sometimes maybe whatever
but right you know you tell your friends you appreciate them that you like the stuff they do
but I yeah it pays them off they like it and you know you get to feel good about being able to
express how you feel is that what you're getting at yeah there's certain artists that I absolutely
love and who will never know that and I mean that's that's one of the shitty things about writing
is that you basically get no feedback ever you know you're like did people love this did it touch
anyone's life I don't know and that's not entirely true I have gotten a few emails and god I treasure
those so much because they are the best but for the most part you just have no idea and that's why
I think it'd be better for people to see each other in real space much more often because then you
can you know show that appreciation for each other and and build those bonds which I think is how
super organisms manage to exist and why it's sort of society is coming apart a bit at the seams
because we don't see each other in person nearly as much anymore and we cannot pay that same
praise to each other and get the payment of praise that we used to get if we're just interacting
online like a like on facebook or an upvote in reddit is not the same thing as someone coming
up to you like with an admiring look in their eye and being like dude that was really awesome what
you did last week or man thanks for helping with building that wall it's a great thing the lions
aren't eating our children right now that's true and the people who slack off they don't get that
praise so they you know there isn't that much of a free rider problem yeah sure they still get the
wall around their house but everyone's like yeah that's the fucking slacker that didn't do anything
screw him we're not giving him a beer and and so that the payment problem takes care of itself
I like that that's that's something to think about yeah it's a great article no that's not
cool I look forward to reading it makes a point about you know the mice came up with this great
idea in an old story that they they could stop the cat from eating them if someone would just
hang a bell over the mouse's neck or someone just hang a bell over the cat's neck and they
could hear it whenever it came up you know and then all of my slipped each other like yeah but
who's gonna put the bell on the cat's neck and no one wants to do that but as more as the cat
eats more and more mice and this becomes more of an issue maybe some young mouse with not much to
lose but really wanting all the glory and potential hot mouse pussy that comes with being the guy who
hung the bell on the cat is going to take that risk because you know pull it off maybe be the hero
probably get eaten but maybe be the hero yeah all right I like it yeah so that was that was my
article we'll link it on the the show love it yeah for sure not my personal article my article that
I enjoyed your pick yes you got it your your rationality chat yeah chatter oh I should totally
also mention the author of that thing as we speak about praise that was posted on ribbon on ribbon
farm by Kevin Simler Kevin you wrote a great article why don't know that name
he had to beat up two burglars that were trying to rob his house while he was left
home alone on Christmas one year he was just a kid at the time so they oh yeah that rings a bell
I don't know that's that was Kevin McAllister damn it from home alone which reminds me Donald
Trump was in the second home alone movie very briefly I remember did you hear a story Daniels
described their sexual encounter I can't wait to hear it she so you know she's getting sick and
tired of people just constantly focusing on the sex part and someone asks her so like what did
what did you and Donald do she's like well oh she spanked him with a time magazine of this face or
the not a maximum time what with a magazine of this face on it right well I mean in this particular
interview she was like well I asked him you know do you want to act out one of my movies because
that's what most people want to do is like no you probably act out your movies all the time
let's act out one of my movies and so she went up to him and she said hey mister where can I find
the the room or whatever Kevin's line was you know and he leaned over me and he said you just go
down that hallway take your second door on the left then he turned around and walked away and I never
saw him again that's amazing yeah and that was his big sexual fantasy with Stormy Daniels wow
okay well I'm glad I know that um I I feel bad for not remembering Kevin similar was the co-author
of The Elephant in the Brain oh that's Kevin that's Kevin similar that's the one fucking A
that was the uh yeah that was him well he's he's a good writer of things cool well I'm glad to hear
that he's writing stuff and and doing I liked The Elephant in the Brain sorry hands are Robin
a lot more than like Robin's uh OG writing mm-hmm Robin is kind of inaccessible to me he it's dense
it's hard and it doesn't energetically bridge that inferential distance that Utkowski does
that said it's full of awesome content but you have to be like you know you have to have you
have the sense that you have to be as smart as Robin to enjoy it and I don't have that so like
I or you need someone who's really good at communicating like Kevin similar yeah
it was a good team yeah um so sweet all right cool shall we thank people yes cool first of all
