and I think the fact that I can plausibly imagine her
or another teacher saying it that way
they're making it hard on the kids who want to be here
kind of illustrates your whole point that yeah they
they don't want to be here they're making things hard on
on everybody else as a result and that's bringing down the whole system
a lot.
And I would like for teachers to get more involved in their
kids lives and actually you know want to be involved with the kids
and can be a force for social good when there is a breakdown
in the society that kids are creating.
Yeah and anecdotally because they do try to keep themselves separate
you don't want to get mixed up in the kids shit you know
yeah but once you're part of that society and they can look to you as a
normal person you don't feel as bad getting involved in their lives it's
not like these are the wards that are in my charge
that the parents have you know entrusted me with ensuring their safety
it's like these are my friends my short dumb friends but
my friends nonetheless and so I will get involved and help.
Yeah and occasionally their teachers should do that sort of thing and it's
heroic and it's awesome but it shouldn't be
the odd heroic incident it should be all the time I see that
and you know part of the problem too is you know I'm not one of those like
small classrooms are better but yet when it's 30 to 1 and you as a teacher
know the names of 200 students because that's how many teach a day because
they're all running through your classes all the time
you know you don't have the time to know their
life story and help them with every little thing and get rid of their bullies
and that sort of thing but I can't say anecdotally
and this probably speaks to the point of volunteering to go to school
when I went to community college before I went to CSU and at both of those and
it's I think even more so at community college because
there is a much higher percentage of population there who didn't come right
out of high school I went there because it was
like a third the price for the same education and people you know you don't
get the same esteemed credentials but you get
the same textbooks and that's my pitch for community
college you know if your if your goal is to learn you get it for a third of the
price and you can use those credits at a
university and get your you know your bachelors or whatever
I am more and more under the opinion that college isn't there for what you
learn it's for the connections you make which is why you probably want to go
the more expensive ones and for the credentials
well I am for the credentials but I mean you can put your first two years in community
college and then transfer but I if you're there for the
connections you make you want to go with the where the most valuable
connections are going to be that could be because you learn the same stuff in
either way but the people that you're around and that you form bonds with
are different and that is that is one thing I didn't know about college that
I wish I would have known like I stayed in my room and I did
studying and stuff and what I should have been doing is
well for the one semester that I was actually doing college what I should
have been doing is being out there and making connections with people
well for what it's worth I didn't make any friends in college either I made like
two friends that I'm still in touch with and
I also don't do what I studied at CSU so I can I can support the idea that my
lack of networking didn't do anything for me but
you know if your goal is to get a job in Denver
you know going to Harvard you're not going to make a lot of friends there
who probably can get your job in Denver but maybe some well if you go to
Harvard you're not the kind of person who
needs to get a job you're the kind of person who needs to know people in
high political offices and in the high up in the business world because you are
part of the ruling class well I'll pull the brakes on that before
I make one other point and just point out that my significant other went to
Columbia okay and you know is the kind of person
who wants a job and you know isn't this you know high
salon of society person she went there because on an
on a lark she applied there she got turned down from CSU for her master's
degree probably because CSU wants to get out of state people because they pay
twice as much and they do it under the guise of like oh we
want to bring new ideas in or whatever but it's really probably about the money
and Columbia said yes so it became really cynical
no I think that's I think it's it'd be weirdly rosy eyed of me not to
acknowledge that yeah money probably has something to do with it
probably has almost everything to do with it it's not explicitly everything
other than the fact they can't say it right so they have to do just enough of
beyond you know to make paying lip service not seem like a complete
you know farce but anyway Rachel's not the person you're talking about sir
okay okay all right but when I went to uh especially at front range community
college in Fort Collins there weren't I don't remember any bullies
there are people there who came that's I love the feel of a school
of a of an academy style school play-doh ish where people are coming there
because they want to learn yeah there was none in college either when I went to
college yeah because that's what I mean there's probably you know jocks and
jerks whatever but I don't meet them at CSU either
but they're much more of like the you know I'm here and I'm 19 let's have fun
and much less of like I'm here to learn but I got a lot of that at front range
and and some of that at CSU but the the idea that they're they're there on
purpose that they're not there because they're forced to be
that really cut down on a lot of these problems and you know adults might try
and say I say adults like we're not old but uh the adults who run schools and
stuff might be like well that's because they're older and they're not going
through puberty or whatever but Paul Graham hits that in that essay pretty
well that you know hormones aren't this monster that turns you into you know
this this sad psychopath it's really the assholes that are surrounding you that
do that to you and I think he's absolutely right I mean no doubt I remember
having anger issues in my teens and stuff and that was probably something with
you know your body's changing and you know whatever but the voluntary aspects
did add a lot and I wonder what Zeke's thought would be to compare from his
primary education to his college education there and if that is really
just a maturity aspect or if they're more mature because they can afford to be
because there's less bullies than to guard against although there is something
to be said for the fact that maybe does train people to punch the clock and
keep a shitty job that's just as bad as high school oh yeah that part is still
definitely on the table yeah um you know and at work you have bullies off I mean
you know less overt I don't get beat up at my job I don't even really get bullied
but um but back to your jobs yeah that's true but I do work with somebody who
has been bullied at his job considerably to the point where uh no
network listens to this no one will put it together because I know the names of
like half my co-workers on my floor and there's like a hundred so no one knows
what I'm talking about they went to HR to report this person because it's been
going on for months and they're like you know I get anxious when I get up from
my desk enough to walk by their desk to get to the door and I'm like that is
exactly the time you should be going to HR and having them step in and do stuff
because you're describing you know workplace harassment you can't you
can't do you can't be at work without feeling uncomfortable that's fucking
insane so it happens and you know maybe the fact that maybe he was bullied in
school and that's why he's able to put off you know complaining to the teachers
for almost a year at this place and I put that in quotes uh guys a great guy he
did the right thing yeah the domestication aspect you know maybe also keeps you
from shutting down at the first sign of trouble you know you can just put up and
shut up and do your things so we can't we can't ignore the domestication aspect
of it but as far as making it suck a little less there's still ways to do
so yeah what did you if you did it I might have been skimming the um the other
feedback um the first part of Zeke's question you know what do you imagine
they would do the kids didn't want to go to school did you touch more on that
no I mean I think it would be better for the kids that are in school
for the ones that aren't then I there's just this whole issue where I don't know
what to do with because they don't want to go to school yeah and they probably
don't want to be productive members of society either but even if they did but
there's not enough low level jobs for them to all stay busy right at the same time
and they're not doing anyone any favors by being at school so if they're gonna you know
be at home and be I'm sorry to put words in your mouth you tell me if I'm putting the
wrong ones in there but I imagine it's like if they're not going to be productive and
helpful at school let them be unproductive and unhelpful at home away from everybody
at the very at the very worst right so like you know at the very at the end of the day
what what happens you stay unproductive and unhelpful and the rest of us get to flourish
you weren't going to go anywhere anyway you're a bully don't get me wrong bullies turn around
life with caveats etc but for the person going to school like I can't wait to be a dick today
let them not go to school that day and see how well everyone else turns out yeah and I yes I
think of there are quite a few countries where going to school is viewed as a privilege and
they're very poor countries and the schools they're generally suck and yet they don't have these
these behavioral problems the kids that do go to those schools are happy to be there
because they know it's their way out of being you know maybe it's it's it's what our parents
our parents people my age ish told me call you know school and college would be it's your way
to like actually get your life good you need to do well and you know why do you have to go to school
Stephen because it sucks so much well you have to go because it's your door ready college and
let's you have a better life than we had and so but for many people in the world that's actually
true and it feels I don't know it also feels shitty to say that because then what we're dooming
those people that drop out of school to life and poverty or something and I I don't know I don't
have an answer that I can't be responsible for everyone especially the people that are shitty
you know imagine if more Elon musks came around because they're bullied less in school and their
spirits weren't broken how much faster the world would be saved and then all the all the bully
problems would also be solved we can bring the singularity on faster if there were fewer bullies
I'm not sure how true that is it's getting late speaking of Elon musk and saving the world
do you want to touch on that AI assistant the google one yeah which was not Elon musk but no but
it's saving the world style stuff yeah okay maybe maybe is it I don't know I don't know where you
want to go with this you just sent me the video I did no we'll post this video as well but it's
basically of a google voice assistant type thing where you tell your you tell your computer hey
make me a haircut get me an appointment for a haircut Saturday between 10 and 12 and this this
assistant just calls up a haircutting place near you and with a completely natural sounding human
voice is like hi I'd like to book a a haircutting appointment for my client and it likes stutters
and says um and stuff and sounds just like a human you know and the person on the other line went and
took down the information and thought that there was a person they were talking to and the the person
doing the demo on stage got a haircutting appointment booked for them and it was really
awesome because it sounded just like a normal person yeah the you know there's the occasional
like small pause where they'd be like you know what time or you know I'm sorry we're booked at one
okay I'm good anytime between 10 and 2 yeah so uh what did you think about this google assistant
thing my thought was is that I wish I had prepped by watching prepped for this question by watching
like the announcement for Siri when Apple first announced that because I don't know if they went
way above and beyond to what Siri could do and 10 years later however long it's been it still
sucks right I still often can't get it to call the person I want to call which I mean don't be
wrong that's a really cool problem to have that my robot won't you know make my phone call immediately
for me so I can you know talk to somebody a thousand miles away in a second like you know that's
not not to bitch on like that level of problem but um I'm curious if they oversold it so like if
this thing works as advertised that's fucking insane yeah and though on google it's gonna roll
out for free and everybody who wants one can have one did you hear what happened almost immediately
afterwards nope so there was a bit of a backlash about people being like this is kind of creepy
and unethical and we we don't want this to go like almost the next day like walked it back I was like
oh no we would we would never use this to just trick people into thinking about talking to a human
we'd always say hi this is google assistant or something like that and I was like I don't know
what do you think about that because on the one hand I don't see why it matters as a user of
google assistant I'm like if you think you're talking to human that's great but on the other hand
if I was when I when I call and I um you know get those those robo answering
menus that you got to push your buttons through and like say this if you want this I don't have
any consideration at all for the computer because I know it's not a person and I can just be annoyed
at it and and be jerky to it basically it doesn't matter whereas if there's a human on the other
line then right away there's a level of compassion and empathy that I feel I guess I believe the word
Vivian used for it was emotional labor when I have another human on the line I put forward
emotional labor to help make them comfortable and to work with them in a level that I never would
with a computer and so I kind of feel like I have done that labor for nothing if it's a computer on
the other end at the very least you fostered the kind of person that you want to be to actual
people so it's not necessarily wasted effort it's just like exercise right rather than actually
lifting something yeah um but I mean my thought was sort of that but I took it the other direction
in that like you know if I'm making the hair appointment or making an appointment for a haircut
or rather um if I'm taking the appointment for the haircut the person who calls me
isn't really a person they're they're like as far as I'm concerned they're they're a potential
customer do you want this or not when do you know here's our availability when do you want to come
in it's not it's not like oh my god you're steven you're I want to talk to you what's your life
