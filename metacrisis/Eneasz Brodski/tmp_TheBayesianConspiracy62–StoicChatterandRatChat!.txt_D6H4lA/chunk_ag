story it's like no fuck it you're here to get your haircut let's get your haircut and when you go
to you know you're making the appointment they're doing that's the same thing in reverse they're
not a person they're a person they're they're a tool for you to get a haircut or to get the first
steps to getting one set up yeah um don't get wrong service people are people I've been in service
but what I'm saying is that it's like you know you go to you go to the coffee shop the person at
the counter is a person that you should care about but right then there are means to coffee
and I don't really know how how useful it would be I don't I don't think it'd be bad to say this is
a google assistant I'm scheduling a appointment for Stephen Zuber and I mean what if it wasn't a
google assistant what if it was my assistant Stephen yeah he's basically being a tool anyway right
just a tool to get me a haircutting appointment and if I was a full-time assistant I might call
saying this is Stephen calling for I'm calling on behalf of Enya she's getting him a haircut
appointment maybe I want my robot to say the same thing right I mean it would be
an identical interaction from from their perspective because they don't they don't care
they're just like when are you coming in when are we booked on the other hand I would still feel
a little cheated if I was nice to a computer so maybe that is the way to say it is like
I'm calling for Stephen yeah or I'm a robot calling for Stephen is maybe the idea is that
you're not wasting emotional labor yeah but then at the same time too google assistant is not going
to call clearly having a bad day and needing someone to talk to right so like you don't have to
any emotional labor other than like not shouting at them and you're presumably not going to do that
at the real human anyway dude it's the weirdest thing my uh the contractor that put in my air
conditioning and my new furnace like I was really fucking annoyed with him because the dude as far
as I can tell is not entirely stable and so whenever I called he would be like yeah okay I can come
and I can do that for you let's see here all right here's my schedule man it's been a really just a
busy week I got so much going on and he would chat with me for like five or ten minutes about
nothing randomly going places he once was like yeah I think I think we do need to spend more money
on the military because we don't have enough submarines we need more submarines man and I was
like dude you're you literally have some sort of weird mental issues but and I was unhappy at the
time I was like I just want someone to get in here and fucking put an air conditioner in my house
why am I doing this but now I look back on that as like man remember that weird dude that put in my
air conditioner who thinks we need more submarines that's hilarious yeah he's gonna stick out in my
memory so that guy clearly had no filter that's weird I I mean I don't I'm I'm paused because I
really know what to say there like he's violating the expectation of the of the contract that you
guys have with that conversation it's like I'm not I'm not calling to talk to you forgive me I'm
not trying I'm not talking to you as a friend or even somebody that you know I if if at all possible
I'd avoid talking to you all together if I could do this online I would yeah but you take appointments
over the phone so here we are right I've speaking of haircuts in this example I've gotten haircuts
from people and they'll tell me about like problems with their kids at school and problems with you
know their neighborhood in their house and I'm just like man you know it's hot out right like
what am I supposed to say it's like and I do you know I make I make I think I do a good job I like
to talk and I like to I like to engage that kind of conversation and be friendly but at the same
time one or two times I got kind of like personal and I'm just like you know holy shit like do you
remember my name like are you just desperate to talk to this about somebody and in that case I'm
happy to listen but if I was having a rough day and I'm just like trying to get something done
it's like man I I'm not wanting to hear about this right now and the robot will never try and
you know badger you if this person ooh I imagine the next step for this if it's not rolling out
at the same time would be setting up google assistant for your like your own personal business
right yeah or me even for yourself it's only gonna be a few months until it's your google assistant
calling the haircutting places google assistant and the two assistants talk to each other and that
sounds ideal then no human ever has to interact with another human I am finding myself much more
enjoying like talking and hanging out with people and it's been like in the last 10 years and in
the coming but then I have for what I thought like in high school I was a very shy probably from
my lightly bullied upbringing but like I remember like the first person I didn't really like I'd
never been introduced to that like I talked to it was like my second it may be not the first but
I remember like this is a big moment for me I talked to somebody who sat next to me in class
my second semester of senior year of high school oh wow and like I didn't know who this person was
before I talked to them and that wasn't like the first time but I remember being a watershed moment
for me as a developing person yeah like that's where I'm at that's where I'm coming from yeah
and so from that I love talking to people I love going to meetups and meeting my all the people
that I know and I like doing this and I really enjoy my social time which isn't something I would
have predicted for myself all that said I would love to make it super voluntary to where I like
I don't call this because of my haircuts I don't know who does but if I was that kind of person
or other other services man letting my robot talk to the robot and let leaving both of us
time to you know browse right out on our phones instead that sounds great so I could I don't know
I don't think this will be the degradation of society because this is just for like simple
things this isn't for like you know replacing conversation or replacing friendships it's just
for weeding out the tedium and I think that's the whole point of computers and robots right
but I don't know maybe the tedium wouldn't be as tedious if we connected with people a little more
so I would not convinced no no I was just thinking of different examples so like
I was coming back from Fort Collins a couple weeks ago and I swung through uh McDonald's
because I'd used the restroom we went inside and because it's going down the interstate
and you can order I haven't been in one in years I don't know when these came up but I ordered
at a kiosk I pressed buttons on them on a big you know tablet that was as tall as I was to place
my order yeah and the only time I had to talk to somebody was when they handed me a thing I said
thank you very much I thought that was actually pretty nice yeah because I mean people hate running
cash registers people probably don't like trying to teach talk to the person at the cash register
like a person plus I don't know if you ever worked a dull mind-numbing service industry job but well
it I mean a little bit for about two weeks asking supers yeah it wears you out right away right
and like when you're on the clock there like four hours into your shift someone asks you like hey
Inyash what's the capital of Wyoming and you're like I what what what are you even talking about
like you can't draw basic facts you can't think you're you're just you're completely turned off
right so like for many in many in my personal experience from doing some of the stuff for
years was like you're not I'm not really a person when I'm doing that job I'm just monotonously
doing that job and trying to engage a person is exhausting that's the worst part of it so like
I don't know if you know there are a lot of people who enjoy that sort of thing a lot of people you
know love you know like my company where I work they have a large customer service department
because we have lots of customers and those people probably a lot of them don't like it
because customer service sucks but some of them do you're helping people figure their stuff out
and at the end of the day you get to brighten their day by helping them helping them have solved a
problem but that's also like the only thing that they're doing you're not distracting them from
like trying to do the other five things to being paid nine dollars an hour to do right so I don't
really know what point I'm making with this other than I do think that I don't see this being a bad
thing I'm actually really looking forward to it I was just I was slightly surprised by how negative
the reaction was and how quick I had not expected that because I also when I first saw was like
that's kind of cool what other negative reactions were there like other than the fact that that was
it that was like this is this is a lying to people or something you can't do that I I don't think
it would be nice to say I you know if the robot said I'm Stephen I'm calling for an appointment
because that is lying right I am a human I am totally a human I'm fully human check out all
my legs and stuff isn't there a subreddit I'm totally a human or something something like that
not robot yeah totally not robots but like I think we kind of talked about at the end of the day
you're when you're making an appointment or you're taking one you're not a person neither of you are
you're just you're economic you're doing a job of productivity yeah you know one downside could be
that this could replace some jobs and that's a downside you know there are some people whose
jobs it is probably to do things just like this I think anyone rich enough to afford a personal
assistant is going to want the the actual of having the esteem of a personal assistant yeah but
the actual a human would still be better than a machine to have as a personal assistant like this
is this this is technology that will only be used by people who do not currently have personal
assistants so no one would be put out of a job oh I meant like the hair the person taking the
appointment at the hair place oh granted they probably cut hair too but like bigger companies
you know if you're if you're writing a lot of calls or something you might that might be a full
time job you know we probably could have staffed one less person at the pizzeria worked at through
college if there wasn't somebody having to answer phones because that person would also do other
stuff but since there was a lot as we didn't take online orders because it was mom pop shop and they
liked to be you know in the 1990s they did it all over the phone so if that could also be done
with a robot there would probably be one less person on staff so whatever that means that's
an externality but that's just progress and that's we're gonna lose more and more jobs until
either we all starve death in the streets or our raiding the razor wire compounds of the
middle of the trillionaires or something else happens yeah so that's that's just gonna happen
in the meantime and I think my vote is enjoy your robot and enjoy not having to talk to people as
much as possible excellent I do have one other thing let's sort of a rat chat thingy okay oh
yes okay uh so the uh one of our friends recently posted on facebook the uh her problem with family
movies that every family movie starts out with a young person is in an abusive family that won't
let them listen to music or won't let them marry the person they want to marry or something
so young person leaves the abusive family and gets to go and be an individual and do their thing
and the abusive family eventually says look we'll let you come back into our family and
they can have this one thing and the young person goes okay that's great and so they've won that one
little battle and they come right back to the abusive family and everything is great forever
and that's just a horrible moral qualifier family movie they mean movies about families
or like family movies like movies a whole family can get behind and watch movie whole family can
get behind and watch I can't think of a single movie that follows that premise other than like
Cinderella and she doesn't go back to the family does she the the ones that were brought up were
Coco and Brave oh I don't see either of those okay okay so that's fine I'm sure it's I'll take that
point as given but I can't I didn't know this was a common trope I don't I don't know how it's
moderately common hold on a second I only see superhero movies so that is not the case in any
super well let me go through them all really quick nope none okay with a vague except oh wait
shit no that doesn't count Thor 1 doesn't count his family wasn't abusive he was being a dick
okay all right hold on can you give me just one second yeah do you think all right while
Enos browses Facebook and succumbs to his life in the computer um I will point out my two ratchats
which are super ripoff I'm gonna just I'll link to them in this uh Scott Alexander's review for
12 rules of life by Jordan Peterson and um Paul Graham's uh why nerds are unpopular
which already made notes to include in the uh description here but the Paul Graham one was
one that Zeke wrote in about and uh I read that this week and if you're a fast reader it'll probably
take 15 minutes uh Zeke which is the time that Zeke quoted me if you're me it'll take you almost
an hour so um I don't know what my problem is I read really slow so all right well did you find
it I did all right okay her summary is family movie young person my family is trying to violate my
autonomy forcing me into a marriage forbidding me from enjoying music etc I will rebel young
person's rebellion leads to exciting but stressful adventure young person I miss my family I was wrong
to rebel now that I realize I love my family more than anything I will sacrifice my autonomy and be
a good family member family now that you've accepted our dominance over you we've conveniently
learned our lesson about letting you be your own person you may play music or choose your own spouse
or whatever happy ending so I am thinking of something that vaguely follows the trope I saw
how to train your dragon when it was new so I have no idea how long ago that was a long time
and from what I remember the dad's name on that he was this big hulking figure played by Leonidas
what was the actor's name um Russell Crowe no uh it was uh Drard Butler oh you're right there yeah
yeah sorry I was nope it's very rare that I get to call somebody out on an actor because I'm really
bad at knowing non-aventures so anyway so Leonidas was you know big powerful voice his son's name
was hiccup and the whole thing was you know hiccup was a small puny kid they're all Vikings and he's
giving them a hard time then he goes off and finds and tames this super badass dragon and then he's
popular and then cool stuff happens in the movie it's actually kind of fun I should probably
rewatch it I also haven't seen the Incredibles speaking of kids movies I need to watch Incredibles
was really good that's the unanimous thing I've heard I haven't avoided it I just never got around
to it and now the sequel's coming out 11 years later and it's about time so yeah the Incredibles
definitely does not follow that trope because that one's not about a young person it's more about
the dad than anything so we'll have to ask our friend uh if how to train your dragon follows
this recipe so maybe the closest I have but if it sounds like what what they were describing
they go off and have their adventure and self actualize a little bit and then they come back
and the family's also grown and learns to accept them it's not like they're going back and putting
back on the shackles right yeah they're just saying hey you got you know I'm better now and I've
shown that I could do without you and they're like you know what you're right but would you
deign to be with us again and we'll treat you like a person so that sounds like a good outcome
so what was their what was their issue here well uh their issue was that the young person has to
start believing they're not entitled to autonomy and then come um before the before the family
uh before the family starts coming around to the fact that maybe they are like the young person
has to be like uh my autonomy wasn't that great because I miss you guys and only then does the
family start thinking well maybe we can give you a little bit maybe I should see one of these
other movies but I do like the heavy chest and autonomy because I know that this this was a
previous guest and I I think it was Shelly she said the message is that uh a good person lets
their family own them but a good family is a little nicer about how they own their people
and and I mean my thought on that was that yeah I mean that's true and that's a great way of putting
it but uh you know the thing is a lot of people don't think of because this person that we had on
as a guest is very much into the individualism and autonomy you know but a lot of people don't
think that way about humans they think more about as collections of people you know and so the family
unit is is more like a single organism and like one one person is really upset that's like an
organ is failing right and the person leaves the family and then the whole the whole organism is
hurting and it's a story about how the organism comes back and learns to to be healed to reincorporate
the organ and everyone is one again and together and happy because there was something out of
whack with the body before and now the body is fixed and that's why it's a happy ending and our
friend just very much disagrees with this sort of issue on very personal very personal grounds
but it reminded me of this fantastic rationalist article on ribbon farm that I read a while ago
so I went and reread it and that is my rat pick for this week or my rat chat topic the name of the
article is minimum viable superorganism and it talks a bit about superorganisms like the Catholic
church and the US military and like the amazing things that they can do when people all work together
we did we this this was shelly we had her on episode 34 and maybe another at some point I can't
remember that sounds right who knows yeah anyway so the we talked about I think I'm sure autonomy
came up at some point that episode because that's something that I that she talks about a lot and
I think it's she has a really powerful take on it I think it's interesting and I really admire it
yeah I like shelly and like her viewpoints totally but the the minimum viable superorganism
basically said we can do these amazing things when we work as a single organism and how how
does this happen let us investigate how this works and so they they thought do people coordinate
because of like a strong man forcing everyone to work together that doesn't really work in
fact one of the first um ways that super organisms you know got together was to overthrow tyrants
