maybe it's because he took out a security guard prior to that maybe that's what I was thinking yeah
I'm probably wrong on that don't quote me and please don't put it as a meme on the internet
that's okay there's one other thing I wanted to talk about you you did want to know like
what caused people to get offended I think I have an idea of what causes people to get offended what
I'm curious about is like what that feels like from the inside because I'm pretty sure I've been
offended so this isn't one of those like black boxes right but I'm curious like what the obligation
is once one declares offense what someone else has to do or like I guess really how we unpack
that whole thing and we can taboo offense if we get bogged down on it so offense yeah can we
what what to me I guess being offended means that like I found what you said to be emotionally
repellent yeah is that fair or maybe what you said or did so like your middle finger isn't
isn't something that you said but I think not just emotionally repellent but also an attack upon
my person or or a group that I identify with I think that is personally injurious because I can
find something offensive that's about like black people jokes that's true I find that offensive
my go-to example is like you know some religious people and I'm not gonna say all religious people
because I'm not gonna pay with a wide brush some religious people is that punching up or down I'm
not I don't care to look it depends on the religion so some some some christians in the united states
religious people are the overwhelming majority in the world so it's punch wrap well I'm not I
refuse to punch up I refuse to I refuse to throw punches which is my privilege which is why you
say some religious people actually it is but carry on yeah oh I find it I find to admit that but I
think that everyone has the privilege not to throw punches but in many cases whatever moving
pushing forward as he makes a fist and pushes it forward literally thank you there are religious
objections to like the existence of homosexuals so like if I'm a religious person and if I'm
an example of some religious people and I see two gay people holding hands in the park I am offended
by that yes but they're not obligated to change their behavior because I'm offended so I guess
does offense matter it does if you give a shit about what the other person thinks
so like but I mean it matters as a warning sign it's like if someone got offended then
you have noticed that they might do something to harm you well there's that but I mean like I could
be offended at an inclusive sleeping gesture or sleeping attack at white people or men or something
right but I'm not about to hurt anybody no it's just like it just hurts my feelings yeah but
if you get offended like that often enough you may do something like buy a tiki torch for target
which does hurt people for what it's worth I have no idea if Target actually sells tiki torches
I'm sure they got to it's a standard piece of lawn furniture I do know that tiki torch incorporated
or whatever said that we didn't mean just like we're not we didn't sell them for them to use it for
this reason I thought it was I thought it was a kind of a joke the first time I saw like people
walking with tiki torches yeah I thought it was a joke that they had to say that we didn't mean for
that to happen but there was an official statement released apparently so going back to a fence yes
refocus but someone needs to keep us rained in we can take turns yeah I'm gonna have to take turns
but I think that when someone is offended by something it speaks to their moral and emotional
stance and it's like a it's one of those so I thought I was talking to someone the other day
about like how we as social animals have to oh it's something I was editing sorry how we as
social animals have these responses that allow us to interact with each other and to understand how
we relate to each other and so when we say something offends us it challenges what we
what our stance is and how we observe the world and a lot of times when people say I am offended
by this thing it's the this thing contravenes how I feel the world should be so I think I can get
behind that definition but I guess what does that mean that like I'm supposed to do so like if
I'm holding hands with the guy in the park and somebody says that offends me you should stop I
could just say politely fuck you yeah or no thank you or whatever say that like they go up to you
in a park and they're like you should stop holding hands because that's offended to me and you just
look at them like they're like a homeless person you're like no thank you or I mean you could even
just do it you know I mean yeah however you want to do it but like you could also say like well
you're saying you're offended defend me or whatever let's just let's just get in a circle until one
of us runs out of breath but like if you said something or if I said something that offended you
and he said whoa Steven that that holocaust joke you just made was super insensitive I'm offended
I'd be like oh shit my bad yeah and I think that's appropriate among friends but like
I guess not on everything like like if I said I was offended at hypothetically a version of you
that used sweeping generalizations to say all men are rapists and I'm like hold on I'm offended
are you obligated to change your behavior because of that no right so but like
but what if it's like somebody you respect saying that like a friend so like I would
change I would stop telling you know racist jokes or something about offended people I was around
or people that I cared about like my friends or anybody because I don't talk racist jokes but
the only racist joke I tell is what do you call a what do you call a black person flying a plane
a pilot you racist as well wins before the punchline yes that's why I like that joke
actually it was in Robin Hansen's great book on the chapter on laughter in the elephant in the
brain nice and the whole point is that a court's danger but then safely moves back and that's why
it's funny so I guess yeah what is what is the appropriate response to offense I think it depends
because I think when people say I am offended by this thing they're depending on the social ties
in order to change your behavior so say we're going to use the random people in the park example
again I'm holding hands with my girlfriend in the park we're walking around this you know person
comes up to me and says that's really offensive and I would evaluate instantly because this is
what humans do I'd look at this person and say do I care what they think are they close enough
to me in my social circle to influence how I'm how people interact with me and do I have any
investment in their opinions or feelings the answer is no I'm going to say fuck you and keep
holding my girlfriend's hand and walk off so it's like a constant evaluation of like the social
standing between yourself and the other person as well as how much their emotions and feelings and
sensibilities mean to you and also a lot of times people uh a lot of times always people take into
account do I think that this person's offense is valid yeah like if if someone did get offended
because I was holding hands with a guy or something I don't care if it's my mom really I mean I'd
probably care a little bit because I like my mom I don't want to lose standing in her eyes I'm like
hey mom let's have a conversation now but um ultimately my first impulse is like I am not
going to apologize or change my behavior because I feel that your offense is invalid in this case
and I mean that's that's a tricky line because that's just dictated by social norms right
I think the other thing is like that depends on whether or not you stop too it's gonna
like how important is the thing that I'm doing that's offending them to me so if it's uh
um like having a relationship with someone you love versus eating a hot dog yeah sure or like
maybe eating a hot dog really seductively for a joke and someone's like hold on that's that's you
know you're making me uncomfortable for whatever reason or like you know what this round orthodox
Jewish guy or a vegan or vegan or like someone who knows what goes in those things everything
everything anyone with good taste so um wasn't Oscar Meyer everything but the squeal so um including
the hooves and snout and stuff like that brain eyes uh that aside um as somebody who's eating
hot dogs I'm okay owning that we all feel so like ready to eat hot dogs one person's one person's
listening to this and they're just like looking at the hot dog that they're about taking another bite
of them they're like fuck me to you no judgment I've eaten hot dogs somewhat recently probably
anyway um like if you don't care about like how funny that joke was or something that you're not
going to stand on principle and tell the person to fuck off so like you're weighing a lot of factors
but um like so like you said you wouldn't stop if I said I was offended at uh excuse me the hypothetical
you wouldn't stop making sweeping generalizations about men if I said I was offended about that
even if we're friends so you like your stance on how important it is to make sweeping generalizations
is more important than like not offending me slash possibly losing my friendship I think it's the
hypothetical me that's a bitch right and that's because I honestly don't know what kind of stuff
you post on facebook so um so I tend to preface things as has been obvious through the majority
of this discussion with I feel and I statements so I'm very unlikely to be like well all men are
fucking stupid sure or whatever but so that's why I'm having a hard time being like yeah because
so if you were like all you said like I did this a while ago remember that wonder woman article
uh probably so I posted a thing from I don't remember who's huff post or something about
um how it said dudes on the internet are getting offended by the alumna draft houses
female only wonder woman viewing or something like that yeah I remember that one
and I posted it because I was like yeah there are some people on the internet that are getting
really pissed off about this and I think it's fucking hilarious and other people took it to mean
all men right because I was like I'm a dude on the internet by other people you mean me yeah I was
trying to be nice yeah it's okay before we make this personal I think I can quickly paraphrase
both sides you were saying well hey I think it's a great idea why you're saying I don't like it yeah
and so that's why I like sweeping generalizations just in general you're because you you immediately
you're guaranteed to paint people in the wrong box and that particular one was kind of tricky
because it was like you didn't write the headline no I didn't view the headline as all men because
it didn't say all men are being stupid on the internet it was I read it as there's some dudes
on the internet who being jerks and I thought it was hilarious so I shared it um but other people
took it as all men are evil and no and that one seems like a muddier example yeah it was if you if
you wrote it and you use the word all then it'd be much clearer case so like um maybe I could pick
a better different example so like I know vegetarians and vegans who are probably offended when I eat
meat and I don't eat that much to be clear that doesn't really matter I eat less than I used to
I was vegetarian for a few years I eat meat very much before that I was a vegetarian for like four
years and fell off the wagon and I've been eating much less meat than I historically did for the
last several years and I'm kind of like in the camp of like I'm doing better than I was so it's
better for the world etc but um if I got to lunch with somebody and they order tofu plate I order
the chicken one um they're probably offended by my order but like I've I've not yet met a vegan
or a vegetarian that's actually been offended by someone else eating meat near them oh I have a
story and I I think is it about the same person not the same person we were referencing earlier
okay um so I was in a class with a person and for the for a particular reason for that class
we were we'd go around the room and say whether we had any like medical or anything kind of things
going on and so some super personal what kind of class was this I'll tell you later okay but um it
was it was something where it was actually part and so I was my turn and I'm like well I'm intolerant
of meat it makes me very sick so I won't be eating meat and that's cool because I don't care
and this person sitting immediately next to me goes I'm also intolerant of meat because meat is
murder and I just kind of went head desk because I was like okay and then then this person went on
to say and because of that if you're eating meat I refuse to sit near you or talk with you
well I know the kind of people you're talking about and like you and to be fair and so I I'm
sorry I was pausing to let you talk dramatic there was a very dramatic pause and so later on I was
talking to this person we were sitting and not eating and talking and I had seen a recipe for
something that was um it was like stuffed bell peppers or something I thought it looked really
cool it was like it was during Halloween and so they were cut up cut up like little jack-o-lanterns
and so I showed this person the recipe and I'm like oh this is really cute we could do this with
like vegan food and they came to me two days later after not talking to me saying that because
there was chicken in the recipe how dare I I'm like I completely phrase that to be like we could
substitute this as a vegan meal for you but they found a defensive that I had shown them a recipe
that mentioned using chicken as an ingredient that just blows my fucking mind that was weird that's
one of those I'm participating I don't know this person but like those like professional victims
that they're going to find the smallest thing that they can get like upset about and just go to the
moon with it and stay there for two days until they're ready to talk to you again and that like
and you couldn't have been more forth hey let's do this like as a vegan meal they're like oh my god
I saw the word chicken on that thing and I was just so freaked out I couldn't talk to you for
half a week that just this person also I had a discussion with them about one of their friends
dying and took me five minutes to figure out the friend was a chicken oh my god that's like
sobbing discussion and you know so this person sounds like either they're really upping their like
you know signaling their like how much they care let the world know how much you know like
just to the highest extent that they can or they've got some actual problems that's a bummer so I feel
bad yeah I mean to be fair my mom grew up on a farm and she actually was really upset when they're
family cow died after being in you know on their farm for I don't know 12 13 years this was a
chicken she stole from a farm I know you're talking about I remember the story I'm just saying
sometimes people can be upset about their pets dying yeah my dad grew up on my dad spent his
summers on farms and he doesn't eat chicken now because he fucking hates those things and their
dicks he had to kill a bunch of them as a kid shouldn't he eat lots of chicken then if he
he's so refocusing refocusing so this person was offended by the fact that I the point of this
long arm building story was this person was offended by the fact that I'd shown them a recipe
including chicken but I do think most vegans are not like that and so I hate to paint that broad
brush yeah I'm not talking about vegans I'm in general I'm talking about this particular person
yeah so vegans are cool I like vegans most of them except for this person so but the reason I'm
talking about this is because I had offended her and so I was like you know I was like well this
I didn't mean to offend you and I really apologize for that but in my and I actually did apologize
and I was very sorry for it because it obviously hurt her feelings and I felt bad for doing so
but in the back of my mind I'm like I didn't mean to offend you and it was something completely innocent
for you to react in such a way seems very shocking to me yeah and I think that's a I don't know if
that's a good example case just because this person sounds even if they have all their ducks in a row
they seem they they're for modified so far they behave as if they're not mentally stable
but that's how people act on the internet well that's that's another whole kind of
awareness I'm talking about people I know and real people not real people okay so everyone
listening people like that are just exhausting to be around I don't want to be friends with them
because it's so much effort to constantly police every single little thing you say or do in order
to not offend them and like especially when they're ready to be offended so hard by so little and so
like you know I know vegans who and imagine like I mean if you're a peter stinger style animal
rights activist you watch somebody order a burger and you have some knowledge like the suffering
that went into their plate and you're like well fuck and you know they don't necessarily know
that the person ordered it or they know and they don't care or whatever but you know it I think it
makes sense to like not love the fact if you're vegan or vegetarian to like love the fact that
eating you're watching your friends eat meat because like you you kind of have a feel as to why
you're not doing it and they don't sympathize with that so like they don't share that value
um but to be that blown away by it I don't know if that's a good representative case
no because I have another friend who's vegan who is amazing and every time I I'm a vegetarian
not on purpose obviously and so every time I have cheese or something around her she's like
she doesn't say anything but every time we go out I'm like hey can we go out to this place
does it have vegan stuff for you which is completely different than trying to figure out like how I
had offended this person you know yeah I think um I guess maybe there isn't a quick easy answer to
this I was just curious like what one's obligation was to say to someone who says I'm offended um
like I mean one answer is like okay sorry that you're offended not necessarily sorry for what I'm
doing um if if there's a conversation to be had there like hey I'm offended because are you aware
that like this coffee house they're ordering this from you know employees uh you know uh whatever
sweatshop labor etc or whatever right um that could be like oh shit I didn't know that I'm gonna stop
ordering from that place or whatever um so like the fruit toys have the conversation but I guess
I don't know like what one's obligation is to someone else's offense I guess there is an obligation
it's it's how you feel like you should respond to it like taking the coffee shop thing for example
my parents hate Starbucks because it apparently apparently donate money to plan parenthood I don't
