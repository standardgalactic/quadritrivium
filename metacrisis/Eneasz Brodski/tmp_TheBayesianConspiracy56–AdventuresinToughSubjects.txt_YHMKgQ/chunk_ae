they're like yes this is horrible we should ban all guns and do exactly what I've been proposing
the whole time because look at how many school shootings there are I don't think it's necessarily
just that though and yeah that's also shocking which helps and I think it also speaks to the
fear that other people have so it's not just I'm going to share this to further my social agenda
it's the oh my goodness I'm scared let me share this yeah that's exactly what it is but people
don't bother sorry go ahead no no you're good I think I just wanted to add to that that another
consequence of that is that somebody on the right who is you know looking at this and his pro-gun
and they say no way man it's like half that why are you lying maybe there's maybe there's more
yeah so who knows like maybe there's more bullshit to this than I thought and it it
continues to deunify people and so I imagined that like a lot of the insane stuff that you see
coming like you know I'm left of center but there are like there are insane circles of the left
but now I'm considering or I was strongly considering and then I had to confirm a few days later
that the circle is much smaller than I thought that there are people who yes on the left who
believe weird stuff that I can't really get behind but it's a it's a smaller circle than I thought
despite what I've seen online because the stuff I've seen online could be just trolls it could be
paid or bored people trying to just fuck with people but or it could be one person you know
with 10 accounts or whatever right and then we were out to dinner and I saw that thing on your
phone that was drawing you some of the specific headlines it was yeah oh it was out of the Denver
Post I think where it was talking about like these are all the tweets that have been archived
that we've been able to access out of the past I think it was out of 2016 that can be directly
tied to Colorado like about things in Colorado from the Russian hackers hackers are the hackers
I don't know not really hackers I think they're called hackers but they're not doing what people
think of as hacking but they are they're gaming the system well they're social hacking right okay
yeah social engineering or whatever they call that but yeah so yeah one of the examples was
like can you think of any write-off um there was one about how Trump got stuck in an elevator
what else was there because I remember actually seeing that on facebook and the during the election
year um there was one about marijuana and it being like scary or something or like it not being as
profitable and it was just like a bunch of stuff that like on the face of it if you didn't look too
deeply into it or if you didn't know more about the topic would seem real especially if it confirmed
your underlying already established biases sure and I think I remember skimming this but it was a
busy night I can't remember the specifics but I want to post this full article to the website on
this episode but I can find it a couple of them were um specifically the kind of things that I
imagined the far left people saying and these are people just they're just to just to stir the pot
and so disharmony and uh then like I said so it sort of confirmed my my suspicion that like oh I
bet they're doing this for both sides or they could be in this exactly what it would look like
and it was very gratifying to have it have it have my noticing something that actually
confirmed what I was thinking within a few days so there's actually I agree with you and I read
this article that I don't remember I was published and this is gonna sound super sketch because I'm
like so I read an article online um but it was basically maybe it's a Washington post or something
where it was talking about like how the Russian hackers slash scammers slash bots were targeting
Bernie Sanders supporters during the election through memes and through other stuff um and how
they were trying to influence their like to polarize them to make it so that and I actually one of my
friends is the case in point for this he's very young and so he was like well I saw this all this
stuff online that that that they said Hillary did and um Bernie Sanders is the best I'm just gonna
vote for Trump because Hillary's the worst oh and it's that kind of like honest-to-goodness person
that kind of person that this social engineering is targeting yeah for sure I guess the reason I
brought that up is because both right and left social engineering yeah just like it's not just the
right people who are real stupid or are falling for all these tricks it's everyone we do too yeah
and that's the realization that I had that's why like I said when I was considering this possibility
I was like oh shit and then I was like oh that actually happened so that's sort of a drag but it's
at least allowed me to pull like up to a much more peaceful worldview I guess if you can call that with
you know people with malice intent trying to fuck us over but the fact that most of the people I
actually want to ally with aren't uh there isn't this giant pocket of insanity there's a small
pocket of insanity and most of the giant part the perceived giant part is is much of it might be
propaganda stuff so um the reason I bring that up is because you're mentioning like the online
communities that were poisoning people or something and there's some really good segue to that maybe
if someone's losing it no I just like picking on 4chan yeah uh it was something specific about
that kind of thing and I think that uh it's now it seems not just likely but it's it's shown that
a lot of that bullshit that you know you see oh people online are all like this and that it's like
well those people online aren't representative of people in fact they're they're deliberately trying
to fuck with you and for me it worked for a long time yeah and I mean it still will it's hard to
like update everything in two days but um you know I'll be much more skeptical next time I see this
crazy headline on some random subreddit or something and I'm like oh man this is why I can't you know
call myself a far left liberal or something like oh wait no this you know it these people might exist
but they're existing in smaller numbers than what I'm saying or what I previously thought
one of the things that I'm finding very heartening about that that I'm trying to
do myself and that I appreciate when people do for me is like if I like just randomly
shitpost something or if I share a meme that I think is entertaining or that resonates with me
somehow I enjoy it when people say you know these are the facts related to this and this is why this
meme isn't related um instead of being antagonistic they're like hey so this is actually what happened
like I remember I shared this thing about Jack Kirby being told he needed to include more white
people in Black Panther and so he just put in KKK members that Black Panther beat up
and I thought it was funny I'm like this is actually pretty funny I didn't bother to fact check it
and the in the episodes oh the issues of Black Panther where he does fight the KKK we're not
Jack Kirby episode or why do I keep saying episodes it's so weird because we've been in Netflix land
but um and so I was it was actually more interesting to me to have that challenged and to be like no this
is actually what happened and I'm trying to inculcate in myself and in other people that
tendency to question and to be like no this is actually the the facts or whatever and so
for example one of the things I started doing since the election is looking at what my friends
share and seeing what the URL is so it's like you know hard times done that I don't even that just
came up in my head I know it's a website I don't remember what if it's one of the websites that's
untrustworthy it probably is daily news and buzzfeed or some of those bad ones yeah yeah and
so if it's not like the Washington Post or the New York Times and even then I'm kind of squirrely
on it I'm like okay this is probably not actual decent reporting and it's probably meant to just
like shitpost so is this actually something I can trust as a verified source to represent me and
what I actually intend to represent or is it me storing the pot and saying you know I'm just spreading
misinformation I think what it did for me was realized made me realize that I had to up the
level of my skeptical game and in a way that was actually rather than like burdensome was
like uplifting yeah because I'm like oh shit far fewer of my neighbors are crazy than I thought
was my conclusion and I might be wrong but uh I that's that's where I'm at right now and it's
actually a nice place to be so um I will try and you know stay vigilant but uh I know again it could
be more than I thought maybe none of them are Russian bots maybe every Russian bot lives in
Texas and you know they're all Americans but who knows uh deep cover an American posing as a Russian
posing as an American they've been here since the 60s yeah um one of the things you brought up
earlier that I kind of wanted to touch on because I like grabbing about my parents is um the tendency
of people who are more right than I am to believe to maybe be more gullible and that's it's not
when you mean more politically right yeah more politically right sorry um and it's a stereotype
but I think when it comes to people who tend and this is going to sound horrible so I'm going to
say it anyway okay but um people who are religious tend to be more gullible and they tend to be more
further right usually well being religious makes you more gullible because you have to be
it's a tenant of all religion that you have to accept some things on faith yeah and so um for
example my parents are incredibly Catholic like capital C Catholic all caps Catholic um and we
got into this argument the other day because I was like um today actually I had intended to try to
find a march to march with the students and be like we should have gun control and stop hurting
mentally ill people and all this business so I was telling my parents that off hand and
my dad's like well that's really stupid and I'm like oh we're getting into this are we
and he went off about how how did he put it um something along the lines of like yes we needed
more gun control and no that kid had no business having that weapon and we he's like you're not
going to believe me saying this but we need more social scientists to study the issue of mental
illness in America and I'm like okay cool and then he's like but then and he's probably I hope
he never listens to this because he'd be so mad at me he says that he will not abide by the laws of
gun control that are enacted because he doesn't feel they're fair to people who aren't crazy
huh I think it's a very common position it is but I know for a fact he has things in his house
he should not be having legally so dad and he's also crazy so I'm joking I am joking oh oh I see
what you're saying yeah yeah yeah so that's a hard one yeah who makes the exceptions how do we
logically and with compassion say we need to do these things as a society make sure everyone's
safe who makes the exceptions I'll tell you who I do yeah so catch me if you can yeah I think
actually said that by the way um the gun control issue is a can of worms but I don't think that
we're gonna get any big policy changes from more more shootings like I'm not prepared to talk about
it for five minutes but the 32nd version is like there are things that are easy to fix that people
aren't willing to give ground on because they're worried that it's a slippery slope it's like I
went to a class where I was I if I send off the paperwork to the sheriff I can get a concealed
carry permit um and they mentioned probably five times how like the maximum uh clip limit or clip
the um number of bullets you can put in a clip is like 12 or 15 or whatever it is now in Colorado
because a few years ago it wasn't but now it's less yeah and they get real real salty about that
they do and I and I even like made the point of asking them like if you can't do it in 12 whatever
it is 12 or 15 shots then what do you hope to do in 16 like what what the hell are you imagining
where if 15 isn't enough one more is going to make the difference and they're like it's
and they they're articulated that the point is is that we're worried that every inch that we seed
could could be the one that starts the avalanche and then we lose everything so like there's a
charitable position to view that from assuming that you can twist yourself into a mindset where you
can say I can see why they want guns which I admit is hard um but I'm sorry no you're good but I
but I can see where they're coming from so like uh if you're worried about that then you know
like super reasonable things like background checks at gun shows um or like you know if you
sell me a gun and I go kill somebody with it and you're liable you gave me the means um
saying that that should be just standard uh I think it's less that I'm anticipating I'm sure
there's people who are really pro-gun and they're going to say that's an infringement for whatever
reason but I imagine that the bulk of the concern there is not about that particular issue they
might even agree but they'd say I don't think they'll stop there I think they're gonna keep going
and that's what I'm worried about the bomb is coming for our guns yeah that's the I am moderately
pro-gun honestly but I do think there should be a national computerized registry of all guns
and who is their legal owner and no one will ever give ground on that because they're like well
Hitler made people register their guns before he took them away God wins whatever and I'm like
yes I guess he did but this is actually a very good idea and we should have it
mm-hmm so there's a couple of interesting points you just agreed with Hitler
oh I also like dogs oh yeah that's sir German shepherds man they're they're cute sorry
wait the police like German shepherds are we onto something guys grab your tinfoil hat
so speaking of that I used to be a police dispatcher and one of the things that I found very
interesting is during my time doing that for the past 15 years was that um at one point they had uh
on like either it came with your driver's license or something when we got the records back
when we'd run your driver's license on like a traffic stop or something you would say this person
is a concealed carry holder the state of Colorado ruled that that was unconstitutional
so now there's no way to track who has concealed carry permits uh I can falsify that well no not
and like a law enforcement sense that's weird because as a private investigator which is way
easier to get into the law enforcement that comes up on your two dollar and forty cent lexus search
well yes but not like any media oh sorry I'm being unclear but when you're run for something
like on a traffic stop okay so they do something less intense than yeah a detective would be able
to tell or if you had like you know 30 minutes this is a five second you go to lexus nexus type in
their name and get this information back and it shows on one of the subheadings is concealed carry
yes or no I think she's protesting to the fact that they're not allowed to tell the cops in the
field yeah by the way this guy has a concealed and I think they do have lexus nexus on their
mgt's now that's that's why I was surprised because yeah but like back in my day um we would have to
we would tell people we would tell not people we tell the officers hey this person's concealed
carry holder when they ran them so they would just know right and what you're saying is that
whether or not that information still comes back and not allowed to tell them well no it just
doesn't come back anymore gotcha that's interesting and that's weird by the one by the time you quit
yeah I could see that being useful information all right this is going to be totally on the side
but if you can't tell we're kind of derailed anyway um if I was a police officer I would like to know
the approximate probability of the person whose car I'm going to have in the gun or not
and yet like I think the number of people and this could be a wrong statistic maybe somebody
knows I think the number of people with concealed carry permits committing crimes is less than that
if you like the average police officer so like if anything if they have a concealed carry permit
you're like oh this is probably a chill dude they might be a gun in the car but I'm probably good
yeah um so it might even be good most officers aren't that's don't take that point of view right
well no they do oh they do yeah some of them they would feel more reassured if they knew the
guy had a concealed carry permit I can't speak for most officers not being one okay so it's not
necessarily fair but I don't think that it necessarily upped their danger level just made
them aware that there may be a gun maybe a weapon in the car and that factored into
their assessment of the overall situation okay so but that wasn't necessarily my point my point
was that it was taken away because it was ruled unconstitutional by people that are like well you
can't take our guns away you can't track us you can't do all this stuff and it's like but but but we
really feel more safe if we knew who had the guns and of course my father returning back to that
part of the conversation was like well they keep selling AR-15s to drug dealers in Mexico and so
they're just gonna keep coming across the border which is where apparently everyone who has an
AR-15 is getting oh I was trying to figure out what the hell he was where he was going with that
as opposed to walmart down the street as opposed to I think you're saying that if they banned them
it wouldn't slow down the traffic which is just not true it would slow down they would just go to
the next semi-automatic rifle it's it's a very common piece of machinery and like yeah you can get
varieties of that like he said a walmart or your local gun store yeah there's the scary thing about
rifles that it's really easy to get good at shooting a rifle yeah two hours and you could shoot a
target you know 100 yards away with somewhat reliability I'm not sure if that's necessarily
scary like well I think it's great if you practice anything you should get better at it and I would
prefer people to have better aim it's it's the firing and discriminately into a crowd that I really
have a problem with I think well I guess the downside I was getting at is that it's with only an
afternoon of training you know she could become a very successful mass shooter which I would like
to think that it would be a hard barrier to like getting good and it's not with with zero
minutes of training I could be a very successful mass shooter all I need is a large crowd of people
that's yeah yeah uh if you're if you're ambitious all right let's let's let's let's me there um if
I'm an ambitious mass killer and I want to get only headshots but I think the Vegas shooter was
actually doing that no I'm pretty sure he just fired at the maximum rate of fire he could get
