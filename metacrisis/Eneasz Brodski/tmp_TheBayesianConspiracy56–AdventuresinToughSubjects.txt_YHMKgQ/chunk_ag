know if that's true or not but that's the war on Christmas in the war on Christmas actually they
don't care about that they just care about the dead babies got each cup of coffee supports one
dead baby apparently oh hey I'm it's cooler they got a one-to-one ratio there I'm completely being
facetious Starbucks is very popular dude I hate babies I'm gonna order a lot more Starbucks
but every time I visit with them I bring Starbucks because I like Starbucks coffee and I don't care
that they're offended by it because it's a to me a really stupid thing to be offended by
but they're my parents and so I don't like I do code switch in other ways to not offend them
like if I have someone in my life who I'm attracted to who's a different uh the same gender as
myself or someone who's non-binary I'm not gonna we call them up and be like hey so I totally had
sex with so-and-so and I hold hands with them and I'm gonna bring them up and I'm gonna make out
with them in front of you um that's not something I'm gonna do because I code switch in front of
them to preserve their feelings in some ways I'm also never made out with anybody in front of my
parents but that's that's actually a good point but I actually made out with someone in front of my
parents but your point's taken and I think like so the general takeaway just explaining to me like
I'm an idiot alien because I don't get how people work so that the general version is like uh
I guess way the it's like you're not obligated to do anything if someone says I'm offended what you
what you probably will do instinctually and what you maybe should do quote unquote should is think
okay what should I or what should I up to my behavior based on this information um how important
is to me like the thing that I'm doing how offended do I think they actually are how much I think this
will ruin our relationship or risk it um so like your thing is I don't think that if you know someone
well doing something like that is really going to change your relationship all that much I mean
not bringing Starbucks won't change your relationship that much but like not telling your like uh say
if you came out to your family that you're gay and they're like well that offends me because I'm
a Christian or something um then like you would have to change your behavior a lot to like correct
for that right yeah well I think I think the bigger effect for most of these things is because
you're still gonna for the most part remain friends with people maybe you'll be slightly
better friends maybe it'd be not as good friends but things aren't going to change all that much I
think the bigger effect is that uh how you respond to someone's offense signals which social group
you are part of and if you do are not offended by the correct things and if you do not make the
correct apologies when people are offended you're like you're saying I am not part of this group
in society that you think is important like I am not a feminist or I am not a men's rights activist
or I am not a whatever the group is that is you know that is being slighted I suppose I think I
think that has a much bigger effect than just one-on-one relationships I would disagree to a
degree but I think because I have something that I feel is trumps that a little bit um so for example
I was in a relationship with someone who made racist jokes and I would tell that person that's
not funny and they would laugh and be like it is and I'm like no actually that's really offensive
and I would prefer you didn't do that and it made me think less of them because it was showing me
that they didn't care about how other people felt and so it's at least in that specific regard and
in that specific regard but it's like one of those like you know you have this like high
esteem of a person and it slowly drops yeah and that's I guess that's the the social capital
in your guys' relationship that he's willing to pay to keep telling those jokes which I you know
to be fair he probably wasn't those jokes were probably super important to him what he probably
enjoyed was like in some ways it's funny to watch some people be uncomfortable like that's why like
that's why I like that that joke I told earlier about the pilot was kind of funny for me not for
you no it was actually pretty funny after the punchline but beforehand watching you guys get
watching your faces be like what is he doing it's kind of funny yeah that's fair so like the only
person in my life that I have a lot of contact with who uses the word gay pejoratively is my
older mate who's gay and I never got around and I don't think it's worth bringing up like you
know I don't like it when you use that word he's like he gets to use it I think yeah but it's like
I don't I it's not my favorite word and I'm sure he's gonna convert to Judaism too for the jokes
for the jokes it's a Seinfeld reference okay I was I was giving them both a very odd look funny
funny throwback the the dentist to convert to Judaism in that show was Brian Cranston
no uh toads oh shit yeah okay guys got range as an actor yeah um so uh I would totally love to see
all the like bros out there who I don't think these exist anymore but all the 12 years ago
bros out there who were complaining about not being able to use gay as a word that means lame
anymore if they would have just hooked up with another dude for one night I think I think that'd
be a price I'd be willing to pay like all right if you explore your sexuality enough
to fuck another dude for one night you're okay using gay for the next few years
however you want see you're giving me this look like you don't think that's that's fair
I think okay so what that's triggering for me and I'm not being triggered by it but okay stupid
whatever um is the argument that all people who are homophobic in public are secretly gay
oh that's not what I meant at all no I didn't I didn't read that way either and that's what I
was getting out of that so that's why I was making that face okay yeah can I re re say what I think
you're trying to say and see if I had it right you were saying that like if you want to use this word
there's a cost to entry and go for it okay yeah okay fair um speaking of as long as we're a way
off topic but I actually wanted to go back to your old roommate oh good okay yeah because um you said
that him using gay in a way that for example people from 12 years ago would made you uncomfortable
yeah a little bit did it offend you I don't I so I'm not I don't know if I'm ready to jump on that
or like to remember that well enough or not I think because I'm also not sure like if offense
applies in the situation because I don't know if I can be offended on behalf of other people
like I didn't but it depends no I don't think he means he personally does not have the physical
capability oh yeah I could barely be offended for myself like yeah I barely yeah like for me to be
offended on behalf of gay people because this one gay person using the word gay was like you know
I don't think that occurred to me okay I was more just like I have this association that like
jerks are the ones who use that word that way and you don't seem like a jerk but
you think you get licensed to use it so it was just this weird dynamic that I had with him in that
word well it's like how I call myself queer which is it was a pejorative yeah so it was
pejorative and it can't well and it can still be if I mean anything's pejorative you've put
enough stank on it right yeah I think it was there was a comedian who had that line about uh
you know Jew is both the like appropriate and pejorative word for people on earth
depending on how you say it so I'm not sure what the the most political politically correct term
is for somebody who's not straight but you could use that in a pejorative way right yeah but it's
not a particular it's not using self-identifying is not necessarily politically correct it's just
whatever label works best for you sure okay oh yeah no I just meant like if if uh if someone's like
I'm uh I guess homosexual is that the most preferable term it depends on the person yeah on
on on a standard gay person the most neutral term I think that you just used yes the standard gay
person I use that on purpose to mean somebody to mean somebody I think gay means guys who likes guys
right well and see and I used for a while I went through a phaser I was using gay to describe persons
who are not heterosexual see I always thought it was like a lesbian gay uh lgb by trans right so
lesbians and gays were same-sex people who liked the same sex but not the same they weren't themselves
the same so there's queer intersex lesbian transgender bisexual asexual gay questioning
and like five other things I was gonna say I saw the I saw the 13 or 16 character version of this
on Wikipedia once and I thought it was too many yeah at that point you guys so which is why a lot
of people are going if they don't identify as one of the big four really they go towards queer and
me being like the privileged person from the outside with like no vested interest in this
like other than like I want everyone to be happy yeah but like no personal dog in the fight is
which I hate that phrase but whatever skin in the fight I don't know skin in the game and that's the
one um is like you know go for the politically savvy move you don't if you draw yourself into
26 different boxes then you've got 26 different groups of people campaigning and however small
your group already was that divided by 26 is never gonna stand a chance so well and I think that um
the reason why a lot of us started using gay was because of how people were using it like you have
the far religious right that's like that was gay they're sending us all to hell they're like yep
us gays are totally doing that they feel his brother Jed was the guy at CSU I forget his name
but I think they I think these were homosexuals and that's yeah that can't be like that's
that's the textbook okay version kind of yeah it is like again however brother Jed the crazy
dude yeah I think I think you're right I think that's his name yeah it might very well be
but you knew the same guy yeah oh yeah he was a presence on CSU's campus every semester
uh with his huge freaking sign and shouting and before we continue we are right about our two
hours I don't think we're gonna get to listener mail or rationalist picks this week which is really
unfortunate because we had some all right I got this up in 90 seconds uh did any closing remarks
from anybody I guess other than like thanks for having a good cultural conversation about a very
difficult topic yeah we didn't resort to name calling us pretty good nice if we had I feel happy
about everyone in this room still yeah I've never anticipated this resort to name calling and if it
did I would have been very unpleasantly surprised so what is the topic we covered today we never got
around to it so maybe we'll do it again another time for the record this was supposed to be Steven's
idea of like the tools or I guess the elements of a good conversation and how to overcome some of
like this the the tripping moments like uh like offense and uh misinterpretation or something
and I wanted to talk about things like talk you know when you're arguing with somebody you argue
with their beliefs not with them um and that's where that never happens in real life but it can
if you set it up right so um yeah all right so that topic once again we pushed off for another day
and this was just our fun SJW interview not exactly for the record I'm a social justice mage not a
warrior I think I think what the conclusion I have drawn from today is I need a pocket Steven
to follow me around yes because that really helped or sometimes if I get in like get in it with Steven
I need a pocket Vivian I just need a pocket neutral third party to be like you guys are going around
in circles and spinning your wheels let's step back and well I think that's really important for
any kind of discussion because if you have two sides that are really getting vehement about stuff
there's no real easy way to back out of it without losing face and even though we're not like really
losing face at all it's easier when you have someone else who can be like hey so we were talking about
this can we get back on that or I don't understand this can you explain it to me and having someone
say I don't understand can you explain it to me is not only a really easy way to challenge like
people making horrible jokes but also a really easy way to stop the conversation and make people
reconsider where they're going rather than just like rushing forward into like the knockout drag
out kind of thing and when you get in that death spiral you don't notice yeah you need someone on
the outside to be like hey guys you're in the death spiral you're like oh thank you yeah you can
you can notice that a little bit with like just uh that's where people like who are all into mindfulness
training talk about and being vaguely into that myself I I was having conversations like this earlier
and that's kind of why it came up was like I noticed like oh we're arguing that's not what I was going
for we're just being able to like be meta about your own conversation which actually be very distracting
a lot of the time but has its occasional use like in that specific situation and probably know
all there's um I'm totally gonna try to keep a little mini Steven in my head from now on
ah good luck to me I hope he's nice so yeah this wasn't quite what I was going for but it was a
fun conversation I hope that you guys felt okay about it so um so that's good uh in that case
we don't have time for listening feedback we have time to thank a listener and our sound engineer
Kyle Moore for constantly kicking ass making this random conversation in your guys's ears uh
only sounds bad because of the content not because of the the audio sorry no no I'm I think I think
it was okay yeah I thought it was a good conversation and oh my god did I lose my list of listen
so um for today we are thinking all our patreon supporters yay thank you guys you're awesome
and all of our listeners in general yeah yeah it's true I I hope that people occasionally enjoy
listening to this so yeah that's why I do it you know what we don't need to thank someone every
single time every now and then we should thank all our listeners just for listening and being awesome
inviting us into your lives and hey maybe tell any friends if you find any of these interesting
episodes interesting yeah and hit us up on the subreddit the email or the comment section on
the website where we post this yeah reddit red what do you got against reddit because I noticed
when you said that you were like the four channels the redditors I'm like red it's great no reddit
it's great I just I feel like you get the same impression of reddit as I have of like the the
capital F feminist movement because no reddit is actually really useful I just don't go into it very
often there's lots of camps like I said yeah subreddit wholesome memes animals being bros people being
or humans being bros there's a lot of very wholesome subredditors that I follow because I
need a daily dose of lots of good news in fact there's one uplifting news which is actually
kind of awesome because it gives me hope for humanity so yay humanity yay um as I guess
did you want to plug anything like a wonderful anthology about how awesome humans are oh yeah I
do have one of those so I am Vivian kth I am the editor of humans wanted it is available on amazon
and it is a pro human science fiction anthology yay pro human science fiction that's not like a
rare genre it well that's why I did it actually because there's a tendency in science fiction
for people to be like well humans are like the the base class no one really wants to be them all
these aliens are super cool and there was a tumblr post that um I saw that the author of which allowed
me to use it for the Kickstarter and subsequent anthology that was talking about how humans are
useful and I found that very endearing and engaging because I was like well you kind of are I'd really
like to see more of that and so I was able to kickstart it and then publish it on amazon that's
really cool I didn't know anything about this oh we shall talk more about it as soon as we get off
the air okay all right all right goodbye everybody thanks bye
Vivian says corporations are our jews oh my god
