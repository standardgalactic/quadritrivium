I mean like we are doing it making an effort to record more demos of things for work
because one thing that happened majorly with the last changeover was there's sparse documentation on
anything and even on like big important services that are like really expensive it's not clear how
we use it and we know that like oh well look at that I tinkered with it and it broke stuff so we
need this but I don't know what it's doing or why we're spending $2,000 a month on it or whatever
and so we are demoing basically every time we learn something we'll either write a doc for it
or do a video demo of it and I was doing one of the co-worker he wanted to record his own thing
and he spent like 10 minutes just himming and hawing getting over the nervousness of it and
like dude who's gonna watch this like people in two years who are gonna know nothing else about
you other than I wish that guy still worked here because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing right
you'll be fine um and I have no shyness about anything on this and you know so I feel like
the first few episodes I remember being crazy nervous right oh yeah yeah the more you do something
and find out that you're not going to be absolutely destroyed for it the more your brain
starts to adjust and be like oh okay this is this is not such a dangerous thing to do
yep I'm learning that a lot in my job yeah it's the first couple times that you're
in court representing someone it's nerve-wracking when your case is called and the judge is looking
at you what's what's happening counsel what are we doing here and you're just like you know the first
couple of times you you freak out a little bit but well especially because this person's future is
in your hands well yeah I mean it's usually not that you're right but yeah but you you have some
influence on it yeah and so that it does it makes you but even that you're not even really
thinking about that that that's more like in a general like abstract sense but just in general
like a judge it's been different lately because of covid they're over webex but usually they're
up on a bench kind of high above you they have that they have the microphone they're projecting
their voice and they're like and they call your case and it's like all right show time you know
and just like oh shit uh a judge we're looking for a new date uh you know you're just at first
you just kind of scramble for words but my dad always had beef with courthouses he's like he goes
I mean in general he loves architecture but whenever he goes to a courthouse or a state house
he's like did they really need 20 huge steps leading up to it and these massive columns in
the space no all this is to intimidate you okay it's the thing that is big and powerful and can
beat you down it's pretty much right yeah fortunately though that only describes like
some courthouses those are like the nice ones okay a lot of courthouses are pretty small shabby
like I've seen I've seen courtroom proceedings dude that are like basically in closets oh wow
like sometimes literally like there was uh there was a I think I already did it a couple of so I
used to work in Lancaster County Pennsylvania and they had um DUI like a DUI specific court right
so they would have a judge doing preliminary hearings which is just to determine whether
there's probable cause for the DUI charge right okay and so this judge would be in a room
it would just be like two or three like tables like long you know these elongated folding tables
yeah yeah with the legs that right and he'd be at the one table and then there'd be defense on one
side prosecution on the other and they would just argue and the judge would just be like okay I think
you know that's enough and I find that there was probable cause and that was it like it was and
it was a legitimate judge right you know but you're doing them especially for things like
preliminary hearings in front of like you know sometimes magistrates but also judges they can be
tiny tiny rooms so only he's talking about the big like you know supreme court and you know these
like the higher level for a traffic ticket and I got that cut that treatment you can test the
traffic ticket I did nicely done sir did you win yeah you should always contest everything oh really
oh yeah can you kidding always contest everything you never know when I did it you get at least
the 45 dollar court fees charge so it might not be worth it if you end up you know not getting
that I suppose yeah you could get the small amount of court costs but wait even though you won you
had to pay the court costs I mean you showed up at court you took up some of the court's time
you got to pay some fees for that don't I pay for the court's time with my taxes you might think so sir
where's where's David to yell about how inefficient and stealing this is this is also like it's
partly because you were it was such a small charge I think usually for like larger charges if you
get a dismissal you don't pay court costs okay it's only if you're getting if you get convicted
otherwise you're not gonna get this was charged simply to just because you I wasted the court's
time like it's not your fault if you're getting your charge dismissed then clearly the state is
at fault at least in some respect right so you know that's not that's not on you but they don't care
for for lower things it's weird the amount of very in very minor cases how often constitutional
rights just don't fucking matter like no one gives a shit for the little things they care for the big
charges but for little tiny things it can be rough I assume it's due to the whole the courts only
have so much capacity and if everyone contested every small thing nothing would get done so we have
to disincentivize people you know contesting the small things or stop trying to get people in trouble
for every small thing that would be a much better solution but the but that's not I mean the small
thing sure but like you could you could handle the small things because they're usually handled so
quickly and that's part of the constitutional right thing is that they're not they're not giving
you necessarily a full hearing for like traffic tickets so you're not gonna get a full amount of
process that you think of like a trial and all these witnesses being called and all that stuff
it's the major charges where you'd have an actual trial because that's when you know if we had
every single person who was charged with a misdemeanor or a felony that'd be 10,000 plus people a year
in Denver alone and having a trial for every single one of those cases would not literally collapse the
system it wouldn't be possible and we're actually seeing the limits of that now because trials didn't
go for like a full year in Colorado because of covid and just now they're starting back up like
last month holy shit so they're now that whole backlog that happened because of covid is they're
finally having a reckon with that and um so i'm curious i know this is just a personal taste
matter but would you prefer that they expand the capacity of the courts or that they have less
laws i actually i don't mind the way it's done now uh you give the prosecutors a lot more a lot of
discretion to offer deals to get cases off their docket the problem with them having less laws is
first of all most laws by far are fairly just the punishments themselves may not be
but it's probably good we have drunk driving laws or laws against violence or laws against you know
you know some of the more minor ones like public intoxication or drug possession i mean you could
definitely argue those should go i don't think anyone's going to argue with you on those things
but like laws against selling loose cigarettes just as a you know example since we're going to be
talking about a sort of thing like this later it seems like sure maybe you could have some
regulation on things but when you think about it in the end any law to be enforced has to be
at the end enforced by large men with muscles or guns using violence if someone isn't going to go
along with the law so how would you regulate them without the large men with guns and i mean i'm
using violence that's the thing i think uh you just you decide some things are not worth that
level of violence and so you don't regulate those things so you just allow loose cigarettes to be
sold yeah that that would be my preferred solution just less laws in general okay all right i i don't
necessarily agree i i think that's valid i just don't um i don't know if it if yeah i suppose for
loose cigarettes i mean that's that's one that i have a hard time defending just because it's
such a stupid charge right i mean but neighborhood noise ordinances might i mean like my inner uh
john stewart mill style libertarian is asking where's the harm right yeah with with cigarettes with
loose cigarettes no it's anything if anything you're serving you're serving up you're doing a public
service right right now granted you're skipping taxes whatever but you already pay taxes on the
cigarettes when you bought them right if i'm gonna sell them if i can turn down and sell them on a
profit i'm an entrepreneur like you know that the government needs a cut of every single profit
so whenever money changes hands you give some to the government so but the noise ordinance thing
i can i mean again when you say that the the logical the end consequence is somebody showing
up at your house with a gun but like you know my neighbors are putting a new cabinet to the last
couple days and it's awesome and good for them to look cool they were plied enough to start at 9am
and finish usually by the end of business hours right uh if they started at say two in the morning
on friday night or something i'd have been pissed and i probably would have called i would have asked
them to stop but you know whatever if it escalated the point of involving the police i'd be like
why are they doing this at two in the morning you know make them not make them stop officer i mean
i've had some loud parties before and i've never actually had the cops called on me although in
retrospect probably should have a few times because they went to like you know two three with
noise anyways i i understand the noise ordinances i think they're a good idea uh people shouldn't
be kept up like that but you know then you always face the the prospect of maybe things really go
south like they do in rare occasions and somebody is killed because the kids were playing their music
too loud like that sucks i mean that's um that's a huge part of all of this right i mean a lot of
for example debates about guns and gun restrictions that's largely what it comes down to like a lot
of people want there to be regulations of guns and you know i think we're all at least a little
sympathetic to it it makes some sense me these are highly powerful you know machines and you could
easily kill someone with them however if you make it against the law to own a gun well now if someone
does own that gun and they are in the police find out it's not like and it's going to be like you
know some of the more like totems of the of the woke types where it's like it's going to be like
black people a lot you know that own these things and now the cops have every reason to arrest them
and perhaps use violence against that's what it means to have a law i mean you said that earlier
and that's an important point when you have a law the laws are laws are great we want there to be
some standards in our communities we don't want people killing others or driving drunk and all
these things but at the same time when you make something a law you have to understand implicitly
what you're doing is allowing police to take this person and put them in a cage right that is that
you have to at least confront that reality that's absolutely true that's part of like we're having
discretion you can have discretion on the part of individual individual officers you know i've
been pulled over a handful of times a couple of times the cops who really wanted to get me in
trouble but had no had no like reasonable ability to do so and then one time by a cop who totally
could have given me a ticket but he was nice and understanding i thought i was in a lane that would
let me go straight but it was left to turn lonely and i went through the light and i'm like oh great
i did it i'm like oh i'm coming traffic and the car behind me pulls into the bike lane or whatever
just to let the cop behind him in front before like you know the cop even had his lights on
because he's like get this asshole and the cop comes out and he couldn't have been more polite
about it i explained and i'm trying to find the identification for the car because it's my mom's
car and i had no idea where she kept it you'd think it'd be in the glove box but i don't know we
found it eventually and he he gave me he pulled a a surreal moment on me i handed my license and
he's looking at it and he's looking at me with the flashlight he's like how to know this is your
license and i'm taking it back and i'm like because i look like the guy in the picture like
that's why there's pictures on there right he's like yeah but other people look like the guy in
the picture and i'm like well i mean yeah my twin brother but he's right there he's like oh you've
got a twin brother in the car um so but he was just messing with me uh he understood what was going on
i get that a lot too with the id because this is my id picture oh man no one no one can recognize
me without the beard so i get that a lot so right now just in his all clean shape and in his um
barrel driver's license more like two days of five o'clock shadow yeah but you you know you you
look like someone who's basically clean shave and in the driver's license picture you got a
full mountain man beard it's glorious you know what we never started the episode we just started
chatting i think i should put all this into the episode because this was this was interesting
shit yeah well let's let's do a soft entry now then okay cool uh welcome to the base in conspiracy
i'm minyash brotsky i'm steven zebra and i am justin excellent i'll give my last name out of it for
yes that's usually wise we most of our guests don't do the last name thing
because his last name is obama he doesn't want that kind of attention
steven shut up sorry clinton oh shoot that's another one yeah all right uh what was the
why were they trying to get you in trouble those other cops pulled you over or like how could you
tell um one guy i was signaling to get over to the right turn lane for blocks and there was kind
of room but you know like how somebody's supposed to like see and let you have a comfortable amount
of space well they weren't and so i just you know like well i've let you know my intention for a good
half a minute i'm coming over and then his lights come on i didn't realize it was a cop
and so he comes out and he's like are you on something it was like three in the afternoon
and i'm like no and this was actually at a point when i was in high school i'd never had any drugs
or alcohol and i was like no i've never done any of that stuff ever he's like never and i'm like
yeah actually never and the guy in my passenger seat's laughing and he was like you cut me off
back there and i was like well i was trying to get over if i knew you were a cop i would have
missed my turn you know sorry um but he didn't did the thing where you know he went back and uh
you know took half an hour to look up all my information or whatever and just just waste my
afternoon um another time and i didn't know this was legal it sounds illegal to me but i'm sure it's
i'm sure it's legal because no i was out of stoplight and i just got this car and i'm doing
the right thing at the stoplight it's you know the middle of the night i'm driving somebody home
after a party and he pulls me over and he's like yeah your car isn't registered and i'm like first
of all you're allowed just to check you're sitting behind me in traffic i didn't do anything oh yeah
that's definitely illegal they do that oh really yeah oh yeah they'll run your plates even before
they've pulled you over absolutely and it's illegal to do that or legal legal legal why isn't that a
search that i should have no no if they if they're searching fourth amendment style like what people
typically think of as a search right if they have a legal ability to be there what they find is not a
search okay so even though they're looking in traffic yeah right yeah well see public information
seeing my license plate in traffic is one thing but putting it through his police only database to
check on who it is for no reason that just seemed weird yeah it's uh it's been a point of contention
there is case law on it but no it is legal for police to just run your plates like that even
if they don't pull you over well i call shenanigans because he found an excuse for no reason to pull
me over my car was in fact registered but it was literally like earlier that day and i was like
check up another office like i you know i've got the temp tags or whatever and everything and
eventually i don't know why but he said like some database in denver had it even though i
registered it in fort collins because that's where i was living uh some stupid thing there
but then i last i think the only other time i can remember being pulled over i had the the little
light above my license plate was out because i forget to do a 15 point inspection on my car
every time i get into it right um he was nice about it he just let me know and i was like oh
thanks i i had no idea um and he didn't give me a ticket i don't know because how would you know
yours i mean presumably you're supposed to get out and do a 15 point inspection every time you get
into your car right seriously well i mean otherwise you want to have a light out and how else are you
supposed to know that like your brake lights aren't are out you know how would you know that but yeah
you have a cop pull you over and say hey by the way this is out please go get fixed yeah i mean
that's or a cop pull you over and give you a ticket for having a light out it it shouldn't
happen but that but i think that's legal right you've broken the law you're supposed to have
indicating rick lights i'm not a lawyer but it sounds like if you had a cop who wanted to be an
asshole or make more tickets that week you know well listen i i highly recommend you never do
anything in your car that could get you in serious trouble because that is the easiest way for police
to get their hands on you when you're driving a vehicle you're almost certainly breaking the law
in one way or another it's almost impossible i've got a mask for my mirror that's against the law yeah
i mean it there's so many traffic regulations you know and the amount of things that you could do
incorrectly like when you turn for example when you turn right onto the street you're supposed to
turn in the lane that is farthest to the right if you veer over into the middle lane instead say
you could be pulled over for that if you weave at all in between lines you get pulled over for that i
mean there's just so many ways for them to pull you over and once they pull you over
