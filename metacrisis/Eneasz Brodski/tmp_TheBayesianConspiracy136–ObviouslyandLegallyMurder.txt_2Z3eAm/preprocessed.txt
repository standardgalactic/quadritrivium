I mean like we are doing it making an effort to record more demos of things for work
because one thing that happened majorly with the last changeover was there's sparse documentation on
anything and even on like big important services that are like really expensive it's not clear how
we use it and we know that like oh well look at that I tinkered with it and it broke stuff so we
need this but I don't know what it's doing or why we're spending $2,000 a month on it or whatever
and so we are demoing basically every time we learn something we'll either write a doc for it
or do a video demo of it and I was doing one of the co-worker he wanted to record his own thing
and he spent like 10 minutes just himming and hawing getting over the nervousness of it and
like dude who's gonna watch this like people in two years who are gonna know nothing else about
you other than I wish that guy still worked here because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing right
you'll be fine um and I have no shyness about anything on this and you know so I feel like
the first few episodes I remember being crazy nervous right oh yeah yeah the more you do something
and find out that you're not going to be absolutely destroyed for it the more your brain
starts to adjust and be like oh okay this is this is not such a dangerous thing to do
yep I'm learning that a lot in my job yeah it's the first couple times that you're
in court representing someone it's nerve-wracking when your case is called and the judge is looking
at you what's what's happening counsel what are we doing here and you're just like you know the first
couple of times you you freak out a little bit but well especially because this person's future is
in your hands well yeah I mean it's usually not that you're right but yeah but you you have some
influence on it yeah and so that it does it makes you but even that you're not even really
thinking about that that that's more like in a general like abstract sense but just in general
like a judge it's been different lately because of covid they're over webex but usually they're
up on a bench kind of high above you they have that they have the microphone they're projecting
their voice and they're like and they call your case and it's like all right show time you know
and just like oh shit uh a judge we're looking for a new date uh you know you're just at first
you just kind of scramble for words but my dad always had beef with courthouses he's like he goes
I mean in general he loves architecture but whenever he goes to a courthouse or a state house
he's like did they really need 20 huge steps leading up to it and these massive columns in
the space no all this is to intimidate you okay it's the thing that is big and powerful and can
beat you down it's pretty much right yeah fortunately though that only describes like
some courthouses those are like the nice ones okay a lot of courthouses are pretty small shabby
like I've seen I've seen courtroom proceedings dude that are like basically in closets oh wow
like sometimes literally like there was uh there was a I think I already did it a couple of so I
used to work in Lancaster County Pennsylvania and they had um DUI like a DUI specific court right
so they would have a judge doing preliminary hearings which is just to determine whether
there's probable cause for the DUI charge right okay and so this judge would be in a room
it would just be like two or three like tables like long you know these elongated folding tables
yeah yeah with the legs that right and he'd be at the one table and then there'd be defense on one
side prosecution on the other and they would just argue and the judge would just be like okay I think
you know that's enough and I find that there was probable cause and that was it like it was and
it was a legitimate judge right you know but you're doing them especially for things like
preliminary hearings in front of like you know sometimes magistrates but also judges they can be
tiny tiny rooms so only he's talking about the big like you know supreme court and you know these
like the higher level for a traffic ticket and I got that cut that treatment you can test the
traffic ticket I did nicely done sir did you win yeah you should always contest everything oh really
oh yeah can you kidding always contest everything you never know when I did it you get at least
the 45 dollar court fees charge so it might not be worth it if you end up you know not getting
that I suppose yeah you could get the small amount of court costs but wait even though you won you
had to pay the court costs I mean you showed up at court you took up some of the court's time
you got to pay some fees for that don't I pay for the court's time with my taxes you might think so sir
where's where's David to yell about how inefficient and stealing this is this is also like it's
partly because you were it was such a small charge I think usually for like larger charges if you
get a dismissal you don't pay court costs okay it's only if you're getting if you get convicted
otherwise you're not gonna get this was charged simply to just because you I wasted the court's
time like it's not your fault if you're getting your charge dismissed then clearly the state is
at fault at least in some respect right so you know that's not that's not on you but they don't care
for for lower things it's weird the amount of very in very minor cases how often constitutional
rights just don't fucking matter like no one gives a shit for the little things they care for the big
charges but for little tiny things it can be rough I assume it's due to the whole the courts only
have so much capacity and if everyone contested every small thing nothing would get done so we have
to disincentivize people you know contesting the small things or stop trying to get people in trouble
for every small thing that would be a much better solution but the but that's not I mean the small
thing sure but like you could you could handle the small things because they're usually handled so
quickly and that's part of the constitutional right thing is that they're not they're not giving
you necessarily a full hearing for like traffic tickets so you're not gonna get a full amount of
process that you think of like a trial and all these witnesses being called and all that stuff
it's the major charges where you'd have an actual trial because that's when you know if we had
every single person who was charged with a misdemeanor or a felony that'd be 10,000 plus people a year
in Denver alone and having a trial for every single one of those cases would not literally collapse the
system it wouldn't be possible and we're actually seeing the limits of that now because trials didn't
go for like a full year in Colorado because of covid and just now they're starting back up like
last month holy shit so they're now that whole backlog that happened because of covid is they're
finally having a reckon with that and um so i'm curious i know this is just a personal taste
matter but would you prefer that they expand the capacity of the courts or that they have less
laws i actually i don't mind the way it's done now uh you give the prosecutors a lot more a lot of
discretion to offer deals to get cases off their docket the problem with them having less laws is
first of all most laws by far are fairly just the punishments themselves may not be
but it's probably good we have drunk driving laws or laws against violence or laws against you know
you know some of the more minor ones like public intoxication or drug possession i mean you could
definitely argue those should go i don't think anyone's going to argue with you on those things
but like laws against selling loose cigarettes just as a you know example since we're going to be
talking about a sort of thing like this later it seems like sure maybe you could have some
regulation on things but when you think about it in the end any law to be enforced has to be
at the end enforced by large men with muscles or guns using violence if someone isn't going to go
along with the law so how would you regulate them without the large men with guns and i mean i'm
using violence that's the thing i think uh you just you decide some things are not worth that
level of violence and so you don't regulate those things so you just allow loose cigarettes to be
sold yeah that that would be my preferred solution just less laws in general okay all right i i don't
necessarily agree i i think that's valid i just don't um i don't know if it if yeah i suppose for
loose cigarettes i mean that's that's one that i have a hard time defending just because it's
such a stupid charge right i mean but neighborhood noise ordinances might i mean like my inner uh
john stewart mill style libertarian is asking where's the harm right yeah with with cigarettes with
loose cigarettes no it's anything if anything you're serving you're serving up you're doing a public
service right right now granted you're skipping taxes whatever but you already pay taxes on the
cigarettes when you bought them right if i'm gonna sell them if i can turn down and sell them on a
profit i'm an entrepreneur like you know that the government needs a cut of every single profit
so whenever money changes hands you give some to the government so but the noise ordinance thing
i can i mean again when you say that the the logical the end consequence is somebody showing
up at your house with a gun but like you know my neighbors are putting a new cabinet to the last
couple days and it's awesome and good for them to look cool they were plied enough to start at 9am
and finish usually by the end of business hours right uh if they started at say two in the morning
on friday night or something i'd have been pissed and i probably would have called i would have asked
them to stop but you know whatever if it escalated the point of involving the police i'd be like
why are they doing this at two in the morning you know make them not make them stop officer i mean
i've had some loud parties before and i've never actually had the cops called on me although in
retrospect probably should have a few times because they went to like you know two three with
noise anyways i i understand the noise ordinances i think they're a good idea uh people shouldn't
be kept up like that but you know then you always face the the prospect of maybe things really go
south like they do in rare occasions and somebody is killed because the kids were playing their music
too loud like that sucks i mean that's um that's a huge part of all of this right i mean a lot of
for example debates about guns and gun restrictions that's largely what it comes down to like a lot
of people want there to be regulations of guns and you know i think we're all at least a little
sympathetic to it it makes some sense me these are highly powerful you know machines and you could
easily kill someone with them however if you make it against the law to own a gun well now if someone
does own that gun and they are in the police find out it's not like and it's going to be like you
know some of the more like totems of the of the woke types where it's like it's going to be like
black people a lot you know that own these things and now the cops have every reason to arrest them
and perhaps use violence against that's what it means to have a law i mean you said that earlier
and that's an important point when you have a law the laws are laws are great we want there to be
some standards in our communities we don't want people killing others or driving drunk and all
these things but at the same time when you make something a law you have to understand implicitly
what you're doing is allowing police to take this person and put them in a cage right that is that
you have to at least confront that reality that's absolutely true that's part of like we're having
discretion you can have discretion on the part of individual individual officers you know i've
been pulled over a handful of times a couple of times the cops who really wanted to get me in
trouble but had no had no like reasonable ability to do so and then one time by a cop who totally
could have given me a ticket but he was nice and understanding i thought i was in a lane that would
let me go straight but it was left to turn lonely and i went through the light and i'm like oh great
i did it i'm like oh i'm coming traffic and the car behind me pulls into the bike lane or whatever
just to let the cop behind him in front before like you know the cop even had his lights on
because he's like get this asshole and the cop comes out and he couldn't have been more polite
about it i explained and i'm trying to find the identification for the car because it's my mom's
car and i had no idea where she kept it you'd think it'd be in the glove box but i don't know we
found it eventually and he he gave me he pulled a a surreal moment on me i handed my license and
he's looking at it and he's looking at me with the flashlight he's like how to know this is your
license and i'm taking it back and i'm like because i look like the guy in the picture like
that's why there's pictures on there right he's like yeah but other people look like the guy in
the picture and i'm like well i mean yeah my twin brother but he's right there he's like oh you've
got a twin brother in the car um so but he was just messing with me uh he understood what was going on
i get that a lot too with the id because this is my id picture oh man no one no one can recognize
me without the beard so i get that a lot so right now just in his all clean shape and in his um
barrel driver's license more like two days of five o'clock shadow yeah but you you know you you
look like someone who's basically clean shave and in the driver's license picture you got a
full mountain man beard it's glorious you know what we never started the episode we just started
chatting i think i should put all this into the episode because this was this was interesting
shit yeah well let's let's do a soft entry now then okay cool uh welcome to the base in conspiracy
i'm minyash brotsky i'm steven zebra and i am justin excellent i'll give my last name out of it for
yes that's usually wise we most of our guests don't do the last name thing
because his last name is obama he doesn't want that kind of attention
steven shut up sorry clinton oh shoot that's another one yeah all right uh what was the
why were they trying to get you in trouble those other cops pulled you over or like how could you
tell um one guy i was signaling to get over to the right turn lane for blocks and there was kind
of room but you know like how somebody's supposed to like see and let you have a comfortable amount
of space well they weren't and so i just you know like well i've let you know my intention for a good
half a minute i'm coming over and then his lights come on i didn't realize it was a cop
and so he comes out and he's like are you on something it was like three in the afternoon
and i'm like no and this was actually at a point when i was in high school i'd never had any drugs
or alcohol and i was like no i've never done any of that stuff ever he's like never and i'm like
yeah actually never and the guy in my passenger seat's laughing and he was like you cut me off
back there and i was like well i was trying to get over if i knew you were a cop i would have
missed my turn you know sorry um but he didn't did the thing where you know he went back and uh
you know took half an hour to look up all my information or whatever and just just waste my
afternoon um another time and i didn't know this was legal it sounds illegal to me but i'm sure it's
i'm sure it's legal because no i was out of stoplight and i just got this car and i'm doing
the right thing at the stoplight it's you know the middle of the night i'm driving somebody home
after a party and he pulls me over and he's like yeah your car isn't registered and i'm like first
of all you're allowed just to check you're sitting behind me in traffic i didn't do anything oh yeah
that's definitely illegal they do that oh really yeah oh yeah they'll run your plates even before
they've pulled you over absolutely and it's illegal to do that or legal legal legal why isn't that a
search that i should have no no if they if they're searching fourth amendment style like what people
typically think of as a search right if they have a legal ability to be there what they find is not a
search okay so even though they're looking in traffic yeah right yeah well see public information
seeing my license plate in traffic is one thing but putting it through his police only database to
check on who it is for no reason that just seemed weird yeah it's uh it's been a point of contention
there is case law on it but no it is legal for police to just run your plates like that even
if they don't pull you over well i call shenanigans because he found an excuse for no reason to pull
me over my car was in fact registered but it was literally like earlier that day and i was like
check up another office like i you know i've got the temp tags or whatever and everything and
eventually i don't know why but he said like some database in denver had it even though i
registered it in fort collins because that's where i was living uh some stupid thing there
but then i last i think the only other time i can remember being pulled over i had the the little
light above my license plate was out because i forget to do a 15 point inspection on my car
every time i get into it right um he was nice about it he just let me know and i was like oh
thanks i i had no idea um and he didn't give me a ticket i don't know because how would you know
yours i mean presumably you're supposed to get out and do a 15 point inspection every time you get
into your car right seriously well i mean otherwise you want to have a light out and how else are you
supposed to know that like your brake lights aren't are out you know how would you know that but yeah
you have a cop pull you over and say hey by the way this is out please go get fixed yeah i mean
that's or a cop pull you over and give you a ticket for having a light out it it shouldn't
happen but that but i think that's legal right you've broken the law you're supposed to have
indicating rick lights i'm not a lawyer but it sounds like if you had a cop who wanted to be an
asshole or make more tickets that week you know well listen i i highly recommend you never do
anything in your car that could get you in serious trouble because that is the easiest way for police
to get their hands on you when you're driving a vehicle you're almost certainly breaking the law
in one way or another it's almost impossible i've got a mask for my mirror that's against the law yeah
i mean it there's so many traffic regulations you know and the amount of things that you could do
incorrectly like when you turn for example when you turn right onto the street you're supposed to
turn in the lane that is farthest to the right if you veer over into the middle lane instead say
you could be pulled over for that if you weave at all in between lines you get pulled over for that i
mean there's just so many ways for them to pull you over and once they pull you over
they are close to being able to get inside your car they can't quite search it yet but they only
need to find one thing i smelled something it was probably drugs right and that that's all it really
can take sometimes yeah there was one more time where we got pulled over this was great i got into
a lot of shenanigans as a kid and oh i wonder how much of this i should say um pass this probably
pass any statute of limitations which is probably good for minor crimes it's gonna be just like a
couple okay well in any case we did some donuts in a school soccer field for fun and soccer field
it was ripped up their turf i felt really bad when we were back the next day and saw how wrecked it
was oh man but so we did donuts we we we ruined it and we were shooting fireworks off the whole
time out of the car um and it's like a residential area and everything we were you know doing crazy
stuff and so we get pulled over coming back up that street 20 minutes later and uh the cops thought
it was supposed to be a black car because this one was dark dark green okay and he's like i can see
your car is green but you know i just thought i'd you know you thought he'd check and like meanwhile
because it's in colorado you're not supposed to have fireworks or anything that shoots um and we're
we had a car full of that exactly um and so uh we're sitting there you know holding our feet
perfectly still so we can shove all the fireworks under the seat like we are we the car was loaded
with with illegal paraphernalia and uh we he just basically sent us on our way he thought that he
had the wrong car so and then i don't know how he didn't notice because when we got home the car
smelled like a freshly mowed lawn like anyway well that's hilarious but i've contacted the police
and they're on their way right that makes sense so the reason we have justin here is because justin
is a certified defense lawyer you are just an esquire that's right yeah i'm esquire in two
different states in fact colorado and pennsylvania although i'm not active in pennsylvania right so
really i'm just a lawyer in colorado it's slightly annoying but you have to get
recertified here when you moved here pretty annoying yeah especially to take the bar exam
a second time that was not fun you can usually you can if you're in like one area for five years
you can just get like brought in like grandfather did almost but uh if i was only a lawyer for
nine months when i moved here so i wasn't nearly enough time so i had to take the bar like i was
just graduating law school all over again so you took it while working here twice and i took it
summer 2018 and then february 2020 right before the pandemic so twice in about a year and a half
year and eight months that but i mean i yeah it sucked but hey i i right to take it yeah it's
the test itself was about 700 each time and then the the most of the like high profile practice
courses like thymus and barbary are like i got it for 1400 i was lucky holy crap usually it's 2000
plus barbary easily will cost you three okay um but you know i mean it's a lot you're not wrong
however i just will remind you a much like law school for example costs which is about 60 000
a year relative to that the bar is dirt cheap but in theory could you be entirely self-taught
and then take the bar or do you have to have a degree to take the bar oh you have to have a degree
from an institution that's uh accredited by the american bar association if you can pay the 2000
dollars and pass the bar that should be enough proof that you know what you're doing right yeah i mean
in theory but like the point of the test but the bar doesn't really test your skills as an attorney
that well well then it's a shitty test does school i mean no yeah but like that's the thing is that
like i mean no one's gonna argue for law school staying exactly how it is okay in theory it should
teach you how to be an attorney it does not it teaches you a couple of very basic skills you
need to know like legal research and writing it teaches you things like how to read a case
so when i need to know what i you know from from a particular case what i the important bits i can
just skip right to him because i know where roughly it's going to be um so it teaches you that stuff
but as far as like your day-to-day practice it doesn't teach you hardly anything i mean you can
you can seek out like the sorts of classes that will help you with that stuff you're sort of clinics
where you're actually like practicing on kind of where you're practicing under a license attorney
and stuff but if you don't seek those out you could totally go through all law school and not get
any legal education in really much of a sense that helps you practice as a lawyer
fucking nuts man but that's that's school right i mean law school i'll give it this it prepared
me more for being a lawyer than undergrad prepared me for other jobs it was it was more because it's
nearly focused every class is law related is law school one of those ones where you can't go into
it until you have an undergrad and something else yeah you have to have an undergraduate god that's
so fucking stupid you're just here in shakedown after shakedown so then after all that you take a
test that you have to spend thousands of dollars taking and like neither the school nor the test
apparently say you're a good lawyer now right what was your undergrad in uh accounting okay hey
accounting brothers never use it again yeah yeah i know i use it a little bit i had a job
in like kind of finance and a little bit of it after school but um yeah i didn't accounting
didn't really come into the but i you know i selected it when i was 17 i didn't know what i was doing
and i was like i'm kind of i took an accounting class in high school i was like i'm pretty good
at this i guess i'll go to school in that i guess and then by the time i was in my third year i
realized i a didn't want to do that and b i that's when i had a class that had to do with law
and i fell in love with it immediately so i have taken exactly one college level accounting course
i mean i took 10 and it was torture yeah so i'm happy for you yeah you know i made it made
up the other side of that deal by working in the industry for 15 years so right and you know i i
still have a i don't know what you call it when you can't go higher because you don't have the paper
a paper ceiling like i can't go higher than my current position but that's okay because i don't
give a fuck that's so stupid you know and it's it's one of those things too i don't know i don't
think that's gonna happen much in my industry just because if it does if it if they try it all
just change jobs but like uh my wife's dad worked for anheuser bush doing something software related
for 25 years and at some point they made him go take night classes at front range community college
to get a piece of paper saying you can now do this other thing he's like but i've built the whole
thing you guys are working with yes haven't i demonstrated my value or whatever but no apparently
you know it would you like me to leave right well but the thing is i think because big company
10 you know not 10 year but seniority you know great health insurance and all that so yeah it was
a good cushy job for that but um yeah i would never stand for that shit like oh sorry we need to go
back to college and like what are you kidding me mm-hmm are you gonna pay for my classes you know
some places will subsidize education which is kind of cool but even still it's a pain in the butt
takes a lot of time and yep yeah no i'm not i'm not gonna i mean that's how many hours of my life
every week yeah my boss bought all of us because there's only four of us on the team um he bought
us all uh udemy course for docker with this uh technology thing that we're using is that one of
those online yeah okay but he was just like oh i found this really good docker course um let me
send it to you guys and he just he bought us all like he just did that he made me expensive the
company he probably did no yeah well maybe it's he's the kind i think i get the impression he's
super rich is he the company uh not this one but he is yeah he has been the company at previous
companies okay he occasionally mentions like a line like oh yeah like my first company i sold
we did this and like one of the companies i had we did this and um he's never like gone on a length
about it but i think once you're in a high up enough position like anything that you want at the end
of the year you can be like oh yeah that was for the company and move it over to yeah oh yeah i mean
he's the cto uh it's i'm sure and let's i guess you're right let's be real he is absolutely
probably expensing everything he can just because why would right exactly yeah we have some officers
in our company that every now and then we'd like get a credit card bill for six thousand dollars and
we're like all right we'll process it but you really really should go through the normal
channels when doing this this high of a level of expense that's wild anyways um we are here
because we wanted to uh we have you here because we uh saw your posts on the it's the ssc um not
discord the mod subreddit oh the mod yeah the mod which yeah was split off from ssc and uh on there
you are the egos last stand and you put together a whole bunch of really interesting posts about the
derrick schofen case am i pronouncing his name right yeah okay while that was going on on the
monday culture war threat the weekly culture war threads yeah yeah i just like i like how it had to
be because there it's i mean it should just be a thing that you can you know don't it's just at a
high level i thought it was funny that we had to wait for mondays for updates because that was the
the mods day where you could talk about something this culture worry right even though he was just
laying out the up the legal updates yeah yeah and uh it wasn't really i mean i put it in there
because that's where eyeballs tend to you know end up but like i didn't and it is a culture war case
but if you read the posts and if you watch the any of the trial at all it's pretty clear that
culture war isn't really involved yeah i mean that's the thing is that one of the things about
the trial is what it is not you know that all the popular discussion about this case has to do with
race and yet race never came up during the trial not once i don't even think the word was mentioned
and except maybe quickly in vaudeer during during the attorney's questioning of some of the perspective
jurors it just doesn't come up because it's not it's not evidence right he has these three crimes
that he is charged with here is the evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt or doesn't
that he is guilty of these crimes and whether or not he had i mean it could have been relevant if
for example he was charged with a crime requiring some some level of intent but that wasn't the case
here he was he was charged with two different counts of murder but neither of the murder charges
are the type of murder charges that one typically thinks of it's not first degree premeditated
malice of fourth thought requiring the intent to cause a specific harm to a specific person so
what his reason was for doing what he did was really just not that big of a part of the case
and race especially just did not come up whatsoever okay i'm making a quick note that that is where
we are going to start off and we come back to this because as always we start with the i guess
we didn't really as always this time but as typically as typically yes we start with two
less wrong posts that we briefly discuss briefly in quotes i guess it depends on your definition
of briefly and yes we will talk about two less wrong posts first like we typically do and uh
justin you have also read them right so yeah yeah chime in whenever you want to do that for anyone
who is not interested in this at all skip forward i'm assuming 20 minutes or so that's very optimistic
of you i think these are usually 40 well they really i don't know we'll go through fast though
okay no we might not who knows don't lie to the people i mean i think that these are these are
two quick ones and they're they're fairly easy to summarize the logical fallacy of generalization
from fictional evidence is one of my favorites because when phrased that way it tells you the
exact point of it yeah and i i once in a while bring this up and i phrase it like this way you
know if uh someone was mentioning their uh like their dislike of uh smart house things because
apparently there's a movie in the 90s or early 2000s called smart house okay or smart home or
whatever and obviously i think it was a disney or like a younger population movie so at the very
least it turns on them makes their lives annoying i forget what it does because i never saw the movie
but they were like no i don't want all the you know the smart lights and uh the the electronic
assistants that if i say its name it'll start talking to us um you know i don't want any of
that stuff because i you know i saw this movie smart house and i'm like you know we should be
careful about generalizing from fictional evidence right because when you say that it's like you
know you realize you're making your case from something that someone just made up like it is
it couldn't be couldn't be more facetious way to base like base any belief on like oh no we should
really be careful not to uh to i don't know god during a full moon because of werewolves or something
right like it is exactly that level of of of reinforcement there you need a separate argument
for why this makes any sense yes and yeah that's it's wonderful he says people some get it some
people get it and right away and laugh and that is yeah that's the level we're talking on right now
but he also goes deeper into that about uh why this is something to worry about even if you do
realize that it's fictional evidence and shouldn't be used in any sort of real evidence so i'm going
to go into a little bit more on that part because that's the more interesting part i think totally
well they're both interesting but more applicable to our audience that one's easy and doesn't need
anything worth talking about the other one is is deeper yes as he says there are subtler ways to
go wrong um i'm going to okay so uh the first of all he makes the point that requirements storytelling
are not the same as requirements of forecasting obviously stories don't use probability distributions
and makes a really cool example about you know the hero walked into this room and looked right
left and then right or possibly right and then left and then was holding one of these various
weapons and gives percentage possibilities for each one and then his uh loyal sidekick joined
in afterwards and some scholars say that it was this sidekick and he died soon after but other
scholars say that it was this sidekick and lasted through the rest of the adventure and that's just
not a very good story unless it's worth unless it's worth the candle but that is the sort of thing
that you would say if you were actually trying to make a prediction right you give various probability
distributions rather than just this is exactly what happens uh but he says you know but that's
not even the real problem on problems with large answer spaces the greatest difficulty is not verifying
the correct answer but simply locating it in answer space to begin with if someone starts out by asking
whether or not ai's are going to put us in capsules like in the matrix they're jumping to a hundred
bit proposition without a corresponding 98 bits of evidence to locate it in the answer space as a
possibility worthy of explicit consideration imagine for a second someone dedicating a great
deal of their time towards preventing that specific outcome it almost sounds insane right you know if
they're if they want to go to the McVeigh style and blow up uh computer buildings i don't know exactly
what he did but whatever they want to go Sarah Connor and start blowing up computer science
buildings let's generalize from that fictional evidence yeah um then sure you know then you're
then you're solving a wider problem from whatever you think you're doing but if all you're going to
do is keep the matrix our boss from putting you in pods to harvest your BTUs that seems like a really
weirdly specific goal right yeah yeah he points out that normally if you were trying to locate
something worthy of consideration you'd do things like weighing what you know and don't know what you
can and can't predict trying to avoid biases and widen confidence intervals pondering which
questions are the important ones trying to adjust for black swans but jumping simply to matrix yes
or no skips over all of those steps matrix yes or no yeah i mean yes or no skips over all the steps
unless you just answered no right i mean i guess but but but jumping jumping to that to that
binary question yeah the fact that someone even brought that up yeah is there any sort of now
that i thinking about is there any sort of um similar thing in the law field privileging the
hypothesis sort of thing well i will say that um when it comes to i mean this is kind of off topic
but uh part of the i like his is uh example in the post about having to figure like assigning
probabilities to each and every uh like individual thing that happens and and you know as when you're
an attorney and you're especially when you're reading uh like in discovery like a police report
the police have written it down in a certain way right but you have to kind of read between
the lines and try to find where they may have completely missed what they actually did you
know what i'm saying so like because they wrote it in a way that's beneficial to them
so like even though this doesn't really have anything to do directly with the post that did
kind of hit me where it's like oh yeah i have to find those probability distributions in a sense
all the time because you know they'll say that they did this but i mean realistically most cops
don't do that and also if he did this instead that would be really bad for him but he wrote it the
way that is really good for him well that's convenient you know what if what if he didn't
do it that way and so you have to try to dig through more evidence to find you know whether
or not he's actually or she's actually being accurate in the report not really related to the
post but that's something that that made me think of yeah that's you have to find the where the errors
are could be do a lot of defense lawyers do that or are you just like really good no you have to do
it i mean yeah i mean that's like that's you know defending someone one-on-one i mean the cops are
gonna write what they did in a report and they're gonna do it i mean they i think they're mostly
pretty honest but they're gonna either make mistakes or do things in a way that is beneficial to them
and that is subconsciously what they want to believe they did all right that is illegal where
you forgot one line of the Miranda rights or something right and so like for example uh you
know when you're pulled over for a suspected dy you have to be read that you can get a blood test
or a breath test if they flub that line and only offer you one the results of that entire test
whatever you choose could be thrown out completely and so that case goes away right is this a great
idea to always hit record whenever police approach you for anything i don't see why it wouldn't be
i mean you you want to i mean most cops today have body cam when they're uh engaging with a
civilian for like any reason but um i mean there's really no harm in having more recordings i can only
imagine what practicing must have been like before there was video of everything and you had to just
go by the cop's word and you had nothing else i mean you could say that they're probably full of
shit but how do you know yeah nowadays we have cameras that sometimes will show you that they are
full of shit or show you that they're at least somewhat wrong in a really relevant way you know
before we back up their case like at the very least it's like look we can all we've all seen the film
like i the idea of just having actual evidence as opposed to someone telling a convincing story
there was a literal stabbing in process yeah there's a couple quick things one is uh mike
probiglia is a good stand-up comic he doesn't really tell jokes as much as he tells like 70
minute stories and it might have been his first netflix special or his second the like the big
thing he keeps coming back to is he was in a car accident where he got t-boned an intersection
and the cop who wrote the report said that car a came through the intersection and was struck
from the side by car a and he was car a who came through the intersection and car b struck him but
the cop put car a for both and he just went nuts arguing you know calling the cop over like every day
for months trying to get him on the phone he tried to take it to court and the final obvious typo
it was and what ended up happening was he got finally got the cop on the phone and he's like
look you said this and he's like just do the right thing and pay the guy and he's like no no you
don't understand you made a mistake and he's like just just do the right thing and pay it up and so
of course this drove mike insane and he's trying to figure this out but apparently it was like
ruining his life and he's just told by his friends like dude just drop it yes he were right
but he during the show he brings the police report he blows it up on a big screen behind him so you
can show dude you can feel his passion getting nuts about it that is like that is the best revenge
become successful and like point this shit out yeah nice i mean yeah i'm sure he made more than the
cost of whatever he lost in that that case you know telling that story on netflix right i suppose
but it's still infuriating oh yeah you could you can tell he's he's he's he's passed the period
where he's obsessed about it but during the show you know he you can still tell he's getting impassioned
about it um i was thinking your probability is in court though you know there's like um what do you
call this uh switch flipping the denominator or something there's a there's a general word for it
so uh guys on trial for killing his wife um the defendant the defendant the defense says
almost no husbands kill their wives you know it's gotta be one in a hundred thousand or whatever it
is right and that is not the the number you're looking for the number is given dead wife what
are the odds that the husband did it right which is much much higher right and so that's that's the uh
that's where i can kind of see like actual numbers coming in um and then of course there's actual
numbers that you you know whatever the numbers are they're available and so i could just imagine
someone trying that switcheroo and being like i don't look almost nobody does this and it's like
he's not almost nobody he's the he's the person of interest for a reason well i did while we were
talking i just thought of an example of generalizing from fictional evidence in the law one that i've
seen quite a few times so back when i was a law clerk that's when i've seen the vast majority
of the trials i've seen because i was working for judges who would have trials you know every other
week so i've seen like 30 or so trials that happened here in arapaho county um and i the beauty of
that job is i was able to talk to the jurors before during and after trial before and during you
kind of stay mum because there's certain things that if you say can cause real problems but afterwards
there's no rules you can ask them anything you want about what made them come to their decision
and one thing that often they would say especially after an acquittal is that there was the the
evidence they expected to be there which i assume i i i'm guessing is based on csi you know they wanted
more dna you know they wanted something that more directly ties them now i think it has kind of a
fortuitous outcome i mean if if we're going to be you know beyond a reasonable doubt it's a pretty
high standard if you're close i think that you know the tie should go to the runner and they
probably shouldn't be convicted but at the same time there's a lot of people who expect
that that level of evidence should be there and then the state just doesn't have the resources
for that level of evidence to be in every single you know domestic violence case yeah and so it's
just not there and and the guy ends up walking because of it i have heard um yeah prosecuting
attorneys really hate csi because it makes everyone expect these unreasonable standards which
may not even exist in real life yeah i mean i think it's it's subtle i don't think most people
actually expect that but i think when they're presented with the case they finally realize
oh that's that's all they have is the testimony of a police officer maybe one video a couple of
things i was expecting something more and and i think that probably comes from seeing in in fictional
situations a very thorough case though the cases that you see on tv would be like the derrick
chauvin trial it would be the most high profile type stuff that's when all the effort is put in
that's when you spend millions of dollars on forensics right yeah yeah when it's just a dude
beating up his wife it's like i got 10 more of these to get to tonight i don't have a million
dollars for each one right exactly man that sucks anyways yeah yes uh the thing i found
super interesting about this is uh this thing that i pulled out aliases says in the ancestral
environment there were no moving pictures what you saw with your own eyes was true it will be hard
enough to undo the damage by deliberate concentration why invite the vampire into your house in chaser
go every wasted move is a loss in rationality any non-evidential influence is on average entropic
and like i really like that because it feels true to me it feels i guess it's truthy
where the when you see something and god especially like on tv you see the close-ups of
people crying and you get all emotionally invested in it like it feels like you're seeing something
that actually happened which is why we care that like no you can't do that to scarlet witch
she's a good person stop fucking her but um i was wondering like is this a general argument
against fiction i will just raise the point that inyosh made a marvel reference well before it even
crossed my mind to do so i think i think my my obsession is contagious um the you you've mentioned
the fact yeah that he wrote hpm or so yeah well that was gonna be my my next follow-up to that
i shouldn't have jumped the gun sorry yeah but is it is it a case against fiction in general that
fiction since it literally is made up and you know it's it's lies and uh it is altering what you see
in the world or it is giving you something to see in the world that you're going to somehow on some
emotion level internalize so is it just is it just fucking up your picture of the reality to
consume fiction i think that's a pretty weak rebuttal against it you know i mean like people
enjoy fiction so much yeah the idea that it's slightly warping your view of reality it's probably
some truth to that but like compared to the the beauty that you see in fiction you know how how
much joy you get how you know i would say that fictional works are one of the things that make
life worth living yeah you know and so like the fact that it's warping your view of reality and
unless you give me a really clear cut very poisonous example the fact that it's i guess
suppose it is literally a case against fiction to some extent but it's just not very convincing in
my opinion okay i think you're supposed to get lessons and wisdom and fun from fiction not facts
right and so that said lessons can be misapplied to reality or properly applied to reality right
yeah 1984 was a fiction and yet the author clearly intended for some aspects of it to be
hey be mindful of this right um you know it's if uh terminators are great example right terminators
are great fun story the lesson you shouldn't take from it is that robots will uh look like humans
and track you down they will like that if you build an artificial intelligence it will make
robots with two legs and two arms and glowing red eyes and a gun um that's not the lesson you should
take from it um maybe it could be general lesson about technological hubris or something right
or more than that it's just fucking fun watching Arnold Schwarzenegger be a terminator right the
one of the interesting parts of a terminator is that like the lesson you learn early on is
the vast majority of humankind is wiped out when the ai tricks the us and the soviet union
into exchanging nuclear weapons but like all you actually see in the movie is one robot tracking
one other person because that's the really exciting part but yeah the the the way the the ai
actually wiped out humanity was you know hacking people's beliefs and uh and threat responses
i just watched last night the episode of brick and morty in season four that was like three minutes
the episode was just snakes hissing it was like the the snake i forget what episode i think season
four episode five yeah um they they get time travel standing against the snakes do and so like
there's snake hitler and there's snake uh uh abraham lincoln and when one guy goes back in
time to kill snake hitler this other teleporting snake shows up right behind him from time shoots
him the another one teleports in shoots him and then from that the outside of the building you
see start seeing snake piles body up that's what you would have expected to happen a terminator
if they had a time machine right you drop a bunch of them and they do something kind of like that
in the one uh i don't know they went off the rails on the tree of time well that one for sure
that's an alexander whale short story everyone should check out but uh in one of the terminator
movies they do they actually play with the idea that time did something um there was the one
in the first terminator the thing was they built the time machine the ai built the time machine
just as the humans were getting in and so it only had time to send out one terminator before the
human smashed it so and then and then threw back their own person well yeah before the humans i
guess grabbed it yeah but you know and then as the movies went on they're just like oh actually
had a time to throw back two no no there was time to throw back three machines and yeah i mean if
depending on how hard it is to change the time on these things i would have set the robot to go
back 30 minutes and guard the door so that i could bring in more robots to do the actual
important mission right right maybe yeah all right um but you know it it is what it is it wouldn't
have been a fun story if it was just the snake episode of rick and morty right yeah might have
been a fun episode if it was branches at the tree of time but um yeah rick so you told her this
takes longer than 20 minutes all right fine i had a great time with it though but yeah so so i was
wondering what can we extrapolate from the fact that the person who said this thing implying that
all fiction is a deliberate skewing of your uh of your vision of reality is also the person who
wrote harry potter and methods of rationality in rationality any any non-evidential influence is
on average and tropic um i don't know if like when when i draw lessons from methods of rationality
i'm not thinking and here's how i will get good at quidditch right um i'm thinking uh i'm trying to
generalize the lessons of the characters like their actions their their their failures their
successes that sort of thing um in a way that's not specific on the evidence of the world in
particular but more generalizable plus like when harry monologues and just talks about
science like he's citing real world papers yeah right um i guess if i am going to take the other
side of that argument though if i'm gonna generalize like if i'm going to try to try and internalize
wisdom from the lessons of the characters or something uh i'm doing that in a fictional
setting from a fictional universe you know real world lessons probably are way different than how
to you know if if someone's plotting to ruin my life it probably won't look like lucius malphoy
doing it right right it'll probably look way different so maybe i shouldn't generalize too
much from that kind of lesson my thought upon upon contemplating this was that eliezer knows
exactly what he's doing and he's trying to introduce fictional evidence into the minds of
everyone who reads this in order to steer the future in a way that is what he considers more um
less likely to kill all of humanity and i don't know that seems almost dark artsy but also like
i like it and also i love hpm or so you know i'm not about to complain but yeah that's that's an
interesting thing to think and the more i thought about it like all of us don't have perfect views
of reality anyway right we could use some adjusting in some way so if you consume a piece of fiction
that uses fictional evidence to adjust your priors more towards the way the world really is that's
not helpful it's just really hard to you know target stories to people where it would help them
as opposed to hurt them necessarily yeah this reminds me of a you mentioned perfect views
reality there's a Saturday morning breakfast cereal comic um let's see it would have been shoot
i can't find it right away oh there it is qasp um quality as shitty or qualia are shitty perception
and so like the perfect view of reality he's imagining that if we had like a way to get
perfect of quantum level information about reality we could call it uh x quali x quali x
qualiver quali quali uber it's easier to read than it is to say um it didn't even think of that
okay like all right yeah if we could get perfect information on the on the thing then there'd be
no disagreement right what's it like to be a bad well that's a stupid question because bats have
shitty perception it's they had if they had perfect quality perception then this wouldn't be a problem
um i kind of forgot the rest of my point because i was thinking of the comics so yeah yep i i like
that use of fiction and like i said i just like fiction in general yeah i don't think the author
takes a hard stand against fiction or would have spent five years writing harry potter fan fiction
and reading tons of fiction so yeah um i think i think the key like i said is just not to run from
i saw this in a movie therefore i should be concerned about it happening in real life
depending on what the movie you know on how applicable the movie is and that's maybe a harder
lesson to get right you know yeah i mean in just just the whole idea of be cautious of
exposing yourself to fictional evidence i think is an interesting idea to ponder
and i'm not sure how to incorporate it into my life considering how much i love fiction i don't
know what it would mean you know like if you're watching a slasher fic with a home invasion you
might learn some general lessons about like what not to do because it gets every family every
movie like that killed right that said you're assuming that people are going to break into your
house are going to be like people in the movie right uh really the solution is go upstairs grab
your shotgun and just sit with your back facing the door um or excuse me sit with your back against
the wall and face the door uh i mean that might happen in a horror movie i don't know it i think
just go forth have fun and don't grab a specific conclusion from fiction and say we should be we
should be worried about exactly this unless you can make a good independent case why yeah right um
you know again if you're if you're worried about 1984 state like government stuff um you can point
to well look you know what you what you probably shouldn't do is say well look these three things
happened and then it became like you know dystopia from 1984 but you can say these people weren't very
happy the author was a pretty savvy guy people aren't happy now and we're we're kind of checking
these boxes right um because it it it seems more applicable to human psychology it's kind of like
generalizing from actual history that's that's what he goes on to say in the rest of the post
that uh people don't actually treat this like as a prophecy or as real evidence but
emotionally it feels like you know this is something that happened in the past or this
happened over in a different country so how are we gonna address it he says that uh journalists
don't believe the future will contain borg they don't believe star trek as a prophecy but when
someone talks about brain computer interfaces they think will the future contain borg not how
do i know computer assisted telepathy makes people less nice which the second question is you know
the real question but but you go with the emotional affect of like oh hey what if there's
borg in the future that's what happened when this happened in star trek so what are borg oh my god
wow you're right this is the your bimonthly reminder that i haven't seen star trek wow we need
to know everything is a star trek episode but they're like a collective intelligence mind and
there's like these individual mindless drones who just like steal technology and have no care for
lives so whatever they destroy they just it's like if it doesn't matter to them at all they're
like a hive mind species and yeah the individuals yeah they're drones they don't matter kind of
like a less coordinated uh buggers from enders game yes okay i could follow that yeah so you don't
want that but you're right so i think that that you can watch that and say this might be a you
know an actual downside of doing human mind interface telepathy or something right but like
the better question is but you focus on the actual thing not borgs yeah or borg if it's not plural
doesn't look like it's plural right all right okay so that was that post it was a very interesting one
and the next one is another classic of the sequences hold off on proposing solutions
and this uh anyone who's read hpm or will be familiar with this one uh but the gist of it is
that when a group faces a problem the natural tendency of its members is to propose possible
solutions as they begin to discuss the problem and consequently the group interaction focuses on
the merits and problems of those proposed solutions uh when a researcher enacted an edict to enhance
group problem solving the edict was do not propose solutions until the problem has been discussed
as thoroughly as possible without suggesting any and this did very well i do i do try to keep this
in mind and this one's not that hard to do especially when working in groups um if you're
trying to figure something out or work on a solution to a problem um it especially if you
remember to bring it up early depending on if you're dealing with people who have heard the
phrase or not um it is very helpful to say hold on before we start trying to answer the question
let's discuss the problem a little more and i find that very helpful to do with work things with
non-work things with whatever but anyone who's read like you said method of rationality particularly
chapter 25 chat named you guessed it hold off on proposing solutions is already familiar with
the lesson of this one i i'd hate to put you on the spot again but i don't really hate that because
that's why i brought you here um fair enough is is there i'm assuming that in trials there's a lot
of not proposing solutions and trying to map out the problem space first but maybe i'm wrong about
this well i mean you should by the time you're at trial all of the issues should have been
meted out by then i'm not sure what you mean you usually i mean trials they have their fair share
of things that come up that fuck things up but for the most part whatever the main issues are
are already handled before trial oh you should always already out of the way by then so you're
just trying to convince the jury yeah you have your story and i have mine and we're gonna tell
our stories and see whether or not the jury thinks you're guilty of what they're charged with beyond
a reasonable doubt but like as far as like an evidentiary issue like whether something should
be allowed to come in that's already handled by this time um so i guess it's all the pre-trial
work where you're right okay yeah there's usually those several stages before a trial starts where
you would you would handle those issues ahead of time and mostly because if you handle them during
trial what that actually looks like is the jury just sitting around doing nothing for long periods
of time or being told to just sit in their jury room which is this tight little room that no one
wants to be in for more than five minutes and just having them sit in there for two hours and then
you know you have to check in on them every so often be like sorry guys it's gonna be another 30
minutes and they're like uh-huh sure you know what i mean it's just a noise people slows everything down
so yeah you always get that stuff done well ahead of time how how much pre-trial work is there for
each pre-trial well depends on the case yeah it depends on the case i mean for there's some cases
where it's just pretty clear that there's gonna be a plea agreement pretty early on and so you're
just doing some very basic like you'll review the discovery you'll you'll reach out to the prosecution
talk to them a little bit you'll you know ask for your client to provide some mitigation you know
like what you know let's make them see you as more than just the crime that you're charged with
so that you get a better deal but then there's some stuff where okay well there was this there's
this huge like maybe maybe one event that occurred there was like i'm thinking of one in particular
client i had who there were several witnesses to the crime they gave some statements on the scene
to the police officers but it was very bare bones and this was a case we thought might go to trial so
we actually hired a private investigator to go and interview those witnesses further and you want
to get those also like videotaped so you can also maybe have them transcribed if you ever call them
and they go on the stand and they're going off of they're going off track from what they said
you can impeach them with that you can say well isn't it true that on this date you had an interview
with so-and-so and isn't it true that you know you said this on that date you know so so impeaching
is like the technical term for dunking on someone yeah basically yeah it's an impeachment impeachment
is the is legally making someone look like a like a liar okay that's what impeachment evidence
basically is is trying to make you look like a bad witness thank you full of shit it was it's
what i've learned because justin i've had several talks on like how law works and it is so
disappointingly even like more convoluted than i would have guessed so like the like what you'd
like to imagine ideally you would start with not even really a defense and prosecution you would
start with like a an objective like what happened here right and then what then the cynic might think
oh no what you've got is the defense who starts with the default assumption they didn't do it let's
try and prove it and the prosecution who says they did it let's prove it it's not even like that
right it's so much more there's so many more twists and turns in there where it's like the
defense is like oh he totally did it but did he do the exact charge that they brought to bear
no can we mitigate that you know like it's it's just makes me glad i uh will probably never end
up in a courtroom because i don't break that many laws um yeah please don't yeah it sounds like a
nightmare i don't want to represent your ass i would i would have wouldn't it be on an ethical
fee to represent him oh no i just i i don't think i'd have the patience for it no i'd be like
you just go on a murder spree in the middle of the courtroom or i'd be like look can i just
i'll say whatever you want can i just how long how long do i serve in jail to get out of out of
this courtroom yeah five years five oh my god i'm kidding i don't i don't know yeah i'm definitely
not being your attorney if you're gonna say something like that oh you do you are on record
as a pre caving to torture so that's right yeah am i just if anyone needs to remind you if you're
gonna torture me i will just bet i'll i'll break right away you don't even have to start breaking
my fingers yeah but that just makes it really easy for someone to say hey i'm gonna torture you if you
don't give me five bucks by all means i mean it has to be a plausible threat of torture okay yeah
you they actually got to be holding a hammer and yeah i was gonna ask you if someone asked me for
five bucks and they had a hammer uh yeah i'd probably say yes that's like here's ten oh yeah yeah here's
one per finger cool so in the post he gives an example problem with employees rotating around to him
to not get bored in their jobs but that reduces efficiency and then the some groups were given
the edict of don't propose any solutions until you've discussed the problem as much detail as possible
and some aren't and the response or results here was that those who are not given the edict
immediately those not given the edict immediately begin uh like start they hear the problem and then
start with solutions as their first like vocalizations on the subject and then argue about the solutions
yes if they're told hold off on proposing solutions they discuss the problem more yeah and then they
actually arrive at the what in this situation turns out to be the ideal solution of what
rotating the senior member around or something rotating the top two and let it be yeah worst
Wednesday but uh that's fun as i remember hearing this example in school oh really yeah okay but it's
been so long i can't remember it was must have brought up in this context but it makes me think
how many things i've read from the sequences that i remember in school i must have had a pretty good
psych education yeah well i mean you did go into the psych college course i guess what's funny is like
in high school i took prime due in high school i took i took psychology in high school and i was
like ap psychology in high school which is what like 90 minutes a day three days a week or something
or maybe maybe an hour a day five days a week whatever the schedule was point is it was like
about the amount of contact hours you get for half of an undergraduate degree because you're there for
70 minutes twice a week or some bullshit for a two credit class or three credit i forget what the
numbers are but it's the amount of contact i got in high school was on par with what i got in college
when it came to the actual subjects i wanted to take nice um yeah it it was uh pointed out that
those that were given the edict immediately begin to argue about the importance of productivity
versus worker autonomy and avoidance of boredom but those who are told not to discuss solutions
at all were much more likely to arrive at the solution of just rotating the two more capable
workers i wonder if this replicates i'm assuming it does because this doesn't ding at all on my
bullshit o meter um but that said you know this would be easy enough for more people to go back
and test so uh if it did hit that replication crisis business someone by now could have done it again
or under various guises with different questions there is the claim made that when groups are
faced with very tough problems that's when group members are most apt to propose solutions immediately
which like was kind of shocking to me is that the case i don't know where he got that um it
what what he points out then is like if the problem is how do we keep humanity from being
extinct in 500 years people have an answer like that right solve global warming or you know build
a gi yeah build a gi don't build robots you know whatever it is somebody's got an answer for that
right when in fact the problem is really hard um i and it and people if you have an answer to that
ready and you haven't spent a long time thinking about it you should probably reconsider that answer
right yeah he goes on to say that the effectiveness of our decisions is determined only by whatever
evidence and processing we did in first arriving at our decisions after you write the bottom line
it is too late to write more reasons above and this is a great time to plug the uh previous
less wrong post what it's called the bottom line right what's the name of it yeah which
made this point in more formal detail if you make your decision very early on it will in fact be
based on very little thought yeah and since we change our minds less often than we think which
again note back to that less wrong post uh once you can guess what your answer will be you have
probably already decided and if you can guess your answer half a second after hearing the question
then you have about half a second in which to be intelligent which is not great did you want to
jump in with anything i think i'm good okay just making sure because didn't want to like leave you
out i want to grab the last bullet point because i've got a good example of this okay um traditional
rationality emphasizes falsification the ability to relinquish an initial opinion when confronted
by clear evidence against it and i like this just meta note he he talks about traditional
rationality is basically like paparian science um which i think has tons of value but he brings
it down because it's it's a great bar and it's a lot it's very valuable but he's like we can do
better if we try harder that's the whole point of modern rationality as i guess as you'd call it
yeah um once an idea gets into your head it'll probably require way too much evidence to get it
out again worse we don't always have the luxury of overwhelming evidence i suspect that a more powerful
and more difficult method is to hold off on thinking of an answer to suspend draw out that tiny moment
when we can't yet guess what our answer will be let's giving our intelligence a longer time in
which to act even half a minute would be an improvement over half a second right um that
makes me think of darwin's on the origin of species we're in just evolution all together
that is a very unintuitive and confusing conclusion to come to so it's unlikely that he
he started with the idea you know what i bet we're literally cousins with bananas
and then went out to go prove that right um it it's the kind of thing when you're and maybe i just
you know my my i got the the five minute overview in school i'm sure but my my real introduction
to it that i i'm sure most of my references go to in my brain without knowing it is richard dockins
um uh the greatest show on earth and he spends like the first five chapters just daisy chain
walking you to the basics of evolution he does not start from the beginning you know from the the
the conclusion and give you all the evidence for it he walks you from wherever your starting point is
you get to fully understand it by halfway through the book or most the way through the book anyway
and it and it's when it when it's presented that way in the very incremental step you can
sit in that moment of uncertainty for a long time and i imagine that's how it was initially
discovered right i think most confusing things that like many i think most big problems are
probably solved that way where there was a long period of people not really know what's going on
they just go out and measure stuff and like then they're thinking okay well hold on if this flower
so deep and i'm only seeing these kinds of butterflies or these kinds of birds like there's
gotta be a bird with a beak deep enough to get into that flower right like because that's that's
all the rest of these getting pollinated you're just you're out there seeing these things and
try and solve the the excellent you know to get an explanation for it um the the eventual conclusion
is again like that that's my favorite fact you know like it's it's fun and cosmological to think
about that your you know your body is made of stardust like that's awesome but to me my my one
sentence of zinger for like mind-blowingness is like we are literally cousins with bananas like
that it's that is so uh i don't you know what i mean it's just it's fun it reminds me did you
see that terrible alien prequel prometheus yes i did it was so bad but at the very beginning like
this very humanoid looking dude just like a really tall bald dude i think they're like 10 feet tall
or something comes to earth put some black goo in uh water and eventually that is like what helps
make the humans right if you say so i forgot the movement yeah i haven't seen this since it came out
so but yeah that was that was the thing that was like this will uh help seed the intelligence
into this planet and this like this was done as life is first evolving on earth maybe even before
that like we see barren rocks at the beginning of the movie and it was pointed out that like
after the millions of years have passed where we get from that little black goo to humans
like we're more closely related to strawberries than we are to the aliens that first seeded the
planet and yet somehow we look exactly like them except a few feet shorter right yeah it's it seems
to strain credulity that um it's basically just people not knowing how evolution enforced oh yeah
yeah i mean that my favorite example of that is x-men yes it opens up with with sir patrick stewart
talking about you know evolution once you know one small genetic mutate mutation it's like suddenly
you can throw lightning bolts right or teleport or control minds or move metal uh yeah you know uh this
my this gene flipped and now suddenly i can move metal of my mind um yeah i mean that's it's all
fun and good though uh i do think this ties a bit into the um fictional evidence post though
because when he says the ability to relinquish an initial opinion when confronted by clear
evidence against it is what traditional reality is based on traditional rationality uh but once
you have an idea in your head it'll probably require way too much evidence to get it out again
like seems sort of like a argument for not getting um unreality founded evidence into your head
yeah i mean depending on you know how how wedded am i to any belief i got from watching a movie um
i'm trying to think of any movies i've seen recently that weren't you know uh i i just saw
a movie like in the last couple of days what did i watch oh i watched a movie last night uh it was a
polish or uh polish it was a danish movie with madz michelson could have been better for the
polish movie the reason i thought it was polish because i watched a trailer for a polish netflix
series uh i think it's i forget might be like the word orgasm came up a lot in the trailer
okay uh these these high school or college girls make an orgasm app or something and i was like
this isn't polish inyash could watch it and understand it um be hard my polish is bad there's
subtitles you could relearn polish watching this and i'm like this might be good but i'm not going
to pilot a show you know that i have to watch it read subtitles anyway this this uh this danish
movie was subtitled and it was like an action comedy because the the the humor there was very
different point is i saw a movie last night and i'm not i'm not taking any lessons from that movie
none whatsoever um you know the there's there's nothing it was and yet now you hate danish people
just a little bit more than yesterday what does that mean with with people not liking danish people
oh i don't know is that a thing like it seems to be a joke um i mean i wasn't sure whether i
should go with love or hate danish people more and i was like yeah hate's more um you know in
cindy area i'll go with that one there was a joke on a tv show called better off ted where
she played the sister on arrest development i forget her name um she played like this this
ceo portia something yeah portia something okay anyway um and i forget what it was oh and there
was also like a like a picture i saw on reddit it was like someone's lawn sign it's like you know we
love uh you know we love um muslims jews christians various nationalities various races except danes
fuck danes and like it was clearly a joke but then uh um Veronica on better off ted makes a similar
joke and he's like is that why you hate danish people i don't hate danish people i love them
that's why i hold them to a higher standard nice so there must be some background meme to this
i'll have to look into it why do people hate the danes i know that uh the us and um what the
Netherlands i believe is where the danish are located uh have a special uh friendship treaty
that makes it much easier for americans to go and become danish residents permanently cool
yeah i guess i guess we hate them so much that we made a special friendship treaty with them
just to keep them in check keep your friends closer they make delicious pastries your enemies
called danish yeah yeah i went to the Whole Foods last night to buy some we've gotten off
topic as we always do we should get back onto the top of the murder all right well before that we've
got a quick uh speaking of murder muggings our next time we've got Pascal's mugging tiny probabilities
of vast utilities and illusion of transparency why no one understands you again two classics
from the less wrong genre speaking of Pascal's mugging i was Pascal's mugged by myself to buy
50 bucks for the doge coin in january okay and it worked nice like so i i brought this up on the
live episode what i ended up doing is i sold off uh i don't know how many coins it turned out to be
but 500 bucks worth is that how much you put in originally i put in 50 originally and then i put
in like a hundred bucks or 200 or something at some point so i think i've made two x my investment
so now no matter what happens yeah i've got 6 000 left nice so in the event that they ever become
worth 10 000 i'm going to go uh i don't know buy a yacht and set it on fire to see what color it turns
right um that sounds like a terrible idea but you know it's your money yeah my money i'll do whatever
i want yeah i will i will light cigars with hundred dollar bills that just sounds gross you know what
i mean though i i do know what you mean but on the on the chance they have returned to 10 bucks i made
a nice pretty chunk of change and i'm not gonna like obsess about it now because i was just worried
like you know what if i mix the money for like burning your money in a terrible way just hookers
and blow because at least then you get hookers and blow out of it right i suppose yeah i mean i guess
if i want to be as cheap as or like as as gauche as possible i'd get like a gold plated toilet seat
or something but at least then you get a gold plated toilet seat out of it yeah anyway it's we
are here to talk about murder well it turns out it's murder yes yeah legally it is yeah legally
we can say now that it was the murder of george flood i suppose that is that is true uh i would
caution just because it's not murder like i said before in the traditional sense but it is still
a form of murder um and that is i think where we wanted to kick off anyway because that's where
you had left that's what you were talking about when we feared course away so um what is the the
distinctions about the murders so well you typically when you think of murder you think of
pre-meditation and intent to cause harm you know that someone has done something wrong or whatever
and you intentionally harmed them right that's not really what happened here or at least even
if you say that that is what happened that's not what Derek Chauvin was charged with or found guilty
of he's found guilty of two different types of murder the first the the legal terms are
second-degree unintentional murder and third-degree murder but those are a little confusing the better
way to think of them as a felony murder was the first one which is the commission of an inherently
dangerous felony that results in a death um usually inherently dangerous felonies are things
like burglaries arsons rapes robberies kidnappings if you do something like that and someone ends
up dead you've committed a felony and someone died that is considered murder even though it's not
murder in the traditional sense like you would think of it could be but like it's because you
could imagine someone committing a rape and then killing someone afterwards basically on purpose
but even if they accidentally die that is still murder i heard like at least one case where someone
was robbing a bank shot a gun into the air and uh someone with a weak heart like had a heart attack
and then they were convicted of felony murder for that yeah yeah that's absolutely possible
it depends on the jurisdiction they some have a little defined differently but uh that's yeah
absolutely possible it seems like uh you know again i'm glad we're just invigorating the word
murder because it's pretty loaded again when i picture murder i picture me whatever going to a
store buying a gun loading with bullets and going to someone's house and shooting them in the face
right if i'm in a bar scrap and of course i'm describing things i never do um and whatever i
get into a good swing or the guy has you know slips on a spilled beer or something and cracks his
head on the ground while you're fighting while i while i fighting him i've murdered him basically or
a prosecution could make a case that i've murdered right yeah because he certainly wouldn't have died
if we weren't in a fist fight um so this that's that's more of the kind of crime that uh show
when it was charged with yeah it was so the predicate felony meaning the felony that he was
committing that when the death occurred it became felony murder was uh interestingly it was assault
and the reason i say that's interesting is that i i'm not i know it's the vast majority it may even
be all except minnesota where this crime happened um that defines felony murder in such a way that
that would not be possible he may have been convicted in the only state where that type of
felony murder is possible but isn't it entirely possible to accidentally murder someone while
you're assaulting them right but i mean that could still be like another form of oh that'd be like
manslaughter it'd be like maybe a second degree intentional murder where it's like it's not where
you're intending to cause harm they end up dying so you're still guilty of murder but it's not like
premeditation you weren't intending to kill them okay right so there's there's different layers the
reason it was second degree unintentional is like i said this this doesn't require any intent to cause
harm specifically to them um but for it to be felony murder you have to have committed a felony
usually the felony has to be the type of felony that murder does not itself imply
murder does not imply a rape murder does not imply a robbery if you've murdered someone you
doesn't mean at all that you've committed either of those things right but an assault every murder
implicates an assault and so there's something called the merger doctrine where in almost all
states the assault merges with the second degree in this case that we were just talking about murder
right it wouldn't be charged with murder and also assault and all the other
minor charges i mean you could and you could be convicted of all but you'd only be sentenced for
the one right so um it's it's a little interesting chauvin was a little unlucky in this in this um
in this case just because usually something like felony assault cannot be the predicate felony
for felony murder it has to be something more like arson where a murder does not imply that an
arson happened but he still got the other murder charge anyway which is in all states right the
not felony murder but the um depraved heart that was going to get into the next one is third degree
murder which again you say second degree third degree it's a little confusing so instead depraved
heart murder which is an act that is so reckless and careless that it shows like um i mean you can
look up case law that will describe this in eight billion different ways but essentially that you
do not give a shit about human life you create it you'd commit an act so vile and reckless
that it was clear that you did not care whether someone lived or died and i think that's a great
description of what he did yeah well i mean just my own personal opinion i wasn't there for the
trial or anything sure sure and that makes sense but it's actually the most controversial of all
of his charges oh really because i mean originally it was dismissed by the judge outright as not
legally possible huh uh because and and this is why i think the jury convicted him but why it was
the the judge was if he on whether it shouldn't be allowed is that the way that you're taught in
law school the way it's taught like for the bar exam the all that stuff to brave heart murder usually
means an act to generally like the people usually the the classic example is firing a gun wildly into
a crowd right you're not aiming your your at a at a person right there's no gen there's no target
specifically you're just doing something really reckless and crazy and someone gets hit and dies
right whereas in this case it was you know aimed all his you know all chauvin's actions were aimed
directly at george fluid right so it is not the traditional um definition of to brave heart
murder however the prosecution um charged him with it argued that it should be allowed the
judge originally dismissed it but then in between when the judge dismissed it and when the trial
started there was a case from the minnesota court of appeals that came down that you know was right
on exactly this issue and they said nope it can definitely be charged so he added it back in and
yeah and he was convicted of that as well um so that's uh the the exact phrasing is
an act that is eminently dangerous to others which makes it sound like on its face that it's an act
that's dangerous to like lots of people right okay but the way that it was defined in the jury
instruction an act eminently dangerous to others is just an act that is highly likely to cause death
so the jurors don't have that legal background where to pray for murders usually this you know
firing wildly into a crowd they don't have any of that right all they see is the crime as it's
defined in the statute and they'll get some jury instructions that further define some key terms
so because of that i think they were very willing to convict him of it from my point of view it was
a little iffy simply because of how i learned it before but i think under how the statute is
read and how the jury instructions are read i think that it's a valid conviction as well
but it's just legally a bit weird yeah it's a strange way to look at depraved heart murder
which one is the more serious charge the felony murder that's that's second degree when they say
second and third degree that's literally separating out which is more serious so second degree assault
in colorado for example is more serious than third degree assault by definition that's really
weird because i personally would be much more incensed at a depraved heart murder than like a
committing a felony and somebody dies in the process felony murder is a pretty controversial
crime because in some states for example if you were to rob a bank let's say the three of us were
rob a bank one of us is the getaway driver the two leave the bank with the guns and the money
and the cops start a shootout right with with the robbers and they hit someone and kill them
the cops hit someone yeah the cops the robbers get the felony murder in some cases that's felony
murder and some jurisdictions that wouldn't be because it has to be one of the people in the
conspiracy one of the robbers would have to do it okay yeah let's put an asterisk next to conspiracy
there and so not all conspiracies hashtag yeah not all conspiracies god damn it so it would be
but in some cases it would be and not only would it be felony murder for the robbers but also for
the getaway driver so they're just sitting there in the car i mean granted they're obviously
complicit in the robbery but they're now a murderer okay yeah i'm the getaway driver all i'm doing is
sitting in the car listening to a podcast with headphones on waiting for you guys to come back
in from the bank yeah baby driver and before i know it exactly and before i know it i'm being
charged with felony murder maybe shouldn't be abetting a fucking bank robbery homie oh absolutely
yeah but but it's the kind of thing to where i get how you said it's one of the most controversial
i get how that is unintuitive though it makes perfect sense i should be charged with something
and i and the and the person wouldn't have been killed if i wasn't helping with the crime because
they needed a getaway driver that would be you know i get how all that lines up and yet i would think
if i'm the criminal helping rob the bank i don't have a gun i'm gonna get charged with murder right
isn't second degree usually the one where like you wanted to kill someone but like it wasn't
premeditated like you walk in on your spouse cheating with someone and you kill one or both of
them and that's a second degree murder because you intentionally killed them but it wasn't something
you planned out so you're thinking of voluntary manslaughter the the well that's voluntary manslaughter
right so the um first off let's just say that however you define first second third degree
murder like a lot of states don't even have third degree murder it's it all depends on the state
right they can define it however they want um you know in some states i'm sure felony murder is
first degree murder you know it's all it really doesn't matter these are just terms that the
minnesota legislature has decided on but they don't really have any particular meaning but
the general conception of like an impassioned murder where you're talking about where your
your passions are inflamed to such an extent that you can't really be held culpable at the same
to the same extent that someone else would for their actions that's voluntary manslaughter the
classic case being you come home and you find your wife in bed with another man you shoot them
both and kill them that's the that's the classic case of voluntary manslaughter um yeah and then
involuntary is that considered like third fourth degree well it it just manslaughter was like the
least serious of them well it's it's not it is less serious you know that's why they created a
different category for it and call it manslaughter instead of murder but um it is still a fairly serious
charge which is not killed a dude yeah i mean well you're dead and there's a big i'm assuming big
mountain of difference between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter you know if if you're
driving a little recklessly and serve one of the sidewalk and hit somebody
that you involuntarily manslaughter that person but that's not indicative of the kind of person
that you are and the kind of risk that you pose being out in society while being more careful
or maybe not being allowed to drive right whereas if you voluntarily manslaughter somebody
you're the kind of person who when properly impassioned will will manslaughter somebody
i like verbing manslaughter yeah yeah so and then there was the the third charge so he was
charged with those two murder there was also a second degree manslaughter which just think of as
there's basically two elements to it you were objectively should have been aware of a high
risk what you were doing created a high risk of a substantial bodily harm and that there was also
a subjective understanding that you were doing that and that the harm may result right so it's
both an objective a reasonable person in your shoes should have known that this was a high risk
to this person and also you did understand it oh is that like negligent like not tying down your
load when you carry something heavy on the highway or uh i mean i'm not really sure how that fits per
say but um yeah it's like um it does borrow a lot from what you're describing would be like torts
like negligence is is tort law and that and that's um and a negligent that results in someone dying
negligence that oh if it ends up in someone's death then i mean it depends on what a reasonable
person would do in that situation right i mean if you tied it down you know as hard as humanly
possible yeah yeah it's not negligence but if you just didn't really check at all or if you're
the dipshit on the highway that everyone's seen with their arm out the window holding the thing
on the roof of their car right that would probably be negligent behavior legally i'm gonna go ahead
yeah and so then whenever whatever you're holding falls and hits the person in the windshield behind
you when they die you're charged this in some capacity of having ended that person's life yeah
yeah yeah absolutely so like and it is i mean it's that's what he was charged with even though it says
manslaughter doesn't say murder at the end of the day it's you you were you knew or and you should
have known that you were doing something completely fucked up to this person and that substantial
bodily harm would fall and substantial bodily harm can even mean loss of consciousness so even
if you didn't die but had just lost consciousness and was revived later still could have been
guilty of this charge but not with the murder add on not with the murders no you have to have a death
for it to be murder cool well not cool at least that part's intuitive yeah um oh and just to
clarify i think i i think i've misspoke there so you do have to have a death for the manslaughter but
the but the the the bodily harm that was intended or that could have flowed is just substantial it
could just mean loss of consciousness uh that's that's what i mean it's not the manslaughter can't
happen with without a death i mean it definitely requires a death it's just that for the definition
of the parts of that statute that say like culpable negligence to be culpably negligent
you don't necessarily need to kill someone you know i'm saying you just need to you need to have
done something that could have caused substantially bodily harm which doesn't
necessarily require a death does that make sense yeah okay yeah so those are the charges he was
he was charged with i don't think i'll just say right up top i don't think it's controversial
that he was convicted of these things per se i think that um the evidence was overwhelming um
you know and i thought they had prosecution did a fantastic job putting their case together
i do think there's some weirdness because like i said the felony murder it's a little different
in minnesota most states do not allow it to be charged that way deprave heart murder a little
strange most people do not think of deprave heart murder in that sense but i do think the evidence
was there for a conviction on on all three and i think the second degree manslaughter was a slam
dunk i mean it just wasn't but you know at the same time you don't know that until you see the
evidence right one good thing about the trial as we saw tons of video footage that was never before
released you know the only video footage you saw a pretrial was that the knee on the neck for the
nine minutes or so before the paramedics came um i actually saw the body cam footage that was leaked
before i saw that one oh did you yeah from which officer do you know uh it was it was the same one
that you mentioned in your post where yeah yeah we're like it looked eminently reasonable what
what they were doing when you watch that video not like reasonable reasonable but like i was like oh
yeah i could see i'd be in that situation too if i was a cop and then like a week or two later i
watched the the video where he's kneeling on his neck and i was like oh he just straight up murdered
the dude yeah yeah and that's i mean like because the the body cam footage stopped before the full
nine minutes of neck kneeling right it does it um and you can't really because this that's the
officer i think that was on his legs okay so in that in that part where chauvin's kneeling on
short flood's neck uh so you don't really get a good view from that angle so even if it continued
you wouldn't necessarily see all that was happening um but yeah i mean that's that's a good place to
start so i mean you had this video that apparently was leaked i didn't see it until the trial but um
that was the full like 20 minutes before this incident did it end i didn't mean to interrupt
but i didn't interrupt but i needed to ask you said it ended before uh like the the it didn't
encompass the entire time that chauvin was on the guy that the video ended did the guy turn
the camera off or just they didn't leak that part of the footage i think it just didn't leak out the
full footage yeah from what i remember from lanes body cam footage it showed the whole incident
okay i don't think it skipped at all there was chauvin's was missing because his fell off
during the struggle his body cam actually fell off and you can see it in the video on the ground
see but everyone else had it on the whole time other than circumstances like that because that
seems perfectly reasonable you know it should be fixed properly but things you know come off
especially when you're wrestling a dude absolutely that makes perfect sense and i then i'll let you
finish you know your actual stuff but i just need to say i feel like anytime there's any sort of
you know argument between well the cop said this and the the the person that is saying the cop did
this said that and the cop's like yeah my body cam footage is off and it's like well then we
believe the other guy right like i mean you have a camera for a reason we paid for you to have a
camera you keep that shit on and the cool thing is because it proves you're right if you did it
or if you're doing the right thing right right no excuse anyway unless like yeah you know falls off
that's a fair excuse unless there's this rampant thing of them falling off then we're gonna need
we're gonna need better fasteners sorry to digress no you're fine but yeah the original uh so there
was the report from the cup foods which was the store that george flid was in right before the
incident happened called in that he had tried to buy i think it was cigarettes with a fake $20
bill he gets into his car the cops show up to talk to him about it officer lane it's actually
chauvin's not in the picture at all at this point it's just two of the other officers who are also
charged with other charges but oh is that trial still gonna come up down later yeah yeah they're
they're going to trial i think next month okay it's not for the same charges they're for they're
on trial for aiding and abetting but they're still on the hook a bit for what happened
so it's officer lane and king at first and they they go up to george floyd's driver he's on the
driver's side and and officer lane like taps on his window with like the flashlight or whatever
and then as soon as george floyd sees the police he's a freak he's immediately histrionic he is
he's being given orders by officer lane and he's sort of following them where he will if he's
asked enough times he will put his hands on his head but then they'll like slide down onto the
onto the steering wheel and he's like i don't know flying up on some kind of he's definitely
freaking out he seems high he's definitely very he's just freaked out he's crying perhaps a little
he just feels like it the video footage is very telling of the situation it was that it was just
this avalanche waiting to happen you use the the word histrionic uh yeah for those of us with uh a
mere uh fifth grade education it just means a very emotional very like um you know whipped up into
kind of a frenzy a little bit like just very like um emotionally hijacked different than hysterical
you know basically hysterical i don't yeah but hysterical super loaded because that's just
what they used to say women had as a problem i think histrionic has the same root word in his his
yeah but uh the biggest lesson i took from watching that first video was like do drugs in a safe
place don't go out in public where there's going to be a lot of other people like maybe in the woods
or something where it's relatively isolated but jesus christ don't do drugs and then go out on the
street because bad things could happen and it's really hard to react like a reasonable person
when you're fucked up and i don't think drugs should be illegal at all and i don't think that
anybody should be killed for having a good time on drugs but your good time should be your good
time should be safe yeah yeah yeah and this is this is not relating to the case at all or to
george floyd at all i'm just thinking like in general if you're going to be on stuff don't be
driving well oh yeah definitely that yeah i don't i don't like that's controversial yeah right and i
do believe he was about to drive some people home so he was he wasn't driving at the time but he was
about to i think but in either case you know they they take him out of the car he's fine for a minute
they're talking to him on the ground you know he's you know still a little upset but he's not
freaking out he's not resisting or anything they're not even arresting him really at this point he is
in handcuffs and they're in the middle of an arrest but they're not like put bring him into the squad
car or anything so he's fine for a minute then they bring him over to the squad car to actually
bring him to the the jail to book him and that's when everything goes completely off the rails
george floyd tries with everything he has to not get in that car and that's in that goes on for
about four minutes including during those four minutes of struggle him saying i can't breathe
a few times the first time he sat down in the car like even they weren't even touching him yet and
he was saying that right and so you know so just to contextualize a little when he says it later
and they don't they kind of ignore him there's there is some reasonableness in there where it's
like okay well you know you're not only are you speaking right now but you've been saying this
for like 10 minutes even before we were doing this you were saying this when you were sitting down
and then but so they they continue this for about four minutes that's when they drag him to the ground
and that's when the the hold starts yeah and i think um if i'm being honest i don't think it
was unreasonable at first like i think the fact that they're putting him in this hold that they've
got him on the ground that's probably okay i'm okay with all this right and just for a couple
of minutes but there's i understand why the leaked footage stopped there because right up until that
point you're like yeah they're they're doing things more or less reasonably this is a shitty situation
but nothing's fucked up yet but it's just when you see the next seven minutes right and then so
then it continues and then at some point george fluid is saying i can't breathe and you can tell
his voice is starting to fade and he's getting slower and they still kept the knee on the neck
and this was i think the testimony that really hit it home for me it was from this guy dr toben
who was a pulmonologist testified for the prosecution he would show george fluid these
little tiny moments in the in the video where he was like putting his finger up against the tire
and up against the ground to try to create just a little bit more space for his chest
but that was him trying to the way he put it was trying to literally breathe
with his fingers like trying to just push just a little bit just to create a little bit of
space for his chest and then he they actually show the moment that george fluid goes unconscious
you can see his head just drop and that's when he's unconscious and then they keep the knee on
the neck or chauvin keeps his knee on the neck for another three and a half minutes after that
in about 45 seconds after he goes unconscious one of the officers tells chauvin and this was like
the nail in the coffin for me tells him i can't find a pulse and then chauvin's knee stays on the
neck for another two minutes and 44 seconds before the paramedics tap him on the shoulder
saying they're here and that's when he lets him up so i've got a couple i guess three quick thoughts
one i haven't watched the video uh i'm sorry to to bring that no no no i it is and i've i've read
every uh detailed account i've come across i just i couldn't bring myself to sit and watch it i knew
it wrecked my day um part of me thinks that i you know so what you should pay that price to
feel what's going on but i mean i i'm a very uh empathetic person i'm making this point much
longer than i meant to say i guess what i'm saying is i didn't see the video so i'm what you're
what you're reciting is what i'd heard before other than the fact that i didn't know that he
had been unconscious for minutes before the paramedics showed up or that the other officer said
i can't find a pulse because i had i had seen moments or pictures or something where you know
chauvin's on him kind of just shooting the shit you know yep got this guy looking for him to calm
down talking with my fellow officers whatever like it he didn't he didn't behave like somebody who was
like i got him he's you know i'm killing him right now and getting off on it right um so you didn't
see the video no i you suggest i watch it maybe up to you like the thing that i really got out of it
is that i think he killed him not because he was trying to kill him but because there were other
people around saying you're killing him get off him and he was like fuck you i do what i want you
told me to get off this guy i'm gonna stay on him and like in his mind he wasn't killing the guy
obviously but he was staying on him to flex his power at these people who were worried about the
guy's life and that is like that to me is the really depraved part that this was something
that was dangerous to the dude and he was doing it anyway because there were punk kids over there
trying to tell him to worry about the dude's life and he wasn't gonna he wasn't gonna take his knee
off because they said so yeah like that's that's just the other part that gets to me he's in handcuffs
at this point floorways yes and you know i'm not a brazilian jujitsu expert um you look so much like
one i i i give off that vibe of master class black belt but um i've watched a handful of videos and
i'm interested my point is i know that there are ways to keep people on the ground without putting
your knee on their neck if they're in handcuffs he could have just rested his knee on his pelvis
while he's facedown he there's nothing he could have done to get up with you know 100 pounds of
officer leaning on him right right uh i at least i am pretty sure um i if anyone knows better than
please correct me but i'm uh i'm pretty sure i'm uh quoting an actual brazilian jujitsu black belt
that you know without without arms uh if someone and i'm saying 100 pounds of officer because
the guy doesn't have to be standing on you just putting a sizable weight on you what can you do
literally nothing you sit there and flop for a minute until you just surrender um that to me
sounds like the way that one should do these sorts of things again i don't feel threatened by a guy in
handcuffs um i i don't know what joey's floyd's measurements are but i'm a smaller than average
dude or maybe his i don't know i'm five eight hundred fifty pounds most guys are bigger than me um
but if he was in handcuffs laying down i think i'd feel pretty safe especially if i had three
buddies near me right um so i i wouldn't feel like i need to do whatever i can to keep him
keep him under control and i say that as somebody who's not in a lot of stressful situations like
that but uh i guess it doesn't strike me as uh like that that use of force um that the application
of that use of force to the neck rather than anywhere else is what kind of surprises me um i don't
there's punk kids telling you to get off his neck well i mean then you know obviously then i've
got to stay on oh come on but um it's i feel like i brought that up for another reason oh new york
banned uh kneeling on people did they ban it or was it introduced i was outlawed i think it's
illegal i i i wasn't sure but i didn't vote it on it that was the impression i got is that it was
put past into law so yeah so you you what that means is like if i've got a guy who's not in
handcuffs yet and i can't put my knee on the small of his back i basically need four buddies to hold
down each an appendage and i don't know how else i'm going to put somebody down without uh again
i'm not an expert at this sort of thing but um i heard that's usually how chimpanzees have coos
ripping each other's arms off no no no uh they have four buddies and uh yeah one each one grabs a
limb and the other dude like punches them in the face or whatever but yeah you when you don't know
martial arts techniques and when you do it's interesting i'm part of this is stuff i learned
elsewhere and part of this is from a semi-recent episode of sam harris's podcast where he has on
uh a black belt uh jujitsu practitioner who runs uh uh slew of dojos across the country
including one that's working with a small police municipality but that's that gets more in the
episode um this guy he's one of the most like erratic guests he's i don't know if he had too
much coffee or something or if he was nervous about being on the air but he's really really like
oh and let me tell you this part oh yeah no that's not even the park man let me like
his energy is a lot but in the last 30 minutes he gets into the actual numbers of uh what training
can do for officers and stuff but he talks about is like you know i'm an expert i couldn't keep somebody
down if i couldn't touch their torso right and like and he's like and he emphasizes over and over
like i'm a professional i've been doing this for 20 years professionally i'm not an officer who gets
two hours of training a year you know um anyway i i think i heard parts of that like where he said
the only option if you can't like touch their torso and put them in a hold is to beat them until
they're half unconscious yeah yeah based or again have four friends sit in their arms or legs like
there's there's not much to do to somebody unless you can attack their center of gravity to to hold
them down um i i'm bringing this sounds like i'm making huge digression but it was related because
the i mean again the the the picture i saw of Shobin and again i didn't see the video he didn't
strike me as somebody who's trying to murder this guy he was holding them down but i to my
untrained and only barely informed eyes it seems like there were way safer ways you could have been
doing that and i think that that alone makes it you know would have made this a big big issue if
even if floyd hadn't died a lot of consciousness it's like what do you want his goddamn neck for
are you kidding me i think that's where the depraved heart thing really feels like it fits to me
because he didn't give a shit about if he was endangering someone's life with what he's doing
yeah and if the officer is like there's that subjective standard you have to understand what
you're doing yeah and they they're telling them you know we can't find a pulse and at that point
you are aware of what you're doing like you are now in the air you're no longer in the i am restraining
them or even restraining them unreasonably you're now in the realm of this guy may actually be dead
and and i'm staying on him anyway right and i'm just you know for two minutes and 44 seconds
which count that out that's a long time yeah and you just don't move so what sort of um
case did i mean and obviously this this case went on for like how many hours were they in the courtroom
for like usually i mean it's a like five to six i mean they'll have like they'll have like three
hours in the morning with a 15 minute break in the middle somewhere in an hour for lunch then
three more hours in the afternoon with like a 15 minute break and then you multiply that out by
you know 12 or 13 full days of court so so 50 ish hours ballpark even more probably 65 so so they
sat there for 60 hours discussing this so obviously i we can't get into every argument made by each
side but i'm kind of curious in broad strokes what what did the defense have to say and what
did the prosecution have to say because i know the defense tried to do things like and first of all
we're going to link to a bunch of really cool posts that that justin put together on the mod like
we mentioned at the top um that they were there were just great weekly kind of updates you know
for me who's not equipped to watch a trial and a be able to pay attention and be understand what
i'm watching i was able to kind of get the digest of what was happening it was really cool um so i
know some of this but for the people who haven't read these yet like what what in broad strokes
were the the cases made by the defense and the prosecution like i know the the charges they brought
against but what what did the cases look like sure so we've already basically been touching on what
the prosecution was arguing the whole idea of him keeping the knee on the neck for that long is
flies in the face of Minneapolis police training at least according to them and what is a reason
what a reasonable officer should do in his situation and that one thing we didn't really hit on but
kind of implicitly did i suppose is the cause um what was actually the cause of death was it the
knee right or was it the drugs in george fluid system that was a big part of the case i knew
that was a big contention in that it i didn't mean to interrupt i'm sorry i'll try and i'll get a
mouth shut for these two minutes but that when when i knew that that was part of what was going on
it was kind of just like it's drained credulity that like you're telling me that this guy died
from asphyxiation while someone was pressing the knee on his on on his neck but it happened to be
because he was on drugs like just it's possible it's definitely possible people people asphyxiate
by taking too many drugs all the time um but but for those two minutes to line up for those
moments to line up so well to each other and you're telling me you're you're you're making
that case that that strained my credulity to the point where i was severely annoyed well you know
and that makes sense but you got to think from the defense side of things they just have to put
reasonable doubt and they really only need one juror they can't get an acquittal with one juror
but they can't get a mistrial right so if they get one juror to steadfastly declare that there is a
reasonable doubt the george fluids death was caused by the uh the the hold and the the uh
cardiopulmonary arrest that resulted that you either push off the trial and have them have to
do this all over again or you may even get an acquittal so but you're you're right i think
and that's why the jury i think found him guilty of all these charges is even though they tried to
say that essentially the because george flight had fentanyl in his system and fentanyl is now
infamous for being this drug where very little is required for you to die from it right and so
the uh big opioid crisis crisis is mainly about right well it's that's the overdosing
yes i mean the opioids themselves i mean like heroin obviously causes a ton of problems by
itself but you know people are now more than ever there's fentanyl in it because it's cheaper and so
you put some of that in with the heroin and someone takes it thinking it's a regular amount of what
the drug they're used to and then they overdose we all saw pulp fiction wasn't fentanyl but she
thought she was doing a line of coke and it was heroin oh oh oh yeah yeah so um sorry i inject
levity to keep things cool no i appreciate it need some humor for these things it's true even in
the courtroom sometimes you gotta laugh because otherwise you'd just be depressed all the time
but so i mean it's reasonable to at least inquire into that right he had i can't remember the exact
amounts i don't know i'm not a pharmacist you know i don't know pharmaceuticals very well but he had a
amounts of fentanyl in a system that could have produced an overdose it was unlikely it wasn't
a very high amount and also this was a man who had an admitted heroin addiction or at least opiate
addiction so his tolerance was likely higher he had one of the witnesses that testified said that
they had been doing heroin together for years um and so you know it's reasonable to assume that his
tolerance was high even compared to compared to a regular person and it was not a super high
amount of fentanyl either but he also had methanosystem at the same time and he also had a bad heart
so that was the two ways they tried to plant a doubt in the minds of the jurors was to say look
not only was he on fentanyl which slows your breathing and that's how people die of these
overdoses that the breathing slows and stops eventually but also he had a bad heart and he
had methanosystem and they made the point over and over again that even though amphetamines are
often prescribed for certain things methamphetamine that there's no safe amount of methamphetamine
for you to have in your system however some of the doctors for the prosecution testified this
heart while it was showing signs of heart disease and was weakened in some ways it was actually a
lot stronger than the defense made it out to be that it was unlikely for that amount of um
meth to have killed him that even though his heart was enlarged that it was you know fairly tough
and also for the um for the fentanyl overdose part of what it does is it restricts your the the rate
of breathing right you can tell from dr. Tobin's testimony that the rate of breathing never changed
he wasn't able to breathe very well but he was still trying to take breaths at the same rate
that a normal person would take them they just weren't good enough breaths to get the sufficient
oxygen in but fentanyl if it was a fentanyl overdose then it would have been that his rate
of breathing slowed down dramatically and so he wouldn't have been trying to take breaths as often
that's an awesome uh example of expert testimony yeah because dr. Tobin was fantastic that was the
he was one of the best witnesses i've ever seen in any trial bar none he was on the stand for like
three plus hours and i know that's a really long time but it's totally worth watching some of it
because he was an all-star he was showing the jurors like he would take off his own tie and show
them like you know parts like if you put pressure on here it's gonna slow down your breathing and
he had all these demonstrative showing exactly where everyone was at certain times and how much
pressure was being put on he's the one who we had like the finger being placed against the car to
show he's trying to breathe through this finger he was the one who was calculating frame by frame
when he was trying to breathe so he could get a rough breathing rate so that we know that it
wasn't fentanyl overdose because his breathing rate would have would have been much much lower
he was an unbelievable witness so yeah expert testimony 100% incredibly important
that's awesome yeah i mean because like i said just to me i have my my prior that i would think
would be unlikely that these two events would line up you know it could be the stress of being
arrested might you know cause my already bad heart to explode which is probably the case they're
making or something but um you know the the rate of breathing slowing down isn't something i knew
about um you know even having seen simulated overdoses you know watching Breaking Bad or
something right uh it's um that that that sort of then of course he's got the the video detail
to prove like so here's what you would expect to see if this was the case let's take a look
and test this experimentally oh look we don't we don't observe that in fact we see the opposite
therefore we can yeah and that's awesome um i'm making a really like haphazard way of
articulating that i'm just uh the i don't know i guess i'm just overwhelmed by awesome expert
testimony i can imagine that there were probably some bullshit experts coming in saying uh and i'm
just you know someone comes in oh no that's the only safe way to hold somebody down i'm sure you
know i can imagine somebody saying or you know oh no that's uh that's what i don't know you don't
mean uh was there any bad expert testimony so i don't have to make up examples uh well i think
a lot of people would argue that the defense expert testimony was pretty bad uh i don't
necessarily think it was i don't have the medical or police training expertise or background to say
but uh you know they only had two experts um and one was a police use of force expert and
you know he testified that it was actually fairly reasonable what george uh derek chauvin did
and the thing is though like with juries one thing you have to understand is that little
things can really fuck with your perception of people right just little things so for example
barry broad was the expert for the defense for police use of force he was testifying that it was
reasonable what uh derek chauvin did he also i think may have lost a lot of credibility in the
jurors minds at least in mine you know he it made me think less of him because he was not able to
give the the prosecution anything when cross examining when they were cross examining him about
what their experts had said and why he might be wrong you know he was unwilling to admit to even
things that seemed very reasonable like for example whether or not at you know at what point
during this incident was derek chauvin even using force he seemed to be arguing that even
necessarily the knee on the neck wasn't necessarily a use of force at all because it wasn't intended
to cause pain or that it wasn't actually causing pain it was something to that effect and it seemed
very like like you said earlier stretching and credulity it did seem to you know how can anyone
not see that as some kind of use of force and so things like that are going to make the jurors
turn against you you know if you're if you're unreasonable on the stand for just little points
against you you look like a bad witness and you look like a liar yeah you know it's funny you know
i i immediately felt my incredulity meters skyrocketing and that blood pressure going up
when he was like that's not a use of force then i'm like well maybe it's a legal definition that
it has to hurt or something and yet if i've got you in an arm bar where you can't move but if you
try to move it really hurts well i'm not using force it only it only it only hurts if you try
and move right um and i mean i and my my definition of force comes from physics and i'm like no i
don't think so that sounds like sounds like you're using force to me um so i heard one of the big
things about this trial i mean this trial uh unique was that cops actually testified against
chauvin oh yeah saying that he used a lot of unnecessary force is that really as amazingly
novel as people are making out to be and he keep hearing about this like blue wall of silence where
no cops ever testify against another cop even if they saw him stabbing someone in the eye
well i suppose i mean so one reason i could see that that's true is that a lot of the officers
that testified were in the minneapolis police department right so they were literally turning
against someone they work with uh you had several people high up lieutenant zimmerman who was like
third in command testified against him his former supervisor sergeant pluger testified against him
and the chief of minneapolis police madaria aradondo testified against him as well all saying
pluger was a little bit iffy but the other two were no nonsense this was wrong right um this was
way too much force this was yeah this wasn't what we teach our officers this was totally unnecessary
that was like an exact quote from zimmerman he was very very clear that he didn't agree with
the use of force here um some of the officers though where i mean you gotta think how many
officers are there in the country and how many testified i mean there's you know thousands
and thousands of police and there's i think maybe eight nine cops that testified in this case so
you can probably find a few granted some of them were in the minneapolis police department itself
and that's a little tough to testify against someone you knew but like one of the officers
was jody steiger who was uh with the la pd you know what does it matter to him that some cop in
minneapolis goes under you know i'm saying maybe he doesn't care yeah i just i'd always heard that
that was like that was a huge thing and that was one of the reasons that it's almost impossible to
be a police officer and be ethical uh because either you are run out of the police department
within a year or two or you lie on the stand to protect your fellow officers and like it didn't
happen this time well i certainly can't say what that what that is like for police officers i've
never been one but i can say that um in a high profile case like this where you have so much
effort already being put towards it so much budget you can probably find people who will
testify against them right it's the average case where you don't have this much effort put towards
i mean you just don't have the time so trying to find officers who will testify against this
person in their use of force that takes a lot of time and money that the state is not going to put
towards individual cases right but they do in this case because it was so high profile okay you know
i'm saying so like i guess if you want justice you have to have a very high profile well it's if
you want justice to be meted out as exactly as possible you know i think i think the criminal
justice system does a fair enough job getting it pretty close but there is so much that could be
in every case so much evidence that could be more thoroughly analyzed that's just not because
who the fuck has the time for that who has the money for that right how many experts am i gonna
ask to dissect everything you know like i had one case where you know this guy had been accused
of beating up some dude outside of a nightclub and you know there was security footage from
across the street from a camera like on the street we got the footage of the from the security camera
and the the 20 or so seconds where the actual incident happened was cut out and so you know
that's it right i don't know and we'll never know because to figure out why that wasn't working at
the time would require an expert it would require someone who knows this stuff right
so that's every little piece of evidence could probably be analyzed a little bit further you
could just go on and on somehow get to those records and have them deleted and it's not a
high-profile case you'll get away with it uh i mean i don't want to say that but i i don't um
i mean look in this particular case there was other evidence that he did it right there was
other camera footage but i'm just saying in this for this one other angle it would have been nice
to see it because there was only one other video and it wasn't very good so i would have like to see
a steady security camera footage right um but i didn't have it now i you know is it true that you
could if you had access to all the records and deleted i mean that that's a high risk because
you're talking if you get caught doing that you're done your career is over right no matter who you
are you have to be like i would imagine top of the top brass to get away with something like that
what if you're already a criminal this is a criminal who's charged with kicking somebody to
death not somebody who is going to be you know using their or hacker skills to yeah well so that
that's a that's the thing though but that's that's a reasonable like line of thinking and let me let
me just say too that most defendants they don't they don't understand that stuff they don't even
know there would there would be a camera there you know most defendants are you know i love them
but i'm not the smartest bunch you know they don't that's why they ended up getting in a
fight like that well yeah i mean that's pretty much the reason right i mean that's you know
unfortunately a lot of criminality is just like kind of a combination unfortunate combination of
stupidity and lack of impulse control you know um so you know i wouldn't be worried about that uh i
don't uh but i suppose it is possible if you knew the right people and we're smart and and sharp
enough it is it is possible i suppose okay and that's why we need batman thank god for batman
all right so so the defense didn't have really much but i guess when you're guys clearly guilty
well one one thing that i think could come up on appeal was the amount of witnesses so part of me
is worried that my decision like my um conclusion that Derek Chauvin is guilty comes more from just
the amount of witnesses that were against him right i mean there was like eight or nine officers
that testified that that was an unreasonable use of force there was probably six or seven doctors
that testified to the cause in one form another of george floyd's death didn't you say that like
had they had some of the biggest prosecuting attorneys in the state right so and that's another
i mean that's uh it's probably a little bit beside the point but they did have a lot of
manpower i mean they had four first of all four prosecutors were doing openings closings
direct and cross examinations all the trial stuff that you have to do they had four people
the defense had one guy doing all that work now granted he had a pretty big fund i think
there was like a police union that was funding the defense and i'm sure he had people behind the
scenes but you had a rotating group of prosecutors for each witness right so they don't have to be
prepared with a with a really good cross of every single doctor and why they might be wrong about
xyz thing and why their studies might be bullshit you know what i'm saying like that's that's
incredibly fucking hard for one guy to do and then on top of that you had a lot of motions hearings
stuff like for example we talked earlier about that third-degree murder charge not coming in
originally it wasn't it was dismissed the prosecution argued to bring it back the guy who argued to
have bring it back if i remember incorrectly was neil cut y'all who is like this former Yale grad
was an assistant attorney general or like was like second in command at the you know at the
Manhattan federal prosecutor's office and is now this big legal like well-known guy and here he is
on this case he's what he was hired what's called pro hoc vc so that means being in on a case you're
not legally able to practice in that spot but you are for this one case oh you can you can be brought
in for one case uh and so he was brought in pro hoc vc to argue just one motion essentially you know
then you're talking getting in to be like asking lebron james to come play for your high school
basketball team for one game you know what i mean like the state put this many resources even into
prosecuting an innocent person they could get a guilty verdict oh yeah i mean if like i guess you
know that you know you're talking the situation can go any one a million different ways so many
variables in this case their evidence was fairly um obvious that i mean the evidence itself was the
videotape right right so you had a clear shot of this of this instant of this instance but yeah i
suppose i mean it does make it harder right of course if the other if the state is coming at you
with everything they've got tons of money tons of time tons of resources tons of very intelligent
people who've been doing this for a long time it's gonna be a fucking uphill battle you know
you said that you were worried that your that your acceptance of the conclusion was based on the
cumulativeness of the evidence is how i would put it isn't that what you would want to inform
your opinion on it well yes but the quantity and quality of the evidence right but so my my issue
with it is for appeals right because cumulative evidence is not allowed right there's there's
only the judge gets leeway in deciding what is cumulative but you can only say the same thing
so many times right okay sorry so one argument against an army thing so even though i mean it's
just it's natural right for people to see the same like the same argument made over and over and over
again it looks like you've got just these two experts against like 25 you know at what point you
just go well i mean even if the two are right how am i supposed to decide that i'm just a juror i'm
just a regular person you know these 25 people are saying that the defense is wrong they only
got two people on their side you know and you know you're not an expert in these in these fields so
you're just taking the information as it comes it's really tough and the judge led in so much
evidence on the prosecution side that he may have overstepped and now it could create an issue on
appeal where he led in too much evidence that was cumulative it was the same same thing over and over
again and prolonging the trial what happens if the appeals court finds that that is what happened
well if it's a serious enough error then a new trial may be granted i don't think it would result
in that but um it's unlikely very few appeals work in that way but you know it is it is possible
it does seem like he was towing that line where it's like this is like the sixth doctor that's
testified to this are you sure you want to allow that in like you're seem to be creating issues for
yourself that could be avoided and so i i guess i was thinking you when you said you were worried
about that i was thinking from my position of i want to believe what's true about it right
therefore i will uh calibrate my my confidence and a belief to the extent that i get more of
evidence and more experts that are reliable informing me right realistically it is the proper
way that you would want to to make a decision but there's the legal constraints that that's that
was the the decision i wanted to make and so i didn't know that about appeals i guess that sort of
makes sense um because then then you might just have you know take take all of this case aside
just make up one you've got one side with a ton of resources who will bring in a hundred people who
will make their case and you're a person with a lawyer and you can only make your case once
and it's like well i heard i heard them say it a hundred times and heard you say it once
it sounds like they've got a hundred times as much evidence as you do right and that that's just
maybe how a brain works so that's that that would be the case they'd make during an appeal
is that look they overwhelmed the jury with with uh what did you call it um cumulative cumulative
testimony of the same thing over and over it'd be one thing if i brought in a hundred different
pieces of evidence to your one piece of counter evidence that sounds like that should be super
encouraged right right but for me to bring in a hundred experts to say the same thing
like just reinforce that point well and and to be fair to them they were slightly different
the experts were slightly different you know you have like uh the pulmonologist dr tobin
the all star but then you also had like the uh corner who is also a doctor testified to a lot
of the same stuff but he had a completely different role in the case you see what i'm saying so like
even though they were called for different reasons their testimony overlapped a lot
and that's my worry is that it would result in what is considered cumulative yeah i don't know if
you can speak to this because it's not really a legal sort of question but the thing i worry
about a lot is the sort of social fraying we seem to be seeing in the us like is there a
possibility that people on the far right could say this was an unfair trial they railroaded him
and just not accept the the results well there's definitely i mean that already exists i mean and
of course right if you're always going to find people who say stuff like that but they have a
better point than you may be giving them credit for simply because a fair trial in the traditional
sense was in my opinion simply not really possible in this case because the average trial when you're
called in for jury service right the average crime you steven myself no one has heard of
you know we we don't know it's happened we have no clue were these juries familiar with this ready
oh yeah whoa every person every one of the problems that they had to go through like 10
thousand jurors for the oj simpson cases because they had to find 12 that had never heard of this
well they probably tried to do that i don't know if they eventually gave up i don't know
too much about the oj simpson trial i do know it lasted 11 months which is a fucking bonkers
but um you know i this case they i guess they threw their hands up and said there's no way we're
gonna find anyone you know with how well rapidly this spread and how crazy it was and how much
media coverage we're just not even gonna go there so you know they only they only interviewed
about 135 prospective jurors they picked uh 15 originally uh and so one out of every like nine
or so jurors that they interviewed ended up on the jury but they every single one of them
knew about the case okay you know and and so normally that's not ever the case you come in
you you'll see the charges you'll know what's going on what the case is about is it a murder
trial is it like you know felony medicine what is it you know we'll know that but we don't know
the details we don't know who the defendant is we don't know what the circumstances of the case were
we were not poisoned or you know by the well of information out there you know what i mean like
we aren't worried that our city could erupt in riots that too you know and and they also didn't
change venue you know they were having this trial with hennepin county residents in in hennepin
county which is where the incident took place which is where if riots had happened that city
would have burned right outside the courthouse and so you know the jurors were way more informed on
this matter before it started than your average jury ever would be why didn't they change venue that
seems to just like a brain did first step well because i think i first of all you want it to be
a jury of your peers so you want it as close to uh where the incident happened because it's the idea
being that it's a cross section of people that are closest to you okay right but it's a good question
right why why not put it in a in a city that doesn't risk burning i mean you can't put it
outside of minnesota it has to be in minnesota but you can put it in another county they may
have also been worried about how many jurors they could call a lot of the other counties are probably
really small they called you know the the amount of prospective jurors was originally 326 and of
course they can't be people who have already been called for jury service and all this stuff so um
there's a lot of constraints on who you can actually call for jury service they have to be 18
they have to be you know in some places they have to be a citizen so all this stuff um but
yeah why not why not put it a little further up north where the jurors don't have to worry
about going home at night and going through you know riots you know i mean i agree with you
just seems like an easy thing you could have avoided but now it's gonna be it's absolutely
gonna be in the appeal whether it will be enough and i don't think that anyone would have found
him innocent like you don't need the extra pressure of of that rioting it at least from my
point of view it seemed really fucking clear that this guy was guilty well we're a bunch of of
blue wide you know libtards who are going to lean that way anyway right yes but like the
change of venue i don't think would have made a difference and the prosecution should have been
fine with changing the venue yeah i would made the appeals process less risky i mean i i was
curious about i mean yeah we think i i i'm sure that there were reasons for doing everything they
did i i wonder you know i i was gonna chime in on like the the profile the high profile on this
trying to find jurors who had never heard of it you know it might have been super hard in the
days of oj's innocent because everyone only had tv and radio you know no one didn't know about this
who was in the area to uh to to be on the on the jury about it right i i guess uh so i was gonna
wait on all that but i i had to i guess after all that we're talking about the you know the appeal
which people don't have to appeal their cases they just get to right and so there's no way he's not
going to yeah i mean there are some forced appeals for like death penalty cases but for the most part
i mean you don't have to they're going to they always do why why wouldn't you right yeah i mean
you don't have to i i i guess i'm kind of curious and you know we won't know until it comes around
and how the appeal goes maybe they can drop some of the charges or something what what do you imagine
being the best case scenario from uh chauvin's point of view and do you like best case scenario for
the public who wants justice like do you think it's possible he's going to get six months home
uh prob you know uh home house arrest and a slap on the wrist and like going to go on to live a
cushy life like well cushy and quotes you know like george zimmerman you know that that fucking
nut job you know he went on to make a quarter million dollars selling the gun he used to kill
that kid right really yes i mean oh my god wow i don't know about that so if chauvin wanted to go
off and make a celebrity of this and write a book sell maybe sell his boots or something that you
know he used and i i'm just saying like i imagine that would not a that doesn't sound like justice
and b that is the kind of thing i can imagine starting riots and kind of i don't hope i never
hoped for riots but if i did this would be the kind of thing i would hope for this the kind of
thing i would hope would start right all that all that i'm getting too far afield i my my original
thing i'm curious what what is the least amount of punishment punishment you could have dissipated
him getting and the most amount of punishment okay so the least that i could possibly see so
he was convicted of this the felony murder charge right that is the most serious charge that is the
charge will be sentenced for that carries a presumptive range of 10 and a half to 15 years
all right this is another thing i learned sorry no you're fine though for our non-lawyer listeners
you can't stack punishments for the same enough for the same exact conduct against the same victim
right you can set charges because he did commit multiple crimes while doing this
but you can't stack those punishments no which isn't something i knew so when you're
when you're being interrogated by the cops and they're like we got you on this that's two years
we got you on this that's two years we got you on this that's two years you're going to spend the
next 20 years in jail man it's actually just just the two years they're allowed to lie during
well yeah yeah but well no because that's that's not so you can one event could lead to multiple
charges that are not the same thing so for example if i broke into your home to to murder you
i have both committed murder and burglary because burglary is breaking into a home essentially
to commit a felony okay and so i've done both and i could have those stacked because they're
separate crimes one is breaking into the home to commit a felony the other is the felony itself
the murder okay different things right so these are the same right if i held up a gas station
i illegally acquired a firearm i held somebody at gunpoint i drove recklessly and i burgled them
those could be stacked exactly yes that makes sense because those are all different crimes right
okay yeah so anyway sorry so looking at 10 and a half to 15 uh yeah typically so that's the presumptive
range which means he's going to get somewhere in that usually that's mostly what he'll get uh based
also on his criminal history he has apparently none i i don't know anything about it but apparently
has a criminal history score of zero so he will get the lowest presumptive range which is 10 to
10 and a half to 15 years however part of the case that i haven't talked about at all is there's a
second second Blakely trial and Blakely is this supreme court case that says that any
fact that could raise essentially your sentence outside of that presumptive range needs to be
proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt he waived that section of it so there's gonna be no
jury trial it's going right to the judge so the judge is going to hear evidence of what what were
some of the external factors in this case that make it seem more aggravated than your typical
version of felony murder right and then they'll be able to defend with mitigating factors that make
it seem less bad i guess than your typical example of felony murder so it would it could um it's not
going to lower it below the presumptive range but it could with the aggravating factors make it higher
right the prosecution is intending to try to charge him with factors that will go much higher than
the 10 to 15 years realistically based on minnesota case law this is very highly technical but
the most he could actually get is 30 because i guess minnesota's case law suggests that the highest
you can get on these Blakely factors these these aggravating factors is double the presumptive
range so 15 is the presumptive max double that is 30 that's the most he can serve even though it
does say in the statute that it's technically possible to get 40 years for felony murder
30 is the most that he could serve most likely though i don't i mean i this is me totally
speculating i'll just say we're off the top i don't know yeah at this point we're predicting
we're guessing the future right this is pretty tough and i don't know Blakely trials that well
and i can't say for certain what's gonna happen and and i haven't heard the arguments um however
i think he's probably gonna serve the regular 10 and a half to 15 right he's probably gonna get on
the lower end and he also has some time served because he spent like six or seven months in jail
pre-trial so that's going to be credit against the amount of time that he has served that that
he's been that many months it's been yeah almost a year since the incident and uh he was in jail
from i think early may until october somewhere in there or no sorry early june until october
something something like six months of time so um so yeah he's gonna get some confinement credit
he's probably gonna serve like actually in prison around six to eight years is my guess
and the rest of it will be served on parole uh because i think in minnesota from what i understand
it's one third of your of your prison sentences served on parole two thirds is actually served
in the department of corrections so two thirds of whatever sentence he gets let's say it's 12 years
two thirds of that will be served in prison so eight years and then four years on parole after that
with some confinement credit that would count against the eight years he actually has to serve
in prison that's about what he's looking at be right in there we'll know on june 25th that's the
date of his sentencing what month is it now it just it's just may may be a second we're waiting two
months for them to decide the punishment well they have to do so they had the Blakely trial
i'm not sure when they're doing it that they may have done it already i don't think they did though
i think they're doing it like next week or something but then they also have what's called a
pre-sentence investigation report this is something that most all defendants well at least a lot of
them will will have done so they're they're convicted usually it's after a guilty plea they'll
plead guilty and then their sentencing date will be set out like two months that way in the meantime
they can meet with probation and probation will kind of go over a really lengthy like profile of
them to see what their background was how what crimes they've committed in the past what you
know who they're like you know like what's their relationship status are they married do they have
kids do they have family here all this stuff just to get a full picture of who this person is
to give to the judge so they can make their decision for the sentence the um i remember
hearing i don't remember if this was before after the jury started doing their deliberations didn't a
high-profile senators say something along the lines of if there's a uh not guilty verdict
that everyone should riot yeah that was maxine waters so um putting her on blast did the jury
hear about that they may have uh so here's the thing could that lead to a mistrial well maybe
the thing is like so it's another appeal issue right so the jury wasn't sequestered for the vast
majority of this trial sequestering meaning uh they are put um in a hotel and they can't leave
they're basically with each other at all times you think of the jury is on the one you blackout
yeah and so they're they're watched the more i hear by police basically all 24 hours and when
they're not in the court and stuff like that they're you know they still are able to basically
live in the hotel but they are not allowed to they're basically in jail right it goes to jail
yeah i the more i hear about this yeah the more i am like shocked about how crazy the oj trial was
because those jury members not only did they comb the state to find people who hadn't heard
about him they were sequestered for 11 fucking months that's amazing that's insane i wouldn't
want to go to jail for 11 months because someone else murdered someone but like i just since then
it had been my my general understanding since i was still you know kid a teenager when this happened
that like oh okay whenever there's a big enough trial they move the venue they search the the
county for people and then they sequester them for months at a time and apparently that was just
a huge outlier of a case no no yeah sequestration is very rare most juries by far do not have to
be sequestered they were sequestered for one night in this case that was for when deliberations
began they were sequestered but deliberations only went two days so it's just that one night
but maxine waters made the comment like the day before deliberations began so if that in that 24
hour or so window between when she said it and the deliberations began they absolutely could have
heard about it you know they were not under anyone's watch they were just going home what was the
comment specifically if we don't have the exact wording do we have an approximation something
along the lines of that they should the rioters should get more aggressive if there's a not guilty
verdict it was something like that some more confrontational i think is the exact word she
used so so definitely it was in the vein of like there's not a plausible interpretation of that to
where it seemed like she wanted people to riot yeah okay yeah so i i was looking to see if you
know because i i mean i get why a short sighted and not legally savvy senator might say such a
thing she's also in her 80s so oh oh i didn't know that yeah she's a she's an old lady so
they should probably take her twitter or what while i can understand why somebody might say all those
things again to make their base happy or you know signal their allegiance it seems like a remarkably
stupid thing to have done yep given that this could this could be used as ammunition for like look
the jury felt fear for their lives they couldn't make a fair judgment and someone someone could
plausibly make that case yeah and they're going i guarantee you they're going to and judge k
hill the judge in this case said from the bench right before closings began that maxine waters
may have given you another avenue for appeal i mean it's it is like plain as day that is going
to be one of the cases made on appeal absolutely man that's annoying is she in minneapolis um or
minnesota i don't remember where she's from i don't it's not minnesota i don't think thankfully i
don't imagine how quickly she'd be voted out if she was a minneapolis senator the exact words
were get more confront get more confrontational i don't have the full tweet here because apparently
nobody wants to link to the actual tweet in the news media no they want to link to other articles
yeah they wrote that's i've clicked through like three different articles now they're just
linking other articles that was such a pain in the butt in doing some of the research for this case
where i'm trying to find actual court documents and then the site that talks about the case links
to other articles they've written and not the actual complaint or the proposed jury instructions
or something like that fortunately i did eventually find the website that just has all of it the actual
like minnesota state docket site where you can just look at that stuff but i gave a lot of undeserving
webzine some clicks in the meantime i think about that every time i try to look for information
online like how do i download a website um well i mean on the plus side your one click is very very
small it's the mass aggregation that is money but i want to punish them for doing impulse i want to
punish them for doing a bad job right it's not as much that i mean i have adblock you want to
vandalize their website yeah i have adblock or they're not getting us they're not getting a
percentage of a nickel off me it's it's i'm just annoyed yeah um i don't know if this takes us too
far field or how long we've been going but i i'm thinking in the in the context of cases like this
going forward um i i i like the precedent of uh officers being you know empowered to testify
other officers it seems i get you know there's a companionship among a uh you know a precinct
right you know these these in on the days where you're not out committing murders you're out there
risking your life to keep the community safe um and so you know on the day where in my mind my
coworker does something that the court has found egregious but i you know no he's a good guy you
know i get how they might i guess i'm i'm trying to be as charitable as i can i can understand why
much of the time you wouldn't necessarily want to be the first in line to go testify against
your your co-worker who you've seen conduct themselves well over the last decade or whatever
right but didn't chauvin specifically have a record of like being abusive and having a lot
of complaints against him he did have uh from what i understand i heard the number was 22
complaints lodged against him however that stuff can't come out in the trial because it's what's
called character evidence your only the evidence that's admitted is only evidence of this particular
instance whether he committed this crime on the charge date etc but i think someone's character
is an important factor it's very relevant it's just that it's not uh it's not relevant enough
it's highly prejudicial and that's why it's kept out there's a specific i mean it's rule 404 you
know that's uh the character evidence section of the rules of evidence where you know essentially
if you are you cannot ever argue that this person is a bad person and on that day he acted in conformity
with that with that bad character right the evidence of you doing bad things in the past
is not coming out that's so weird because to abasian that counts as perfect evidence right
hey this person has slapped uh you know 30 people in the last 10 years to the point of knocking them
all down right and now he's on trial for slapping somebody finally you don't get to bring up the
fact that he slapped 30 other people um because but and you know i guess if it was a criminal record
maybe you would be aware of it like if they've been charged with it or something oh no no there's
against defendants criminal records don't come out either but in the and so it's weird because
you know i didn't watch the the court part of this and yet the jury wasn't sequestered either so they
heard all about how george floyd is actually a bad guy and he you know he had a history of
criminality of all blah blah blah everyone got to to read about uh all the all the cases being
made that way well he was a victim not a defendant so stuff about a witness or a victim could come
out oh right like for impeachment purposes for example if you had been charged with a felon
convicted of a felony in the last 10 years and you're a witness they can impeach you with the
fact that you're a felon but defendants you can't do that see i would really want to know if like
someone was up on on trial for murder of course you'd want to know i would like is this a a great
grandma type person who is of all sorts of doing great things and it just seems highly unlikely
that they would have killed this person or is this someone that regularly goes out and like you know
knocks over convenient stores and threatens small businesses with their business burning down if they
don't pay up like well the good news is you can bring character witnesses forward for the defendant
during their case and if you do their character is now at issue and now character evidence can come in
oh so they could have brought in a witness saying that this is a great guy you know i mean chauvin
could have put on witnesses saying what a great guy he is but then that allows the prosecution
to say what a bad guy is oh so the prosecutor could the prosecution bring in a witness without
the defendant having done something a defense having done something first saying like i was there
when this guy just started you know slapping my friend and saying give me a hundred bucks or i'm
gonna bring you into the police station on some charge what was that part of the charges no then
no i mean like not for unless it was for another purpose like if you were establishing that they
were there i you know were you there oh how do you know well i heard the the defendants say i'm
gonna beat your ass you don't give me a hundred dollars you know they'd probably the defense would
probably object to that for eight different reasons but but you couldn't be like he did this a year ago
as this is part of a a pattern of his of being abusive towards wow only evidence of that one
instance that's what's coming in okay there are some exceptions like for example if you're
historically have to abuse someone domestically right and then you're accused of it again
your history of having done this to this one person can come in right so there there are
certain exceptions that are carved out uh one is for domestic abuse like if you've if you've
done this before you can bring in the other instances but i mean on the one hand i can kind
of see that like there used to be people bringing the courtroom oh she's a total slut she likes to
sleep with men and therefore she couldn't have been raped because she'd enjoy sex you know like
that's the kind of thing where like fuck you if i was on the jury i obviously would not consider
that any sort of evidence but like i can understand wanting to not have that into your courtroom
but but it's different when you're a cop abusing your power it's it's i i get the like a lot of
these things i'm curious about um and it's fun julia galeb did a good episode a few weeks ago
with um i don't know if he's a lawyer or just a law expert but for the first half they talked about
qualified immunity and then it's great because julia galeb is you know chill and and positive
and at the end of it she's like all right well not that my blood pressure is sufficiently high
let's switch gears because it turns out qualified immunity as is is as insane as it sounds even
historically um let's you want to talk about like civil forfeiture because you wanted her
blood pressure to go down right all right because she was curious about more legal stuff turns out
the origin of that is ships uh if if you're shipping drugs from another country i can't get
to you but i could steal your boat if i'm the state who catches you so you know like that's one
of those things i like i like knowing the origins of things so as far as that the reason i brought
that up is because the the origin of like okay look we can't bring in character to shit on the
defendant like if you're there for i don't know whatever dui you don't want the state or whoever
to be able to accrue a bunch of people to say look at this guy you know go good go good his
high school principal and be like yes he acted out in class you know i mean it's especially dangerous
not anymore but like in the early 2000s like somewhat if i was on trial for anything i wouldn't
want the state to bring someone in be like this guy's an atheist he's an outspoken atheist obviously
bad citizen and you should convict him because you know if he doesn't believe in god what else could
he do sure and nowadays that's not nearly as big a deal but at the time you know i can understand
not wanting that to be in a character thing but but i think there's degrees of difference here i
agree i just i get how that i i'm imagining that's somewhat how the rule came to be in the first
place but am i do you know the origin or am i approaching on the mark um no i honestly couldn't
say what where the you know general that's about non-admissibility of character evidence comes from
i you know yeah i i i guess i'm less really interested in that as i was trying to i was working
towards another question about the the outcome of this oh possibly influencing other um cases
going forward because you know like the police testifying you'd said you would say yeah police
testifying and frankly just please getting in trouble um you know it happens but not as often
as the public would like otherwise there wouldn't be uh so uh up in arms about it right um now i
don't know how long we have again what where are we at uh about two and a half hours so we're probably
don't have the time to crack the lid on i'm not sure how long yeah we don't have we don't have
time really then to crack the lid on the like police uh like abuse of force and public perception
as a whole unless you guys feel like diving into that briefly or is that we could but that sounds
like a big can of worms but we could we could go into it if you want a little bit i guess briefly
i'm i'm excited the fact that this might uh set an example for what police can expect going forward
because at the very least a small minority of cops are complete pricks and are happy to flex
their their power and be jerks to people and i'm being as as weak about that statement as possible
right um i think that's uncontestably true uh so i think the idea that hey look you actually
stands to get in trouble for doing this kind of shit i think that's a great idea um you know some
some accountability for doing things you know like there's uh there's concerns where people are like
well look if you make them you know too afraid of litigation uh you know that they might um
they might not act on something and it's like well good like if you're so afraid that what
you're doing might be might be wrong that you might get in trouble for shooting this guy
if you're if you're on that if you're on the fence about it i don't want you shooting that guy
right like you can see there being a little bit of slack given the cops but obviously not so much
slack that you can kneel on a dude's neck for nine fucking minutes yeah and that's kind of where i am
with this as far as it being you know having broader implications for society it's um this case
is pretty clear cut i don't know what kind of precedent it's going to set um it is nice when
a police officer does something as as brazenly improper as this that they are punished for it
um i mean ultimately i'm not a big fan of that kind of punishment uh in general just because
you can't bring george flood back just by locking derrick chauvin in a cage but at the same time
you know the fact that there is a repercussion for obviously wrong behavior is i think valuable
but also this is a pretty good this is a hard case to compare to other times because a lot of
these kinds of cases are not so obvious you know derrick chauvin there was no doubt in my
mind he was guilty of at least the manslaughter charge right you could argue that the deprave
heart murder doesn't fit legally you could argue that the felony murder that it shouldn't have been
charged that way because most states would not allow it to be charged in the way it was charged
here but the second degree manslaughter at the very least is like open and shut and i just don't know
what presidential power uh in the cloak wheel sense not in the legal sense it won't have any
presidential power legally but the the what type of meaning it will have in general when this was
such an egregious case you know i don't know if the average example of perhaps police misconduct is
analogous because it's this was just so clear cut at the very least we know that in clear cut
obvious abuse murder cases there will be people held yeah liable the hope is that was never not
the case but yes at least going forward it's probably we're not in the worst possible timeline
right thank god one one other outcome i can see being possible is precincts being a little more
dedicated to training their officers if there's so much misunderstanding about whether or not
this is what my precincts told me i can do or whether or not this is reasonable if two officers
who share an office can't agree on whether or not they've been trained the same way like that strikes
me as you guys need more training did you say something about two hours of physical um restraining
people training per year uh two or four depends on the the i'm sure it varies across the country
maybe some places do it doesn't yeah that sounds ridiculously low for a job that's that that's not
just the physical restraining part that's that's like that's your training upkeep you know like if
you're if you're um if you're a doctor you have to do continuing education throughout your career
if you're a lawyer too right because it makes sense because if you learned if you if you became a
lawyer in 2020 and you're practicing 2045 and all your law and knowledge comes from 2020 and
before you make a pretty shit 2045 lawyer right depends some things don't really change but yeah
there are some expanding areas of the law where you absolutely would need an update sure and 2045
you'll have to be all up on space law because that'll be a huge thing going forward i can't wait
we can hope but uh yeah so um continuing education is a big part of a lot of careers that's like
mandated for you to be able to keep doing that i think in in enforcing the law it's can be as little
as two hours a year which when you think about it like that's the amount of time i spend uh dealing
with my computer running slow a month right i mean i'm trying to think of just how much i think i
spend more than two hours a year making coffee yeah i mean i it's that's that's a that's a
i spend way more than two hours a year peeing yeah while on the clock right yeah um easily
and so i don't know it's weird i and just in general um and this is my just like so boxing
about police and like training i don't get wrong i'm i'm a i come from a background of of being
relatively pro cop i knew a lot of cool cops when i was a kid i went through the youth police academy
i idealized the like uh you know what i what i perceived as a kid like the protector class of
people these are the people who rather than go off and do something fun they're going to
be the ones who will be summoned to help you in an emergency um kind of like firefighters everyone
likes firefighters i kind of picture cops the same way as a kid and you know but then it's weird
how long how many hours or years would take you to become a lawyer like six well there's the four
years of undergrad that's necessary then there's the three years of law school and then there's you
know a little bit of time to study for the bar so all told it's probably like seven and a half years
and if you trim out the extracurriculars that you have to take an undergrad we'll say five years
uh sure i mean just it takes a while but i guess i'm just thinking because i think
in some in many places you can become a cop with six months of training which means that
it took you 10 times as long to become a lawyer as it would if you wanted to enforce the law
instead you could have done it with one tenth of the effort like that seems weird um you know if
i want to uh if i want to cut hair for a living or be a cosmetologist it's i think in colorado
like 2000 hours of training which is stupid well it's it's a high it should be an adult that has
put makeup on if other people want to pay me to put makeup on them well if if i want to hire you
to put makeup on somebody i want to make sure that you know what you're doing so how you know you
being credentialed you know kind of makes sense because i don't want you stabbing somebody's eyes
with a mascara brush it would definitely it would definitely be something i consider if i'm hiring
someone but like if someone wants to just put their shingle out like i can put makeup on humans
because i have eyes and fingers okay cosmetology school aside 2000 hours of training cup maybe
maybe not and yet you do but you need a fourth of that to become a cop or excuse me half of that
right like it just seems weird um it when i when i imagined it as my my youthful bright eyed self
i i kind of pictured it you know i this is before the movie 300 to come out but you know like a
kind of like a complete lifestyle this is something you dedicate yourself to and granted you don't
want it to be have to necessarily be that arduous but it just blows my mind that it's that easy to
become a cop and not to go crazy on the cosmetology thing either but i most people that get into
cosmetology i believe are people that have been putting on makeup on themselves for many years
and like have a lot of hands-on real world experience okay okay yeah i don't know maybe maybe
i'm getting too far afield here no no you make you make a compelling point about that particular
example okay um but i mean there are other professions where it requires training and
upkeep that what i would consider to be a very essential part of the fabric of society they
don't get that time and training right um you know you we need cops right we need somebody to show up
if somebody's banging on my door trying to kill me i'm going to be able to call somebody um and i
don't want to have to you know someone's banging on your door it may be too late but i definitely
want someone to investigate crimes after that happened and punish people who did the crimes
yeah so that in general people will think maybe i shouldn't do crimes because i'll be punished if i
do right i i the the the the function and role of police in society i think is indispensable
it just i feel like it's one of those things that could be like there's so much easy room for
improvement and some some not so easy room for improvement so i want to hit one last thing before
we call it a night or an afternoon um you were saying that the two other cops are going to be
brought up on aiding and abetting charges yes it's actually three the there's the the cop that was
controlling the crowd okay uh i can't remember his name he's a vietnamese i believe uh and then
officers lane and king who were in the original people who approached george floyd they are
because the those two were holding down george floyd's well one had his knee on his back and
the other who was holding his legs um and then there was the other gentleman who was controlling
the crowd those three are brought up on charges as well it's not it like i said it's aiding and
abetting which is a little strange too another thing minnesota does kind of strange aiding
and abetting usually is not a crime anymore unless unless it's after the fact the only time now
that you usually hear aiding and abetting is if you found out that someone committed a
crime and helped them hide the evidence that would be considered aiding and abetting like
after the fact but usually if you help someone commit a crime you are just guilty of the crime
if you are the getaway driver for the bank robbery you are guilty of robbing a bank you're not guilty
of aiding and abetting a bank robbery but they apparently still have it so uh yeah they're being
charged with though that lesser charge and i i haven't done my research on what aiding and abetting
means legally like like specifically uh but yeah that's they're they're facing charges as well
do you have any opinions or predictions on this or still too early well no i don't uh
i can say this though chauvin's trial you know i don't know how much this is gonna mean because
the trial got so much publicity but it his conviction can't be used against them
so it's gonna start basically from zero that's really weird that his conviction can't be used
yeah it's a totally different case if he had been found innocent could his innocence be used
no now we so he could be found innocent of a crime and they could be found guilty of abetting a crime
that legally was never committed yeah i mean essentially i told you this is way twistier
than one could ever imagine yeah how your nose isn't bleeding all the time from knowing how to do
your job blows my mind that's yeah i mean it sounds bizarre but it's absolutely absolutely true i'm
on a purely personal um opinion do you think that they should be prosecuted for this were they
morally negligent culpable for any of it for what happened i think at least somewhat because like i
said at one point one of the officers says to chauvin like look we can't find a pulse um that
point probably should have stood up and pushed him off or something doesn't seem like they were
necessarily cheering him on to stay on his neck but they were not at all making any effort to get
him off the neck either um and they didn't even really verbalize any sort of like protest um i think
they're absolutely somewhat culpable i don't know if it should be considered a crime they ought to be
ashamed of themselves i'll say that much i mean i agree they should be ashamed ashamed of themselves
but so fucking what if they're ashamed like i'm i'm of the opinion that this sucks that this happened
to them but i think they should be punished so in the future if someone sees their partner kneeling
on someone's neck and feels the pulse go out they'll think oh shit i could go to jail for this
and you know maybe steps up and pushes him off instead of being like well it's not me on his
neck so i'll just stay here well rather not that not be the reason uh that you know oh it's he's
got no pulse well fuck i might actually be in trouble for this guy's shit instead of you know
it being about the guy who's dying but right but you know i agree you know it's uh and they won't
face charges nearly as severe so even if they get time it won't i i don't know this the statute um
but i have a feeling they wouldn't spend prison time they might get jail time
so at a lesser facility for a shorter amount of time but not as bad as prisons yeah i know
not generally i mean they may be i guess it depends on the location but a jail is usually
just like you know you think but you like right you know it's just uh i just figured that you
were gonna get abused and you know fucked up no matter what i've never been so i can't quite i mean
i've been to jails but i've never been in jail hey you know i don't know how true those kinds of
rumors are but i i will say that the hardest criminals end up in the department of corrections
prison right you don't usually counting people are like you know you might see some people who
are arrested on dy or some minor domestic if you go to a jail you probably aren't going to have to
join a gang just not to be killed anyway okay yeah yeah it won't be nearly as bad for them going to
jail than the prison jail you can do weekenders too you know if you're if you're sentenced to 16
days you can serve that over eight weeks or yeah and just yeah there's there's various ways you can
do it and a lot of places will do in-home detention rather than jail and and so you know if you're
sentenced to jail it's a lot more flexible if chauvin gets uh you know prison time chances that
he'll be killed in prison i have no idea okay i have no idea i was trying to think about that they
may put him in some kind of non in the general population just don't think they'd have to
have to protect them just a little bit you know because you know as much as they should be in
prison i i'm against execution you don't want to just get stabbed by a rusty you know shank you
know i was thinking about the same question of whether or not the uh the fellow officers
should be punished you know like again as not a lawyer my opinion is if it it seems to be the
opinion of the court and of reasonableness in general that chauvin was acting unreasonably
and they were present for that and should have been aware of that right um it and so that sounds
complicit to me right yeah again just like we were talking about uh if whether the their concern
be well i could get in trouble too or whatever it's like no actually i i just happen to notice
that you're being unreasonable right um just like if if we were out i don't know if the bird
is coming through on the microphone but if so i hope it sounds nice um the uh you know if we were
out at a bar and you got in a fight with somebody and you were and you were crushing their neck
and and i was there and i'm i'm reasonable enough to know that you shouldn't be doing that if i
didn't try and stop you i'm doing something wrong right yeah so so just to that purely like
abstract level i think that they they are in some way accountable for what happened especially
to considering that they could have intervened and prevented it well they and they more to the
point they were participating right they had their knee on the back and on the legs yeah um at least
the two of them did and so in your example you don't have really a duty to do anything because
you're not involved right you're just a bystander so even though you may feel a moral wrong there's
typically no legal duty to help someone like that um unless you're caught the only time that
there that there is typically is for child abuse if you are aware of child abuse you do have a
legal duty to report it but otherwise um good law yeah and so um but other than that you know you
don't really have a duty to rescue people or to tell anyhow she was beating up random bar patron
that i don't have a legal duty i'm not i'm not so much concerned about the law right i'm concerned
about what i think is right right um and if i if i was present and didn't do anything i would fall
to i've done something wrong but you're right they were they were merely they weren't merely present
they were they were involved involved yeah um yeah it's i'm curious to see what shakes down with
them too but we'll see yeah it's gonna be pretty soon i think definitely be uh this year so but
i think i think the trial schedule for june i think is this a normal amount of time between when
a crime happens and when the trial happens honestly it's pretty fast especially in covid times um
you know usually nowadays trials have been halted for so long but even back in normal times uh if you
went to trial a year is reasonable but usually for a high-profile case like this it would take
longer there'd be a lot more fighting before trial motions that are filed an investigation that's
done asking for continuances things like that jesus but um not in this case i was just thinking
like getting charged with a crime if you have to hold a lawyer for a year before the trial even starts
that's at least a thousand dollars a week well um i don't know i mean he may eric nelson is the
defense attorney he may have his own payment plans the way my firm typically charges clients
is a as a upfront you we we take uh an amount based on your case and so oh based on you don't
charge like per hour no no not that's that's uh there's a lot of types of law that they do do that
but not the force law they not not for criminal you know usually they just charge a flat amount
you pay maybe a chunk of that upfront and then oh the next over the next like two months or something
like that but yeah usually charge one flat fee and so you just taken into consideration this
trial will probably take a year so this is how much we're charging for this right yeah how much
would it be for a trial you think it would take a year for this case the like a high profile one
or just a typical typical one um it would miss me or felony i mean it's something that you assume
will take a year to resolve that could be either i would say probably in the ballpark of like 3000
on average you're fucking kidding me so you have to take many cases you can't have one case be your
sole focus for a year well it's also yeah and i mean a lot of you know you do take on a lot of
cases yeah it'd be you know it's more for the the higher profile case or the cases with you know
if it was a case where like it was the almost the sole focus of all your lawyering for a year
i'm assuming that would be basically your salary yeah you're talking minimum 50 000 i would assume
at that point but like you know that those those cases don't come around very much you don't think
the chauvin case would cost that one that one probably did that one because they called so many
experts and they had so much time and resources spent um uh cross-examining experts and things
like that there was i'm sure a lot of investigation done there was a ton of discovery you have to
review all that there was thousands and thousands of pages of documents so they probably had to
charge a lot but your average case now i mean you the amount of work on any individual cases
is probably lower than you think okay yeah you got to think i think with jobs with caseloads
you know you've got it depends on what you do but between 50 and 60 people that you're you know
managing their cases i imagine i i mentally visualize it as just like a file drawer full of
names and and your job as as managing the case you make sure things keep going in every case
and that that things are in motion the pieces are in place and that can take you 15 minutes a day
right or or an hour a week so of course you've got room to you know to juggle you know 40 50 cases
right just seems crazy to me that i could you know defend myself against a felony conviction
for half of what my divorce cost felonies usually run you a little higher like four five six thousand
or maybe more depending if it's really high like 10 15 000 but just make it and feel better
thank you you're welcome well i appreciate this this glimpse because i mean like i said the law is
way more opaque than even my inner cynic would have guessed and it's it's interesting getting
like an inside view on what this looks like and it's also fun just on a metal level of talking
to you about any sort of law stuff in general um you you default to like well no legally this
and it's like oh no i'm not talking legally and i have to make that explicit and you're like oh you
mean like not law okay yeah and i it's not bad it's cool that's your default mode of thinking
because you're a lawyer i think it makes perfect sense it's something i finally picked up in like
my late teens it's like oh philosophers answer questions in philosophy ways biologists answer
them in biology ways um it's just like that's your specialty well if i do that in normal settings
please slap me but when we're talking law things explicitly on a podcast you know i'll
default to the oh yeah yeah it's only with law stuff yeah um but anyway it's like the the insights to
what the system looks like under the hood is not something that i had any access to as just a
muggle running around on the street i could have put in you know lots of work maybe and you could
always commit a crime you'll learn a lot about the criminal justice system real fucking fast
if i ever get real curious and i don't want to read a book or talk to a lawyer friend i might just
do that all right this advice not not endorsed by the patient conspiracy or any of its guests
well thank you for joining us today absolutely it was my pleasure i loved it it was fascinating
oh we got started like in an awkward way because we did you know the soft intro but jace couldn't
make it this this episode so oh that's right no actually he was here the whole time did you guys
know did the mic go out crap but anyway we miss jace and uh anyway if you guys did too
just meant to acknowledge that so yeah anyway um yeah okay any other closing notes anybody
um nope i think i've uh i think i've exhausted you guys enough for for today so it was wonderful
i had fun yeah awesome thanks everybody we'll see you in two weeks sounds good
you
