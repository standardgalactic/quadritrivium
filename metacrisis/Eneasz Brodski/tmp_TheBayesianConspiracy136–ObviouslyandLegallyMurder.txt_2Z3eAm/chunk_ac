whatever you choose could be thrown out completely and so that case goes away right is this a great
idea to always hit record whenever police approach you for anything i don't see why it wouldn't be
i mean you you want to i mean most cops today have body cam when they're uh engaging with a
civilian for like any reason but um i mean there's really no harm in having more recordings i can only
imagine what practicing must have been like before there was video of everything and you had to just
go by the cop's word and you had nothing else i mean you could say that they're probably full of
shit but how do you know yeah nowadays we have cameras that sometimes will show you that they are
full of shit or show you that they're at least somewhat wrong in a really relevant way you know
before we back up their case like at the very least it's like look we can all we've all seen the film
like i the idea of just having actual evidence as opposed to someone telling a convincing story
there was a literal stabbing in process yeah there's a couple quick things one is uh mike
probiglia is a good stand-up comic he doesn't really tell jokes as much as he tells like 70
minute stories and it might have been his first netflix special or his second the like the big
thing he keeps coming back to is he was in a car accident where he got t-boned an intersection
and the cop who wrote the report said that car a came through the intersection and was struck
from the side by car a and he was car a who came through the intersection and car b struck him but
the cop put car a for both and he just went nuts arguing you know calling the cop over like every day
for months trying to get him on the phone he tried to take it to court and the final obvious typo
it was and what ended up happening was he got finally got the cop on the phone and he's like
look you said this and he's like just do the right thing and pay the guy and he's like no no you
don't understand you made a mistake and he's like just just do the right thing and pay it up and so
of course this drove mike insane and he's trying to figure this out but apparently it was like
ruining his life and he's just told by his friends like dude just drop it yes he were right
but he during the show he brings the police report he blows it up on a big screen behind him so you
can show dude you can feel his passion getting nuts about it that is like that is the best revenge
become successful and like point this shit out yeah nice i mean yeah i'm sure he made more than the
cost of whatever he lost in that that case you know telling that story on netflix right i suppose
but it's still infuriating oh yeah you could you can tell he's he's he's he's passed the period
where he's obsessed about it but during the show you know he you can still tell he's getting impassioned
about it um i was thinking your probability is in court though you know there's like um what do you
call this uh switch flipping the denominator or something there's a there's a general word for it
so uh guys on trial for killing his wife um the defendant the defendant the defense says
almost no husbands kill their wives you know it's gotta be one in a hundred thousand or whatever it
is right and that is not the the number you're looking for the number is given dead wife what
are the odds that the husband did it right which is much much higher right and so that's that's the uh
that's where i can kind of see like actual numbers coming in um and then of course there's actual
numbers that you you know whatever the numbers are they're available and so i could just imagine
someone trying that switcheroo and being like i don't look almost nobody does this and it's like
he's not almost nobody he's the he's the person of interest for a reason well i did while we were
talking i just thought of an example of generalizing from fictional evidence in the law one that i've
seen quite a few times so back when i was a law clerk that's when i've seen the vast majority
of the trials i've seen because i was working for judges who would have trials you know every other
week so i've seen like 30 or so trials that happened here in arapaho county um and i the beauty of
that job is i was able to talk to the jurors before during and after trial before and during you
kind of stay mum because there's certain things that if you say can cause real problems but afterwards
there's no rules you can ask them anything you want about what made them come to their decision
and one thing that often they would say especially after an acquittal is that there was the the
evidence they expected to be there which i assume i i i'm guessing is based on csi you know they wanted
more dna you know they wanted something that more directly ties them now i think it has kind of a
fortuitous outcome i mean if if we're going to be you know beyond a reasonable doubt it's a pretty
high standard if you're close i think that you know the tie should go to the runner and they
probably shouldn't be convicted but at the same time there's a lot of people who expect
that that level of evidence should be there and then the state just doesn't have the resources
for that level of evidence to be in every single you know domestic violence case yeah and so it's
just not there and and the guy ends up walking because of it i have heard um yeah prosecuting
attorneys really hate csi because it makes everyone expect these unreasonable standards which
may not even exist in real life yeah i mean i think it's it's subtle i don't think most people
actually expect that but i think when they're presented with the case they finally realize
oh that's that's all they have is the testimony of a police officer maybe one video a couple of
things i was expecting something more and and i think that probably comes from seeing in in fictional
situations a very thorough case though the cases that you see on tv would be like the derrick
chauvin trial it would be the most high profile type stuff that's when all the effort is put in
that's when you spend millions of dollars on forensics right yeah yeah when it's just a dude
beating up his wife it's like i got 10 more of these to get to tonight i don't have a million
dollars for each one right exactly man that sucks anyways yeah yes uh the thing i found
super interesting about this is uh this thing that i pulled out aliases says in the ancestral
environment there were no moving pictures what you saw with your own eyes was true it will be hard
enough to undo the damage by deliberate concentration why invite the vampire into your house in chaser
go every wasted move is a loss in rationality any non-evidential influence is on average entropic
and like i really like that because it feels true to me it feels i guess it's truthy
where the when you see something and god especially like on tv you see the close-ups of
people crying and you get all emotionally invested in it like it feels like you're seeing something
that actually happened which is why we care that like no you can't do that to scarlet witch
she's a good person stop fucking her but um i was wondering like is this a general argument
against fiction i will just raise the point that inyosh made a marvel reference well before it even
crossed my mind to do so i think i think my my obsession is contagious um the you you've mentioned
the fact yeah that he wrote hpm or so yeah well that was gonna be my my next follow-up to that
i shouldn't have jumped the gun sorry yeah but is it is it a case against fiction in general that
fiction since it literally is made up and you know it's it's lies and uh it is altering what you see
in the world or it is giving you something to see in the world that you're going to somehow on some
emotion level internalize so is it just is it just fucking up your picture of the reality to
consume fiction i think that's a pretty weak rebuttal against it you know i mean like people
enjoy fiction so much yeah the idea that it's slightly warping your view of reality it's probably
some truth to that but like compared to the the beauty that you see in fiction you know how how
much joy you get how you know i would say that fictional works are one of the things that make
life worth living yeah you know and so like the fact that it's warping your view of reality and
unless you give me a really clear cut very poisonous example the fact that it's i guess
suppose it is literally a case against fiction to some extent but it's just not very convincing in
my opinion okay i think you're supposed to get lessons and wisdom and fun from fiction not facts
right and so that said lessons can be misapplied to reality or properly applied to reality right
yeah 1984 was a fiction and yet the author clearly intended for some aspects of it to be
hey be mindful of this right um you know it's if uh terminators are great example right terminators
are great fun story the lesson you shouldn't take from it is that robots will uh look like humans
and track you down they will like that if you build an artificial intelligence it will make
robots with two legs and two arms and glowing red eyes and a gun um that's not the lesson you should
take from it um maybe it could be general lesson about technological hubris or something right
or more than that it's just fucking fun watching Arnold Schwarzenegger be a terminator right the
one of the interesting parts of a terminator is that like the lesson you learn early on is
the vast majority of humankind is wiped out when the ai tricks the us and the soviet union
into exchanging nuclear weapons but like all you actually see in the movie is one robot tracking
one other person because that's the really exciting part but yeah the the the way the the ai
actually wiped out humanity was you know hacking people's beliefs and uh and threat responses
i just watched last night the episode of brick and morty in season four that was like three minutes
the episode was just snakes hissing it was like the the snake i forget what episode i think season
four episode five yeah um they they get time travel standing against the snakes do and so like
there's snake hitler and there's snake uh uh abraham lincoln and when one guy goes back in
time to kill snake hitler this other teleporting snake shows up right behind him from time shoots
him the another one teleports in shoots him and then from that the outside of the building you
see start seeing snake piles body up that's what you would have expected to happen a terminator
if they had a time machine right you drop a bunch of them and they do something kind of like that
in the one uh i don't know they went off the rails on the tree of time well that one for sure
that's an alexander whale short story everyone should check out but uh in one of the terminator
movies they do they actually play with the idea that time did something um there was the one
in the first terminator the thing was they built the time machine the ai built the time machine
just as the humans were getting in and so it only had time to send out one terminator before the
human smashed it so and then and then threw back their own person well yeah before the humans i
guess grabbed it yeah but you know and then as the movies went on they're just like oh actually
had a time to throw back two no no there was time to throw back three machines and yeah i mean if
depending on how hard it is to change the time on these things i would have set the robot to go
back 30 minutes and guard the door so that i could bring in more robots to do the actual
important mission right right maybe yeah all right um but you know it it is what it is it wouldn't
have been a fun story if it was just the snake episode of rick and morty right yeah might have
been a fun episode if it was branches at the tree of time but um yeah rick so you told her this
takes longer than 20 minutes all right fine i had a great time with it though but yeah so so i was
wondering what can we extrapolate from the fact that the person who said this thing implying that
all fiction is a deliberate skewing of your uh of your vision of reality is also the person who
wrote harry potter and methods of rationality in rationality any any non-evidential influence is
on average and tropic um i don't know if like when when i draw lessons from methods of rationality
i'm not thinking and here's how i will get good at quidditch right um i'm thinking uh i'm trying to
generalize the lessons of the characters like their actions their their their failures their
successes that sort of thing um in a way that's not specific on the evidence of the world in
particular but more generalizable plus like when harry monologues and just talks about
science like he's citing real world papers yeah right um i guess if i am going to take the other
side of that argument though if i'm gonna generalize like if i'm going to try to try and internalize
wisdom from the lessons of the characters or something uh i'm doing that in a fictional
setting from a fictional universe you know real world lessons probably are way different than how
to you know if if someone's plotting to ruin my life it probably won't look like lucius malphoy
doing it right right it'll probably look way different so maybe i shouldn't generalize too
much from that kind of lesson my thought upon upon contemplating this was that eliezer knows
exactly what he's doing and he's trying to introduce fictional evidence into the minds of
everyone who reads this in order to steer the future in a way that is what he considers more um
less likely to kill all of humanity and i don't know that seems almost dark artsy but also like
i like it and also i love hpm or so you know i'm not about to complain but yeah that's that's an
interesting thing to think and the more i thought about it like all of us don't have perfect views
of reality anyway right we could use some adjusting in some way so if you consume a piece of fiction
that uses fictional evidence to adjust your priors more towards the way the world really is that's
not helpful it's just really hard to you know target stories to people where it would help them
as opposed to hurt them necessarily yeah this reminds me of a you mentioned perfect views
reality there's a Saturday morning breakfast cereal comic um let's see it would have been shoot
i can't find it right away oh there it is qasp um quality as shitty or qualia are shitty perception
and so like the perfect view of reality he's imagining that if we had like a way to get
perfect of quantum level information about reality we could call it uh x quali x quali x
qualiver quali quali uber it's easier to read than it is to say um it didn't even think of that
okay like all right yeah if we could get perfect information on the on the thing then there'd be
no disagreement right what's it like to be a bad well that's a stupid question because bats have
shitty perception it's they had if they had perfect quality perception then this wouldn't be a problem
um i kind of forgot the rest of my point because i was thinking of the comics so yeah yep i i like
that use of fiction and like i said i just like fiction in general yeah i don't think the author
takes a hard stand against fiction or would have spent five years writing harry potter fan fiction
and reading tons of fiction so yeah um i think i think the key like i said is just not to run from
i saw this in a movie therefore i should be concerned about it happening in real life
depending on what the movie you know on how applicable the movie is and that's maybe a harder
lesson to get right you know yeah i mean in just just the whole idea of be cautious of
exposing yourself to fictional evidence i think is an interesting idea to ponder
and i'm not sure how to incorporate it into my life considering how much i love fiction i don't
know what it would mean you know like if you're watching a slasher fic with a home invasion you
might learn some general lessons about like what not to do because it gets every family every
movie like that killed right that said you're assuming that people are going to break into your
house are going to be like people in the movie right uh really the solution is go upstairs grab
your shotgun and just sit with your back facing the door um or excuse me sit with your back against
the wall and face the door uh i mean that might happen in a horror movie i don't know it i think
just go forth have fun and don't grab a specific conclusion from fiction and say we should be we
should be worried about exactly this unless you can make a good independent case why yeah right um
you know again if you're if you're worried about 1984 state like government stuff um you can point
to well look you know what you what you probably shouldn't do is say well look these three things
happened and then it became like you know dystopia from 1984 but you can say these people weren't very
happy the author was a pretty savvy guy people aren't happy now and we're we're kind of checking
these boxes right um because it it it seems more applicable to human psychology it's kind of like
generalizing from actual history that's that's what he goes on to say in the rest of the post
that uh people don't actually treat this like as a prophecy or as real evidence but
emotionally it feels like you know this is something that happened in the past or this
happened over in a different country so how are we gonna address it he says that uh journalists
don't believe the future will contain borg they don't believe star trek as a prophecy but when
someone talks about brain computer interfaces they think will the future contain borg not how
do i know computer assisted telepathy makes people less nice which the second question is you know
the real question but but you go with the emotional affect of like oh hey what if there's
borg in the future that's what happened when this happened in star trek so what are borg oh my god
wow you're right this is the your bimonthly reminder that i haven't seen star trek wow we need
to know everything is a star trek episode but they're like a collective intelligence mind and
there's like these individual mindless drones who just like steal technology and have no care for
lives so whatever they destroy they just it's like if it doesn't matter to them at all they're
like a hive mind species and yeah the individuals yeah they're drones they don't matter kind of
like a less coordinated uh buggers from enders game yes okay i could follow that yeah so you don't
want that but you're right so i think that that you can watch that and say this might be a you
know an actual downside of doing human mind interface telepathy or something right but like
the better question is but you focus on the actual thing not borgs yeah or borg if it's not plural
doesn't look like it's plural right all right okay so that was that post it was a very interesting one
and the next one is another classic of the sequences hold off on proposing solutions
and this uh anyone who's read hpm or will be familiar with this one uh but the gist of it is
that when a group faces a problem the natural tendency of its members is to propose possible
