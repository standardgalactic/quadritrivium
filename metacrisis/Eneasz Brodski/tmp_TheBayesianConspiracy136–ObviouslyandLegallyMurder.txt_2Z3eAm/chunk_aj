charged with though that lesser charge and i i haven't done my research on what aiding and abetting
means legally like like specifically uh but yeah that's they're they're facing charges as well
do you have any opinions or predictions on this or still too early well no i don't uh
i can say this though chauvin's trial you know i don't know how much this is gonna mean because
the trial got so much publicity but it his conviction can't be used against them
so it's gonna start basically from zero that's really weird that his conviction can't be used
yeah it's a totally different case if he had been found innocent could his innocence be used
no now we so he could be found innocent of a crime and they could be found guilty of abetting a crime
that legally was never committed yeah i mean essentially i told you this is way twistier
than one could ever imagine yeah how your nose isn't bleeding all the time from knowing how to do
your job blows my mind that's yeah i mean it sounds bizarre but it's absolutely absolutely true i'm
on a purely personal um opinion do you think that they should be prosecuted for this were they
morally negligent culpable for any of it for what happened i think at least somewhat because like i
said at one point one of the officers says to chauvin like look we can't find a pulse um that
point probably should have stood up and pushed him off or something doesn't seem like they were
necessarily cheering him on to stay on his neck but they were not at all making any effort to get
him off the neck either um and they didn't even really verbalize any sort of like protest um i think
they're absolutely somewhat culpable i don't know if it should be considered a crime they ought to be
ashamed of themselves i'll say that much i mean i agree they should be ashamed ashamed of themselves
but so fucking what if they're ashamed like i'm i'm of the opinion that this sucks that this happened
to them but i think they should be punished so in the future if someone sees their partner kneeling
on someone's neck and feels the pulse go out they'll think oh shit i could go to jail for this
and you know maybe steps up and pushes him off instead of being like well it's not me on his
neck so i'll just stay here well rather not that not be the reason uh that you know oh it's he's
got no pulse well fuck i might actually be in trouble for this guy's shit instead of you know
it being about the guy who's dying but right but you know i agree you know it's uh and they won't
face charges nearly as severe so even if they get time it won't i i don't know this the statute um
but i have a feeling they wouldn't spend prison time they might get jail time
so at a lesser facility for a shorter amount of time but not as bad as prisons yeah i know
not generally i mean they may be i guess it depends on the location but a jail is usually
just like you know you think but you like right you know it's just uh i just figured that you
were gonna get abused and you know fucked up no matter what i've never been so i can't quite i mean
i've been to jails but i've never been in jail hey you know i don't know how true those kinds of
rumors are but i i will say that the hardest criminals end up in the department of corrections
prison right you don't usually counting people are like you know you might see some people who
are arrested on dy or some minor domestic if you go to a jail you probably aren't going to have to
join a gang just not to be killed anyway okay yeah yeah it won't be nearly as bad for them going to
jail than the prison jail you can do weekenders too you know if you're if you're sentenced to 16
days you can serve that over eight weeks or yeah and just yeah there's there's various ways you can
do it and a lot of places will do in-home detention rather than jail and and so you know if you're
sentenced to jail it's a lot more flexible if chauvin gets uh you know prison time chances that
he'll be killed in prison i have no idea okay i have no idea i was trying to think about that they
may put him in some kind of non in the general population just don't think they'd have to
have to protect them just a little bit you know because you know as much as they should be in
prison i i'm against execution you don't want to just get stabbed by a rusty you know shank you
know i was thinking about the same question of whether or not the uh the fellow officers
should be punished you know like again as not a lawyer my opinion is if it it seems to be the
opinion of the court and of reasonableness in general that chauvin was acting unreasonably
and they were present for that and should have been aware of that right um it and so that sounds
complicit to me right yeah again just like we were talking about uh if whether the their concern
be well i could get in trouble too or whatever it's like no actually i i just happen to notice
that you're being unreasonable right um just like if if we were out i don't know if the bird
is coming through on the microphone but if so i hope it sounds nice um the uh you know if we were
out at a bar and you got in a fight with somebody and you were and you were crushing their neck
and and i was there and i'm i'm reasonable enough to know that you shouldn't be doing that if i
didn't try and stop you i'm doing something wrong right yeah so so just to that purely like
abstract level i think that they they are in some way accountable for what happened especially
to considering that they could have intervened and prevented it well they and they more to the
point they were participating right they had their knee on the back and on the legs yeah um at least
the two of them did and so in your example you don't have really a duty to do anything because
you're not involved right you're just a bystander so even though you may feel a moral wrong there's
typically no legal duty to help someone like that um unless you're caught the only time that
there that there is typically is for child abuse if you are aware of child abuse you do have a
legal duty to report it but otherwise um good law yeah and so um but other than that you know you
don't really have a duty to rescue people or to tell anyhow she was beating up random bar patron
that i don't have a legal duty i'm not i'm not so much concerned about the law right i'm concerned
about what i think is right right um and if i if i was present and didn't do anything i would fall
to i've done something wrong but you're right they were they were merely they weren't merely present
they were they were involved involved yeah um yeah it's i'm curious to see what shakes down with
them too but we'll see yeah it's gonna be pretty soon i think definitely be uh this year so but
i think i think the trial schedule for june i think is this a normal amount of time between when
a crime happens and when the trial happens honestly it's pretty fast especially in covid times um
you know usually nowadays trials have been halted for so long but even back in normal times uh if you
went to trial a year is reasonable but usually for a high-profile case like this it would take
longer there'd be a lot more fighting before trial motions that are filed an investigation that's
done asking for continuances things like that jesus but um not in this case i was just thinking
like getting charged with a crime if you have to hold a lawyer for a year before the trial even starts
that's at least a thousand dollars a week well um i don't know i mean he may eric nelson is the
defense attorney he may have his own payment plans the way my firm typically charges clients
is a as a upfront you we we take uh an amount based on your case and so oh based on you don't
charge like per hour no no not that's that's uh there's a lot of types of law that they do do that
but not the force law they not not for criminal you know usually they just charge a flat amount
you pay maybe a chunk of that upfront and then oh the next over the next like two months or something
like that but yeah usually charge one flat fee and so you just taken into consideration this
trial will probably take a year so this is how much we're charging for this right yeah how much
would it be for a trial you think it would take a year for this case the like a high profile one
or just a typical typical one um it would miss me or felony i mean it's something that you assume
will take a year to resolve that could be either i would say probably in the ballpark of like 3000
on average you're fucking kidding me so you have to take many cases you can't have one case be your
sole focus for a year well it's also yeah and i mean a lot of you know you do take on a lot of
cases yeah it'd be you know it's more for the the higher profile case or the cases with you know
if it was a case where like it was the almost the sole focus of all your lawyering for a year
i'm assuming that would be basically your salary yeah you're talking minimum 50 000 i would assume
at that point but like you know that those those cases don't come around very much you don't think
the chauvin case would cost that one that one probably did that one because they called so many
experts and they had so much time and resources spent um uh cross-examining experts and things
like that there was i'm sure a lot of investigation done there was a ton of discovery you have to
review all that there was thousands and thousands of pages of documents so they probably had to
charge a lot but your average case now i mean you the amount of work on any individual cases
is probably lower than you think okay yeah you got to think i think with jobs with caseloads
you know you've got it depends on what you do but between 50 and 60 people that you're you know
managing their cases i imagine i i mentally visualize it as just like a file drawer full of
names and and your job as as managing the case you make sure things keep going in every case
and that that things are in motion the pieces are in place and that can take you 15 minutes a day
right or or an hour a week so of course you've got room to you know to juggle you know 40 50 cases
right just seems crazy to me that i could you know defend myself against a felony conviction
for half of what my divorce cost felonies usually run you a little higher like four five six thousand
or maybe more depending if it's really high like 10 15 000 but just make it and feel better
thank you you're welcome well i appreciate this this glimpse because i mean like i said the law is
way more opaque than even my inner cynic would have guessed and it's it's interesting getting
like an inside view on what this looks like and it's also fun just on a metal level of talking
to you about any sort of law stuff in general um you you default to like well no legally this
and it's like oh no i'm not talking legally and i have to make that explicit and you're like oh you
mean like not law okay yeah and i it's not bad it's cool that's your default mode of thinking
because you're a lawyer i think it makes perfect sense it's something i finally picked up in like
my late teens it's like oh philosophers answer questions in philosophy ways biologists answer
them in biology ways um it's just like that's your specialty well if i do that in normal settings
please slap me but when we're talking law things explicitly on a podcast you know i'll
default to the oh yeah yeah it's only with law stuff yeah um but anyway it's like the the insights to
what the system looks like under the hood is not something that i had any access to as just a
muggle running around on the street i could have put in you know lots of work maybe and you could
always commit a crime you'll learn a lot about the criminal justice system real fucking fast
if i ever get real curious and i don't want to read a book or talk to a lawyer friend i might just
do that all right this advice not not endorsed by the patient conspiracy or any of its guests
well thank you for joining us today absolutely it was my pleasure i loved it it was fascinating
oh we got started like in an awkward way because we did you know the soft intro but jace couldn't
make it this this episode so oh that's right no actually he was here the whole time did you guys
know did the mic go out crap but anyway we miss jace and uh anyway if you guys did too
just meant to acknowledge that so yeah anyway um yeah okay any other closing notes anybody
um nope i think i've uh i think i've exhausted you guys enough for for today so it was wonderful
i had fun yeah awesome thanks everybody we'll see you in two weeks sounds good
you
