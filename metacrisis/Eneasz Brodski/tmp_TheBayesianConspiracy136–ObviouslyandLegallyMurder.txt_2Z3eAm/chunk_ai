punish them for doing a bad job right it's not as much that i mean i have adblock you want to
vandalize their website yeah i have adblock or they're not getting us they're not getting a
percentage of a nickel off me it's it's i'm just annoyed yeah um i don't know if this takes us too
far field or how long we've been going but i i'm thinking in the in the context of cases like this
going forward um i i i like the precedent of uh officers being you know empowered to testify
other officers it seems i get you know there's a companionship among a uh you know a precinct
right you know these these in on the days where you're not out committing murders you're out there
risking your life to keep the community safe um and so you know on the day where in my mind my
coworker does something that the court has found egregious but i you know no he's a good guy you
know i get how they might i guess i'm i'm trying to be as charitable as i can i can understand why
much of the time you wouldn't necessarily want to be the first in line to go testify against
your your co-worker who you've seen conduct themselves well over the last decade or whatever
right but didn't chauvin specifically have a record of like being abusive and having a lot
of complaints against him he did have uh from what i understand i heard the number was 22
complaints lodged against him however that stuff can't come out in the trial because it's what's
called character evidence your only the evidence that's admitted is only evidence of this particular
instance whether he committed this crime on the charge date etc but i think someone's character
is an important factor it's very relevant it's just that it's not uh it's not relevant enough
it's highly prejudicial and that's why it's kept out there's a specific i mean it's rule 404 you
know that's uh the character evidence section of the rules of evidence where you know essentially
if you are you cannot ever argue that this person is a bad person and on that day he acted in conformity
with that with that bad character right the evidence of you doing bad things in the past
is not coming out that's so weird because to abasian that counts as perfect evidence right
hey this person has slapped uh you know 30 people in the last 10 years to the point of knocking them
all down right and now he's on trial for slapping somebody finally you don't get to bring up the
fact that he slapped 30 other people um because but and you know i guess if it was a criminal record
maybe you would be aware of it like if they've been charged with it or something oh no no there's
against defendants criminal records don't come out either but in the and so it's weird because
you know i didn't watch the the court part of this and yet the jury wasn't sequestered either so they
heard all about how george floyd is actually a bad guy and he you know he had a history of
criminality of all blah blah blah everyone got to to read about uh all the all the cases being
made that way well he was a victim not a defendant so stuff about a witness or a victim could come
out oh right like for impeachment purposes for example if you had been charged with a felon
convicted of a felony in the last 10 years and you're a witness they can impeach you with the
fact that you're a felon but defendants you can't do that see i would really want to know if like
someone was up on on trial for murder of course you'd want to know i would like is this a a great
grandma type person who is of all sorts of doing great things and it just seems highly unlikely
that they would have killed this person or is this someone that regularly goes out and like you know
knocks over convenient stores and threatens small businesses with their business burning down if they
don't pay up like well the good news is you can bring character witnesses forward for the defendant
during their case and if you do their character is now at issue and now character evidence can come in
oh so they could have brought in a witness saying that this is a great guy you know i mean chauvin
could have put on witnesses saying what a great guy he is but then that allows the prosecution
to say what a bad guy is oh so the prosecutor could the prosecution bring in a witness without
the defendant having done something a defense having done something first saying like i was there
when this guy just started you know slapping my friend and saying give me a hundred bucks or i'm
gonna bring you into the police station on some charge what was that part of the charges no then
no i mean like not for unless it was for another purpose like if you were establishing that they
were there i you know were you there oh how do you know well i heard the the defendants say i'm
gonna beat your ass you don't give me a hundred dollars you know they'd probably the defense would
probably object to that for eight different reasons but but you couldn't be like he did this a year ago
as this is part of a a pattern of his of being abusive towards wow only evidence of that one
instance that's what's coming in okay there are some exceptions like for example if you're
historically have to abuse someone domestically right and then you're accused of it again
your history of having done this to this one person can come in right so there there are
certain exceptions that are carved out uh one is for domestic abuse like if you've if you've
done this before you can bring in the other instances but i mean on the one hand i can kind
of see that like there used to be people bringing the courtroom oh she's a total slut she likes to
sleep with men and therefore she couldn't have been raped because she'd enjoy sex you know like
that's the kind of thing where like fuck you if i was on the jury i obviously would not consider
that any sort of evidence but like i can understand wanting to not have that into your courtroom
but but it's different when you're a cop abusing your power it's it's i i get the like a lot of
these things i'm curious about um and it's fun julia galeb did a good episode a few weeks ago
with um i don't know if he's a lawyer or just a law expert but for the first half they talked about
qualified immunity and then it's great because julia galeb is you know chill and and positive
and at the end of it she's like all right well not that my blood pressure is sufficiently high
let's switch gears because it turns out qualified immunity as is is as insane as it sounds even
historically um let's you want to talk about like civil forfeiture because you wanted her
blood pressure to go down right all right because she was curious about more legal stuff turns out
the origin of that is ships uh if if you're shipping drugs from another country i can't get
to you but i could steal your boat if i'm the state who catches you so you know like that's one
of those things i like i like knowing the origins of things so as far as that the reason i brought
that up is because the the origin of like okay look we can't bring in character to shit on the
defendant like if you're there for i don't know whatever dui you don't want the state or whoever
to be able to accrue a bunch of people to say look at this guy you know go good go good his
high school principal and be like yes he acted out in class you know i mean it's especially dangerous
not anymore but like in the early 2000s like somewhat if i was on trial for anything i wouldn't
want the state to bring someone in be like this guy's an atheist he's an outspoken atheist obviously
bad citizen and you should convict him because you know if he doesn't believe in god what else could
he do sure and nowadays that's not nearly as big a deal but at the time you know i can understand
not wanting that to be in a character thing but but i think there's degrees of difference here i
agree i just i get how that i i'm imagining that's somewhat how the rule came to be in the first
place but am i do you know the origin or am i approaching on the mark um no i honestly couldn't
say what where the you know general that's about non-admissibility of character evidence comes from
i you know yeah i i i guess i'm less really interested in that as i was trying to i was working
towards another question about the the outcome of this oh possibly influencing other um cases
going forward because you know like the police testifying you'd said you would say yeah police
testifying and frankly just please getting in trouble um you know it happens but not as often
as the public would like otherwise there wouldn't be uh so uh up in arms about it right um now i
don't know how long we have again what where are we at uh about two and a half hours so we're probably
don't have the time to crack the lid on i'm not sure how long yeah we don't have we don't have
time really then to crack the lid on the like police uh like abuse of force and public perception
as a whole unless you guys feel like diving into that briefly or is that we could but that sounds
like a big can of worms but we could we could go into it if you want a little bit i guess briefly
i'm i'm excited the fact that this might uh set an example for what police can expect going forward
because at the very least a small minority of cops are complete pricks and are happy to flex
their their power and be jerks to people and i'm being as as weak about that statement as possible
right um i think that's uncontestably true uh so i think the idea that hey look you actually
stands to get in trouble for doing this kind of shit i think that's a great idea um you know some
some accountability for doing things you know like there's uh there's concerns where people are like
well look if you make them you know too afraid of litigation uh you know that they might um
they might not act on something and it's like well good like if you're so afraid that what
you're doing might be might be wrong that you might get in trouble for shooting this guy
if you're if you're on that if you're on the fence about it i don't want you shooting that guy
right like you can see there being a little bit of slack given the cops but obviously not so much
slack that you can kneel on a dude's neck for nine fucking minutes yeah and that's kind of where i am
with this as far as it being you know having broader implications for society it's um this case
is pretty clear cut i don't know what kind of precedent it's going to set um it is nice when
a police officer does something as as brazenly improper as this that they are punished for it
um i mean ultimately i'm not a big fan of that kind of punishment uh in general just because
you can't bring george flood back just by locking derrick chauvin in a cage but at the same time
you know the fact that there is a repercussion for obviously wrong behavior is i think valuable
but also this is a pretty good this is a hard case to compare to other times because a lot of
these kinds of cases are not so obvious you know derrick chauvin there was no doubt in my
mind he was guilty of at least the manslaughter charge right you could argue that the deprave
heart murder doesn't fit legally you could argue that the felony murder that it shouldn't have been
charged that way because most states would not allow it to be charged in the way it was charged
here but the second degree manslaughter at the very least is like open and shut and i just don't know
what presidential power uh in the cloak wheel sense not in the legal sense it won't have any
presidential power legally but the the what type of meaning it will have in general when this was
such an egregious case you know i don't know if the average example of perhaps police misconduct is
analogous because it's this was just so clear cut at the very least we know that in clear cut
obvious abuse murder cases there will be people held yeah liable the hope is that was never not
the case but yes at least going forward it's probably we're not in the worst possible timeline
right thank god one one other outcome i can see being possible is precincts being a little more
dedicated to training their officers if there's so much misunderstanding about whether or not
this is what my precincts told me i can do or whether or not this is reasonable if two officers
who share an office can't agree on whether or not they've been trained the same way like that strikes
me as you guys need more training did you say something about two hours of physical um restraining
people training per year uh two or four depends on the the i'm sure it varies across the country
maybe some places do it doesn't yeah that sounds ridiculously low for a job that's that that's not
just the physical restraining part that's that's like that's your training upkeep you know like if
you're if you're um if you're a doctor you have to do continuing education throughout your career
if you're a lawyer too right because it makes sense because if you learned if you if you became a
lawyer in 2020 and you're practicing 2045 and all your law and knowledge comes from 2020 and
before you make a pretty shit 2045 lawyer right depends some things don't really change but yeah
there are some expanding areas of the law where you absolutely would need an update sure and 2045
you'll have to be all up on space law because that'll be a huge thing going forward i can't wait
we can hope but uh yeah so um continuing education is a big part of a lot of careers that's like
mandated for you to be able to keep doing that i think in in enforcing the law it's can be as little
as two hours a year which when you think about it like that's the amount of time i spend uh dealing
with my computer running slow a month right i mean i'm trying to think of just how much i think i
spend more than two hours a year making coffee yeah i mean i it's that's that's a that's a
i spend way more than two hours a year peeing yeah while on the clock right yeah um easily
and so i don't know it's weird i and just in general um and this is my just like so boxing
about police and like training i don't get wrong i'm i'm a i come from a background of of being
relatively pro cop i knew a lot of cool cops when i was a kid i went through the youth police academy
i idealized the like uh you know what i what i perceived as a kid like the protector class of
people these are the people who rather than go off and do something fun they're going to
be the ones who will be summoned to help you in an emergency um kind of like firefighters everyone
likes firefighters i kind of picture cops the same way as a kid and you know but then it's weird
how long how many hours or years would take you to become a lawyer like six well there's the four
years of undergrad that's necessary then there's the three years of law school and then there's you
know a little bit of time to study for the bar so all told it's probably like seven and a half years
and if you trim out the extracurriculars that you have to take an undergrad we'll say five years
uh sure i mean just it takes a while but i guess i'm just thinking because i think
in some in many places you can become a cop with six months of training which means that
it took you 10 times as long to become a lawyer as it would if you wanted to enforce the law
instead you could have done it with one tenth of the effort like that seems weird um you know if
i want to uh if i want to cut hair for a living or be a cosmetologist it's i think in colorado
like 2000 hours of training which is stupid well it's it's a high it should be an adult that has
put makeup on if other people want to pay me to put makeup on them well if if i want to hire you
to put makeup on somebody i want to make sure that you know what you're doing so how you know you
being credentialed you know kind of makes sense because i don't want you stabbing somebody's eyes
with a mascara brush it would definitely it would definitely be something i consider if i'm hiring
someone but like if someone wants to just put their shingle out like i can put makeup on humans
because i have eyes and fingers okay cosmetology school aside 2000 hours of training cup maybe
maybe not and yet you do but you need a fourth of that to become a cop or excuse me half of that
right like it just seems weird um it when i when i imagined it as my my youthful bright eyed self
i i kind of pictured it you know i this is before the movie 300 to come out but you know like a
kind of like a complete lifestyle this is something you dedicate yourself to and granted you don't
want it to be have to necessarily be that arduous but it just blows my mind that it's that easy to
become a cop and not to go crazy on the cosmetology thing either but i most people that get into
cosmetology i believe are people that have been putting on makeup on themselves for many years
and like have a lot of hands-on real world experience okay okay yeah i don't know maybe maybe
i'm getting too far afield here no no you make you make a compelling point about that particular
example okay um but i mean there are other professions where it requires training and
upkeep that what i would consider to be a very essential part of the fabric of society they
don't get that time and training right um you know you we need cops right we need somebody to show up
if somebody's banging on my door trying to kill me i'm going to be able to call somebody um and i
don't want to have to you know someone's banging on your door it may be too late but i definitely
want someone to investigate crimes after that happened and punish people who did the crimes
yeah so that in general people will think maybe i shouldn't do crimes because i'll be punished if i
do right i i the the the the function and role of police in society i think is indispensable
it just i feel like it's one of those things that could be like there's so much easy room for
improvement and some some not so easy room for improvement so i want to hit one last thing before
we call it a night or an afternoon um you were saying that the two other cops are going to be
brought up on aiding and abetting charges yes it's actually three the there's the the cop that was
controlling the crowd okay uh i can't remember his name he's a vietnamese i believe uh and then
officers lane and king who were in the original people who approached george floyd they are
because the those two were holding down george floyd's well one had his knee on his back and
the other who was holding his legs um and then there was the other gentleman who was controlling
the crowd those three are brought up on charges as well it's not it like i said it's aiding and
abetting which is a little strange too another thing minnesota does kind of strange aiding
and abetting usually is not a crime anymore unless unless it's after the fact the only time now
that you usually hear aiding and abetting is if you found out that someone committed a
crime and helped them hide the evidence that would be considered aiding and abetting like
after the fact but usually if you help someone commit a crime you are just guilty of the crime
if you are the getaway driver for the bank robbery you are guilty of robbing a bank you're not guilty
of aiding and abetting a bank robbery but they apparently still have it so uh yeah they're being
