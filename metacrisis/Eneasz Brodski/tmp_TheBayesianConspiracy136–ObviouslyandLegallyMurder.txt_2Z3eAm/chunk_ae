from the less wrong genre speaking of Pascal's mugging i was Pascal's mugged by myself to buy
50 bucks for the doge coin in january okay and it worked nice like so i i brought this up on the
live episode what i ended up doing is i sold off uh i don't know how many coins it turned out to be
but 500 bucks worth is that how much you put in originally i put in 50 originally and then i put
in like a hundred bucks or 200 or something at some point so i think i've made two x my investment
so now no matter what happens yeah i've got 6 000 left nice so in the event that they ever become
worth 10 000 i'm going to go uh i don't know buy a yacht and set it on fire to see what color it turns
right um that sounds like a terrible idea but you know it's your money yeah my money i'll do whatever
i want yeah i will i will light cigars with hundred dollar bills that just sounds gross you know what
i mean though i i do know what you mean but on the on the chance they have returned to 10 bucks i made
a nice pretty chunk of change and i'm not gonna like obsess about it now because i was just worried
like you know what if i mix the money for like burning your money in a terrible way just hookers
and blow because at least then you get hookers and blow out of it right i suppose yeah i mean i guess
if i want to be as cheap as or like as as gauche as possible i'd get like a gold plated toilet seat
or something but at least then you get a gold plated toilet seat out of it yeah anyway it's we
are here to talk about murder well it turns out it's murder yes yeah legally it is yeah legally
we can say now that it was the murder of george flood i suppose that is that is true uh i would
caution just because it's not murder like i said before in the traditional sense but it is still
a form of murder um and that is i think where we wanted to kick off anyway because that's where
you had left that's what you were talking about when we feared course away so um what is the the
distinctions about the murders so well you typically when you think of murder you think of
pre-meditation and intent to cause harm you know that someone has done something wrong or whatever
and you intentionally harmed them right that's not really what happened here or at least even
if you say that that is what happened that's not what Derek Chauvin was charged with or found guilty
of he's found guilty of two different types of murder the first the the legal terms are
second-degree unintentional murder and third-degree murder but those are a little confusing the better
way to think of them as a felony murder was the first one which is the commission of an inherently
dangerous felony that results in a death um usually inherently dangerous felonies are things
like burglaries arsons rapes robberies kidnappings if you do something like that and someone ends
up dead you've committed a felony and someone died that is considered murder even though it's not
murder in the traditional sense like you would think of it could be but like it's because you
could imagine someone committing a rape and then killing someone afterwards basically on purpose
but even if they accidentally die that is still murder i heard like at least one case where someone
was robbing a bank shot a gun into the air and uh someone with a weak heart like had a heart attack
and then they were convicted of felony murder for that yeah yeah that's absolutely possible
it depends on the jurisdiction they some have a little defined differently but uh that's yeah
absolutely possible it seems like uh you know again i'm glad we're just invigorating the word
murder because it's pretty loaded again when i picture murder i picture me whatever going to a
store buying a gun loading with bullets and going to someone's house and shooting them in the face
right if i'm in a bar scrap and of course i'm describing things i never do um and whatever i
get into a good swing or the guy has you know slips on a spilled beer or something and cracks his
head on the ground while you're fighting while i while i fighting him i've murdered him basically or
a prosecution could make a case that i've murdered right yeah because he certainly wouldn't have died
if we weren't in a fist fight um so this that's that's more of the kind of crime that uh show
when it was charged with yeah it was so the predicate felony meaning the felony that he was
committing that when the death occurred it became felony murder was uh interestingly it was assault
and the reason i say that's interesting is that i i'm not i know it's the vast majority it may even
be all except minnesota where this crime happened um that defines felony murder in such a way that
that would not be possible he may have been convicted in the only state where that type of
felony murder is possible but isn't it entirely possible to accidentally murder someone while
you're assaulting them right but i mean that could still be like another form of oh that'd be like
manslaughter it'd be like maybe a second degree intentional murder where it's like it's not where
you're intending to cause harm they end up dying so you're still guilty of murder but it's not like
premeditation you weren't intending to kill them okay right so there's there's different layers the
reason it was second degree unintentional is like i said this this doesn't require any intent to cause
harm specifically to them um but for it to be felony murder you have to have committed a felony
usually the felony has to be the type of felony that murder does not itself imply
murder does not imply a rape murder does not imply a robbery if you've murdered someone you
doesn't mean at all that you've committed either of those things right but an assault every murder
implicates an assault and so there's something called the merger doctrine where in almost all
states the assault merges with the second degree in this case that we were just talking about murder
right it wouldn't be charged with murder and also assault and all the other
minor charges i mean you could and you could be convicted of all but you'd only be sentenced for
the one right so um it's it's a little interesting chauvin was a little unlucky in this in this um
in this case just because usually something like felony assault cannot be the predicate felony
for felony murder it has to be something more like arson where a murder does not imply that an
arson happened but he still got the other murder charge anyway which is in all states right the
not felony murder but the um depraved heart that was going to get into the next one is third degree
murder which again you say second degree third degree it's a little confusing so instead depraved
heart murder which is an act that is so reckless and careless that it shows like um i mean you can
look up case law that will describe this in eight billion different ways but essentially that you
do not give a shit about human life you create it you'd commit an act so vile and reckless
that it was clear that you did not care whether someone lived or died and i think that's a great
description of what he did yeah well i mean just my own personal opinion i wasn't there for the
trial or anything sure sure and that makes sense but it's actually the most controversial of all
of his charges oh really because i mean originally it was dismissed by the judge outright as not
legally possible huh uh because and and this is why i think the jury convicted him but why it was
the the judge was if he on whether it shouldn't be allowed is that the way that you're taught in
law school the way it's taught like for the bar exam the all that stuff to brave heart murder usually
means an act to generally like the people usually the the classic example is firing a gun wildly into
a crowd right you're not aiming your your at a at a person right there's no gen there's no target
specifically you're just doing something really reckless and crazy and someone gets hit and dies
right whereas in this case it was you know aimed all his you know all chauvin's actions were aimed
directly at george fluid right so it is not the traditional um definition of to brave heart
murder however the prosecution um charged him with it argued that it should be allowed the
judge originally dismissed it but then in between when the judge dismissed it and when the trial
started there was a case from the minnesota court of appeals that came down that you know was right
on exactly this issue and they said nope it can definitely be charged so he added it back in and
yeah and he was convicted of that as well um so that's uh the the exact phrasing is
an act that is eminently dangerous to others which makes it sound like on its face that it's an act
that's dangerous to like lots of people right okay but the way that it was defined in the jury
instruction an act eminently dangerous to others is just an act that is highly likely to cause death
so the jurors don't have that legal background where to pray for murders usually this you know
firing wildly into a crowd they don't have any of that right all they see is the crime as it's
defined in the statute and they'll get some jury instructions that further define some key terms
so because of that i think they were very willing to convict him of it from my point of view it was
a little iffy simply because of how i learned it before but i think under how the statute is
read and how the jury instructions are read i think that it's a valid conviction as well
but it's just legally a bit weird yeah it's a strange way to look at depraved heart murder
which one is the more serious charge the felony murder that's that's second degree when they say
second and third degree that's literally separating out which is more serious so second degree assault
in colorado for example is more serious than third degree assault by definition that's really
weird because i personally would be much more incensed at a depraved heart murder than like a
committing a felony and somebody dies in the process felony murder is a pretty controversial
crime because in some states for example if you were to rob a bank let's say the three of us were
rob a bank one of us is the getaway driver the two leave the bank with the guns and the money
and the cops start a shootout right with with the robbers and they hit someone and kill them
the cops hit someone yeah the cops the robbers get the felony murder in some cases that's felony
murder and some jurisdictions that wouldn't be because it has to be one of the people in the
conspiracy one of the robbers would have to do it okay yeah let's put an asterisk next to conspiracy
there and so not all conspiracies hashtag yeah not all conspiracies god damn it so it would be
but in some cases it would be and not only would it be felony murder for the robbers but also for
the getaway driver so they're just sitting there in the car i mean granted they're obviously
complicit in the robbery but they're now a murderer okay yeah i'm the getaway driver all i'm doing is
sitting in the car listening to a podcast with headphones on waiting for you guys to come back
in from the bank yeah baby driver and before i know it exactly and before i know it i'm being
charged with felony murder maybe shouldn't be abetting a fucking bank robbery homie oh absolutely
yeah but but it's the kind of thing to where i get how you said it's one of the most controversial
i get how that is unintuitive though it makes perfect sense i should be charged with something
and i and the and the person wouldn't have been killed if i wasn't helping with the crime because
they needed a getaway driver that would be you know i get how all that lines up and yet i would think
if i'm the criminal helping rob the bank i don't have a gun i'm gonna get charged with murder right
isn't second degree usually the one where like you wanted to kill someone but like it wasn't
premeditated like you walk in on your spouse cheating with someone and you kill one or both of
them and that's a second degree murder because you intentionally killed them but it wasn't something
you planned out so you're thinking of voluntary manslaughter the the well that's voluntary manslaughter
right so the um first off let's just say that however you define first second third degree
murder like a lot of states don't even have third degree murder it's it all depends on the state
right they can define it however they want um you know in some states i'm sure felony murder is
first degree murder you know it's all it really doesn't matter these are just terms that the
minnesota legislature has decided on but they don't really have any particular meaning but
the general conception of like an impassioned murder where you're talking about where your
your passions are inflamed to such an extent that you can't really be held culpable at the same
to the same extent that someone else would for their actions that's voluntary manslaughter the
classic case being you come home and you find your wife in bed with another man you shoot them
both and kill them that's the that's the classic case of voluntary manslaughter um yeah and then
involuntary is that considered like third fourth degree well it it just manslaughter was like the
least serious of them well it's it's not it is less serious you know that's why they created a
different category for it and call it manslaughter instead of murder but um it is still a fairly serious
charge which is not killed a dude yeah i mean well you're dead and there's a big i'm assuming big
mountain of difference between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter you know if if you're
driving a little recklessly and serve one of the sidewalk and hit somebody
that you involuntarily manslaughter that person but that's not indicative of the kind of person
that you are and the kind of risk that you pose being out in society while being more careful
or maybe not being allowed to drive right whereas if you voluntarily manslaughter somebody
you're the kind of person who when properly impassioned will will manslaughter somebody
i like verbing manslaughter yeah yeah so and then there was the the third charge so he was
charged with those two murder there was also a second degree manslaughter which just think of as
there's basically two elements to it you were objectively should have been aware of a high
risk what you were doing created a high risk of a substantial bodily harm and that there was also
a subjective understanding that you were doing that and that the harm may result right so it's
both an objective a reasonable person in your shoes should have known that this was a high risk
to this person and also you did understand it oh is that like negligent like not tying down your
load when you carry something heavy on the highway or uh i mean i'm not really sure how that fits per
say but um yeah it's like um it does borrow a lot from what you're describing would be like torts
like negligence is is tort law and that and that's um and a negligent that results in someone dying
negligence that oh if it ends up in someone's death then i mean it depends on what a reasonable
person would do in that situation right i mean if you tied it down you know as hard as humanly
possible yeah yeah it's not negligence but if you just didn't really check at all or if you're
the dipshit on the highway that everyone's seen with their arm out the window holding the thing
on the roof of their car right that would probably be negligent behavior legally i'm gonna go ahead
yeah and so then whenever whatever you're holding falls and hits the person in the windshield behind
you when they die you're charged this in some capacity of having ended that person's life yeah
yeah yeah absolutely so like and it is i mean it's that's what he was charged with even though it says
manslaughter doesn't say murder at the end of the day it's you you were you knew or and you should
have known that you were doing something completely fucked up to this person and that substantial
bodily harm would fall and substantial bodily harm can even mean loss of consciousness so even
if you didn't die but had just lost consciousness and was revived later still could have been
guilty of this charge but not with the murder add on not with the murders no you have to have a death
for it to be murder cool well not cool at least that part's intuitive yeah um oh and just to
clarify i think i i think i've misspoke there so you do have to have a death for the manslaughter but
the but the the the bodily harm that was intended or that could have flowed is just substantial it
could just mean loss of consciousness uh that's that's what i mean it's not the manslaughter can't
happen with without a death i mean it definitely requires a death it's just that for the definition
of the parts of that statute that say like culpable negligence to be culpably negligent
you don't necessarily need to kill someone you know i'm saying you just need to you need to have
done something that could have caused substantially bodily harm which doesn't
necessarily require a death does that make sense yeah okay yeah so those are the charges he was
he was charged with i don't think i'll just say right up top i don't think it's controversial
that he was convicted of these things per se i think that um the evidence was overwhelming um
you know and i thought they had prosecution did a fantastic job putting their case together
i do think there's some weirdness because like i said the felony murder it's a little different
in minnesota most states do not allow it to be charged that way deprave heart murder a little
strange most people do not think of deprave heart murder in that sense but i do think the evidence
was there for a conviction on on all three and i think the second degree manslaughter was a slam
dunk i mean it just wasn't but you know at the same time you don't know that until you see the
evidence right one good thing about the trial as we saw tons of video footage that was never before
released you know the only video footage you saw a pretrial was that the knee on the neck for the
nine minutes or so before the paramedics came um i actually saw the body cam footage that was leaked
before i saw that one oh did you yeah from which officer do you know uh it was it was the same one
that you mentioned in your post where yeah yeah we're like it looked eminently reasonable what
what they were doing when you watch that video not like reasonable reasonable but like i was like oh
yeah i could see i'd be in that situation too if i was a cop and then like a week or two later i
watched the the video where he's kneeling on his neck and i was like oh he just straight up murdered
the dude yeah yeah and that's i mean like because the the body cam footage stopped before the full
nine minutes of neck kneeling right it does it um and you can't really because this that's the
officer i think that was on his legs okay so in that in that part where chauvin's kneeling on
short flood's neck uh so you don't really get a good view from that angle so even if it continued
you wouldn't necessarily see all that was happening um but yeah i mean that's that's a good place to
start so i mean you had this video that apparently was leaked i didn't see it until the trial but um
