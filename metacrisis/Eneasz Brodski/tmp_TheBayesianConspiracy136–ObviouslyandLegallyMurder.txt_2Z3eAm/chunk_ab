they are close to being able to get inside your car they can't quite search it yet but they only
need to find one thing i smelled something it was probably drugs right and that that's all it really
can take sometimes yeah there was one more time where we got pulled over this was great i got into
a lot of shenanigans as a kid and oh i wonder how much of this i should say um pass this probably
pass any statute of limitations which is probably good for minor crimes it's gonna be just like a
couple okay well in any case we did some donuts in a school soccer field for fun and soccer field
it was ripped up their turf i felt really bad when we were back the next day and saw how wrecked it
was oh man but so we did donuts we we we ruined it and we were shooting fireworks off the whole
time out of the car um and it's like a residential area and everything we were you know doing crazy
stuff and so we get pulled over coming back up that street 20 minutes later and uh the cops thought
it was supposed to be a black car because this one was dark dark green okay and he's like i can see
your car is green but you know i just thought i'd you know you thought he'd check and like meanwhile
because it's in colorado you're not supposed to have fireworks or anything that shoots um and we're
we had a car full of that exactly um and so uh we're sitting there you know holding our feet
perfectly still so we can shove all the fireworks under the seat like we are we the car was loaded
with with illegal paraphernalia and uh we he just basically sent us on our way he thought that he
had the wrong car so and then i don't know how he didn't notice because when we got home the car
smelled like a freshly mowed lawn like anyway well that's hilarious but i've contacted the police
and they're on their way right that makes sense so the reason we have justin here is because justin
is a certified defense lawyer you are just an esquire that's right yeah i'm esquire in two
different states in fact colorado and pennsylvania although i'm not active in pennsylvania right so
really i'm just a lawyer in colorado it's slightly annoying but you have to get
recertified here when you moved here pretty annoying yeah especially to take the bar exam
a second time that was not fun you can usually you can if you're in like one area for five years
you can just get like brought in like grandfather did almost but uh if i was only a lawyer for
nine months when i moved here so i wasn't nearly enough time so i had to take the bar like i was
just graduating law school all over again so you took it while working here twice and i took it
summer 2018 and then february 2020 right before the pandemic so twice in about a year and a half
year and eight months that but i mean i yeah it sucked but hey i i right to take it yeah it's
the test itself was about 700 each time and then the the most of the like high profile practice
courses like thymus and barbary are like i got it for 1400 i was lucky holy crap usually it's 2000
plus barbary easily will cost you three okay um but you know i mean it's a lot you're not wrong
however i just will remind you a much like law school for example costs which is about 60 000
a year relative to that the bar is dirt cheap but in theory could you be entirely self-taught
and then take the bar or do you have to have a degree to take the bar oh you have to have a degree
from an institution that's uh accredited by the american bar association if you can pay the 2000
dollars and pass the bar that should be enough proof that you know what you're doing right yeah i mean
in theory but like the point of the test but the bar doesn't really test your skills as an attorney
that well well then it's a shitty test does school i mean no yeah but like that's the thing is that
like i mean no one's gonna argue for law school staying exactly how it is okay in theory it should
teach you how to be an attorney it does not it teaches you a couple of very basic skills you
need to know like legal research and writing it teaches you things like how to read a case
so when i need to know what i you know from from a particular case what i the important bits i can
just skip right to him because i know where roughly it's going to be um so it teaches you that stuff
but as far as like your day-to-day practice it doesn't teach you hardly anything i mean you can
you can seek out like the sorts of classes that will help you with that stuff you're sort of clinics
where you're actually like practicing on kind of where you're practicing under a license attorney
and stuff but if you don't seek those out you could totally go through all law school and not get
any legal education in really much of a sense that helps you practice as a lawyer
fucking nuts man but that's that's school right i mean law school i'll give it this it prepared
me more for being a lawyer than undergrad prepared me for other jobs it was it was more because it's
nearly focused every class is law related is law school one of those ones where you can't go into
it until you have an undergrad and something else yeah you have to have an undergraduate god that's
so fucking stupid you're just here in shakedown after shakedown so then after all that you take a
test that you have to spend thousands of dollars taking and like neither the school nor the test
apparently say you're a good lawyer now right what was your undergrad in uh accounting okay hey
accounting brothers never use it again yeah yeah i know i use it a little bit i had a job
in like kind of finance and a little bit of it after school but um yeah i didn't accounting
didn't really come into the but i you know i selected it when i was 17 i didn't know what i was doing
and i was like i'm kind of i took an accounting class in high school i was like i'm pretty good
at this i guess i'll go to school in that i guess and then by the time i was in my third year i
realized i a didn't want to do that and b i that's when i had a class that had to do with law
and i fell in love with it immediately so i have taken exactly one college level accounting course
i mean i took 10 and it was torture yeah so i'm happy for you yeah you know i made it made
up the other side of that deal by working in the industry for 15 years so right and you know i i
still have a i don't know what you call it when you can't go higher because you don't have the paper
a paper ceiling like i can't go higher than my current position but that's okay because i don't
give a fuck that's so stupid you know and it's it's one of those things too i don't know i don't
think that's gonna happen much in my industry just because if it does if it if they try it all
just change jobs but like uh my wife's dad worked for anheuser bush doing something software related
for 25 years and at some point they made him go take night classes at front range community college
to get a piece of paper saying you can now do this other thing he's like but i've built the whole
thing you guys are working with yes haven't i demonstrated my value or whatever but no apparently
you know it would you like me to leave right well but the thing is i think because big company
10 you know not 10 year but seniority you know great health insurance and all that so yeah it was
a good cushy job for that but um yeah i would never stand for that shit like oh sorry we need to go
back to college and like what are you kidding me mm-hmm are you gonna pay for my classes you know
some places will subsidize education which is kind of cool but even still it's a pain in the butt
takes a lot of time and yep yeah no i'm not i'm not gonna i mean that's how many hours of my life
every week yeah my boss bought all of us because there's only four of us on the team um he bought
us all uh udemy course for docker with this uh technology thing that we're using is that one of
those online yeah okay but he was just like oh i found this really good docker course um let me
send it to you guys and he just he bought us all like he just did that he made me expensive the
company he probably did no yeah well maybe it's he's the kind i think i get the impression he's
super rich is he the company uh not this one but he is yeah he has been the company at previous
companies okay he occasionally mentions like a line like oh yeah like my first company i sold
we did this and like one of the companies i had we did this and um he's never like gone on a length
about it but i think once you're in a high up enough position like anything that you want at the end
of the year you can be like oh yeah that was for the company and move it over to yeah oh yeah i mean
he's the cto uh it's i'm sure and let's i guess you're right let's be real he is absolutely
probably expensing everything he can just because why would right exactly yeah we have some officers
in our company that every now and then we'd like get a credit card bill for six thousand dollars and
we're like all right we'll process it but you really really should go through the normal
channels when doing this this high of a level of expense that's wild anyways um we are here
because we wanted to uh we have you here because we uh saw your posts on the it's the ssc um not
discord the mod subreddit oh the mod yeah the mod which yeah was split off from ssc and uh on there
you are the egos last stand and you put together a whole bunch of really interesting posts about the
derrick schofen case am i pronouncing his name right yeah okay while that was going on on the
monday culture war threat the weekly culture war threads yeah yeah i just like i like how it had to
be because there it's i mean it should just be a thing that you can you know don't it's just at a
high level i thought it was funny that we had to wait for mondays for updates because that was the
the mods day where you could talk about something this culture worry right even though he was just
laying out the up the legal updates yeah yeah and uh it wasn't really i mean i put it in there
because that's where eyeballs tend to you know end up but like i didn't and it is a culture war case
but if you read the posts and if you watch the any of the trial at all it's pretty clear that
culture war isn't really involved yeah i mean that's the thing is that one of the things about
the trial is what it is not you know that all the popular discussion about this case has to do with
race and yet race never came up during the trial not once i don't even think the word was mentioned
and except maybe quickly in vaudeer during during the attorney's questioning of some of the perspective
jurors it just doesn't come up because it's not it's not evidence right he has these three crimes
that he is charged with here is the evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt or doesn't
that he is guilty of these crimes and whether or not he had i mean it could have been relevant if
for example he was charged with a crime requiring some some level of intent but that wasn't the case
here he was he was charged with two different counts of murder but neither of the murder charges
are the type of murder charges that one typically thinks of it's not first degree premeditated
malice of fourth thought requiring the intent to cause a specific harm to a specific person so
what his reason was for doing what he did was really just not that big of a part of the case
and race especially just did not come up whatsoever okay i'm making a quick note that that is where
we are going to start off and we come back to this because as always we start with the i guess
we didn't really as always this time but as typically as typically yes we start with two
less wrong posts that we briefly discuss briefly in quotes i guess it depends on your definition
of briefly and yes we will talk about two less wrong posts first like we typically do and uh
justin you have also read them right so yeah yeah chime in whenever you want to do that for anyone
who is not interested in this at all skip forward i'm assuming 20 minutes or so that's very optimistic
of you i think these are usually 40 well they really i don't know we'll go through fast though
okay no we might not who knows don't lie to the people i mean i think that these are these are
two quick ones and they're they're fairly easy to summarize the logical fallacy of generalization
from fictional evidence is one of my favorites because when phrased that way it tells you the
exact point of it yeah and i i once in a while bring this up and i phrase it like this way you
know if uh someone was mentioning their uh like their dislike of uh smart house things because
apparently there's a movie in the 90s or early 2000s called smart house okay or smart home or
whatever and obviously i think it was a disney or like a younger population movie so at the very
least it turns on them makes their lives annoying i forget what it does because i never saw the movie
but they were like no i don't want all the you know the smart lights and uh the the electronic
assistants that if i say its name it'll start talking to us um you know i don't want any of
that stuff because i you know i saw this movie smart house and i'm like you know we should be
careful about generalizing from fictional evidence right because when you say that it's like you
know you realize you're making your case from something that someone just made up like it is
it couldn't be couldn't be more facetious way to base like base any belief on like oh no we should
really be careful not to uh to i don't know god during a full moon because of werewolves or something
right like it is exactly that level of of of reinforcement there you need a separate argument
for why this makes any sense yes and yeah that's it's wonderful he says people some get it some
people get it and right away and laugh and that is yeah that's the level we're talking on right now
but he also goes deeper into that about uh why this is something to worry about even if you do
realize that it's fictional evidence and shouldn't be used in any sort of real evidence so i'm going
to go into a little bit more on that part because that's the more interesting part i think totally
well they're both interesting but more applicable to our audience that one's easy and doesn't need
anything worth talking about the other one is is deeper yes as he says there are subtler ways to
go wrong um i'm going to okay so uh the first of all he makes the point that requirements storytelling
are not the same as requirements of forecasting obviously stories don't use probability distributions
and makes a really cool example about you know the hero walked into this room and looked right
left and then right or possibly right and then left and then was holding one of these various
weapons and gives percentage possibilities for each one and then his uh loyal sidekick joined
in afterwards and some scholars say that it was this sidekick and he died soon after but other
scholars say that it was this sidekick and lasted through the rest of the adventure and that's just
not a very good story unless it's worth unless it's worth the candle but that is the sort of thing
that you would say if you were actually trying to make a prediction right you give various probability
distributions rather than just this is exactly what happens uh but he says you know but that's
not even the real problem on problems with large answer spaces the greatest difficulty is not verifying
the correct answer but simply locating it in answer space to begin with if someone starts out by asking
whether or not ai's are going to put us in capsules like in the matrix they're jumping to a hundred
bit proposition without a corresponding 98 bits of evidence to locate it in the answer space as a
possibility worthy of explicit consideration imagine for a second someone dedicating a great
deal of their time towards preventing that specific outcome it almost sounds insane right you know if
they're if they want to go to the McVeigh style and blow up uh computer buildings i don't know exactly
what he did but whatever they want to go Sarah Connor and start blowing up computer science
buildings let's generalize from that fictional evidence yeah um then sure you know then you're
then you're solving a wider problem from whatever you think you're doing but if all you're going to
do is keep the matrix our boss from putting you in pods to harvest your BTUs that seems like a really
weirdly specific goal right yeah yeah he points out that normally if you were trying to locate
something worthy of consideration you'd do things like weighing what you know and don't know what you
can and can't predict trying to avoid biases and widen confidence intervals pondering which
questions are the important ones trying to adjust for black swans but jumping simply to matrix yes
or no skips over all of those steps matrix yes or no yeah i mean yes or no skips over all the steps
unless you just answered no right i mean i guess but but but jumping jumping to that to that
binary question yeah the fact that someone even brought that up yeah is there any sort of now
that i thinking about is there any sort of um similar thing in the law field privileging the
hypothesis sort of thing well i will say that um when it comes to i mean this is kind of off topic
but uh part of the i like his is uh example in the post about having to figure like assigning
probabilities to each and every uh like individual thing that happens and and you know as when you're
an attorney and you're especially when you're reading uh like in discovery like a police report
the police have written it down in a certain way right but you have to kind of read between
the lines and try to find where they may have completely missed what they actually did you
know what i'm saying so like because they wrote it in a way that's beneficial to them
so like even though this doesn't really have anything to do directly with the post that did
kind of hit me where it's like oh yeah i have to find those probability distributions in a sense
all the time because you know they'll say that they did this but i mean realistically most cops
don't do that and also if he did this instead that would be really bad for him but he wrote it the
way that is really good for him well that's convenient you know what if what if he didn't
do it that way and so you have to try to dig through more evidence to find you know whether
or not he's actually or she's actually being accurate in the report not really related to the
post but that's something that that made me think of yeah that's you have to find the where the errors
are could be do a lot of defense lawyers do that or are you just like really good no you have to do
it i mean yeah i mean that's like that's you know defending someone one-on-one i mean the cops are
gonna write what they did in a report and they're gonna do it i mean they i think they're mostly
pretty honest but they're gonna either make mistakes or do things in a way that is beneficial to them
and that is subconsciously what they want to believe they did all right that is illegal where
you forgot one line of the Miranda rights or something right and so like for example uh you
know when you're pulled over for a suspected dy you have to be read that you can get a blood test
or a breath test if they flub that line and only offer you one the results of that entire test
