and it's like well i heard i heard them say it a hundred times and heard you say it once
it sounds like they've got a hundred times as much evidence as you do right and that that's just
maybe how a brain works so that's that that would be the case they'd make during an appeal
is that look they overwhelmed the jury with with uh what did you call it um cumulative cumulative
testimony of the same thing over and over it'd be one thing if i brought in a hundred different
pieces of evidence to your one piece of counter evidence that sounds like that should be super
encouraged right right but for me to bring in a hundred experts to say the same thing
like just reinforce that point well and and to be fair to them they were slightly different
the experts were slightly different you know you have like uh the pulmonologist dr tobin
the all star but then you also had like the uh corner who is also a doctor testified to a lot
of the same stuff but he had a completely different role in the case you see what i'm saying so like
even though they were called for different reasons their testimony overlapped a lot
and that's my worry is that it would result in what is considered cumulative yeah i don't know if
you can speak to this because it's not really a legal sort of question but the thing i worry
about a lot is the sort of social fraying we seem to be seeing in the us like is there a
possibility that people on the far right could say this was an unfair trial they railroaded him
and just not accept the the results well there's definitely i mean that already exists i mean and
of course right if you're always going to find people who say stuff like that but they have a
better point than you may be giving them credit for simply because a fair trial in the traditional
sense was in my opinion simply not really possible in this case because the average trial when you're
called in for jury service right the average crime you steven myself no one has heard of
you know we we don't know it's happened we have no clue were these juries familiar with this ready
oh yeah whoa every person every one of the problems that they had to go through like 10
thousand jurors for the oj simpson cases because they had to find 12 that had never heard of this
well they probably tried to do that i don't know if they eventually gave up i don't know
too much about the oj simpson trial i do know it lasted 11 months which is a fucking bonkers
but um you know i this case they i guess they threw their hands up and said there's no way we're
gonna find anyone you know with how well rapidly this spread and how crazy it was and how much
media coverage we're just not even gonna go there so you know they only they only interviewed
about 135 prospective jurors they picked uh 15 originally uh and so one out of every like nine
or so jurors that they interviewed ended up on the jury but they every single one of them
knew about the case okay you know and and so normally that's not ever the case you come in
you you'll see the charges you'll know what's going on what the case is about is it a murder
trial is it like you know felony medicine what is it you know we'll know that but we don't know
the details we don't know who the defendant is we don't know what the circumstances of the case were
we were not poisoned or you know by the well of information out there you know what i mean like
we aren't worried that our city could erupt in riots that too you know and and they also didn't
change venue you know they were having this trial with hennepin county residents in in hennepin
county which is where the incident took place which is where if riots had happened that city
would have burned right outside the courthouse and so you know the jurors were way more informed on
this matter before it started than your average jury ever would be why didn't they change venue that
seems to just like a brain did first step well because i think i first of all you want it to be
a jury of your peers so you want it as close to uh where the incident happened because it's the idea
being that it's a cross section of people that are closest to you okay right but it's a good question
right why why not put it in a in a city that doesn't risk burning i mean you can't put it
outside of minnesota it has to be in minnesota but you can put it in another county they may
have also been worried about how many jurors they could call a lot of the other counties are probably
really small they called you know the the amount of prospective jurors was originally 326 and of
course they can't be people who have already been called for jury service and all this stuff so um
there's a lot of constraints on who you can actually call for jury service they have to be 18
they have to be you know in some places they have to be a citizen so all this stuff um but
yeah why not why not put it a little further up north where the jurors don't have to worry
about going home at night and going through you know riots you know i mean i agree with you
just seems like an easy thing you could have avoided but now it's gonna be it's absolutely
gonna be in the appeal whether it will be enough and i don't think that anyone would have found
him innocent like you don't need the extra pressure of of that rioting it at least from my
point of view it seemed really fucking clear that this guy was guilty well we're a bunch of of
blue wide you know libtards who are going to lean that way anyway right yes but like the
change of venue i don't think would have made a difference and the prosecution should have been
fine with changing the venue yeah i would made the appeals process less risky i mean i i was
curious about i mean yeah we think i i i'm sure that there were reasons for doing everything they
did i i wonder you know i i was gonna chime in on like the the profile the high profile on this
trying to find jurors who had never heard of it you know it might have been super hard in the
days of oj's innocent because everyone only had tv and radio you know no one didn't know about this
who was in the area to uh to to be on the on the jury about it right i i guess uh so i was gonna
wait on all that but i i had to i guess after all that we're talking about the you know the appeal
which people don't have to appeal their cases they just get to right and so there's no way he's not
going to yeah i mean there are some forced appeals for like death penalty cases but for the most part
i mean you don't have to they're going to they always do why why wouldn't you right yeah i mean
you don't have to i i i guess i'm kind of curious and you know we won't know until it comes around
and how the appeal goes maybe they can drop some of the charges or something what what do you imagine
being the best case scenario from uh chauvin's point of view and do you like best case scenario for
the public who wants justice like do you think it's possible he's going to get six months home
uh prob you know uh home house arrest and a slap on the wrist and like going to go on to live a
cushy life like well cushy and quotes you know like george zimmerman you know that that fucking
nut job you know he went on to make a quarter million dollars selling the gun he used to kill
that kid right really yes i mean oh my god wow i don't know about that so if chauvin wanted to go
off and make a celebrity of this and write a book sell maybe sell his boots or something that you
know he used and i i'm just saying like i imagine that would not a that doesn't sound like justice
and b that is the kind of thing i can imagine starting riots and kind of i don't hope i never
hoped for riots but if i did this would be the kind of thing i would hope for this the kind of
thing i would hope would start right all that all that i'm getting too far afield i my my original
thing i'm curious what what is the least amount of punishment punishment you could have dissipated
him getting and the most amount of punishment okay so the least that i could possibly see so
he was convicted of this the felony murder charge right that is the most serious charge that is the
charge will be sentenced for that carries a presumptive range of 10 and a half to 15 years
all right this is another thing i learned sorry no you're fine though for our non-lawyer listeners
you can't stack punishments for the same enough for the same exact conduct against the same victim
right you can set charges because he did commit multiple crimes while doing this
but you can't stack those punishments no which isn't something i knew so when you're
when you're being interrogated by the cops and they're like we got you on this that's two years
we got you on this that's two years we got you on this that's two years you're going to spend the
next 20 years in jail man it's actually just just the two years they're allowed to lie during
well yeah yeah but well no because that's that's not so you can one event could lead to multiple
charges that are not the same thing so for example if i broke into your home to to murder you
i have both committed murder and burglary because burglary is breaking into a home essentially
to commit a felony okay and so i've done both and i could have those stacked because they're
separate crimes one is breaking into the home to commit a felony the other is the felony itself
the murder okay different things right so these are the same right if i held up a gas station
i illegally acquired a firearm i held somebody at gunpoint i drove recklessly and i burgled them
those could be stacked exactly yes that makes sense because those are all different crimes right
okay yeah so anyway sorry so looking at 10 and a half to 15 uh yeah typically so that's the presumptive
range which means he's going to get somewhere in that usually that's mostly what he'll get uh based
also on his criminal history he has apparently none i i don't know anything about it but apparently
has a criminal history score of zero so he will get the lowest presumptive range which is 10 to
10 and a half to 15 years however part of the case that i haven't talked about at all is there's a
second second Blakely trial and Blakely is this supreme court case that says that any
fact that could raise essentially your sentence outside of that presumptive range needs to be
proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt he waived that section of it so there's gonna be no
jury trial it's going right to the judge so the judge is going to hear evidence of what what were
some of the external factors in this case that make it seem more aggravated than your typical
version of felony murder right and then they'll be able to defend with mitigating factors that make
it seem less bad i guess than your typical example of felony murder so it would it could um it's not
going to lower it below the presumptive range but it could with the aggravating factors make it higher
right the prosecution is intending to try to charge him with factors that will go much higher than
the 10 to 15 years realistically based on minnesota case law this is very highly technical but
the most he could actually get is 30 because i guess minnesota's case law suggests that the highest
you can get on these Blakely factors these these aggravating factors is double the presumptive
range so 15 is the presumptive max double that is 30 that's the most he can serve even though it
does say in the statute that it's technically possible to get 40 years for felony murder
30 is the most that he could serve most likely though i don't i mean i this is me totally
speculating i'll just say we're off the top i don't know yeah at this point we're predicting
we're guessing the future right this is pretty tough and i don't know Blakely trials that well
and i can't say for certain what's gonna happen and and i haven't heard the arguments um however
i think he's probably gonna serve the regular 10 and a half to 15 right he's probably gonna get on
the lower end and he also has some time served because he spent like six or seven months in jail
pre-trial so that's going to be credit against the amount of time that he has served that that
he's been that many months it's been yeah almost a year since the incident and uh he was in jail
from i think early may until october somewhere in there or no sorry early june until october
something something like six months of time so um so yeah he's gonna get some confinement credit
he's probably gonna serve like actually in prison around six to eight years is my guess
and the rest of it will be served on parole uh because i think in minnesota from what i understand
it's one third of your of your prison sentences served on parole two thirds is actually served
in the department of corrections so two thirds of whatever sentence he gets let's say it's 12 years
two thirds of that will be served in prison so eight years and then four years on parole after that
with some confinement credit that would count against the eight years he actually has to serve
in prison that's about what he's looking at be right in there we'll know on june 25th that's the
date of his sentencing what month is it now it just it's just may may be a second we're waiting two
months for them to decide the punishment well they have to do so they had the Blakely trial
i'm not sure when they're doing it that they may have done it already i don't think they did though
i think they're doing it like next week or something but then they also have what's called a
pre-sentence investigation report this is something that most all defendants well at least a lot of
them will will have done so they're they're convicted usually it's after a guilty plea they'll
plead guilty and then their sentencing date will be set out like two months that way in the meantime
they can meet with probation and probation will kind of go over a really lengthy like profile of
them to see what their background was how what crimes they've committed in the past what you
know who they're like you know like what's their relationship status are they married do they have
kids do they have family here all this stuff just to get a full picture of who this person is
to give to the judge so they can make their decision for the sentence the um i remember
hearing i don't remember if this was before after the jury started doing their deliberations didn't a
high-profile senators say something along the lines of if there's a uh not guilty verdict
that everyone should riot yeah that was maxine waters so um putting her on blast did the jury
hear about that they may have uh so here's the thing could that lead to a mistrial well maybe
the thing is like so it's another appeal issue right so the jury wasn't sequestered for the vast
majority of this trial sequestering meaning uh they are put um in a hotel and they can't leave
they're basically with each other at all times you think of the jury is on the one you blackout
yeah and so they're they're watched the more i hear by police basically all 24 hours and when
they're not in the court and stuff like that they're you know they still are able to basically
live in the hotel but they are not allowed to they're basically in jail right it goes to jail
yeah i the more i hear about this yeah the more i am like shocked about how crazy the oj trial was
because those jury members not only did they comb the state to find people who hadn't heard
about him they were sequestered for 11 fucking months that's amazing that's insane i wouldn't
want to go to jail for 11 months because someone else murdered someone but like i just since then
it had been my my general understanding since i was still you know kid a teenager when this happened
that like oh okay whenever there's a big enough trial they move the venue they search the the
county for people and then they sequester them for months at a time and apparently that was just
a huge outlier of a case no no yeah sequestration is very rare most juries by far do not have to
be sequestered they were sequestered for one night in this case that was for when deliberations
began they were sequestered but deliberations only went two days so it's just that one night
but maxine waters made the comment like the day before deliberations began so if that in that 24
hour or so window between when she said it and the deliberations began they absolutely could have
heard about it you know they were not under anyone's watch they were just going home what was the
comment specifically if we don't have the exact wording do we have an approximation something
along the lines of that they should the rioters should get more aggressive if there's a not guilty
verdict it was something like that some more confrontational i think is the exact word she
used so so definitely it was in the vein of like there's not a plausible interpretation of that to
where it seemed like she wanted people to riot yeah okay yeah so i i was looking to see if you
know because i i mean i get why a short sighted and not legally savvy senator might say such a
thing she's also in her 80s so oh oh i didn't know that yeah she's a she's an old lady so
they should probably take her twitter or what while i can understand why somebody might say all those
things again to make their base happy or you know signal their allegiance it seems like a remarkably
stupid thing to have done yep given that this could this could be used as ammunition for like look
the jury felt fear for their lives they couldn't make a fair judgment and someone someone could
plausibly make that case yeah and they're going i guarantee you they're going to and judge k
hill the judge in this case said from the bench right before closings began that maxine waters
may have given you another avenue for appeal i mean it's it is like plain as day that is going
to be one of the cases made on appeal absolutely man that's annoying is she in minneapolis um or
minnesota i don't remember where she's from i don't it's not minnesota i don't think thankfully i
don't imagine how quickly she'd be voted out if she was a minneapolis senator the exact words
were get more confront get more confrontational i don't have the full tweet here because apparently
nobody wants to link to the actual tweet in the news media no they want to link to other articles
yeah they wrote that's i've clicked through like three different articles now they're just
linking other articles that was such a pain in the butt in doing some of the research for this case
where i'm trying to find actual court documents and then the site that talks about the case links
to other articles they've written and not the actual complaint or the proposed jury instructions
or something like that fortunately i did eventually find the website that just has all of it the actual
like minnesota state docket site where you can just look at that stuff but i gave a lot of undeserving
webzine some clicks in the meantime i think about that every time i try to look for information
online like how do i download a website um well i mean on the plus side your one click is very very
small it's the mass aggregation that is money but i want to punish them for doing impulse i want to
