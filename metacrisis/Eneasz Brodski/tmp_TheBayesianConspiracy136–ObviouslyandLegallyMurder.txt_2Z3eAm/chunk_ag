you put some of that in with the heroin and someone takes it thinking it's a regular amount of what
the drug they're used to and then they overdose we all saw pulp fiction wasn't fentanyl but she
thought she was doing a line of coke and it was heroin oh oh oh yeah yeah so um sorry i inject
levity to keep things cool no i appreciate it need some humor for these things it's true even in
the courtroom sometimes you gotta laugh because otherwise you'd just be depressed all the time
but so i mean it's reasonable to at least inquire into that right he had i can't remember the exact
amounts i don't know i'm not a pharmacist you know i don't know pharmaceuticals very well but he had a
amounts of fentanyl in a system that could have produced an overdose it was unlikely it wasn't
a very high amount and also this was a man who had an admitted heroin addiction or at least opiate
addiction so his tolerance was likely higher he had one of the witnesses that testified said that
they had been doing heroin together for years um and so you know it's reasonable to assume that his
tolerance was high even compared to compared to a regular person and it was not a super high
amount of fentanyl either but he also had methanosystem at the same time and he also had a bad heart
so that was the two ways they tried to plant a doubt in the minds of the jurors was to say look
not only was he on fentanyl which slows your breathing and that's how people die of these
overdoses that the breathing slows and stops eventually but also he had a bad heart and he
had methanosystem and they made the point over and over again that even though amphetamines are
often prescribed for certain things methamphetamine that there's no safe amount of methamphetamine
for you to have in your system however some of the doctors for the prosecution testified this
heart while it was showing signs of heart disease and was weakened in some ways it was actually a
lot stronger than the defense made it out to be that it was unlikely for that amount of um
meth to have killed him that even though his heart was enlarged that it was you know fairly tough
and also for the um for the fentanyl overdose part of what it does is it restricts your the the rate
of breathing right you can tell from dr. Tobin's testimony that the rate of breathing never changed
he wasn't able to breathe very well but he was still trying to take breaths at the same rate
that a normal person would take them they just weren't good enough breaths to get the sufficient
oxygen in but fentanyl if it was a fentanyl overdose then it would have been that his rate
of breathing slowed down dramatically and so he wouldn't have been trying to take breaths as often
that's an awesome uh example of expert testimony yeah because dr. Tobin was fantastic that was the
he was one of the best witnesses i've ever seen in any trial bar none he was on the stand for like
three plus hours and i know that's a really long time but it's totally worth watching some of it
because he was an all-star he was showing the jurors like he would take off his own tie and show
them like you know parts like if you put pressure on here it's gonna slow down your breathing and
he had all these demonstrative showing exactly where everyone was at certain times and how much
pressure was being put on he's the one who we had like the finger being placed against the car to
show he's trying to breathe through this finger he was the one who was calculating frame by frame
when he was trying to breathe so he could get a rough breathing rate so that we know that it
wasn't fentanyl overdose because his breathing rate would have would have been much much lower
he was an unbelievable witness so yeah expert testimony 100% incredibly important
that's awesome yeah i mean because like i said just to me i have my my prior that i would think
would be unlikely that these two events would line up you know it could be the stress of being
arrested might you know cause my already bad heart to explode which is probably the case they're
making or something but um you know the the rate of breathing slowing down isn't something i knew
about um you know even having seen simulated overdoses you know watching Breaking Bad or
something right uh it's um that that that sort of then of course he's got the the video detail
to prove like so here's what you would expect to see if this was the case let's take a look
and test this experimentally oh look we don't we don't observe that in fact we see the opposite
therefore we can yeah and that's awesome um i'm making a really like haphazard way of
articulating that i'm just uh the i don't know i guess i'm just overwhelmed by awesome expert
testimony i can imagine that there were probably some bullshit experts coming in saying uh and i'm
just you know someone comes in oh no that's the only safe way to hold somebody down i'm sure you
know i can imagine somebody saying or you know oh no that's uh that's what i don't know you don't
mean uh was there any bad expert testimony so i don't have to make up examples uh well i think
a lot of people would argue that the defense expert testimony was pretty bad uh i don't
necessarily think it was i don't have the medical or police training expertise or background to say
but uh you know they only had two experts um and one was a police use of force expert and
you know he testified that it was actually fairly reasonable what george uh derek chauvin did
and the thing is though like with juries one thing you have to understand is that little
things can really fuck with your perception of people right just little things so for example
barry broad was the expert for the defense for police use of force he was testifying that it was
reasonable what uh derek chauvin did he also i think may have lost a lot of credibility in the
jurors minds at least in mine you know he it made me think less of him because he was not able to
give the the prosecution anything when cross examining when they were cross examining him about
what their experts had said and why he might be wrong you know he was unwilling to admit to even
things that seemed very reasonable like for example whether or not at you know at what point
during this incident was derek chauvin even using force he seemed to be arguing that even
necessarily the knee on the neck wasn't necessarily a use of force at all because it wasn't intended
to cause pain or that it wasn't actually causing pain it was something to that effect and it seemed
very like like you said earlier stretching and credulity it did seem to you know how can anyone
not see that as some kind of use of force and so things like that are going to make the jurors
turn against you you know if you're if you're unreasonable on the stand for just little points
against you you look like a bad witness and you look like a liar yeah you know it's funny you know
i i immediately felt my incredulity meters skyrocketing and that blood pressure going up
when he was like that's not a use of force then i'm like well maybe it's a legal definition that
it has to hurt or something and yet if i've got you in an arm bar where you can't move but if you
try to move it really hurts well i'm not using force it only it only it only hurts if you try
and move right um and i mean i and my my definition of force comes from physics and i'm like no i
don't think so that sounds like sounds like you're using force to me um so i heard one of the big
things about this trial i mean this trial uh unique was that cops actually testified against
chauvin oh yeah saying that he used a lot of unnecessary force is that really as amazingly
novel as people are making out to be and he keep hearing about this like blue wall of silence where
no cops ever testify against another cop even if they saw him stabbing someone in the eye
well i suppose i mean so one reason i could see that that's true is that a lot of the officers
that testified were in the minneapolis police department right so they were literally turning
against someone they work with uh you had several people high up lieutenant zimmerman who was like
third in command testified against him his former supervisor sergeant pluger testified against him
and the chief of minneapolis police madaria aradondo testified against him as well all saying
pluger was a little bit iffy but the other two were no nonsense this was wrong right um this was
way too much force this was yeah this wasn't what we teach our officers this was totally unnecessary
that was like an exact quote from zimmerman he was very very clear that he didn't agree with
the use of force here um some of the officers though where i mean you gotta think how many
officers are there in the country and how many testified i mean there's you know thousands
and thousands of police and there's i think maybe eight nine cops that testified in this case so
you can probably find a few granted some of them were in the minneapolis police department itself
and that's a little tough to testify against someone you knew but like one of the officers
was jody steiger who was uh with the la pd you know what does it matter to him that some cop in
minneapolis goes under you know i'm saying maybe he doesn't care yeah i just i'd always heard that
that was like that was a huge thing and that was one of the reasons that it's almost impossible to
be a police officer and be ethical uh because either you are run out of the police department
within a year or two or you lie on the stand to protect your fellow officers and like it didn't
happen this time well i certainly can't say what that what that is like for police officers i've
never been one but i can say that um in a high profile case like this where you have so much
effort already being put towards it so much budget you can probably find people who will
testify against them right it's the average case where you don't have this much effort put towards
i mean you just don't have the time so trying to find officers who will testify against this
person in their use of force that takes a lot of time and money that the state is not going to put
towards individual cases right but they do in this case because it was so high profile okay you know
i'm saying so like i guess if you want justice you have to have a very high profile well it's if
you want justice to be meted out as exactly as possible you know i think i think the criminal
justice system does a fair enough job getting it pretty close but there is so much that could be
in every case so much evidence that could be more thoroughly analyzed that's just not because
who the fuck has the time for that who has the money for that right how many experts am i gonna
ask to dissect everything you know like i had one case where you know this guy had been accused
of beating up some dude outside of a nightclub and you know there was security footage from
across the street from a camera like on the street we got the footage of the from the security camera
and the the 20 or so seconds where the actual incident happened was cut out and so you know
that's it right i don't know and we'll never know because to figure out why that wasn't working at
the time would require an expert it would require someone who knows this stuff right
so that's every little piece of evidence could probably be analyzed a little bit further you
could just go on and on somehow get to those records and have them deleted and it's not a
high-profile case you'll get away with it uh i mean i don't want to say that but i i don't um
i mean look in this particular case there was other evidence that he did it right there was
other camera footage but i'm just saying in this for this one other angle it would have been nice
to see it because there was only one other video and it wasn't very good so i would have like to see
a steady security camera footage right um but i didn't have it now i you know is it true that you
could if you had access to all the records and deleted i mean that that's a high risk because
you're talking if you get caught doing that you're done your career is over right no matter who you
are you have to be like i would imagine top of the top brass to get away with something like that
what if you're already a criminal this is a criminal who's charged with kicking somebody to
death not somebody who is going to be you know using their or hacker skills to yeah well so that
that's a that's the thing though but that's that's a reasonable like line of thinking and let me let
me just say too that most defendants they don't they don't understand that stuff they don't even
know there would there would be a camera there you know most defendants are you know i love them
but i'm not the smartest bunch you know they don't that's why they ended up getting in a
fight like that well yeah i mean that's pretty much the reason right i mean that's you know
unfortunately a lot of criminality is just like kind of a combination unfortunate combination of
stupidity and lack of impulse control you know um so you know i wouldn't be worried about that uh i
don't uh but i suppose it is possible if you knew the right people and we're smart and and sharp
enough it is it is possible i suppose okay and that's why we need batman thank god for batman
all right so so the defense didn't have really much but i guess when you're guys clearly guilty
well one one thing that i think could come up on appeal was the amount of witnesses so part of me
is worried that my decision like my um conclusion that Derek Chauvin is guilty comes more from just
the amount of witnesses that were against him right i mean there was like eight or nine officers
that testified that that was an unreasonable use of force there was probably six or seven doctors
that testified to the cause in one form another of george floyd's death didn't you say that like
had they had some of the biggest prosecuting attorneys in the state right so and that's another
i mean that's uh it's probably a little bit beside the point but they did have a lot of
manpower i mean they had four first of all four prosecutors were doing openings closings
direct and cross examinations all the trial stuff that you have to do they had four people
the defense had one guy doing all that work now granted he had a pretty big fund i think
there was like a police union that was funding the defense and i'm sure he had people behind the
scenes but you had a rotating group of prosecutors for each witness right so they don't have to be
prepared with a with a really good cross of every single doctor and why they might be wrong about
xyz thing and why their studies might be bullshit you know what i'm saying like that's that's
incredibly fucking hard for one guy to do and then on top of that you had a lot of motions hearings
stuff like for example we talked earlier about that third-degree murder charge not coming in
originally it wasn't it was dismissed the prosecution argued to bring it back the guy who argued to
have bring it back if i remember incorrectly was neil cut y'all who is like this former Yale grad
was an assistant attorney general or like was like second in command at the you know at the
Manhattan federal prosecutor's office and is now this big legal like well-known guy and here he is
on this case he's what he was hired what's called pro hoc vc so that means being in on a case you're
not legally able to practice in that spot but you are for this one case oh you can you can be brought
in for one case uh and so he was brought in pro hoc vc to argue just one motion essentially you know
then you're talking getting in to be like asking lebron james to come play for your high school
basketball team for one game you know what i mean like the state put this many resources even into
prosecuting an innocent person they could get a guilty verdict oh yeah i mean if like i guess you
know that you know you're talking the situation can go any one a million different ways so many
variables in this case their evidence was fairly um obvious that i mean the evidence itself was the
videotape right right so you had a clear shot of this of this instant of this instance but yeah i
suppose i mean it does make it harder right of course if the other if the state is coming at you
with everything they've got tons of money tons of time tons of resources tons of very intelligent
people who've been doing this for a long time it's gonna be a fucking uphill battle you know
you said that you were worried that your that your acceptance of the conclusion was based on the
cumulativeness of the evidence is how i would put it isn't that what you would want to inform
your opinion on it well yes but the quantity and quality of the evidence right but so my my issue
with it is for appeals right because cumulative evidence is not allowed right there's there's
only the judge gets leeway in deciding what is cumulative but you can only say the same thing
so many times right okay sorry so one argument against an army thing so even though i mean it's
just it's natural right for people to see the same like the same argument made over and over and over
again it looks like you've got just these two experts against like 25 you know at what point you
just go well i mean even if the two are right how am i supposed to decide that i'm just a juror i'm
just a regular person you know these 25 people are saying that the defense is wrong they only
got two people on their side you know and you know you're not an expert in these in these fields so
you're just taking the information as it comes it's really tough and the judge led in so much
evidence on the prosecution side that he may have overstepped and now it could create an issue on
appeal where he led in too much evidence that was cumulative it was the same same thing over and over
again and prolonging the trial what happens if the appeals court finds that that is what happened
well if it's a serious enough error then a new trial may be granted i don't think it would result
in that but um it's unlikely very few appeals work in that way but you know it is it is possible
it does seem like he was towing that line where it's like this is like the sixth doctor that's
testified to this are you sure you want to allow that in like you're seem to be creating issues for
yourself that could be avoided and so i i guess i was thinking you when you said you were worried
about that i was thinking from my position of i want to believe what's true about it right
therefore i will uh calibrate my my confidence and a belief to the extent that i get more of
evidence and more experts that are reliable informing me right realistically it is the proper
way that you would want to to make a decision but there's the legal constraints that that's that
was the the decision i wanted to make and so i didn't know that about appeals i guess that sort of
makes sense um because then then you might just have you know take take all of this case aside
just make up one you've got one side with a ton of resources who will bring in a hundred people who
will make their case and you're a person with a lawyer and you can only make your case once
