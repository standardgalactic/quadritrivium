that was the full like 20 minutes before this incident did it end i didn't mean to interrupt
but i didn't interrupt but i needed to ask you said it ended before uh like the the it didn't
encompass the entire time that chauvin was on the guy that the video ended did the guy turn
the camera off or just they didn't leak that part of the footage i think it just didn't leak out the
full footage yeah from what i remember from lanes body cam footage it showed the whole incident
okay i don't think it skipped at all there was chauvin's was missing because his fell off
during the struggle his body cam actually fell off and you can see it in the video on the ground
see but everyone else had it on the whole time other than circumstances like that because that
seems perfectly reasonable you know it should be fixed properly but things you know come off
especially when you're wrestling a dude absolutely that makes perfect sense and i then i'll let you
finish you know your actual stuff but i just need to say i feel like anytime there's any sort of
you know argument between well the cop said this and the the the person that is saying the cop did
this said that and the cop's like yeah my body cam footage is off and it's like well then we
believe the other guy right like i mean you have a camera for a reason we paid for you to have a
camera you keep that shit on and the cool thing is because it proves you're right if you did it
or if you're doing the right thing right right no excuse anyway unless like yeah you know falls off
that's a fair excuse unless there's this rampant thing of them falling off then we're gonna need
we're gonna need better fasteners sorry to digress no you're fine but yeah the original uh so there
was the report from the cup foods which was the store that george flid was in right before the
incident happened called in that he had tried to buy i think it was cigarettes with a fake $20
bill he gets into his car the cops show up to talk to him about it officer lane it's actually
chauvin's not in the picture at all at this point it's just two of the other officers who are also
charged with other charges but oh is that trial still gonna come up down later yeah yeah they're
they're going to trial i think next month okay it's not for the same charges they're for they're
on trial for aiding and abetting but they're still on the hook a bit for what happened
so it's officer lane and king at first and they they go up to george floyd's driver he's on the
driver's side and and officer lane like taps on his window with like the flashlight or whatever
and then as soon as george floyd sees the police he's a freak he's immediately histrionic he is
he's being given orders by officer lane and he's sort of following them where he will if he's
asked enough times he will put his hands on his head but then they'll like slide down onto the
onto the steering wheel and he's like i don't know flying up on some kind of he's definitely
freaking out he seems high he's definitely very he's just freaked out he's crying perhaps a little
he just feels like it the video footage is very telling of the situation it was that it was just
this avalanche waiting to happen you use the the word histrionic uh yeah for those of us with uh a
mere uh fifth grade education it just means a very emotional very like um you know whipped up into
kind of a frenzy a little bit like just very like um emotionally hijacked different than hysterical
you know basically hysterical i don't yeah but hysterical super loaded because that's just
what they used to say women had as a problem i think histrionic has the same root word in his his
yeah but uh the biggest lesson i took from watching that first video was like do drugs in a safe
place don't go out in public where there's going to be a lot of other people like maybe in the woods
or something where it's relatively isolated but jesus christ don't do drugs and then go out on the
street because bad things could happen and it's really hard to react like a reasonable person
when you're fucked up and i don't think drugs should be illegal at all and i don't think that
anybody should be killed for having a good time on drugs but your good time should be your good
time should be safe yeah yeah yeah and this is this is not relating to the case at all or to
george floyd at all i'm just thinking like in general if you're going to be on stuff don't be
driving well oh yeah definitely that yeah i don't i don't like that's controversial yeah right and i
do believe he was about to drive some people home so he was he wasn't driving at the time but he was
about to i think but in either case you know they they take him out of the car he's fine for a minute
they're talking to him on the ground you know he's you know still a little upset but he's not
freaking out he's not resisting or anything they're not even arresting him really at this point he is
in handcuffs and they're in the middle of an arrest but they're not like put bring him into the squad
car or anything so he's fine for a minute then they bring him over to the squad car to actually
bring him to the the jail to book him and that's when everything goes completely off the rails
george floyd tries with everything he has to not get in that car and that's in that goes on for
about four minutes including during those four minutes of struggle him saying i can't breathe
a few times the first time he sat down in the car like even they weren't even touching him yet and
he was saying that right and so you know so just to contextualize a little when he says it later
and they don't they kind of ignore him there's there is some reasonableness in there where it's
like okay well you know you're not only are you speaking right now but you've been saying this
for like 10 minutes even before we were doing this you were saying this when you were sitting down
and then but so they they continue this for about four minutes that's when they drag him to the ground
and that's when the the hold starts yeah and i think um if i'm being honest i don't think it
was unreasonable at first like i think the fact that they're putting him in this hold that they've
got him on the ground that's probably okay i'm okay with all this right and just for a couple
of minutes but there's i understand why the leaked footage stopped there because right up until that
point you're like yeah they're they're doing things more or less reasonably this is a shitty situation
but nothing's fucked up yet but it's just when you see the next seven minutes right and then so
then it continues and then at some point george fluid is saying i can't breathe and you can tell
his voice is starting to fade and he's getting slower and they still kept the knee on the neck
and this was i think the testimony that really hit it home for me it was from this guy dr toben
who was a pulmonologist testified for the prosecution he would show george fluid these
little tiny moments in the in the video where he was like putting his finger up against the tire
and up against the ground to try to create just a little bit more space for his chest
but that was him trying to the way he put it was trying to literally breathe
with his fingers like trying to just push just a little bit just to create a little bit of
space for his chest and then he they actually show the moment that george fluid goes unconscious
you can see his head just drop and that's when he's unconscious and then they keep the knee on
the neck or chauvin keeps his knee on the neck for another three and a half minutes after that
in about 45 seconds after he goes unconscious one of the officers tells chauvin and this was like
the nail in the coffin for me tells him i can't find a pulse and then chauvin's knee stays on the
neck for another two minutes and 44 seconds before the paramedics tap him on the shoulder
saying they're here and that's when he lets him up so i've got a couple i guess three quick thoughts
one i haven't watched the video uh i'm sorry to to bring that no no no i it is and i've i've read
every uh detailed account i've come across i just i couldn't bring myself to sit and watch it i knew
it wrecked my day um part of me thinks that i you know so what you should pay that price to
feel what's going on but i mean i i'm a very uh empathetic person i'm making this point much
longer than i meant to say i guess what i'm saying is i didn't see the video so i'm what you're
what you're reciting is what i'd heard before other than the fact that i didn't know that he
had been unconscious for minutes before the paramedics showed up or that the other officer said
i can't find a pulse because i had i had seen moments or pictures or something where you know
chauvin's on him kind of just shooting the shit you know yep got this guy looking for him to calm
down talking with my fellow officers whatever like it he didn't he didn't behave like somebody who was
like i got him he's you know i'm killing him right now and getting off on it right um so you didn't
see the video no i you suggest i watch it maybe up to you like the thing that i really got out of it
is that i think he killed him not because he was trying to kill him but because there were other
people around saying you're killing him get off him and he was like fuck you i do what i want you
told me to get off this guy i'm gonna stay on him and like in his mind he wasn't killing the guy
obviously but he was staying on him to flex his power at these people who were worried about the
guy's life and that is like that to me is the really depraved part that this was something
that was dangerous to the dude and he was doing it anyway because there were punk kids over there
trying to tell him to worry about the dude's life and he wasn't gonna he wasn't gonna take his knee
off because they said so yeah like that's that's just the other part that gets to me he's in handcuffs
at this point floorways yes and you know i'm not a brazilian jujitsu expert um you look so much like
one i i i give off that vibe of master class black belt but um i've watched a handful of videos and
i'm interested my point is i know that there are ways to keep people on the ground without putting
your knee on their neck if they're in handcuffs he could have just rested his knee on his pelvis
while he's facedown he there's nothing he could have done to get up with you know 100 pounds of
officer leaning on him right right uh i at least i am pretty sure um i if anyone knows better than
please correct me but i'm uh i'm pretty sure i'm uh quoting an actual brazilian jujitsu black belt
that you know without without arms uh if someone and i'm saying 100 pounds of officer because
the guy doesn't have to be standing on you just putting a sizable weight on you what can you do
literally nothing you sit there and flop for a minute until you just surrender um that to me
sounds like the way that one should do these sorts of things again i don't feel threatened by a guy in
handcuffs um i i don't know what joey's floyd's measurements are but i'm a smaller than average
dude or maybe his i don't know i'm five eight hundred fifty pounds most guys are bigger than me um
but if he was in handcuffs laying down i think i'd feel pretty safe especially if i had three
buddies near me right um so i i wouldn't feel like i need to do whatever i can to keep him
keep him under control and i say that as somebody who's not in a lot of stressful situations like
that but uh i guess it doesn't strike me as uh like that that use of force um that the application
of that use of force to the neck rather than anywhere else is what kind of surprises me um i don't
there's punk kids telling you to get off his neck well i mean then you know obviously then i've
got to stay on oh come on but um it's i feel like i brought that up for another reason oh new york
banned uh kneeling on people did they ban it or was it introduced i was outlawed i think it's
illegal i i i wasn't sure but i didn't vote it on it that was the impression i got is that it was
put past into law so yeah so you you what that means is like if i've got a guy who's not in
handcuffs yet and i can't put my knee on the small of his back i basically need four buddies to hold
down each an appendage and i don't know how else i'm going to put somebody down without uh again
i'm not an expert at this sort of thing but um i heard that's usually how chimpanzees have coos
ripping each other's arms off no no no uh they have four buddies and uh yeah one each one grabs a
limb and the other dude like punches them in the face or whatever but yeah you when you don't know
martial arts techniques and when you do it's interesting i'm part of this is stuff i learned
elsewhere and part of this is from a semi-recent episode of sam harris's podcast where he has on
uh a black belt uh jujitsu practitioner who runs uh uh slew of dojos across the country
including one that's working with a small police municipality but that's that gets more in the
episode um this guy he's one of the most like erratic guests he's i don't know if he had too
much coffee or something or if he was nervous about being on the air but he's really really like
oh and let me tell you this part oh yeah no that's not even the park man let me like
his energy is a lot but in the last 30 minutes he gets into the actual numbers of uh what training
can do for officers and stuff but he talks about is like you know i'm an expert i couldn't keep somebody
down if i couldn't touch their torso right and like and he's like and he emphasizes over and over
like i'm a professional i've been doing this for 20 years professionally i'm not an officer who gets
two hours of training a year you know um anyway i i think i heard parts of that like where he said
the only option if you can't like touch their torso and put them in a hold is to beat them until
they're half unconscious yeah yeah based or again have four friends sit in their arms or legs like
there's there's not much to do to somebody unless you can attack their center of gravity to to hold
them down um i i'm bringing this sounds like i'm making huge digression but it was related because
the i mean again the the the picture i saw of Shobin and again i didn't see the video he didn't
strike me as somebody who's trying to murder this guy he was holding them down but i to my
untrained and only barely informed eyes it seems like there were way safer ways you could have been
doing that and i think that that alone makes it you know would have made this a big big issue if
even if floyd hadn't died a lot of consciousness it's like what do you want his goddamn neck for
are you kidding me i think that's where the depraved heart thing really feels like it fits to me
because he didn't give a shit about if he was endangering someone's life with what he's doing
yeah and if the officer is like there's that subjective standard you have to understand what
you're doing yeah and they they're telling them you know we can't find a pulse and at that point
you are aware of what you're doing like you are now in the air you're no longer in the i am restraining
them or even restraining them unreasonably you're now in the realm of this guy may actually be dead
and and i'm staying on him anyway right and i'm just you know for two minutes and 44 seconds
which count that out that's a long time yeah and you just don't move so what sort of um
case did i mean and obviously this this case went on for like how many hours were they in the courtroom
for like usually i mean it's a like five to six i mean they'll have like they'll have like three
hours in the morning with a 15 minute break in the middle somewhere in an hour for lunch then
three more hours in the afternoon with like a 15 minute break and then you multiply that out by
you know 12 or 13 full days of court so so 50 ish hours ballpark even more probably 65 so so they
sat there for 60 hours discussing this so obviously i we can't get into every argument made by each
side but i'm kind of curious in broad strokes what what did the defense have to say and what
did the prosecution have to say because i know the defense tried to do things like and first of all
we're going to link to a bunch of really cool posts that that justin put together on the mod like
we mentioned at the top um that they were there were just great weekly kind of updates you know
for me who's not equipped to watch a trial and a be able to pay attention and be understand what
i'm watching i was able to kind of get the digest of what was happening it was really cool um so i
know some of this but for the people who haven't read these yet like what what in broad strokes
were the the cases made by the defense and the prosecution like i know the the charges they brought
against but what what did the cases look like sure so we've already basically been touching on what
the prosecution was arguing the whole idea of him keeping the knee on the neck for that long is
flies in the face of Minneapolis police training at least according to them and what is a reason
what a reasonable officer should do in his situation and that one thing we didn't really hit on but
kind of implicitly did i suppose is the cause um what was actually the cause of death was it the
knee right or was it the drugs in george fluid system that was a big part of the case i knew
that was a big contention in that it i didn't mean to interrupt i'm sorry i'll try and i'll get a
mouth shut for these two minutes but that when when i knew that that was part of what was going on
it was kind of just like it's drained credulity that like you're telling me that this guy died
from asphyxiation while someone was pressing the knee on his on on his neck but it happened to be
because he was on drugs like just it's possible it's definitely possible people people asphyxiate
by taking too many drugs all the time um but but for those two minutes to line up for those
moments to line up so well to each other and you're telling me you're you're you're making
that case that that strained my credulity to the point where i was severely annoyed well you know
and that makes sense but you got to think from the defense side of things they just have to put
reasonable doubt and they really only need one juror they can't get an acquittal with one juror
but they can't get a mistrial right so if they get one juror to steadfastly declare that there is a
reasonable doubt the george fluids death was caused by the uh the the hold and the the uh
cardiopulmonary arrest that resulted that you either push off the trial and have them have to
do this all over again or you may even get an acquittal so but you're you're right i think
and that's why the jury i think found him guilty of all these charges is even though they tried to
say that essentially the because george flight had fentanyl in his system and fentanyl is now
infamous for being this drug where very little is required for you to die from it right and so
the uh big opioid crisis crisis is mainly about right well it's that's the overdosing
yes i mean the opioids themselves i mean like heroin obviously causes a ton of problems by
itself but you know people are now more than ever there's fentanyl in it because it's cheaper and so
