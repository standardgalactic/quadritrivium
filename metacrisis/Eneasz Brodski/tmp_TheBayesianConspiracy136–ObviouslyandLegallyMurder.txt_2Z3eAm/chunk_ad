solutions as they begin to discuss the problem and consequently the group interaction focuses on
the merits and problems of those proposed solutions uh when a researcher enacted an edict to enhance
group problem solving the edict was do not propose solutions until the problem has been discussed
as thoroughly as possible without suggesting any and this did very well i do i do try to keep this
in mind and this one's not that hard to do especially when working in groups um if you're
trying to figure something out or work on a solution to a problem um it especially if you
remember to bring it up early depending on if you're dealing with people who have heard the
phrase or not um it is very helpful to say hold on before we start trying to answer the question
let's discuss the problem a little more and i find that very helpful to do with work things with
non-work things with whatever but anyone who's read like you said method of rationality particularly
chapter 25 chat named you guessed it hold off on proposing solutions is already familiar with
the lesson of this one i i'd hate to put you on the spot again but i don't really hate that because
that's why i brought you here um fair enough is is there i'm assuming that in trials there's a lot
of not proposing solutions and trying to map out the problem space first but maybe i'm wrong about
this well i mean you should by the time you're at trial all of the issues should have been
meted out by then i'm not sure what you mean you usually i mean trials they have their fair share
of things that come up that fuck things up but for the most part whatever the main issues are
are already handled before trial oh you should always already out of the way by then so you're
just trying to convince the jury yeah you have your story and i have mine and we're gonna tell
our stories and see whether or not the jury thinks you're guilty of what they're charged with beyond
a reasonable doubt but like as far as like an evidentiary issue like whether something should
be allowed to come in that's already handled by this time um so i guess it's all the pre-trial
work where you're right okay yeah there's usually those several stages before a trial starts where
you would you would handle those issues ahead of time and mostly because if you handle them during
trial what that actually looks like is the jury just sitting around doing nothing for long periods
of time or being told to just sit in their jury room which is this tight little room that no one
wants to be in for more than five minutes and just having them sit in there for two hours and then
you know you have to check in on them every so often be like sorry guys it's gonna be another 30
minutes and they're like uh-huh sure you know what i mean it's just a noise people slows everything down
so yeah you always get that stuff done well ahead of time how how much pre-trial work is there for
each pre-trial well depends on the case yeah it depends on the case i mean for there's some cases
where it's just pretty clear that there's gonna be a plea agreement pretty early on and so you're
just doing some very basic like you'll review the discovery you'll you'll reach out to the prosecution
talk to them a little bit you'll you know ask for your client to provide some mitigation you know
like what you know let's make them see you as more than just the crime that you're charged with
so that you get a better deal but then there's some stuff where okay well there was this there's
this huge like maybe maybe one event that occurred there was like i'm thinking of one in particular
client i had who there were several witnesses to the crime they gave some statements on the scene
to the police officers but it was very bare bones and this was a case we thought might go to trial so
we actually hired a private investigator to go and interview those witnesses further and you want
to get those also like videotaped so you can also maybe have them transcribed if you ever call them
and they go on the stand and they're going off of they're going off track from what they said
you can impeach them with that you can say well isn't it true that on this date you had an interview
with so-and-so and isn't it true that you know you said this on that date you know so so impeaching
is like the technical term for dunking on someone yeah basically yeah it's an impeachment impeachment
is the is legally making someone look like a like a liar okay that's what impeachment evidence
basically is is trying to make you look like a bad witness thank you full of shit it was it's
what i've learned because justin i've had several talks on like how law works and it is so
disappointingly even like more convoluted than i would have guessed so like the like what you'd
like to imagine ideally you would start with not even really a defense and prosecution you would
start with like a an objective like what happened here right and then what then the cynic might think
oh no what you've got is the defense who starts with the default assumption they didn't do it let's
try and prove it and the prosecution who says they did it let's prove it it's not even like that
right it's so much more there's so many more twists and turns in there where it's like the
defense is like oh he totally did it but did he do the exact charge that they brought to bear
no can we mitigate that you know like it's it's just makes me glad i uh will probably never end
up in a courtroom because i don't break that many laws um yeah please don't yeah it sounds like a
nightmare i don't want to represent your ass i would i would have wouldn't it be on an ethical
fee to represent him oh no i just i i don't think i'd have the patience for it no i'd be like
you just go on a murder spree in the middle of the courtroom or i'd be like look can i just
i'll say whatever you want can i just how long how long do i serve in jail to get out of out of
this courtroom yeah five years five oh my god i'm kidding i don't i don't know yeah i'm definitely
not being your attorney if you're gonna say something like that oh you do you are on record
as a pre caving to torture so that's right yeah am i just if anyone needs to remind you if you're
gonna torture me i will just bet i'll i'll break right away you don't even have to start breaking
my fingers yeah but that just makes it really easy for someone to say hey i'm gonna torture you if you
don't give me five bucks by all means i mean it has to be a plausible threat of torture okay yeah
you they actually got to be holding a hammer and yeah i was gonna ask you if someone asked me for
five bucks and they had a hammer uh yeah i'd probably say yes that's like here's ten oh yeah yeah here's
one per finger cool so in the post he gives an example problem with employees rotating around to him
to not get bored in their jobs but that reduces efficiency and then the some groups were given
the edict of don't propose any solutions until you've discussed the problem as much detail as possible
and some aren't and the response or results here was that those who are not given the edict
immediately those not given the edict immediately begin uh like start they hear the problem and then
start with solutions as their first like vocalizations on the subject and then argue about the solutions
yes if they're told hold off on proposing solutions they discuss the problem more yeah and then they
actually arrive at the what in this situation turns out to be the ideal solution of what
rotating the senior member around or something rotating the top two and let it be yeah worst
Wednesday but uh that's fun as i remember hearing this example in school oh really yeah okay but it's
been so long i can't remember it was must have brought up in this context but it makes me think
how many things i've read from the sequences that i remember in school i must have had a pretty good
psych education yeah well i mean you did go into the psych college course i guess what's funny is like
in high school i took prime due in high school i took i took psychology in high school and i was
like ap psychology in high school which is what like 90 minutes a day three days a week or something
or maybe maybe an hour a day five days a week whatever the schedule was point is it was like
about the amount of contact hours you get for half of an undergraduate degree because you're there for
70 minutes twice a week or some bullshit for a two credit class or three credit i forget what the
numbers are but it's the amount of contact i got in high school was on par with what i got in college
when it came to the actual subjects i wanted to take nice um yeah it it was uh pointed out that
those that were given the edict immediately begin to argue about the importance of productivity
versus worker autonomy and avoidance of boredom but those who are told not to discuss solutions
at all were much more likely to arrive at the solution of just rotating the two more capable
workers i wonder if this replicates i'm assuming it does because this doesn't ding at all on my
bullshit o meter um but that said you know this would be easy enough for more people to go back
and test so uh if it did hit that replication crisis business someone by now could have done it again
or under various guises with different questions there is the claim made that when groups are
faced with very tough problems that's when group members are most apt to propose solutions immediately
which like was kind of shocking to me is that the case i don't know where he got that um it
what what he points out then is like if the problem is how do we keep humanity from being
extinct in 500 years people have an answer like that right solve global warming or you know build
a gi yeah build a gi don't build robots you know whatever it is somebody's got an answer for that
right when in fact the problem is really hard um i and it and people if you have an answer to that
ready and you haven't spent a long time thinking about it you should probably reconsider that answer
right yeah he goes on to say that the effectiveness of our decisions is determined only by whatever
evidence and processing we did in first arriving at our decisions after you write the bottom line
it is too late to write more reasons above and this is a great time to plug the uh previous
less wrong post what it's called the bottom line right what's the name of it yeah which
made this point in more formal detail if you make your decision very early on it will in fact be
based on very little thought yeah and since we change our minds less often than we think which
again note back to that less wrong post uh once you can guess what your answer will be you have
probably already decided and if you can guess your answer half a second after hearing the question
then you have about half a second in which to be intelligent which is not great did you want to
jump in with anything i think i'm good okay just making sure because didn't want to like leave you
out i want to grab the last bullet point because i've got a good example of this okay um traditional
rationality emphasizes falsification the ability to relinquish an initial opinion when confronted
by clear evidence against it and i like this just meta note he he talks about traditional
rationality is basically like paparian science um which i think has tons of value but he brings
it down because it's it's a great bar and it's a lot it's very valuable but he's like we can do
better if we try harder that's the whole point of modern rationality as i guess as you'd call it
yeah um once an idea gets into your head it'll probably require way too much evidence to get it
out again worse we don't always have the luxury of overwhelming evidence i suspect that a more powerful
and more difficult method is to hold off on thinking of an answer to suspend draw out that tiny moment
when we can't yet guess what our answer will be let's giving our intelligence a longer time in
which to act even half a minute would be an improvement over half a second right um that
makes me think of darwin's on the origin of species we're in just evolution all together
that is a very unintuitive and confusing conclusion to come to so it's unlikely that he
he started with the idea you know what i bet we're literally cousins with bananas
and then went out to go prove that right um it it's the kind of thing when you're and maybe i just
you know my my i got the the five minute overview in school i'm sure but my my real introduction
to it that i i'm sure most of my references go to in my brain without knowing it is richard dockins
um uh the greatest show on earth and he spends like the first five chapters just daisy chain
walking you to the basics of evolution he does not start from the beginning you know from the the
the conclusion and give you all the evidence for it he walks you from wherever your starting point is
you get to fully understand it by halfway through the book or most the way through the book anyway
and it and it's when it when it's presented that way in the very incremental step you can
sit in that moment of uncertainty for a long time and i imagine that's how it was initially
discovered right i think most confusing things that like many i think most big problems are
probably solved that way where there was a long period of people not really know what's going on
they just go out and measure stuff and like then they're thinking okay well hold on if this flower
so deep and i'm only seeing these kinds of butterflies or these kinds of birds like there's
gotta be a bird with a beak deep enough to get into that flower right like because that's that's
all the rest of these getting pollinated you're just you're out there seeing these things and
try and solve the the excellent you know to get an explanation for it um the the eventual conclusion
is again like that that's my favorite fact you know like it's it's fun and cosmological to think
about that your you know your body is made of stardust like that's awesome but to me my my one
sentence of zinger for like mind-blowingness is like we are literally cousins with bananas like
that it's that is so uh i don't you know what i mean it's just it's fun it reminds me did you
see that terrible alien prequel prometheus yes i did it was so bad but at the very beginning like
this very humanoid looking dude just like a really tall bald dude i think they're like 10 feet tall
or something comes to earth put some black goo in uh water and eventually that is like what helps
make the humans right if you say so i forgot the movement yeah i haven't seen this since it came out
so but yeah that was that was the thing that was like this will uh help seed the intelligence
into this planet and this like this was done as life is first evolving on earth maybe even before
that like we see barren rocks at the beginning of the movie and it was pointed out that like
after the millions of years have passed where we get from that little black goo to humans
like we're more closely related to strawberries than we are to the aliens that first seeded the
planet and yet somehow we look exactly like them except a few feet shorter right yeah it's it seems
to strain credulity that um it's basically just people not knowing how evolution enforced oh yeah
yeah i mean that my favorite example of that is x-men yes it opens up with with sir patrick stewart
talking about you know evolution once you know one small genetic mutate mutation it's like suddenly
you can throw lightning bolts right or teleport or control minds or move metal uh yeah you know uh this
my this gene flipped and now suddenly i can move metal of my mind um yeah i mean that's it's all
fun and good though uh i do think this ties a bit into the um fictional evidence post though
because when he says the ability to relinquish an initial opinion when confronted by clear
evidence against it is what traditional reality is based on traditional rationality uh but once
you have an idea in your head it'll probably require way too much evidence to get it out again
like seems sort of like a argument for not getting um unreality founded evidence into your head
yeah i mean depending on you know how how wedded am i to any belief i got from watching a movie um
i'm trying to think of any movies i've seen recently that weren't you know uh i i just saw
a movie like in the last couple of days what did i watch oh i watched a movie last night uh it was a
polish or uh polish it was a danish movie with madz michelson could have been better for the
polish movie the reason i thought it was polish because i watched a trailer for a polish netflix
series uh i think it's i forget might be like the word orgasm came up a lot in the trailer
okay uh these these high school or college girls make an orgasm app or something and i was like
this isn't polish inyash could watch it and understand it um be hard my polish is bad there's
subtitles you could relearn polish watching this and i'm like this might be good but i'm not going
to pilot a show you know that i have to watch it read subtitles anyway this this uh this danish
movie was subtitled and it was like an action comedy because the the the humor there was very
different point is i saw a movie last night and i'm not i'm not taking any lessons from that movie
none whatsoever um you know the there's there's nothing it was and yet now you hate danish people
just a little bit more than yesterday what does that mean with with people not liking danish people
oh i don't know is that a thing like it seems to be a joke um i mean i wasn't sure whether i
should go with love or hate danish people more and i was like yeah hate's more um you know in
cindy area i'll go with that one there was a joke on a tv show called better off ted where
she played the sister on arrest development i forget her name um she played like this this
ceo portia something yeah portia something okay anyway um and i forget what it was oh and there
was also like a like a picture i saw on reddit it was like someone's lawn sign it's like you know we
love uh you know we love um muslims jews christians various nationalities various races except danes
fuck danes and like it was clearly a joke but then uh um Veronica on better off ted makes a similar
joke and he's like is that why you hate danish people i don't hate danish people i love them
that's why i hold them to a higher standard nice so there must be some background meme to this
i'll have to look into it why do people hate the danes i know that uh the us and um what the
Netherlands i believe is where the danish are located uh have a special uh friendship treaty
that makes it much easier for americans to go and become danish residents permanently cool
yeah i guess i guess we hate them so much that we made a special friendship treaty with them
just to keep them in check keep your friends closer they make delicious pastries your enemies
called danish yeah yeah i went to the Whole Foods last night to buy some we've gotten off
topic as we always do we should get back onto the top of the murder all right well before that we've
got a quick uh speaking of murder muggings our next time we've got Pascal's mugging tiny probabilities
of vast utilities and illusion of transparency why no one understands you again two classics
