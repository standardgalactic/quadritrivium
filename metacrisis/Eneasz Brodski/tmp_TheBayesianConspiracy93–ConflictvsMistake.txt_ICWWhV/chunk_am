Yeah.
Tell your friends, coworkers, parents.
That actually works a lot better than reviews on iTunes because, you know,
then you'd hear it from someone you actually trust to have a good taste.
Tell your enemies just for fun.
Let us know how that goes.
All right.
Thanks everyone.
Cheers.
Bye.
