what it's like they are turned off because they were lied to. I think a similar thing goes down
with global warming and the fires that we're having right now because as I'm not sure how many
people are aware I think it's been being yelled a lot recently that the primary motivation the
primary cause behind the wildfires is the land policy that has been in effect in the U.S. for
about the last hundred years where it's been we must suppress all wildfires that happen anywhere
and that is unnatural for the west coast because they have a fire-based ecology and so a lot of
dried kindling has built up over the past hundred years and yes global warming is bad yes global
warming will have bad effects on billions of humans and does change the climate as well but
the wildfires aren't because of global warming and when people find out that easily find outable
fact by hearing about the hundred years of land use policy and also see all these people saying
look the wildfires are happening because of global warming and find out that's not true then they might
go well is global warming not even a thing then should this be something I don't need to worry about
because obviously people are willing to lie and say anything in order to get me on board
and that's that's a problem like you lose credibility when you lie even if it's for the
greater good even if you think this will motivate people to address global warming which really
is a real issue yes it really is a real issue but lying to people to motivate them always backfires
and like don't don't do that that's shitty I think that's a good point I um I think it's under
the impression that wildfires are worse now because of global warming than they were 10 years ago
well I mean they're worse but it's not because of global warming it's because of the
yeah that's what I think so I had the wrong impression there um like
it can exacerbate global warming uh or global climate change but like what was it I feel like
I cut Steven off I was going to say I just there was a great tweet that I saw screencapped on
the reddit somewhere it was like the sky is literally the wrong color and you're telling
us you don't have the money for a new green deal or something and which is hilarious and you know
devastating at the same time but it gives me an impression that like you're saying a you know
clean energy bill would actually solve this problem and no it turns out it won't yeah we need to
change how we manage land on the west coast that would solve the problem yeah that's what I was gonna
say uh I took a picture where I had been walking on a nature trail and some kid had like taken a
stick and written no more fires and I just posted that on Facebook because I feel bad about never
posting anything on Facebook and uh David from Spear David from the discord and other podcasts
the mind killer uh edited the picture like it's to say like no more wildfires more controlled burns
just posted the edit and I was just like yeah actually like but like yeah exactly you know
I kind of I don't like the controlled burns solution even though I know that's the most
natural solution because it still puts smoke and shit in the air but at least a like regulated
amount of it yeah I would much prefer like paying some company to go in there and clear out all this
but I think that we're talking about millions of anchor acres yeah that would be using lots of
equipment that burns like fossil fuels and probably yeah that's not a good solution and also the trees
as like you pointed out there is a fire-based ecology yes a lot of evergreens need fire in
order to germinate their seeds yeah just clearing it out would fuck the ecology up yeah so that's
probably a good place to stop talking about this for now okay but I'm glad you brought that up
because I had the wrong impression about it and I imagine I'm I imagine I'm not the only one so
um yeah I can't say I've lived in Colorado for my whole life and this seems I think this is the
worst fire season I've ever lived through here it's also a few years ago there was a really bad one
I know in the early 2000s I don't remember exactly what year I think maybe 2004 it was after 9-11
but it was before the financial meltdown in 2008 so somewhere in the early 2000 uh there was a
really bad fire season where like you could just smell smoke everywhere and I had I I think two
days I woke up and there was a fine layer of ash on my car because it just literally fallen out of
the sky uh I'm not sure if the season itself was worse that could have just been because the fire
was closer proximity to Denver like I don't I don't have data maybe this is the worst fire season
I I know that it that some of these have broken records in size anyway yeah we've broken records
for the hottest summer day um and also the earliest snow yeah there was this weird thing uh the first
week of september where it was 90 degrees on sunday and then I think 80 something on monday
tuesday high of 50 or high of 40 and we had snow on the ground and we had some snow I was outside
and I was just like feeling the temperature drop by like 10 degrees 10 degrees 10 I was just like
this is because I heard I heard the um weather reports and I was just like I need to experience
this so actually I spent that night like out like I was trying to be outdoors as much as possible
and just being like there's no way it's gonna snow yeah so oh my god it's gonna snow should I
post the picture the little snowman may drake me yeah yes please it's itty bitty but it's cute
that's perfect um yeah so I mean climate change definitely a real thing that is happening
yeah but don't lie about that and I think I mentioned this every time but Dan Dennett has
that quote that I should get above her sticker of and so I can just stop saying it but it's nothing
I just like more than a bad argument for a position I agree with yeah and and related to that there's
nothing I like more than than like fake evidence for a position that I agree with and it's like yes
this is actually a problem but every time you lie about it you're making us look wrong that the
truth doesn't need you to lie for it yeah all right think a patron yeah oh this is an interesting
one okay so the patron we would like to thank that helps us bring the all these things that we've
talked about to everyone here and have this sort of community for all of us is the pointless one
thank you the pointless one you are uh fantastic and everybody who is listening here should like
give a little cheer for you right now you're not pointless at all no thank you again pointless one
I was looking through our numbers in the last couple weeks and even a supporter for I think
two years which is remarkable and uh we really appreciate it that might be as long as we've
had a patreon it's something close to that yeah I like that so thank you so much we really appreciate
it and I may have messaged you on patreon desk but literally anything we can do for you let us know
I feel like we owe you one at the very least beat up your bullies we will deliver you donuts
from voodoo donuts the voodoo donuts are not good everyone in Denver keeps saying how great voodoo
donuts are you go there they're fucking sugar bombs you wait in line that's the point you have to
pay with cash and then it's like this this nasty like I got the Homer Simpson I know
this is derailing but it was awful yeah it was soaking wet from all like the that's the sugar
that they pour in it and over it and oh I mean I guess if you're if your taste buds have been so
numbed by a a diet of American pop which is just ridiculously sugary maybe and then it's good but
like I couldn't eat more than a couple bites it was yeah I think that's the point I think that they're
just excessively decadent it's not decadent it's like getting punched in the tongue yeah I will say
I found them overhyped and and I was underwhelmed when I got to finally have their product so this
episode is brought to you by the pointless one and voodoo donuts one of them is pointless and
that's the donuts they're too sweet they've got a great logo though yeah they're really fun like
and what they named them and all this like the decor in that place is awesome I see why it's
popular yeah anyway cool thank you everybody and we'll talk to you again in two weeks awesome thanks
buddy bye
you
