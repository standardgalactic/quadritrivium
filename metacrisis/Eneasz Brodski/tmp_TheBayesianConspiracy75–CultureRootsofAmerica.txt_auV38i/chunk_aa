Do you actually have the book?
No, I looked at it on Interlibrary Loan where they give you photos of it and just the photos
were intimidating.
I was like, oh dear.
That's like all Harry Potter books in one.
Is it?
Not quite that big, but it's pretty large.
Order of the Phoenix is 870 pages.
Yeah, but it's also large text.
Goblet of Fire was 734, so I think between those are probably over 900, but that's a
fantasy books.
Yeah, it's a larger print for kids and stuff, right?
It's a small print and very dense subject matter.
Exactly.
I think in the opening paragraph, he says it was academically dense and stuff, but he
read it because I'm paraphrasing it was like, people kept telling me it explained all of
American culture and it kind of does.
Yeah.
So I'm like, all right.
I'm already intrigued.
Let's read through the rest of this.
Honestly, his review was long enough.
I feel like I've read the books.
So.
It was a really good review.
Yeah.
Scott writes fantastic reviews of books.
Although the interesting, this group facts part make me want to read the book more because
a lot of the facts were really bizarre.
Yeah.
I'm like, how many aren't in this review?
Right.
I should just say, I'm nodding.
I don't know what else to say.
You can say, yeah.
I'm going to drop a couple of those.
I agree.
Someone listening, Scott will get this joke and it'll be really funny.
So yeah.
It's not a joke.
It's an inside joke.
All right.
I'll go ahead and ruin it by explaining it.
You've got to explain it now.
You can cut out the explanation if you want.
Okay.
It doesn't matter.
The Wheel of Time podcast that I've been listening to, instead of saying, yeah, one of them will
say, I'm nodding when they're agreeing with the other person because they're in a room
with each other.
Oh, okay.
Scott and I have both listened to this podcast.
My brother and I, he'll understand.
He'll be really funny.
Gotcha.
When you said Scott, I thought you meant...
Alexander.
Yeah.
Oh, then in that case...
That's why I was confused as all hell.
In that case, leave the explanation in.
I'm pretty sure Scott Alexander listened to our podcast.
He's probably annoyed at how badly we summarize his book reviews.
You think?
Let's find out.
Okay.
Scott, challenge you to write in if you hated our book, our review of your book review.
I really doubt he leads the listeners to our podcast.
He's a busy guy.
I'm sure.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, this is that in school, we tend to think of the original American colonists as Englishmen,
a maximally non-diverse group from all over the place.
Fisher's thesis is the opposite.
Different parts of the country were settled by very different groups of Englishmen.
And Fisher describes four of them.
The Puritans, who came to New England in 1620s, the Cavaliers to Virginia in 1640s, the Quakers
to Pennsylvania in 1670s, and the Borders to Appalachia in the 1700s.
We're going to go through these four groups now more or less quickly to summarize what
they were and what they brought to this country.
Spoiler alert, when I read borderlands, I think of borderlands, and I'm glad that it's not
that bad of a connection.
It's basically exactly that.
That's a good helpful mnemonic.
So the Puritans were a religious group that drew disproportionately from the most educated
and education-obsessed parts of the English populace.
The Puritans seem to have taken the classic dystopian bargain, give up all freedom and
individuality and art, and you can have a perfect society without crime or violence
or inequality.
And he gave a lot of statistics about how it was like one of the lowest crime places
in the world, and everyone was super educated.
But yeah, they lived the crazy kind of Puritan life that you think of, where they're in
church for six hours, and everyone's very strict, and you can't have any colors because
that is tempting the devil to come into your life and shit like that.
Yeah, we use the word Puritan now to describe things that are kind of stodgy and rigid.
I think it's great we could study history, because weirdly enough, it's like we can always
find examples of things that look like crazy thought experiments.
For example, when I was a kid, first learning about the Athenians and the Spartans, I was
like, really, there were actual whole societies based around wisdom and strength, like capital
W's and S's.
And it kind of adds believability to our universe as a simulation theory, because it's like
somebody playing the Sims, right?
Right, yeah, let's make a society where they actually don't feed their children for weeks
on end so that they have to steal in order to survive.
Are you referencing an actual culture?
Sparta.
Oh, that was Sparta, yeah.
And they also threw babies off cliffs, right?
Right.
If they weren't up to the physical standards, they're like, nope, must keep the gene line
pure.
Most of what we know for Sparta, we know from 300, right?
No, because both of the things you just said, I think we're in the movie 300.
Well, I mean, they were really cool facts about the society, right?
You gotta put that in.
Okay, fair enough.
You're like, these people are so badass that if their babies aren't badass enough, they
kill them.
Yeah, that movie makes me want to go home and do push-ups and get into a fight in the parking
lot and stuff.
It's just...
Does it also make you want to have slaves?
Because the reason they were such a strength-obsessed culture was because they were always worried
about the slave revolts.
No, it doesn't.
They don't show that in 300.
They're like, yes, Spartans are all about freedom.
We need our liberty and we can keep our way of life by having so many slaves that we're
terrified.
Well, they're trying to make the Spartans look cool.
Well, I mean, they did look cool.
Typically, that's the legacy of our founders as well, right?
Yes.
So, I mean, we want to be...
And the legacy of the Southern Secession, like we want to be free to have our slaves.
We want to be free, not them.
Forget about them.
Do you think the Spartans looked cool in 300?
No, I didn't like that movie.
Oh, okay.
Maybe it's a guy thing.
I liked the memes.
Yes.
