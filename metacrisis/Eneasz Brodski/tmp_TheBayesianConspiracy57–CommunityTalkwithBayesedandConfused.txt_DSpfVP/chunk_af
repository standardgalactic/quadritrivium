practice this at home if you don't feel like getting out or if you don't feel like ready to get out
and do it in front of people but we'd like to play a video game if you're already playing video games
yeah I guess I'm doing this at you you tell me if you think this would work you play a video game
by a shock or fallout or whatever where you can be a bad person if you want and it like you play
the role that you're not usually inclined to do and so then you know when you're making the decision
all right do I harvest this little sister and killer or do I let her go and save her um you
know if you choose the one that you don't usually go for and then you're rationalizing for your character
could that develop some of the same groups or do you think that's too easy I think it might work
if it's an MMO but I think you almost need humans or some kind of complex not like two or three choices
of options to really figure out where your character is creative and when they weren't
like one of the larping things that helped me was my very first character uh I was playing at a
do you ever see the old youtube video of a guy going lightning bolt lightning bolt I haven't
it's an old larve video I played at that game legends role playing in massachusetts
I wanted to play the most evil conniving character I could imagine so I invented a lawyer banker
in a fantasy world with elves and undead necromancers and stuff and I played him because
it was about as opposite from me as I could imagine and it was kind of scary to realize
how quickly and how effectively I started to just win in that mindset but it also gave
me a level of confidence because I was now like running my own little business essentially in
this game I started the first bank and did all these other silly things but they were definitely
self-motivated and engaged and I was like well if I could do that there I can't I do it in real
life like I could at least try to do the first step see where it's different that's really fun I
like that a lot and I think you're right that the social aspect weighs a lot because it's you know
like we talked about with Robin Hansen a couple episodes ago you know a large part of like where
your conscientiousness and self-image comes from is like in relation to talking to other people
or in fact with them anyway and so if you're if you're doing it at home on a not online video game
then you know you're not getting really any of that feedback because no one's actually judging you
or even actually judging the character to be
one of the things I want to bring up for people who are more introverted is LARPs also offer you
an opportunity to recontextualize your shyness um one of the examples that I'm thinking of is there
was a female player at our game who is like in my opinion almost socially crippling anxiety and
shyness she is a lovely young woman I'm very happy she's my friend and when she started playing
our game she didn't really want to talk to anyone so she decided to become an assassin
in six years she became the most terrifying person in our game we I have still have nightmares
because she out of game learned how to walk through a leafy forest without making a single noise
that's awesome and it is very terrifying you can embrace the things that you have
you know difficulty with and just you know make that part of your character I like that a lot that's
really cool and by the end of her character arc she was like making speeches in front of the whole
town and leading groups because she had realized that being quiet wasn't a hindrance it was just
part of who she was but she also learned when it wasn't appropriate and she had to she was able
to figure those things out in a safe context of a game and now she's been past that character for
a few years she's married she has a very happy life and I don't think she has any of those issues
anymore I might be wrong but she seems much better now that's awesome that's really cool
I still have nightmares so many nightmares I think you're on to something about talking about like
actualizing these skills making them seem really appealing you know to anyone who wants to better
themselves they hear about somebody's approach to solving one of these problems you know they'd say
a social problem you're having or a work problem or something and you know just hearing about
awesome things that people have done make it sound really attractive I like that a lot and you know
I've gotten excited just hearing about most of these right that's awesome
let me think we're closing up here on two hours is there anything else you wanted to
get out real quick or you know any plugs or anything for sure the only plug I would have
besides my rap album I'll let you guys know when that comes out you guys will get the first
demo but besides that if there are any rationalists near Lancaster Pennsylvania or Philadelphia
I'd like to do a meet-up and if anyone's interested in our game it's located in southeast Pennsylvania
Adventures Wanted Role Playing is our website on David Youssef I am a realtor here so on the
off chance that everyone wants to buy a house in beautiful Amish country I'm here to help awesome
well thanks for coming on chatting man I had a good time I hope that you know it was a
validly used for your time and I hope people thought that we did okay without Inyash here to
give us a third voice but wrangle us in well I think I think that's one of the reasons we
drive so well is that we kind of do a good job of wrangling each other and I think
but anyway no this was great I'd love to have you back on at some point I feel like there's
we barely scratched the surface and we didn't talk about any of the well we only talked about
one of the exciting things that we talked about when we got together for drinks when you were
here in Denver so I know that there's a lot of cool stuff left to talk to you about so
I appreciate it I'm very flattered and I'm honored to be another guest of this show that's
made me happy so many times oh man I appreciate that I still don't really know how to respond to
when people say stuff like that but I guess I'm really happy to hear that but I feel like it's
weird that I'm playing part of that role so to quickly transition away from that I will think
this week's this episode's Patreon supporter Christopher James for helping keep this podcast
alive and you know keeping the servers up and I don't know your support means a lot to us and
good job Christopher yeah and we can't let an episode go by without thinking Kyle he's the one
who makes this sound palatable as I said before all they can do is fix the audio he can't fix what
we talk about so Kyle you're the greatest thank you very much I remember the old episodes I remember
the old episodes before you were there oh god me too those were the worst when I tell people if
they hear about the show they gotta meet up and they want to check it out I say start with one of
the newer ones like a guest don't jump back to the first few we were still finding our sea legs there
but you know they're up there for to be immortalized in history so if you want to go back and see
how bad this was they were good enough to hook me I don't know what that says but they were good
enough to hook me well I won't make any judgment score what that says all right David well thanks a
lot I really appreciate talking to you
