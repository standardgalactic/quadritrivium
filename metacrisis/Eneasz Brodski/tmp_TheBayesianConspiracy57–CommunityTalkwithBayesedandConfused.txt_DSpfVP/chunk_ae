them where you're at then we should stop pretending that we care about it huh like if if that's not a
goal and it's not act like a thing we want to do that's fine like it doesn't have to be an espoused
goal of individuals or the community but it's something I hear talked about a lot but yet I
very rarely see rationalists trying to go out and engage with the public even like on a personal
level or usually even on the big level most of the time on the big level it's them talking to
scientists or skeptics or people in related fields that's not not where most of America is it's not
where most the world is that's interesting yeah I mean like I sorry I'm I'm feeling sort of
somewhat scatterbrained like I have that effect on people well I think it's a bit you it's like
I'm coming I'm coming down from something and I'm feeling slightly under the weather but the uh
like yeah you're right the rationalist community talks a lot about like kind of just bemoaning
the fact that you know most people don't care about this sort of thing but and if there and if
there is you know I'm not I'm not super literate in a lot of the online community you know I read
a handful of blogs once in a while but so far as I know and I'm sure someone if anyone knows this
you know do send a link um to the blog or the article that talks about this but there isn't
a lot of systematized like all right how do we actually do this rather than just talk about like
why isn't why isn't the sanity waterline higher or you know um you know raising the problem how do
we you know what are ways that we've looked at to actually get this better it sounds like the
kind of thing that CIFAR would do the Center for Applied Rationality um they're they're so far as
I know their goal is more like actually articulating through like you know small studies like
which approaches teaching rationality actually work um but I can see them down the road getting
into like all right which which ways of conveying the awesomeness of rationality to lay people
actually work um but yeah I wonder why this isn't like a more attacked problem um it's
you know like I said it's the kind of thing that we care about and that people talk about
but why aren't we doing more um you know like in my life the you know like we've been doing this
podcast for two years because like I partly it was that when you go to you know the podcast
store on you know uh on your whatever you call it podcast app like my why am I blinking on this
the apple one I think it's just called podcast um any type of less wrong nothing comes up so like
uh I was like all right well I like listening to this stuff you know rationally speaking only
comes out every two weeks and it takes me 40 minutes to listen to it's like what else have I got um
so I was like all right well you know you know you mentioned doing what you can with resources
you have and I was like well I've got time and you know microphones aren't that expensive and uh
let's let's just give this a shot so I think I don't know if this is doing anything to raise
the sanity waterline or not but it was my like attempt to do some outreach and more like like
I said it was more kind of like self-serving well not self-serving in the sense that like it did
anything for me but I imagined I wasn't the only person who wanted to you know have something
kind of like this out there and so while I don't personally get the fun of listening to it uh other
people do so I believe the term I believe the term for what you did in the entrepreneurial community
would be scratching your own itch yeah that's a great way to put it and I didn't I wasn't worried
that term but I like it a lot um yeah so you know my itch is well does that apply because I mean
so my itch isn't really scratched because I'm gonna get any more rational stuff to listen to
because I don't listen to the podcast uh I mean I occasionally listen to one I listen to ones with
like guests and stuff um but you know I since I was there for the conversation I don't get the
the fun of like downloading it every two weeks and you know hearing it come out um
but at the very least I'm I'm hoping that it scratches the itch for you know the handle
people who wanted to hear it so well and it's also giving you the opportunity to talk to people
like I heard your third episode when you guys put that up with your interview with Eleazar
Yudkowski and you guys have interviewed Robin Hansen twice so even if it didn't give you more
podcasts to listen to it gave you the opportunity to engage with more rationalist communication
that's true and that was really the goal and that that's that's actually a good way to think about
it and you're you're right like um you know part of the way that I've been trying to apply these
skills in my daily life like I said is just like asking myself particular questions okay here's what
you want how can you get there and you know what sort of things would make you happy and I had this
realization a couple weeks ago that like younger Steven would be pretty jealous and happy for current
Steven um like you know I when I every time Brian Dunning's on the show I kind of fanboy
at him and tell him I've been listening to a show for 10 years um but man if I had told you know
20 year old Steven that you know hey down the road you're gonna be he's gonna be on your podcast a
couple times I'm like oh that's pretty exciting I don't know what to say about that um so I mean
I think for me I'm just trying to think of like this sounds like a lot of self padding on the back
of war it's like I'm happy to share that I'm being a happy person right now it's trying to
to signal the fact that rationality has made my life better and to get more people involved by
telling them how happy I am um but the the uh the other side of that is just like
you know like it sounds so obvious there's some disconnect between like being able to just like
hear a piece of advice and be like oh yeah you know that makes sense like then to actually do it so
like for me this is where this is where I actually am going to pull in a weird reference
of eastern Tantra
so there I'm sure you've heard the terms yoga and Tantra before right let's pretend I have it
so a lot of times when you hear yoga you imagine a lot of people doing weird stretches and poses
over mats and Tantra is almost always in reference to sex what they really represent in Hindu religion
and that the parts that I've understood is that yoga is about philosophy its goal is to achieve
quote unquote enlightenment through body and soul like synergizing for lack of a better term
and they have these like poses you go through and these big lofty thoughts
but Tantra has a different approach the whole of Tantra is technique that's what that word means
in the original script and the idea was instead of giving you a philosophy to understand the universe
we're going to tell you to do this meditation or technique because the act of doing it will
reveal the answer that you want and I think that this is one of the things that we don't have I
believe there should be a compendium of texts that are essentially practical applications of the
sequences in your daily life that we can give people before we give them the sequences because a
lot of times I think people learn backwards way better do something and then learn why it works
and that's that ties in great the last thing I was going to say on that was I think
you know again it sounds like one of those hollow pieces of advice but you just really
got to try it like the thing that I think stops most people from doing anything is they never
actually try you look at the problem and say that looks too hard I'm not going to go for it
or there's no way I can do that but you know if it's if the investment cost isn't too high to
you know if it's going to ruin your life to try then maybe you don't risk it but
you know it's the thing that stops people from doing things you know 100% of the time is not
trying it and you know like this is maybe the another example from my life of again it sounds
like I'm patting myself on the back a lot I'm just trying to actualize your advice of or your
suggestion of talking about how this has improved you know my life to motivate people to give it a
shot but um let's see what year is it 2018 so in like 2015 I'd never written a line of code and
don't be wrong I still suck I'm you know I'm new to it but I had this like mental model that anyone
who could do anything with computers with some savant who had been writing games since they were
in diapers and this was like a black box of just this obscure domain of magic knowledge that only
super geniuses had access to and then I met people who you know are programmers they're like
why aren't you doing this you're doing all these stupid jobs I'm like that's a good question I
would thought it was too hard and they're like oh no it's not that bad check this out they sent
over a couple links and I tried out you know like an online tutorial on python called automate the
boring stuff it's free online if you google automate the boring stuff um and the takeaway was like oh
this is human learnable by an average person like me I should be doing something like this this is
fun and I and it's not this impossible thing like I thought it was and so uh you know I decided to
just go gung ho at it and put my job went to a bootcamp and uh for like 50 hours a week for 19
weeks and got some some foundation in there and boom here I am happy and my life's better and I
like my job so like it's just it's interesting what making an actual effort to just try something
can do and you know I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend that you drop 16k on a bootcamp and you know
quit your job as the first step but like if something sounds hard and like oh I could never
do that just go give it a shot at a low investment first you know for most things there's free stuff
online or low entries to to trying stuff out and who knows what you'll find it could be really easy
and fun I usually go with uh if it costs me less than a date with a girl I think is cute or
substitute person you're interested in then I should do it because I'm more interested in myself
than I am in anyone I'm dating and I should be if I want to continue growing as a person
so if I can't even take myself out for a date then I'm doing something wrong that's a that's
a nice way to put about it and it puts you in a good position to yourself I think that's important
um and and uh I think you brought up two really solid things that people can implement right away
which is start asking yourself whenever you see something what is the littlest cost of investment
I can use to get involved and at least get my feet wet and two start writing down times you've
successfully like overcome or defeated something that you thought was harder than it was in actuality
and then next time you get intimidated because you've written down so many of these they will
be the first thing to pop into mind so the next time you are faced with something and your first
instinct is to say ah maybe that's like too hard for me you will have already made this
subconscious process where your brain will make a list of all the times you were wrong
and it wasn't too hard for you it was actually pretty easy that's awesome I like that a lot
from a personal example for me I was terrible with money and I'm if I'm being completely honest
I'm still not great but being involved in the rationality community first of all forced me to
be honest with myself because the longer I was had that blind elephant in my brain about my
inability to handle it the worse the problem got so it helped me confront it first of all
but then I started to ask myself what are the minimums I need to satisfy my wants and how
can I reduce all money intake and I approached it from a rational way and because I had lost my
defensiveness about that problem myself I've moved in a much better direction and
I have my first property in Florida that I'm Airbnbing starting next week and we're looking
at buying another one in Colorado so I might see you again sooner than I thought in the next like
year or two so things are starting to really improve for me in that way and that was not
natural I am not good with money by default at all but you recognize that we just said all right
how do I actually you know first of all not flinch away from acknowledging the problem but
how do I go about fixing it that's really cool man that's awesome and I think that a big part of
that was being epistemologically rational about myself because my mental map could never be accurate
I could never really make accurate and good decisions about myself if I wasn't willing to
look at this big spot in myself that's when Robin Hansen's elephant becomes visible when it has to
stand in contrast against reality yeah I like that that's a good way to think about it you know to
just focus and kind of square away at the problem and force yourself to look at it
and you know all the caveats aside that we've been talking too long to get into of like you know
how do you uh how do you recognize there's a problem if you can't see it that sort of stuff but
just you know noticing areas of non-optimalness and say all right what can I do to improve especially
if it's not that hard and I like the idea of saying you know if you've missed my cost it's less than
a date because you know it's less than a date you know a couple books or something um you know maybe
a date is a few hours so maybe it has nothing to do with money but you can invest like two hours
to watch like a lecture on something instead of like goofing off yeah that's awesome I like that
a lot I'm gonna keep that in mind I am pro laziness don't get me wrong I am too I think laziness
breeds efficiency so if I'm gonna try to improve myself or recommend others improve themselves
I tell them to do it in the laziest way possible because then it sticks especially yeah you know
just with the obvious kind of point there that like if it's not that hard you'll be more likely to
do it and I like that a lot there is one other topic I know we probably have to end soon but
there was one other fun silly-ish topic I wanted to bring up if that's okay with you yeah go nuts
I'm more conscientious of your time I know it's like 10 o'clock there so and you said you have
some tests tomorrow for something that you studied for all day uh statics yeah uh that's
another thing rationality helped me out with once my finances got in order I asked myself if I applied
all of my efficiency to my business how much spare time could I get and what could I do that would be
the most effective good and that's how I landed on my goal of going back to school and
developing a mixture of like real estate developing but that's another tangent for another day well
that'll be able to definitely kind of talk more about that too but what was your funny thing that
you wanted to get to so I think that a good way for a lot of rationalists to realize the difference
in themselves between when they are being rational and when they are rationalizing afterwards
is to engage in acting and play and the reason I say this is that when you I'm sure you've heard
the analogy fish probably don't and have a word for the ocean I haven't but I I like it
and part of that is I think humans and our consciousness swims in our personality that
is like who we are and we move around from focus to focus in there but we never really think about
what it is like what our personality actually is because it's part of what we associate with our
identity one of the things I've done for about a decade now is I'm a larper also known as live
action role playing I in fact I run a game here on the east coast called adventures wanted slight
plug I encourage I encourage guest plugs will there be section for that at the end too that sounds
awesome but um one of the reasons I recommend larping to a lot of introverts and rationalists
is it gives you a completely safe space to be a different person and the act of that is imagine
a version of yourself who is okay Stephen imagine someone who is almost exactly like you in
capabilities but is evil and then play that person yeah and here's the thing that you will discover
you can have and there are moments when you truly forget your role playing and that's
a lot of the greatest acting experiences as well when you will start subconsciously
rationalizing like that person and when that happens and then you go out of game and the
game's over for the night and you go to bed and you think about it you're gonna have the ability now
to like step outside of yourself and look at your personality because you've done it with
this fake personality you've created and say oh I wasn't actually being rational there I was just
rationalizing like the more different personality spaces you allow yourself to occupy and explore
and play around with the more you discover how much of your personality is fluid and what parts
of it are truly like set in stone and that helps you a lot because so I don't know if you've heard
the radio lab but they did a radio lab where they tested this and people who put on lab coats
were more like got 10 percent more questions right on a science test than when they didn't wear
the lab coat I hadn't heard that but that sounds really interesting and if I'm I want to make I
want to paraphrase this to make sure I understood it correctly at least part of it was that when
you're playing a role and then you find yourself rationalizing as that person you notice what that
feels like and you might be able to train grooves in your mind to notice when you're doing that when
you're not playing a role and so yes thank you for making that eloquent because I was kind of going
about that certuitously but it's a it's a way of practicing that third-person perspective on your
own cognitive process in a way that's fun most of the time that's nice that's awesome I like that a
lot I've never tried anything like that I've thought about like improv classes which is one of those
things where I've been putting it off forever improv like acting will definitely do the same
thing to you especially if you play a role for a very long time or go through the practices to the
point where everything becomes subconscious now do you think that for like you know introverted
people who really just aren't ready to try and tackle something like uh uh um improv classes
or something like that you know I think another way to role play someone who you aren't um it's
like whatever I play video games that like a lot of the character to choose if they're going to be a
good or bad person I always choose a good person because I'm like all right what would I do in the
situation uh so you know like only to see what would happen to like I blow up megaton and fall
out three um but then I loaded from another save because I felt bad um so I wondered if a way to
