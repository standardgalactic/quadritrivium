that you should be looking for domains that are pretty new because you can still get good returns
like the opposite is a very fragile return so a fragile idea would be to look like a company that
has had steady growth that is above average because the best case scenario for them is they
continue to do steady growth the worst case scenario is because this is unusual there's
something wrong here and it will collapse like and Ron seemed like a really good investment they had
like above average returns for their shareholders for years but they they had no positive shocks
like any shock to that could only hurt them that's interesting yeah I um you mentioned
the same books from the last time we were hanging out and I really should read some I'll start with
Black Swan um and what's interesting is that I know that that's a book kind of on like the quote
required reading lists for rationalists and yeah it seems that people are still missing the points
you know it's one thing to just read it but it's another to like actually do something kind of
like maybe the 40 hour work or the four hour work week right and you know even like the sequences
and stuff too right like you can get through and you can learn a bunch of trivia but like
actually putting a little work and getting there is an additional step that you don't get from just
knowing the stuff and I think people are intimidated by the idea of conceptualizing themselves as
perfect rationalists because we know we can't be but what you can do is have you read thinking fast
thinking slow yeah thinking Daniel Kahneman yeah so he posits that you only have a limited amount
of energy per day to like essentially do your really good thinking and most of the time you're
running on system one instinct right right so system one was the kind of quick intuitive responses to
problems or questions that you face and season system two was your thoughtful deliberative one
that you have to actively engage system one goes automatically system two is one where you have to
stop and think and you can only do that sometimes for days based on the point of the book and they
talks a lot about your six biases that's a great book yeah so what that means is that even the
best rationalist with the best diet and the best like procedure for getting energy and the best
neurotropic stack probably is only rational for about one fourth of their day like actually engaging
in a rational life so your goal should be to use those moments when you have downtime like a
downtime day to develop systems around you that are designed rationally so that you can operate
in your like system one thinking and have that do most of the work right so the you know if you
could only spend 25 percent of your time actually thinking hard then you try to spend some of that
time cultivating your automatic system to be less stupid and to like system two know when it needs to
kick in which is where like knowing about the biases helps a lot because you can train a system one
to like raise a flag it's like oh this is a situation where the availability availability
heuristic might kick in what do you think system two and kind of pass it off that way
um sorry where were you going with that no that's very similar I was thinking more
like ground practical level like here's a good example I am trying to get a little bit healthier
because I gain a lot of weight I sit down a lot through the day and it's something I can work on
now if I just leave myself throughout the week I'm going to succumb to the lowest like the lowest
energy state whatever is most available so what I've done is in the last like weekend I've done a
lot of pre-cooking and got a bunch of stuff done so now even when I'm not acting I don't have my
full rational energy at me I don't even have the opportunity to act badly nice yeah I like that I'm
doing something similar where um there's a gym at my work so I like I also have a gym at my
apartment but I've used that like 10 times since I moved here so my my thing is all right I'm not
going to let myself go home till I go to the gym and then that way like going to you know sitting
down and relaxing isn't even really an option so it's just like pre-committing and uh forcing
yourself to do stuff um to make those good choices that later when you're feeling lazy you you don't
have the opportunity to indulge that laziness um that sounds like a Tim Ferris style life hack
it kind of is and I don't think that he has any like grand life answers but if I were to advocate
for any one person who really gets how to apply instrumental rationality it would probably be him
like I don't think he's ever heard of the phrase but that's what all of his books come down to
like how can I in the most energy efficient manner go after the goals I want and I mean
that's that sort of brings us back I realized we've been on kind of a digression I wanted to
to talk more about like the initial stuff you raised so um like the kind of thing um
um things the rationality committee isn't doing well um and one of them I think he said was like
not marketing yourself well but it might be a way to paraphrase it um another was like not actually
achieving like not setting goals achieving them like maybe many people are but their goals aren't
ambitious for as smart as they as they say they are right is that an uncharitable way to put it
or is that just a quick paraphrasing that works no I think that's about correct so did you have
anything else on that list because I didn't want to uh I know we went down a couple rabbit holes
and that's something that the show just does but um I'm trying to be mindful uh so what else were
you thinking call me the chess shire cat I'm all about rabbit holes perfect um
um well from Mike's I this is one of the few things I feel confident talking about from having
done a lot of sales and one of it is I feel bad criticizing the body language like every person
who's taken a communications 101 class knows that 70 percent of how we communicate is body language
25 percent is voice tone only 5 percent is the words we are conveying and yet we spend so much
time focusing on making sure that our verbal communication is completely airtight and very
little focusing on voice tone and body language and it's harder for me to make a direct like critique
because each person is individualized in this case but my biggest suggestion would be either take a
martial arts or take a dance class and for voice tone just start doing karaoke or singing in the
shower like that one's the easiest because if you just experiment with it when you feel comfortable
the voice is a beautiful instrument I love rap music for that reason so yeah we should mention
that as one of your credentials that you're a studying professional rapper um I am trying to
work on an album right now yeah so cool see I I don't know I I you know I mentioned I've been a bit
more confident last couple years I started to figure out how to like actually sing and dance
in front of people I think I'm still gun shy from being a shy little kid um but I think I like that
point because inadvertently I've been doing something similar to different approaches so um you know
whether or not the numbers of five percent are your words and that sort of thing add up the the idea
that like yes you are communicating a lot through your body language and your tone um I don't think
those are deniable and you know even in I think this is something that like rationalists know if
they've read like Robin Hansen's new book uh elephant in the brain thank you I was blanking on it I've
got it right here I was going to pull it out figure out what it was um yeah so uh the I think the first
chapter uh so like the first third of the book is like setting up a case for why signaling theory
is plausible and why the elephant in the brain like uh metaphor makes a lot of sense and then
the last two thirds are like examples from every from just daily life and one of them is communication
and uh people like I think people know that like higher body language and your tone conveys stuff
people know that that's a big deal but like maybe it's it's weird it's like failing to take a step
so it's one thing to just like we talked about earlier um it's one thing just to just know that
oh yeah this this is the thing and then another to say okay well how do I actually improve if
I want to be listened to um or or make an impact or something so what I've been doing at work is
I kind of just I not necessarily copy but I mimic in my own style the like the tone and body language
of people that seem really well respected there um and so I don't think I do it enough for anyone's
like obviously ripping them off but when I'm trying to make like an actual point like to my boss
sort of my co-workers I sort of put on a different tone that I'm like knowingly doing because when
this guy that I'm thinking of talks that way people listen um so you know it's not necessarily the
same thing as like deliberate practice I don't think I've done that but just making it an effort
to be aware of the fact that hey um people will receive my message more than like just maybe me
making a compelling argument they need more than that um yeah that's interesting maybe part of the
the fallback or like the not fallback the the failure to engage there is that especially you
know for us online nerds almost all of the discourse there is your your actual content
of your message right um if I'm ready if I'm writing a couple paragraphs it doesn't matter
if I'm slouching in my chair right um so that could be part of it um but I mean almost all of us
interact with some people in real life and if you're you know hunched and shy when you're engaging
you know there's social anxiety and stuff but if you can find a way to overcome that which it's
worth trying to actually do rather than just like you know for whatever shortcoming you have if you
can find a way to engage and solve it do go for it right um so identifying your shortcomings and
not being afraid to stare at them I think is one big step that you can make and then you find things
like you know take an improv class to improve your ability to like dynamically engage in a
conversation or something. Toastmasters is a very well respected nationally known organization
um I have a lot of friends and family who've gone through them and you will become a really
good public speaker and it's not a skill to be trivialized the ability to command a large group
of people to pay attention to you and to take you seriously and to like thoughtfully engage with you
is powerful. Yeah you know we should have had an e-nosh on for this because I know that he's done more
walking the walk than I have and he's also been walking that walk longer but uh I know that he's
a Toastmaster lecture or Toastmaster speeches a few years ago and I think it was deliberately a
thing to like get more confident at public speaking and that'll make me more confident in
like addressing people to get my point across um and it's and it's not as bad as people think it is
like I was always a very extroverted person and I want to make it clear because I know there are
people who are naturally introverted who are listening to this who are thinking talking in
front of a group of strangers sounds like hell and I do not blame them at all because sometimes
it actually is but the important part to remember is unless you are on an island of cannibals who
will eat you the worst possible thing that can happen is that they will politely applaud you
and then snicker a little bit and then forget it after the next bad speech but that someone else
right and you know that was like this realization I had like in high school I was a pretty socially
shy kid and um I mean I still was kind of overcoming that last you know 10 years too but the uh I had
like I had articulated to myself what's called spotlight bias about knowing the name of it
which is basically where you walk around and this is you know every every uh you know pubescent
teenager thinking that everybody's paying a ton of attention to you and you know if your shirt's
not tucked in or you know you've got to sit or something everyone's going to remember and they're
going to you know it's going to be seared into their memory forever and they're going to judge you
but all it took was sort of like just this kind of third person view and for me to realize that I
don't do that to anybody else what makes me so special why would anyone be paying any extra attention
to me and man the like the anxiety of talking and stuff really falls away a bit after that
I mean just just I guess recognizing that like you know you're probably you know you might be
above average in niceness but you might not you might be roughly average and so if you're not
running around hating on people for you know stammering during a talk or you know failing to
reach the end of a sentence articulately then they're not going to do the same thing for you either right
and here's the thing you may very well encounter someone in the bottom 10 percent of niceness
who's going to be a jerk but that's actually the moment that you're going to be judged by
and it's really easy to just hold the moral upper ground and just like gracefully say I've
tried my best you're not the one speaking and like that's one of those things that I think a little
bit of preparation and practice really helps with like dealing with the people who will be jerks
is never going to be comfortable but having a plan for it before it happens means that you
immediately lose a lot of your stress I think that's one of the reasons I I really enjoy and have a
lot of respect for like stand-up comics um because you're out there kind of making a fool of yourself
saying silly shit and if it's not well received or if you got a dick if you gotta let me be more
articulate if it's not well received and you've got somebody being rude in the audience um you
know it's really easy to get disarmed from that and it takes like an extra skill to have a witty
comeback to shut down a heckler um and you know like those that's the situation where you're hitting
the bottom 10 percent of niceness kind of people or they just think that's the acceptable way to
engage in a at a comedy show or something but I always find that to be the dumbest thing you could
possibly do stand up because literally unless it is amateur night this is a person who has made
it their life decision to be funny and you're gonna try to out funny them at their place of work
right yeah this like I've I have never seen heckling go well that's all I've gotta say maybe
at amateur night you can get away with it but nowhere else yeah I mean you gotta think too the
audience is on the comic side right so you've gotta you've gotta be really confident that you're
gonna make a damn good point or be really really funny to uh or be very drunk yeah and and I have
an embarrassing moment with John Mulaney at comedy works a couple years ago that uh John Mulaney is
on my favorite side of comics he had a Netflix special called uh New in Town that my girlfriend
and I were a big fan of and then he was out touring kind of demoing his next show The Comeback Kid
which is also on Netflix now and the comic the club I went and saw him at was a small club and
like there's a lot of audience interaction and stuff and you know being a big fan sitting really
close to the stage I like I engaged on something and he immediately just like dropped his funny
facade and he like he turns to me and like you know he treats me like a heckler and I completely
get in hindsight that was all my fault because the the audience engagement that he had been
doing before was everything that he initiated and you know me just kind of wanting to be a part of
it was like oh if I say something I can be involved you know there's also a to drink
minimum at the bar or at the comedy shows so um somewhat of a lightweight but uh I feel like as
long as you didn't continue after that point you're probably oh no that was actually so that was the
funny thing about it was I tried to disengage immediately because I realized I realized immediately
like oh I fucked up this is on me I shouldn't have said anything I'm being an asshole and
I kept trying to say as like no no I I you know sorry I didn't you know I don't want to and he's
like no no let's talk about it I'm like let's not I'm sorry um so he he kept going for it longer than
I that I wanted to but again not again you know that was my bad I realized that my conduct wasn't
there's also like I think my first time like seeing a celebrity comic that you know at a show
that was like close enough to interact with um so you know I was excited and stupid but speaking
of how easily it is to be just completely slammed by a comic if they're perceiving you to be a heckler
yeah I've got personal experience there so but all that aside it's all this comes down to the idea
that there are very low hanging fruit that I think if each person in this community took it upon
themselves to say I have the resources and applying the sequences and the knowledge of this
community has helped my life a lot maybe I am an oddity but I don't think so like I don't think
I'm that much better or more clever or anything so if this is true imagine a world where every
single person who like you talk to is at least a little bit curious like oh you're doing that
rationality thing I've been seeing waves about that like that's not a crazy goal to achieve in
five to seven years but it's something that we as a community could engage in and the potential
returns are unknowably high yeah it sounds like I mean I feel like the bar is pretty unknowably
high there too you know like I said people aren't walking around like oh my god you're a scientist
that's so cool um I do feel like you know no matter how I don't know you're right I guess on one
level it's one thing to say I know all this cool stuff and I think it helped my life a little bit
and here's like my big explanations for why I think I'm doing better now than I was five years ago
and you know I think what you're envisioning is somebody you know who makes huge strides in
their life and people are like holy shit how'd you do it it's like oh well let me tell you
and that sounds appealing I just I just have no idea how to get there you know talking about it
more could help I don't even I don't think it's even huge strides though those are possible that's
kind of why I like Tim Ferriss he uses real good scientific examples to prove that those huge
strides are at least theoretically possible but the more important thing is that consistent strides
and smart ways of trying to do improvements in yourself that stick we have the data and
we can make a community that holds ourselves accountable maybe this is idealistic and I
have no right to impose on anyone else but if we want to say that we're trying to raise the
sanity waterline but we're not at even putting in 10 effort to meeting people where they are to
help read love like help pull them up essentially and that's what doing all this socializing
knowledge is it's learning the basics and the nuances of how to engage with people to get
