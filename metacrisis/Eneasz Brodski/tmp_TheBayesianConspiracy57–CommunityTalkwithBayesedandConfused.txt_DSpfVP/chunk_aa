Welcome to the Bayesian Conspiracy, I'm Stephen Zuber and Inyasha is busy this week so joining
me is our special guest. I'm David Youssef, you may have seen some of my posts as Bayesian
confused on the subreddit. Well thanks for coming on David, yeah you came to the last
local meetup and it was really cool meeting you and I'm glad you were in town for it and
you seemed super fucking cool and I wanted to chat with you so here we are. I was really
glad I could come on, I've been loosely reading the community of rationality stuff for about
seven years now and besides a close friend of mine who got me into it here in Lancaster,
I had literally never met anyone else about these subjects so I couldn't lose the opportunity.
Yeah I don't remember how I guess you know the way we've I found people in real life with this was
the HPMOR wrap-up party for when methods of rationality concluded there were those like
meetups everywhere for people who wanted to hang out with people on the day the last chapter was
released and there was a somewhat large meeting here because you know Enoch was local and he did
the audiobook podcast and I was like this is a lot of fucking fun who wants to do this again
and most people have been coming back ever since so I don't even think about people here and there
and that sort of thing so I mean that's how I found you guys I was listening to the podcast but
I think I read it when Yudkowsky was like originally writing it and then I stopped for three years
because he did yeah right and then I only picked it up about a year after he finished.
Nice well you got to save yourself that that terrible crawl for the last few years where he
kind of held us all by the suspense. One of the things that I've always wanted to discuss with at
least a few other people more involved in the community than me are what I consider to be
big flaws in instrumental rationality. All right that sounds like fun. So first off what's what's
instrumental rationality? Well as I am aware of it there are pretty much two different ways of
approaching rationality which is epistemological which I guess you could call more like theoretical
truth seeking and being rational about how you look at data which is good and important and
very interesting and things that we should all cultivate in ourselves but instrumental rationality
is about doing what works and I think as one of the sequences put it the art of winning and I want
to know why aren't more rationalists trying to use the skills that we've cultivated to actively
becoming a force to be reckoned with? Well first off well done you didn't know there'd be a pop quiz
and two yeah I think there's a lot to dive into there like I'm sure you have more thoughts on that
but I guess I could either start with questions or you can keep going what do you prefer? Why don't
you ask me questions because I would rather engage that way? Sure so my first thought was that like
my life's been improved a bit and it's you know it's hard to point like a cause and yet I feel
like I've become a clearer thinker and more like explicitly goal-oriented person since learning
more of this rationality business and it's allowed me to like actually focus on what do I want my
goals to be and how do I actually get there like those aren't questions I think many people
articulate to themselves and actually spend time deliberating on and I did and you know here I'm
a three years later and I'm much happier than I was and then so like you know I think there's
some anecdotal evidence that my life's a bit better but like yeah why haven't I taken over the
world so that sort of leads into my my open-ended question like what would the world look like
if more rationalists were forces we reckoned with what would you expect to see that's different?
What I would imagine is that people would be clamoring to figure out what rationality is
that's what a world where rationalists win looks like it's a world where being rational
is so obviously the better choice that even people who have no interest in the subjects that got a
lot of us interested in it like game theory, Harry Potter fan fictions, mathematics people
like we keep talking about raising the sanity waterline the people that need that the most
and who could benefit from that the most are not the people who are going to be convinced by the
same things that a majority of this community is convinced by but if you are if we were winning
in the truest sense and everyone knew like hey if you start doing that rationality stuff
things only go up for you then everyone would want to do it and that would do more to raise
the sanity waterline than any individual act of propaganda slash campaigning that's interesting
like the product of like the enlightenment mindset you know scientists saying no the world
is understandable and let's figure it out that seems to me like a very clear and awesome thing
you know the scientists are the ones who actually understand the universe and yet there aren't a
lot of people clamoring to be scientists I feel like there might be a similar bypass of rationality
in that it takes the kind of people who are already like wanting to ask themselves the question of
how can I be the best rather than just like how do I pay my bills or how do I you know make my
peers not hate me um so I mean is there am I going down the wrong line there or is there any
do you think you're definitely I think you're definitely in the right vein like a good example
of that is while I have done sales for the last 10 years I'm back in school to try to get a degree
in integrated sciences and one of my role models was actually Richard Feynman specifically
because he wasn't just a scientist the dude played the bongos and was really good at like was a
accomplished musician and on top that he used to date models like I think he did more to make
scientists look cool than almost anything else and that's not something we often want to talk about
because we don't want to pretend we want to pretend we are not influenced by that and that other
people are not but being cool is a way of signaling that not only do you have valuable
skills but you have the social understanding to leverage them hmm I can see that yeah Feynman
also famously hung out at strip clubs and did like he brought his physics books there and stuff
Guy knew I had fun yeah like I think that there's nothing wrong with that but to many
rationalists maybe I'm wrong you would probably know better from interacting with more of them
but from what I've seen online people tend to view that as manipulative in some way whereas I
approach it from this Ben Franklin quote it is better to be seen doing good and being good
than just to be good I may have butchered that a bit no I if whether or not that's a good quote I
think the spirit still goes through and I mean you know I think there's a lot of ways to interpret
that you know part of it could be you know the social esteem that comes with being a good person
is also important and shouldn't be forgotten so like you know make your charitable donations
public or something instead of just doing it anonymously is maybe the kind of thing he's getting
at another thing might be you know if you're cool and good and people see that then they're like
how can I be more like that is that more where you're getting oh yeah like I don't know if you
listen to a lot of history podcasts but I browse a bunch of them and recently a bunch of them have
been focusing on the Roman gladiatorial games and one of the interesting effects is they had a
backlash where they may have actually encouraged more people to become Christians because like
you're a Roman and you decide to go to the games and oh there's like 50 Christians that are going
to be crucified and or eaten by lions today but unlike all the other slaves they're like I'm happy
to be a martyr and that sounds weird but you look at them and you're like well they have to be doing
something right if they could face such a terrible situation with such grace like what do they have
that I do not yeah I could think of like another like more sinister interpretation of that it's
just like what do I have that they don't that lets me actually be scared of being killed by lions
like why are they so dumb could be the opposite side of that coin right um but like so that I mean
definitely but when the some of them are your neighbors when they're people you've worked
with in the past who have been reasonable and functional human beings in every other aspect
of their life you begin to question no yeah you're right I was being somewhat tongue-in-cheek
just trying to entertain opposite or alternate hypotheses but um hey I mean here's the thing
you might be right people can be domain stupid well and I think you know some of the behavior is
probably there you know like the ignorance is bliss kind of trope you know if you or you know
like it'd be really easy to be super relaxed and carefree if you if you were in the middle of a
nuclear crisis if you thought like hey if we all die wrong you rush it off we're all going to be
ushered off to nirvana anyway so like this is just great news to me um but I wouldn't want that to
be like that's not the kind of mindset I want to be in um you know I don't want to be the kind of guy
who's trying to stop on again so that we don't all die but I think I'm ruining the point over
you're coming from and I think your point is salvageable aside from my annoying nitpickings
so like um not at all I find it enlightening well I I think
I'm trying to tie this back to like what rationalist uh
big players would be doing differently or what the abyss person would be doing differently
like I guess okay so I have a few small suggestions for what rationalists who may not
be huge in the community but want to help it along so the very first thing is talk about it
people can't know what you're doing right if you don't tell them so one of the things I try to do is
I have a lot of interactions with humans both at school like I said and as a realtor finding work
and dealing with clients and other realtors in my work and whenever they ask me like hey
you seem like you're really put together or that was a really good idea I always make it a point to
say yeah I've read these things called the sequences it's a really good website called less wrong
it's almost like getting a superpower that's the way I try to sell it and it sounds like a bit much
but the way I think rationality manifests is the more you know about it the fewer mistakes you make
which isn't sexy when you think about it it means like it's there's very few times you can
point to something and say oh yeah that was because of rationality but think about playing a video game
in easy mode there's just less obstacles yeah I think I mean part of me is stuck up on I guess
one thing that I don't have any openings to pitch it that way because no one ever says that was a
really cool idea Steve and he seemed well put together so I don't have that I don't have that
opening but I'm actually getting there is half of that is wearing suits half of that is wearing suits
well as a developer I think I'd stand out about worst suits but we'll see
but no I mean I've managed to plug it you know I'm getting more confident the last couple years and
I think you know part of what keeps some people from being super forward with it you know aside
from like being in a community that would not foster you know that kind of thinking or something
which is like more generically like you know telling your co-workers about this stuff that
you like is just you know if they think it's weird then oh no you're weird but I've sort of moved to
put in my life where I don't really care if people think that so you know like there was an example
at work a couple weeks ago where I've got a team with two other people on it right now and one of
the guys was I don't know if anyone listening has heard of that stupid debate out there is like is
water wet um and people oh my god that makes me so angry it's kind of annoying and tiresome
but I you know I'd heard of this and then this guy brought it up at work and I was like you know
if people are arguing about this question you could just not use the word wet and approach the
question again and you know you would probably not be confused by the two minute conversation
and he's like what do you mean and I'm like well think about it like what do you anticipate
happening differently if water was wet or not wet nothing then what's the point of the question
like if you're asking you know if we're just you know deliberating what the definition of
wet is then who cares like you can argue about dictionary words and you know just just turned
blue in the face complaining about the application to specific domains or not like
but really just think about like what what how did that belief actually make itself worthwhile
you know what changes if you believe it's wet versus it's not and if that belief doesn't do
anything then who cares and I don't know how convinced he was think he said something about
you know getting off my Socratic high horse or something but the the other guy seemed kind of
interested so I slacked out to both of them the article uh making your beliefs pay rent
which is that that whole mindset of you know if your belief isn't doing anything for you in the
the domain of of expected experimental results then in what sense is it a real belief anyway
like if nothing changes whether or not it's true or false then it's not you know
what's the belief even doing and if it's not doing anything kick it out
um and so I might have landed there I also got a co-worker hooked on methods of rationality so
we'll see where he is in two weeks um uh but yeah I think talking about it is definitely
one thing that many people could do more of and I'm certainly doing a bit more of um
and you know I think I don't know do we expect and maybe we can either talk more on that or
I can jump into the next question which like is this the kind of thing that you would advocate
for everybody or just like the big players who like want to make a difference and you know like
there's there's one thing to like just you know using it quietly for yourself you know like uh I
was into like skepticism before I was into rationality I didn't really talk about that with
people other than like the fact that I didn't buy homeopathic pills and you know if it came up I
had something to say on you know alternative medicine or ghosts or something um but like
it was less of a um
it I don't know on one angle skepticism is more of a negative perspective like you know shooting
down a bunch of bullshit which is important you know that way you're not wasting all your time and
money um but it there's it takes like an additional step and people like probably didn't probably
disagree with me and I'm probably not being charitable to the skeptics but like it takes it
takes an additional step on top of just debunking to actually like make something useful of that
and you know how do I best focus my efforts because I think it's more the most domain of
rationality on a slight tangential point about the skepticism community I think the thing that they
do incorrectly as far as PR goes is I saw a debate with Tyson Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye against
two creationists and they brought up a difference between cynicism and skepticism
cynicism says there's no ghost skepticism says there's probably not a ghost but if you could
bring me a ghost I'd be so excited yeah I can see the distinction and I think that's important too
often I think people like Dawkins and Sam Harris come off as cynics when if you read their other
works about the way that science fulfills them you would see them more as skeptics and that's why
their fan base sees them one way but everyone outside of it sees it differently I think Dawkins
is really an example of that especially like I think I mentioned before that my first book of his
was the god delusion which I thought was really well written I read it when I was like 16 or 17
or whatever it was somewhat new and uh you know it was fun and challenging it was my first like
real atheist book um but the the tone overall is like negative you know he's like I'm sick of
talking about this the shit's been slowing science down for you know ever and I thought this would
be done with like 30 years ago but here we are still talking about whether or not you know humans
have a common ancestor with chimps and it's 20 whatever year the book came out um but then his
book uh Unweaving the Rainbow is the exact opposite um it's you know if if the god delusion is about
what bugs him Unweaving the Rainbow is about what gets him out of bed in the morning and it's the
wonder and enchantment of science the idea that through comprehending the universe becomes way
more beautiful and way more interesting more interesting than than just sitting around and
imagining how it could be ever than anything you could possibly imagine like the way the universe
actually is is exhilarating and fun um and that's you know I think maybe Dawkins is more popular
for the god delusion than Unweaving the Rainbow and see you're right like people from the outside
seem as this come out during the old uh let's not even get into Dawkins twitter uh reputation um
but uh hey I like Naseem Talib and I don't agree with everything Jordan Peterson does but I like
a lot of it and honestly both of them are kind of insane on twitter so I just don't engage with that
medium anymore I think something about the format makes smart people stupid I think so too I tried
Twitter for like a summer and I got into some debate with a guy about like uh he was I'm assuming
some sort of men's rights activist or something and he was talking about like what a big deal male
circumcision was and I think we were talking like he changed the topic from female genital mutilation
and I was like yeah that's not cool you know it's less cool like getting the whole thing
fucked up right um you know I use the analogy of like you know getting the pinkie cut off versus
getting your left hand cut off you know if if we're yes both are bad and we shouldn't do either but
if we're focusing our efforts on one problem it's you know one's clearly a bigger deal um
but you know with 100 now it's 280 but back then it was 140 characters you can't make a nuance the
point and you can't be perceived to be making one so it's just like people shouting at each other
it has like the same kind of bullshit as like a facebook comment but like more anonymity and
distance so like uh I don't think yeah I agree it's not the best platform to learn anything
nuanced on it's a good platform for like what are the celebrities I'm doing up to where are they
