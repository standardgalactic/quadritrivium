let's say you can only get 15% of the stuff that Tim Ferriss suggests that you can do
if I got a 15% efficiency improvement in anything that's like mechanical I'd probably be hired
immediately as like a lead engineer on whatever project that is for the rest of my life like
if I could design an engine that was 15% more efficient I might win a Nobel Prize well that's
different than being a 15% more efficient person right which which way is this yeah being a 15%
more efficient person is way more valuable I see yeah because if one of those that if one of the
things you become more efficient in is learning how to become efficient the returns are not just
multiplicative they're exponential over time and they're small compared to each day before and each
day after it but from an outside perspective it can be pretty staggering yeah that's interesting
by the way I'm not affiliated with Tim Ferriss in any way I will say that his book the 4 hour work
week is one of the things that motivated me to become a realtor because it gives me a very good way
of looking at how time factors into wealth so it's been very good to me personally but
results may vary yeah I think I mean that's that should be the grain of salt with any piece of
advice right you know everyone circumstances are a little different and one should be cautious of
giving and receiving advice but I you know again having not read the book I'm just going to assume
that it's about as generic as possible and it's it's approachable that way so I mean
you know it's obviously popular not because it targets you know a very small demographic of
people because it's approachable yeah all right you've motivated me to read that book I will have
read it soon it sounds really cool it's pretty easy read and yeah it's a short book yeah and it's
like 10 years old at this point so a lot of these specific tips and tricks aren't great but here's a
good one that's immediately paid dividends in my life most people are addicted especially at work
to checking their emails and their communications but we all know the data says that every time you
shift your focus you have to spend some mental energy like refocusing on the original subject
so just batch your emails I only answer emails twice a day immediately made my life much easier
reduce stress levels and that was one of the most simple suggestions I've ever gotten yeah I think
yeah that sounds like a low effort input with a with a good dividend at the end I
I need to read this book you know like I know I'm aware of tools that like like
lock your browser for certain times the day however long you want from like visiting Facebook
or Twitter or something like I don't know I can't think of the names but something like don't distract
me or something and that way you have to specifically go in and disable it if you want to like allow
yourself to indulge your your desire to go on Facebook or something and that additional step
keeps people kind of in check you know it's just little things that you can do to to enhance your
productivity and then boom suddenly more productive and you're getting done with work faster because
you're wasting less time reengaging man if it's that easy we are missing out that's sort of
maybe other rationalists I've read more stuff than I have in fact that's definitely true in many cases
but it's not about the reading though that's like kind of the thing like I believe a lot of people
have read this it's a community I believe is probably tangential but overlapping also it's
that I wonder how many low-hanging fruit as you've put it are there for the taking that even I haven't
noticed and why we as a community don't actively try to like foster more of that like if we had a
Wikipedia for like hey if you've decided that you want to run a triathlon well we as rationalists
have decided to look at all of the data like the ones of us who are health focused decided on their
own to build a repository of health data and give you like both the most practical advice that they
know that works and a good amount of the research and I'm sure that's only as few people in the
community we only need like five or six people who are experts in a field to at least get you a good
start yeah that's interesting you know like a handful of small things like that have come up but
you know like one for example was meta med which was around for a few years and it was basically
I don't think it ever really took off I think they ended up being like losing funding and
shutting down before they were able to like lower the cost entry but it was like you would pay I don't
know three or four or five thousand dollars and this handful of medical trained people whether
or not they were doctors or not I can't remember and you send out you send forward like your medical
info and your problem and you know if you have a problem that's difficult to diagnose or something
and third their thing was like all right we're going to compile all this we're basically going to
go house on this house the doctor show and we're going to figure out what's going on
and I thought that was kind of cool I think I heard about that you've Kowski mentioned that
he tried it out to figure out like how to treat his sleep disorder if you've read Mrs.
of rationality Harry has that like 26 hour sleep cycle you'd Kowski apparently has like a 24.25
hour sleep cycle which so every it's like it's an extra 15 minutes yeah which doesn't sound too bad
except for you think like all right two weeks later and suddenly you know you're you're off by
half a day so um this you know this was why like a lot of less wrong posts are at like 3 a.m.
so it suddenly it all makes sense yes this is you know tired guy at the computer no but uh
the I think I think the answer was uh like Madaffin ill before bed and then like long release
Madaffin ill as well so like you're getting hit with it throughout the night which sounds super
obvious um you know what this is a book that I should have read before we talked about this uh
you guys can just came up with a book on this subject um the one like why aren't we hitting
more of these like easy to hit points um inadequate equilibria uh is this new oh I haven't read it
either it's on my Kindle yeah you're right we both should have read it shame on both of us
we'll read it and get back to it but I have read the first chapter and he talks about how his wife
has uh severe seasonal affective disorder and the like sun lamps weren't really helping and they
were you know considering rather extreme measures of treating this by like you know moving to South
America for the summer for the winters um but you know he's thinking like look the sun
cures her seasonal affective disorder that's why she doesn't have it in the summer
so you know this is clearly just like a light problem why don't we just got six hundred dollars
with the light bulbs and strung them up in the apartment and it's bright as the summer in here
and it seems to have you know that small investment seems to have paid off really well like she's
apparently doing better um and his thing was like so why wasn't this obvious answer in the
medical literature yet and if it wasn't in there yet should I just conclude before trying that
someone's looking to this and dismissed it or it doesn't work so and I haven't read the rest of the
books I'm not sure what the general advice actually is on how to approach problems but like there are
going to be cases where like you look for an answer there's not one out there or you rather
you think of an answer you go to check and see if there's anything to it and there's no data on it
and so do you think okay well I'm either on to something that the medical community has never
thought of before or oh you know I guess it must not mean anything so when when do you actually
spend the time to invest in your your idea rather than letting the lack of data out there um stop
you uh I don't have the answer I think it's more of an investment thing like if it only
like if for something as big as what you'd kowski saying my limit would be a thousand bucks
I know that sounds really crass to say but if I can't make any real progress within a thousand
dollars or and like a few weeks of thinking really hard I probably won't be making any progress
but like that's still an amount of work and time and a normal person can do like that's the way I
think about it if it's really important you should be willing to invest more time and money
into figuring out yourself but even if it's not that important if you can find out or disprove it
yourself a lot of times with less than a hundred bucks that doesn't cost you much time or energy
I know right uh I mean my my couple examples for my life are much smaller but there's been a couple
times where you know I'm 15 20 bucks away from a rather large improvement um I had a couple examples
and the only one that I can think of is really stupid and pointless but when I first got an
xbox 360 and I switched up from like the gamecube and then before that like n64 and it had like the
red white and yellow uh cords plugged into the tv and the xbox 360 had five and I was like oh so
that's the hd and that's why it looks so good um but I didn't know until I had this thing for like
two or three years was that uh I'm a $15 hdmi cable away from getting wheel hd and I'm like I I mean
I missed I missed out on uh you know again the opportunity to like play Skyrim and higher resolution
or something pointless but just the idea that like I didn't know that there was a problem there that I
could solve so easily and so I think part of the challenge is like figuring out what actually is a
problem that you can address uh not just like all right here's my problem now let's go for it but like
asking myself the right noticing that there's like noticing that there's a problem or
inefficiency there at all yeah like I mean you know I bought a lot of old crappy cars in my life
and the first thing I do with them now is uh get a new distributor cap and spark plug cables and
spark plugs and it runs a lot better and that's like a total of like $60 worth of parts and
you know maybe half an hour worth of work and uh it's it's such a low investment the car runs
like it's 10 years younger um you know I I sort of have like this it's not really a petrifying
fear it's more just like this nagging concern that I'm gonna look back in like a year and be like
oh man here's only $20 that you could have spent to make your life a lot better and so I'm wondering
you know this is I guess not quite related or this is related but not the same thing I guess how
to identify those things that is a lot harder um well because mostly you don't know what you don't
know right yeah and those are by definition black swan events like that that's what nesim talib's
book the black swan is about events that are not only things you didn't predict but could not have
predicted and the best answer he's able to come up with after three books is you develop anti-fragile
strategies because you know that given enough time more of these black swan events and issues will
come up so you just make all your plans based around a world where you know these things are
going to happen and surprise you so you're optimally in like a perfect way of implementing it
you would develop your life such that almost every surprise good or bad made your life better
but couldn't make your life too much worse can you give an example I haven't read his books
so I'm going to be tooting my own horn here a little bit but uh on your last episode I commented
on the reddit because you guys talked about cryptocurrencies and I'm a little bit more negative
than Scott Alexander I would have given the rationality community a d or maybe even an f
because I believe that the rationality community was smart enough to immediately see the value of
blockchains and cryptocurrencies even if they didn't know bitcoin in particular was going to be the
big hit they were smart enough to realize this was a revolutionary set of ideas and if they really
believed that they should have made their beliefs pay rent and gone out and bought 20 dollars of each
cryptocurrency when they first started and you would have known that you would have lost money
on most of those cryptocurrencies because like the example he gives in his book is if you were
a person in 1999 and you had a thousand dollars and you did some research and you're like you
know what the next big thing on the internet is going to be search engines we need to figure out
how to look through all this stuff you don't know which company to bet on right there's a well
there's altavista what are some other ones I kind of forget ask jeeps yeah you don't know which one
of those is going to succeed but you know probably one of them is going to make it big so you put in
100 bucks into the 10 that you feel are most likely to succeed when they're first starting out
you're throwing seeds essentially into the ground and seeing where it ends up being fertile now
100 bucks so a thousand bucks total is like a chunk of change that's serious but in any one
company a hundred dollars win or lose that's like you know it hurts and if you can't afford it don't
do it but for most people it's not going to kill you so you know that you're probably going to lose
most of it we only need one of them to be a disproportionate success not only to make up
all your money but to get 10x returns yeah and so you know it's it's I'm sorry but it's your your
thing oh I was gonna say that the remainder of that post was pretty much saying that I'm giving
myself a c-minus because while I do have two and a half bitcoins and I am still sitting on them
but uh while I still have them I didn't really do what I said either like I should have gone
through the effort of buying litecoin and even dogecoin and all the other ones but I did not
do that because it was too much of a hassle at the time so I really just got lucky I didn't I wasn't
actually rational there or antifragile I was just lucky in in the right place I did read your uh
your comment on the subreddit but I didn't reply eggs I don't know a lot about uh cryptocurrencies
and I felt like more it was something that you know I should have come to handle but then I also
knew you and I'd be talking so um I didn't read your your comment though I think you know my uh my
takeaways you know part of it like I was able to give myself a pass and that I didn't care about
bitcoin until like I don't know maybe five years ago um and I could have gotten in then but I guess
I was super broke back then so it doesn't you know that's my other like way to wave it off
but just like in general um it's the kind of thing that and you know in the reaction
those community too there were people uh and like we talked about on the that episode uh
Gvern on the in the like the comments and posts and less wrong was saying guys think
this is going to take off it's going to be awesome we should all look into this and then
lo and behold it did explode and uh I think that the machine intelligence research institute got
some huge amount of funding because uh some percentage of early adopters of bitcoin were
less wrongers and they uh some of them scored big and it's like that is reassuring yeah and so I
think uh Miri's funded pretty heavily from that which is kind of cool um and I just went out today
with a friend uh who I'm not sure how much he made but he didn't like his job he was working
for Solar City selling solar panels um and I've heard that working for an Elon Musk company is
kind of like challenging because I think that his mindset is that like everyone finds work
as easy as he does um but he I'm going to put in 80 hours because I'm Elon Musk and I don't run on
human food yeah for him it's just like hey if I work 80 hours I can get done twice as fast as my
competitors not like where am I going to find the energy energy to work for 80 hours a week um
but anyway so this friend he made a he made a I'm not sure how much he made but he made enough to
quit his job and he liquidated some of his crypto and he says he's good for at least six months
and he's talking about stuff you know in the uh in the market so like he actually did capitalize
he walked the walk and it paid off yeah I I find it interesting like Ali Eiser's reply to that was
basically there are you know we can't invest in everything that has a one percent chance of working
um ah that's where I disagree you totally can because if you only invest like a small amount
each of them if it's purported gain is over like x1000 then it's worth it like yeah put in a dollar
and every one percent chance if there's a chance that you're going to get a thousand or ten thousand
dollars back yeah I mean I think with the case of crypto that certainly lines up but like other
opportunities you know the entry cost is often more than than more than a dollar you know if you
buy in for whatever fraction of a coin you want but you can't say like attend a class or move cities
or something I guess moving is probably a bigger deal but like you know there are other small things
that you can do that might pay off really big I mean fucking buying scratch off tickets I think
one in three at least gives you your money back and one in five I think gives you back double your
money um those numbers numbers might be slightly off but I don't think one in a hundred gives you
a thousand dollars but maybe one in 500 um so I guess I guess those odds are lower and crypto
had reasons to work that weren't pure chance okay so did you ever see the Julia Gala video where
she goes through like a visual explanation of Bayes theorem you know I just found that last
night I meddled it to somebody um the only one I had seen was like her one where she talks about it
I haven't seen the visual representation one yet or if I have I don't remember it uh she breaks down
the math to this really good multiplication of what are like how likely she uses the example of
like you see a person who's shy what's the likelihood he's a math PhD versus like a business student
so you're like okay math PhDs are 10 times more likely to be shy so it's 10 to one but there's
like a hundred business students for every one math PhD and you just multiply down
so I would think of it in a similar way if your goal when playing the Lotto is to win it big like
when I don't know 13 million or whatever the big prize is but so that's your possible reward
but your odds of winning are one in 45 million you should only invest 50 cents right you should
never invest yeah yeah so then it's just not worth it for you yeah and like I said too I think uh
there are people making noises that like crypto was going to be a bigger deal and no one can make
those same sounds about uh the lottery right no one's saying this is the best use of your money
at least no one worth listening to no one who doesn't work for the lottery yeah and that's why uh
I in general and the same talent tend to recommend uh I talk about us like we know each other that's
not true at all but um you guys are challenges that's why I yeah that's why I agree with him
