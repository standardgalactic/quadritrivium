Welcome to the Bayesian Conspiracy, I'm Stephen Zuber and Inyasha is busy this week so joining
me is our special guest. I'm David Youssef, you may have seen some of my posts as Bayesian
confused on the subreddit. Well thanks for coming on David, yeah you came to the last
local meetup and it was really cool meeting you and I'm glad you were in town for it and
you seemed super fucking cool and I wanted to chat with you so here we are. I was really
glad I could come on, I've been loosely reading the community of rationality stuff for about
seven years now and besides a close friend of mine who got me into it here in Lancaster,
I had literally never met anyone else about these subjects so I couldn't lose the opportunity.
Yeah I don't remember how I guess you know the way we've I found people in real life with this was
the HPMOR wrap-up party for when methods of rationality concluded there were those like
meetups everywhere for people who wanted to hang out with people on the day the last chapter was
released and there was a somewhat large meeting here because you know Enoch was local and he did
the audiobook podcast and I was like this is a lot of fucking fun who wants to do this again
and most people have been coming back ever since so I don't even think about people here and there
and that sort of thing so I mean that's how I found you guys I was listening to the podcast but
I think I read it when Yudkowsky was like originally writing it and then I stopped for three years
because he did yeah right and then I only picked it up about a year after he finished.
Nice well you got to save yourself that that terrible crawl for the last few years where he
kind of held us all by the suspense. One of the things that I've always wanted to discuss with at
least a few other people more involved in the community than me are what I consider to be
big flaws in instrumental rationality. All right that sounds like fun. So first off what's what's
instrumental rationality? Well as I am aware of it there are pretty much two different ways of
approaching rationality which is epistemological which I guess you could call more like theoretical
truth seeking and being rational about how you look at data which is good and important and
very interesting and things that we should all cultivate in ourselves but instrumental rationality
is about doing what works and I think as one of the sequences put it the art of winning and I want
to know why aren't more rationalists trying to use the skills that we've cultivated to actively
becoming a force to be reckoned with? Well first off well done you didn't know there'd be a pop quiz
and two yeah I think there's a lot to dive into there like I'm sure you have more thoughts on that
but I guess I could either start with questions or you can keep going what do you prefer? Why don't
you ask me questions because I would rather engage that way? Sure so my first thought was that like
my life's been improved a bit and it's you know it's hard to point like a cause and yet I feel
like I've become a clearer thinker and more like explicitly goal-oriented person since learning
more of this rationality business and it's allowed me to like actually focus on what do I want my
goals to be and how do I actually get there like those aren't questions I think many people
articulate to themselves and actually spend time deliberating on and I did and you know here I'm
a three years later and I'm much happier than I was and then so like you know I think there's
some anecdotal evidence that my life's a bit better but like yeah why haven't I taken over the
world so that sort of leads into my my open-ended question like what would the world look like
if more rationalists were forces we reckoned with what would you expect to see that's different?
What I would imagine is that people would be clamoring to figure out what rationality is
that's what a world where rationalists win looks like it's a world where being rational
is so obviously the better choice that even people who have no interest in the subjects that got a
lot of us interested in it like game theory, Harry Potter fan fictions, mathematics people
like we keep talking about raising the sanity waterline the people that need that the most
and who could benefit from that the most are not the people who are going to be convinced by the
same things that a majority of this community is convinced by but if you are if we were winning
in the truest sense and everyone knew like hey if you start doing that rationality stuff
things only go up for you then everyone would want to do it and that would do more to raise
the sanity waterline than any individual act of propaganda slash campaigning that's interesting
like the product of like the enlightenment mindset you know scientists saying no the world
is understandable and let's figure it out that seems to me like a very clear and awesome thing
you know the scientists are the ones who actually understand the universe and yet there aren't a
lot of people clamoring to be scientists I feel like there might be a similar bypass of rationality
in that it takes the kind of people who are already like wanting to ask themselves the question of
how can I be the best rather than just like how do I pay my bills or how do I you know make my
peers not hate me um so I mean is there am I going down the wrong line there or is there any
do you think you're definitely I think you're definitely in the right vein like a good example
of that is while I have done sales for the last 10 years I'm back in school to try to get a degree
in integrated sciences and one of my role models was actually Richard Feynman specifically
because he wasn't just a scientist the dude played the bongos and was really good at like was a
accomplished musician and on top that he used to date models like I think he did more to make
scientists look cool than almost anything else and that's not something we often want to talk about
because we don't want to pretend we want to pretend we are not influenced by that and that other
people are not but being cool is a way of signaling that not only do you have valuable
skills but you have the social understanding to leverage them hmm I can see that yeah Feynman
also famously hung out at strip clubs and did like he brought his physics books there and stuff
Guy knew I had fun yeah like I think that there's nothing wrong with that but to many
rationalists maybe I'm wrong you would probably know better from interacting with more of them
but from what I've seen online people tend to view that as manipulative in some way whereas I
approach it from this Ben Franklin quote it is better to be seen doing good and being good
than just to be good I may have butchered that a bit no I if whether or not that's a good quote I
think the spirit still goes through and I mean you know I think there's a lot of ways to interpret
that you know part of it could be you know the social esteem that comes with being a good person
is also important and shouldn't be forgotten so like you know make your charitable donations
public or something instead of just doing it anonymously is maybe the kind of thing he's getting
at another thing might be you know if you're cool and good and people see that then they're like
how can I be more like that is that more where you're getting oh yeah like I don't know if you
listen to a lot of history podcasts but I browse a bunch of them and recently a bunch of them have
been focusing on the Roman gladiatorial games and one of the interesting effects is they had a
backlash where they may have actually encouraged more people to become Christians because like
you're a Roman and you decide to go to the games and oh there's like 50 Christians that are going
to be crucified and or eaten by lions today but unlike all the other slaves they're like I'm happy
to be a martyr and that sounds weird but you look at them and you're like well they have to be doing
something right if they could face such a terrible situation with such grace like what do they have
that I do not yeah I could think of like another like more sinister interpretation of that it's
just like what do I have that they don't that lets me actually be scared of being killed by lions
like why are they so dumb could be the opposite side of that coin right um but like so that I mean
definitely but when the some of them are your neighbors when they're people you've worked
with in the past who have been reasonable and functional human beings in every other aspect
of their life you begin to question no yeah you're right I was being somewhat tongue-in-cheek
just trying to entertain opposite or alternate hypotheses but um hey I mean here's the thing
you might be right people can be domain stupid well and I think you know some of the behavior is
probably there you know like the ignorance is bliss kind of trope you know if you or you know
like it'd be really easy to be super relaxed and carefree if you if you were in the middle of a
nuclear crisis if you thought like hey if we all die wrong you rush it off we're all going to be
ushered off to nirvana anyway so like this is just great news to me um but I wouldn't want that to
be like that's not the kind of mindset I want to be in um you know I don't want to be the kind of guy
who's trying to stop on again so that we don't all die but I think I'm ruining the point over
you're coming from and I think your point is salvageable aside from my annoying nitpickings
so like um not at all I find it enlightening well I I think
I'm trying to tie this back to like what rationalist uh
big players would be doing differently or what the abyss person would be doing differently
like I guess okay so I have a few small suggestions for what rationalists who may not
be huge in the community but want to help it along so the very first thing is talk about it
people can't know what you're doing right if you don't tell them so one of the things I try to do is
I have a lot of interactions with humans both at school like I said and as a realtor finding work
and dealing with clients and other realtors in my work and whenever they ask me like hey
you seem like you're really put together or that was a really good idea I always make it a point to
say yeah I've read these things called the sequences it's a really good website called less wrong
it's almost like getting a superpower that's the way I try to sell it and it sounds like a bit much
but the way I think rationality manifests is the more you know about it the fewer mistakes you make
which isn't sexy when you think about it it means like it's there's very few times you can
point to something and say oh yeah that was because of rationality but think about playing a video game
in easy mode there's just less obstacles yeah I think I mean part of me is stuck up on I guess
one thing that I don't have any openings to pitch it that way because no one ever says that was a
really cool idea Steve and he seemed well put together so I don't have that I don't have that
opening but I'm actually getting there is half of that is wearing suits half of that is wearing suits
well as a developer I think I'd stand out about worst suits but we'll see
but no I mean I've managed to plug it you know I'm getting more confident the last couple years and
I think you know part of what keeps some people from being super forward with it you know aside
from like being in a community that would not foster you know that kind of thinking or something
which is like more generically like you know telling your co-workers about this stuff that
you like is just you know if they think it's weird then oh no you're weird but I've sort of moved to
put in my life where I don't really care if people think that so you know like there was an example
at work a couple weeks ago where I've got a team with two other people on it right now and one of
the guys was I don't know if anyone listening has heard of that stupid debate out there is like is
water wet um and people oh my god that makes me so angry it's kind of annoying and tiresome
but I you know I'd heard of this and then this guy brought it up at work and I was like you know
if people are arguing about this question you could just not use the word wet and approach the
question again and you know you would probably not be confused by the two minute conversation
and he's like what do you mean and I'm like well think about it like what do you anticipate
happening differently if water was wet or not wet nothing then what's the point of the question
like if you're asking you know if we're just you know deliberating what the definition of
wet is then who cares like you can argue about dictionary words and you know just just turned
blue in the face complaining about the application to specific domains or not like
but really just think about like what what how did that belief actually make itself worthwhile
you know what changes if you believe it's wet versus it's not and if that belief doesn't do
anything then who cares and I don't know how convinced he was think he said something about
you know getting off my Socratic high horse or something but the the other guy seemed kind of
interested so I slacked out to both of them the article uh making your beliefs pay rent
which is that that whole mindset of you know if your belief isn't doing anything for you in the
the domain of of expected experimental results then in what sense is it a real belief anyway
like if nothing changes whether or not it's true or false then it's not you know
what's the belief even doing and if it's not doing anything kick it out
um and so I might have landed there I also got a co-worker hooked on methods of rationality so
we'll see where he is in two weeks um uh but yeah I think talking about it is definitely
one thing that many people could do more of and I'm certainly doing a bit more of um
and you know I think I don't know do we expect and maybe we can either talk more on that or
I can jump into the next question which like is this the kind of thing that you would advocate
for everybody or just like the big players who like want to make a difference and you know like
there's there's one thing to like just you know using it quietly for yourself you know like uh I
was into like skepticism before I was into rationality I didn't really talk about that with
people other than like the fact that I didn't buy homeopathic pills and you know if it came up I
had something to say on you know alternative medicine or ghosts or something um but like
it was less of a um
it I don't know on one angle skepticism is more of a negative perspective like you know shooting
down a bunch of bullshit which is important you know that way you're not wasting all your time and
money um but it there's it takes like an additional step and people like probably didn't probably
disagree with me and I'm probably not being charitable to the skeptics but like it takes it
takes an additional step on top of just debunking to actually like make something useful of that
and you know how do I best focus my efforts because I think it's more the most domain of
rationality on a slight tangential point about the skepticism community I think the thing that they
do incorrectly as far as PR goes is I saw a debate with Tyson Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye against
two creationists and they brought up a difference between cynicism and skepticism
cynicism says there's no ghost skepticism says there's probably not a ghost but if you could
bring me a ghost I'd be so excited yeah I can see the distinction and I think that's important too
often I think people like Dawkins and Sam Harris come off as cynics when if you read their other
works about the way that science fulfills them you would see them more as skeptics and that's why
their fan base sees them one way but everyone outside of it sees it differently I think Dawkins
is really an example of that especially like I think I mentioned before that my first book of his
was the god delusion which I thought was really well written I read it when I was like 16 or 17
or whatever it was somewhat new and uh you know it was fun and challenging it was my first like
real atheist book um but the the tone overall is like negative you know he's like I'm sick of
talking about this the shit's been slowing science down for you know ever and I thought this would
be done with like 30 years ago but here we are still talking about whether or not you know humans
have a common ancestor with chimps and it's 20 whatever year the book came out um but then his
book uh Unweaving the Rainbow is the exact opposite um it's you know if if the god delusion is about
what bugs him Unweaving the Rainbow is about what gets him out of bed in the morning and it's the
wonder and enchantment of science the idea that through comprehending the universe becomes way
more beautiful and way more interesting more interesting than than just sitting around and
imagining how it could be ever than anything you could possibly imagine like the way the universe
actually is is exhilarating and fun um and that's you know I think maybe Dawkins is more popular
for the god delusion than Unweaving the Rainbow and see you're right like people from the outside
seem as this come out during the old uh let's not even get into Dawkins twitter uh reputation um
but uh hey I like Naseem Talib and I don't agree with everything Jordan Peterson does but I like
a lot of it and honestly both of them are kind of insane on twitter so I just don't engage with that
medium anymore I think something about the format makes smart people stupid I think so too I tried
Twitter for like a summer and I got into some debate with a guy about like uh he was I'm assuming
some sort of men's rights activist or something and he was talking about like what a big deal male
circumcision was and I think we were talking like he changed the topic from female genital mutilation
and I was like yeah that's not cool you know it's less cool like getting the whole thing
fucked up right um you know I use the analogy of like you know getting the pinkie cut off versus
getting your left hand cut off you know if if we're yes both are bad and we shouldn't do either but
if we're focusing our efforts on one problem it's you know one's clearly a bigger deal um
but you know with 100 now it's 280 but back then it was 140 characters you can't make a nuance the
point and you can't be perceived to be making one so it's just like people shouting at each other
it has like the same kind of bullshit as like a facebook comment but like more anonymity and
distance so like uh I don't think yeah I agree it's not the best platform to learn anything
nuanced on it's a good platform for like what are the celebrities I'm doing up to where are they
touring you know if I'm at a conference you can follow those hashtags or something but um sorry I'm
getting sidetracked where were we um curmudgeony science versus cynicism skepticism um yeah I think
oh I do remember you were asking if we should if I'm advocating these things for the more
prominent people in the community or for the average person and honestly I am advocating
as for the average person because the people who are already popular in the community have a kind
of social momentum going for them at this point and it's that's something I've actually like studied
how to generate pretty thoroughly but we can talk about that a little later but I think it's more
important on the lower level I don't want to say lower but on the more grassroots level
what's more important specifically just having like your average joe being your average jane
being more active and uh talking about and seeming awesome for doing this sort of stuff
yeah yeah but like here's a question I've been considering for the last like 48 hours or so
Robin Hansen worked on prediction markets correct yeah and have you read the books
super forecasting I've not but I'm familiar with it but for those of us who aren't go ahead and
summarize it uh pretty much I feel terrible now I cannot remember the author's name but he was
using prediction markets with essentially pseudo money to make people capable of making
predictions on everything from arctic ice melting to stocks to national takeovers
and what he discovered is most people I think it's like 60% or about as good as a monkey throwing
darts at a dartboard with fake money or real money I mean I believe there was some tie-in like they
had some kind of point system so people felt invested okay and about I think it was
I think it was 35% were pretty good they were like better than average like 70%
but there was like 5% of people who were super predictors and if having a working theory of
the world is having theories and philosophies that pay out rent as we were talking about like beliefs
that do help you predict the future then being a super predictor or having access to one gives
you the more accurate map like by default you are more rational because you have a better working
map than someone who has all the same skills as you but a less accurate map well they've discovered
that you can do some daily practices to help increase your predictiveness score I believe there
is like a cap so if you're truly terrible at it you can get better but the fact that you can improve
it at all should be something every rationalist should be interested in and if we all did that
and pulled our money which I'm sure there's a cryptocurrency that could allow why wouldn't
like why shouldn't rationalist start their own stock funds that actually use correct data that
everyone else seems to ignore because it's socially unconventional like we could just
start winning economically that's a good question I guess I don't have a good answer for that but
I can turn that around why aren't you doing that David my personal goal is I am working to mix
my real estate with robotics and permaculture to create like to become a land developer that makes
resilient anti-fragile systems and honestly I am human and this goal is as big as I am
capable of doing so I've invested most of my energy in this and otherwise trying to be a sane person
mild success at both well for I mean it's it's a it's a journey right it's on a quick step
and you know what you're right like I could if anyone out there has the information that could
help me get started or can point me in the right direction I'll do my best to try like
it's worth doing but it's just something I find weird because I don't think I'm that clever
and this community has a lot of very smart people in it like can you imagine a rationality
hedge fund that just would in a matter of time using prediction markets and enforce contracts
not only be ethical but automatic and make huge dividends maybe not huge but pretty good ones
that's a really good idea uh yeah I haven't thought about that before uh you're convincing me
fairly quickly that there's low hanging fruit here that we haven't grabbed I guess that's not
particularly a little hanging but uh I that's a good way to put it like I think that there's a
lot of things that rationalists could do both individually they're low energy and that we
could do as a community because we have such a good and diverse skill set and if we're going to be
a little bit flatteringly honest a lot of us tend to be above average in more than one skill
like we could diffuse the work for a lot of very ambitious projects pretty easily like I'm
very astounded and it makes my heart glad when I see all the work the effective altruism community
is done yeah I agree and that's you know I don't that didn't really come explicitly out of the
rationality community but it's been highly adopted there and it's just one of those like hey here's
this norm that doesn't make any sense let's let's challenge the parts that we can like the taboo
against bragging um and say look among our community it'll be okay to like broadcast charitable
donations and where they're going and you know to make a public giving what you can pledge
or something um and then you know that way you know a real effective altruist if if they posted
on facebook and they're like yep here's the three places my donations went they'd be receptive to
feedback and be like you know what number two say like the pink ribbon breast cancer fund or whatever
you know that's kind of a waste of money if you're even like if your goal is you know reducing
incidences of breast cancer you don't want to give it to the I can't remember the the person behind
the pink ribbon campaign but you know what I'm talking about um I do I think it's like 95 cents
to the dollar 90 cents to the dollar goes towards more marketing for the pink ribbon and uh so it's
like even your own goal there of wanting to to stop breast cancer you're not even doing that
effectively um so uh just having an openness to that sort of you know because that's a pretty
intense criticism to give somebody like hey you know what you just wasted your charity your charity
money it's pretty hard thing for most people to stomach I think but the EA community has worked
to uh make it I think more acceptable to like discuss where charity money is going and which
ones are best in a way that doesn't make it seem like you're so pretentious philanthropist right
I think a big part of what they've done correctly is pull on the heart strings in the right way
where they're not trying to scam you out of your money and then like precisely the opposite
they're trying to prevent you from getting scammed in a way they almost act like a consumer
protection bureau but for NGOs and nonprofits and stuff yeah I like that and that is something that
people often don't want to admit that they need because it feels paternalistic but in a society
as complex as ours with all these moving pieces nobody can be an expert in everything you need
like someone to protect you from the worst human follies yeah I mean that's that's why I like the
you know give well organization that you know they do all the legwork for us and so if you're
if you're the kind of person who's ready to ask yourself okay I've got x amount of money to give
this year how do I do the most good with it well somebody's already done that homework for you
you don't have to go from the ground up and figure this out they apparently the two people who
started that I forget their names they had a really hard time getting initial data you know there was
like kickback from charities saying you're just trying to steal ours our our secrets to like sell
to our competitors or something which really weird mindset to take if you're like goal is you know
helping the world like what you want to help someone else help it better than we are but just
like there there weren't like statisticians on hands to you know give them numbers like you
know how many people are you saving with this like what how could you even ask that um so thankfully
you know since these aren't easy questions people just to call up an answer they've already done
some of the legwork for us if you uh you know just want to you know maximize your good from your
charity dollar and that works like I think this isn't something I think can be fixed per se but
maybe I can bring a little bit of awareness to it a lot of times I don't think this is even a
rashless thing I think this is a human thing when we notice someone has a belief that is in error
either it is epistemologically incorrect the sun does not rotate around the earth or it's practically
incorrect they should not have turned left now it's going to take you guys 15 minutes longer
and our first instinct when we see that I believe is often to point it out in a matter of fact way
but the same way that humans are really bad like have you ever heard if two people are punching
each other it just gets worse and worse over time because we're really bad at judging like
how much damage we are dealing in relation to ourselves because so every time you get punched
you'll just punch a little bit harder than you have to and the other person will feel it
words are the same way so you should soften everything you try to say that's a correction
by about 50 percent that's interesting and you mean like a conscious effort on top of like
I thought about this I'm doing this nicely to like stop yourself again and say how can I make
that even more palatable yeah like ask yourself how can I frame this or this person understand
that the only reason I'm even bothering to bring it up is because I want their life to be better
see partly that's why I just like hanging out with other nerdy people like me because
you know if I'm driving with a friend and I take the wrong turn they're gonna say you took the wrong
turn it's 15 minutes faster if you go this way and I'll be like great thanks for letting me know
rather than you know them having to say you know I know you're just doing your best and listen
that I can't I'm I think being untradable to your point but I'm thinking of
Robin Hansen was just on Sam Harris's podcast and he talked about
and I'm paraphrasing poorly something along the lines of like enforcing norms or having communities
that enforce the right kinds of norms so like you know we talked about the EA group before you know
if I go to like if my family was giving to charity and I pointed out how bad most of the
charitable donations were it would be received poorly because they're not effective altruists
but like having a community that has norms that like make you stronger and better is like one of the
most like reliably good moves you can do and I think that's why I like the little rationality
community in Denver was you know being challenged and proven wrong is like exciting and fun rather
than like feeling like you're being being beaten down and conceding a point you'd rather not concede
actually that's one thing I think the rationality community gets right
that is something I noticed a lot at the meetup which really encouraged me
just people being less attached to their beliefs like as part of like their personality or their
their personhood and yeah like being told you're wrong is almost never a bad thing to a rationalist
it's a thing that incites curiosity like can you please explain to me more and that gives a level
of mental resilience and it's confident like I don't I think rationalists should actually play
that part of their personality up because it shows such a level of confidence in who you are like I
can afford to be wrong about this it's not a big deal yeah I like that and I and you know not only
does it look good but like it also makes you just feel good you know if I if I'm doing something wrong
at work and someone shows me some faster better way to do something I'm like oh thanks for saving me
the time in trouble um if I'd known about that keyboard shortcut two weeks ago I probably would
have saved myself like 30 minutes by now every time that I go to the tab bar and or the task bar
and do it there or something right um and those are just little things where you know if you
point out hey you're doing this wrong to some people they'll take it poorly but uh if your
attitude about being wrong is different that like you're not I think that the other thing that I
I think I'd be willing to put out there that the rationality community is doing right I think it's
closely tied to this is making an explicit distinction between uh like you and your beliefs
you know your beliefs aren't you and if you're wrong about something it doesn't mean you're a
bad person like I don't think anyone really believes that but they act like they do and
you know I mean you can choose a politically charged topic and you know gun control or or drug
regulation or something um and they suddenly like you know if they're presented with challenging
evidence they get you know their heart rate goes up they get stressed they get they get upset they
get angry and uh that's not I think the right way to approach being wrong right um and it might not
even be being wrong they're just having a difficult conversation and the ability to calmly look at this
and say okay you know what I'm not wrong my belief might be wrong just just having that
different framing makes you much more open to being able to be receptive to that sort of stuff
I think that that is also a side effect of trying to integrate Bayesian reasoning which
is something we talked about when I was in Denver a little bit but I think trying to actively like
ask myself okay I just saw something that contradicts what I believe does this snowflake
of evidence move my belief meter one way or the other about this topic because it should even if
it's like 0.01% I should be willing to acknowledge it was at least that convincing
and that makes you humble because you can't really have a binary belief if you do that you
always have to keep the possibility that you're wrong in your head and then anytime you see
something that contradicts you it's not an attack it's just something that weighs slightly
more on the other side yeah and I think just like you know like you said just one of the
byproducts of that is that you know counterpiece of evidence isn't this you know hammer blow to
yourself it's just uh you know if your beliefs aren't binary and you can accept evidence and then
you know it's not just to accept evidence like okay cool that was that was interesting and then
just keep believing what you believed if enough evidence of enough counter evidence shows up
but to actually be able to switch and say okay cool I'm now leading this way
yeah I am not feeling very articulate I feel like I was onto something and I lost it so we
can we can keep going sorry we can move on if you want the thing I'm kind of contemplating now is
if I'm going to advocate this what are some practical suggestions yeah no I wasn't meaning
to move on I just meant to find some way to segue away from me and into my train of thought
so yeah practical ways I think we just did practical ways to implement this and you already
put forward the idea of just like talking about it you know when when you can to the extent of
not being obnoxious I wonder like for most people though that doesn't click like most of my friends
and family know the kind of stuff I'm interested in but they don't find it compelling themselves
it's just like it takes a certain kind of I use the word nerd endearingly it takes a certain
kind of nerd to like find the stuff really exciting and interesting right you know well you should
okay so let me give you a hypothetical scenario imagine if over the next year and a half
you became one of the top 10 healthiest people that you knew you double or tripled your income
your relationships and your personal life all increased in both quantity and quality
and let's say on top of it you got another awesome pet if all that happened in such a short frame of
time it might not get everyone in your immediate family and social circle interested but I think
it would probably get a good number of them to ask you like hey what what happened that's pretty
amazing but each of the things I just mentioned if like the self-help community is full of a lot
of trash but you don't have that much literature without some gems and they can get you some
amazing results especially the people who are a lot more data driven for example tim ferris
writer of the four-hour work week and not necessarily a founding member but definitely
a big advocate of the quantified self-movement has a section on meta learning where he pretty
clearly details how he goes about not just learning a new skill but organizing his schedule
so that he can master it and understand 80 of it in the most efficient way possible
and like that's something that's free online every rationalist should have that skill set as
quickly as possible now I'm feeling dumb I haven't not read that I mean here's the thing I honestly
forgive the rationality community for that because his books sound like the cheesiest things in the
world the four-hour work week four-hour body and four-hour chef he does have two new ones but I
don't remember their titles but to be fair to him he got those titles in pretty much the most
rational way I ever heard of he wrote like 10 different book titles he could use he made google
ad plays for each of them and that led to like the same website and he just counted at the end of
the month which one got the most clicks and use those for his names that's a pretty awesome approach
and it was brilliant and he explains it in the book and I just couldn't help but giggle that's
awesome yeah and I mean you know to to his credit like you're right the the cover at the bookstore
you know looks like another one of those random like oh here's how to like turn your life around
in three easy steps um but I've heard the guy talk on podcast and stuff and he's very articulate and
I think he he's definitely coming from a place that makes sense so it's weird that it wasn't
compelled to check him out more I mean I have the four-hour work week I just haven't read it which
I don't know what that says about me finally good um but yeah like the ability to to pick
up new skills quickly um is the kind of thing that you can cultivate you know like it's probably a
lot like prediction or super predictors right where you know some people are good at it some people
really suck at it but whoever you are you can get better and that's super valuable the returns
aren't are so amazing even if you put in minimal investment I think that's what always kind of
made me confused about why there wasn't more interest in it because
let's say you can only get 15% of the stuff that Tim Ferriss suggests that you can do
if I got a 15% efficiency improvement in anything that's like mechanical I'd probably be hired
immediately as like a lead engineer on whatever project that is for the rest of my life like
if I could design an engine that was 15% more efficient I might win a Nobel Prize well that's
different than being a 15% more efficient person right which which way is this yeah being a 15%
more efficient person is way more valuable I see yeah because if one of those that if one of the
things you become more efficient in is learning how to become efficient the returns are not just
multiplicative they're exponential over time and they're small compared to each day before and each
day after it but from an outside perspective it can be pretty staggering yeah that's interesting
by the way I'm not affiliated with Tim Ferriss in any way I will say that his book the 4 hour work
week is one of the things that motivated me to become a realtor because it gives me a very good way
of looking at how time factors into wealth so it's been very good to me personally but
results may vary yeah I think I mean that's that should be the grain of salt with any piece of
advice right you know everyone circumstances are a little different and one should be cautious of
giving and receiving advice but I you know again having not read the book I'm just going to assume
that it's about as generic as possible and it's it's approachable that way so I mean
you know it's obviously popular not because it targets you know a very small demographic of
people because it's approachable yeah all right you've motivated me to read that book I will have
read it soon it sounds really cool it's pretty easy read and yeah it's a short book yeah and it's
like 10 years old at this point so a lot of these specific tips and tricks aren't great but here's a
good one that's immediately paid dividends in my life most people are addicted especially at work
to checking their emails and their communications but we all know the data says that every time you
shift your focus you have to spend some mental energy like refocusing on the original subject
so just batch your emails I only answer emails twice a day immediately made my life much easier
reduce stress levels and that was one of the most simple suggestions I've ever gotten yeah I think
yeah that sounds like a low effort input with a with a good dividend at the end I
I need to read this book you know like I know I'm aware of tools that like like
lock your browser for certain times the day however long you want from like visiting Facebook
or Twitter or something like I don't know I can't think of the names but something like don't distract
me or something and that way you have to specifically go in and disable it if you want to like allow
yourself to indulge your your desire to go on Facebook or something and that additional step
keeps people kind of in check you know it's just little things that you can do to to enhance your
productivity and then boom suddenly more productive and you're getting done with work faster because
you're wasting less time reengaging man if it's that easy we are missing out that's sort of
maybe other rationalists I've read more stuff than I have in fact that's definitely true in many cases
but it's not about the reading though that's like kind of the thing like I believe a lot of people
have read this it's a community I believe is probably tangential but overlapping also it's
that I wonder how many low-hanging fruit as you've put it are there for the taking that even I haven't
noticed and why we as a community don't actively try to like foster more of that like if we had a
Wikipedia for like hey if you've decided that you want to run a triathlon well we as rationalists
have decided to look at all of the data like the ones of us who are health focused decided on their
own to build a repository of health data and give you like both the most practical advice that they
know that works and a good amount of the research and I'm sure that's only as few people in the
community we only need like five or six people who are experts in a field to at least get you a good
start yeah that's interesting you know like a handful of small things like that have come up but
you know like one for example was meta med which was around for a few years and it was basically
I don't think it ever really took off I think they ended up being like losing funding and
shutting down before they were able to like lower the cost entry but it was like you would pay I don't
know three or four or five thousand dollars and this handful of medical trained people whether
or not they were doctors or not I can't remember and you send out you send forward like your medical
info and your problem and you know if you have a problem that's difficult to diagnose or something
and third their thing was like all right we're going to compile all this we're basically going to
go house on this house the doctor show and we're going to figure out what's going on
and I thought that was kind of cool I think I heard about that you've Kowski mentioned that
he tried it out to figure out like how to treat his sleep disorder if you've read Mrs.
of rationality Harry has that like 26 hour sleep cycle you'd Kowski apparently has like a 24.25
hour sleep cycle which so every it's like it's an extra 15 minutes yeah which doesn't sound too bad
except for you think like all right two weeks later and suddenly you know you're you're off by
half a day so um this you know this was why like a lot of less wrong posts are at like 3 a.m.
so it suddenly it all makes sense yes this is you know tired guy at the computer no but uh
the I think I think the answer was uh like Madaffin ill before bed and then like long release
Madaffin ill as well so like you're getting hit with it throughout the night which sounds super
obvious um you know what this is a book that I should have read before we talked about this uh
you guys can just came up with a book on this subject um the one like why aren't we hitting
more of these like easy to hit points um inadequate equilibria uh is this new oh I haven't read it
either it's on my Kindle yeah you're right we both should have read it shame on both of us
we'll read it and get back to it but I have read the first chapter and he talks about how his wife
has uh severe seasonal affective disorder and the like sun lamps weren't really helping and they
were you know considering rather extreme measures of treating this by like you know moving to South
America for the summer for the winters um but you know he's thinking like look the sun
cures her seasonal affective disorder that's why she doesn't have it in the summer
so you know this is clearly just like a light problem why don't we just got six hundred dollars
with the light bulbs and strung them up in the apartment and it's bright as the summer in here
and it seems to have you know that small investment seems to have paid off really well like she's
apparently doing better um and his thing was like so why wasn't this obvious answer in the
medical literature yet and if it wasn't in there yet should I just conclude before trying that
someone's looking to this and dismissed it or it doesn't work so and I haven't read the rest of the
books I'm not sure what the general advice actually is on how to approach problems but like there are
going to be cases where like you look for an answer there's not one out there or you rather
you think of an answer you go to check and see if there's anything to it and there's no data on it
and so do you think okay well I'm either on to something that the medical community has never
thought of before or oh you know I guess it must not mean anything so when when do you actually
spend the time to invest in your your idea rather than letting the lack of data out there um stop
you uh I don't have the answer I think it's more of an investment thing like if it only
like if for something as big as what you'd kowski saying my limit would be a thousand bucks
I know that sounds really crass to say but if I can't make any real progress within a thousand
dollars or and like a few weeks of thinking really hard I probably won't be making any progress
but like that's still an amount of work and time and a normal person can do like that's the way I
think about it if it's really important you should be willing to invest more time and money
into figuring out yourself but even if it's not that important if you can find out or disprove it
yourself a lot of times with less than a hundred bucks that doesn't cost you much time or energy
I know right uh I mean my my couple examples for my life are much smaller but there's been a couple
times where you know I'm 15 20 bucks away from a rather large improvement um I had a couple examples
and the only one that I can think of is really stupid and pointless but when I first got an
xbox 360 and I switched up from like the gamecube and then before that like n64 and it had like the
red white and yellow uh cords plugged into the tv and the xbox 360 had five and I was like oh so
that's the hd and that's why it looks so good um but I didn't know until I had this thing for like
two or three years was that uh I'm a $15 hdmi cable away from getting wheel hd and I'm like I I mean
I missed I missed out on uh you know again the opportunity to like play Skyrim and higher resolution
or something pointless but just the idea that like I didn't know that there was a problem there that I
could solve so easily and so I think part of the challenge is like figuring out what actually is a
problem that you can address uh not just like all right here's my problem now let's go for it but like
asking myself the right noticing that there's like noticing that there's a problem or
inefficiency there at all yeah like I mean you know I bought a lot of old crappy cars in my life
and the first thing I do with them now is uh get a new distributor cap and spark plug cables and
spark plugs and it runs a lot better and that's like a total of like $60 worth of parts and
you know maybe half an hour worth of work and uh it's it's such a low investment the car runs
like it's 10 years younger um you know I I sort of have like this it's not really a petrifying
fear it's more just like this nagging concern that I'm gonna look back in like a year and be like
oh man here's only $20 that you could have spent to make your life a lot better and so I'm wondering
you know this is I guess not quite related or this is related but not the same thing I guess how
to identify those things that is a lot harder um well because mostly you don't know what you don't
know right yeah and those are by definition black swan events like that that's what nesim talib's
book the black swan is about events that are not only things you didn't predict but could not have
predicted and the best answer he's able to come up with after three books is you develop anti-fragile
strategies because you know that given enough time more of these black swan events and issues will
come up so you just make all your plans based around a world where you know these things are
going to happen and surprise you so you're optimally in like a perfect way of implementing it
you would develop your life such that almost every surprise good or bad made your life better
but couldn't make your life too much worse can you give an example I haven't read his books
so I'm going to be tooting my own horn here a little bit but uh on your last episode I commented
on the reddit because you guys talked about cryptocurrencies and I'm a little bit more negative
than Scott Alexander I would have given the rationality community a d or maybe even an f
because I believe that the rationality community was smart enough to immediately see the value of
blockchains and cryptocurrencies even if they didn't know bitcoin in particular was going to be the
big hit they were smart enough to realize this was a revolutionary set of ideas and if they really
believed that they should have made their beliefs pay rent and gone out and bought 20 dollars of each
cryptocurrency when they first started and you would have known that you would have lost money
on most of those cryptocurrencies because like the example he gives in his book is if you were
a person in 1999 and you had a thousand dollars and you did some research and you're like you
know what the next big thing on the internet is going to be search engines we need to figure out
how to look through all this stuff you don't know which company to bet on right there's a well
there's altavista what are some other ones I kind of forget ask jeeps yeah you don't know which one
of those is going to succeed but you know probably one of them is going to make it big so you put in
100 bucks into the 10 that you feel are most likely to succeed when they're first starting out
you're throwing seeds essentially into the ground and seeing where it ends up being fertile now
100 bucks so a thousand bucks total is like a chunk of change that's serious but in any one
company a hundred dollars win or lose that's like you know it hurts and if you can't afford it don't
do it but for most people it's not going to kill you so you know that you're probably going to lose
most of it we only need one of them to be a disproportionate success not only to make up
all your money but to get 10x returns yeah and so you know it's it's I'm sorry but it's your your
thing oh I was gonna say that the remainder of that post was pretty much saying that I'm giving
myself a c-minus because while I do have two and a half bitcoins and I am still sitting on them
but uh while I still have them I didn't really do what I said either like I should have gone
through the effort of buying litecoin and even dogecoin and all the other ones but I did not
do that because it was too much of a hassle at the time so I really just got lucky I didn't I wasn't
actually rational there or antifragile I was just lucky in in the right place I did read your uh
your comment on the subreddit but I didn't reply eggs I don't know a lot about uh cryptocurrencies
and I felt like more it was something that you know I should have come to handle but then I also
knew you and I'd be talking so um I didn't read your your comment though I think you know my uh my
takeaways you know part of it like I was able to give myself a pass and that I didn't care about
bitcoin until like I don't know maybe five years ago um and I could have gotten in then but I guess
I was super broke back then so it doesn't you know that's my other like way to wave it off
but just like in general um it's the kind of thing that and you know in the reaction
those community too there were people uh and like we talked about on the that episode uh
Gvern on the in the like the comments and posts and less wrong was saying guys think
this is going to take off it's going to be awesome we should all look into this and then
lo and behold it did explode and uh I think that the machine intelligence research institute got
some huge amount of funding because uh some percentage of early adopters of bitcoin were
less wrongers and they uh some of them scored big and it's like that is reassuring yeah and so I
think uh Miri's funded pretty heavily from that which is kind of cool um and I just went out today
with a friend uh who I'm not sure how much he made but he didn't like his job he was working
for Solar City selling solar panels um and I've heard that working for an Elon Musk company is
kind of like challenging because I think that his mindset is that like everyone finds work
as easy as he does um but he I'm going to put in 80 hours because I'm Elon Musk and I don't run on
human food yeah for him it's just like hey if I work 80 hours I can get done twice as fast as my
competitors not like where am I going to find the energy energy to work for 80 hours a week um
but anyway so this friend he made a he made a I'm not sure how much he made but he made enough to
quit his job and he liquidated some of his crypto and he says he's good for at least six months
and he's talking about stuff you know in the uh in the market so like he actually did capitalize
he walked the walk and it paid off yeah I I find it interesting like Ali Eiser's reply to that was
basically there are you know we can't invest in everything that has a one percent chance of working
um ah that's where I disagree you totally can because if you only invest like a small amount
each of them if it's purported gain is over like x1000 then it's worth it like yeah put in a dollar
and every one percent chance if there's a chance that you're going to get a thousand or ten thousand
dollars back yeah I mean I think with the case of crypto that certainly lines up but like other
opportunities you know the entry cost is often more than than more than a dollar you know if you
buy in for whatever fraction of a coin you want but you can't say like attend a class or move cities
or something I guess moving is probably a bigger deal but like you know there are other small things
that you can do that might pay off really big I mean fucking buying scratch off tickets I think
one in three at least gives you your money back and one in five I think gives you back double your
money um those numbers numbers might be slightly off but I don't think one in a hundred gives you
a thousand dollars but maybe one in 500 um so I guess I guess those odds are lower and crypto
had reasons to work that weren't pure chance okay so did you ever see the Julia Gala video where
she goes through like a visual explanation of Bayes theorem you know I just found that last
night I meddled it to somebody um the only one I had seen was like her one where she talks about it
I haven't seen the visual representation one yet or if I have I don't remember it uh she breaks down
the math to this really good multiplication of what are like how likely she uses the example of
like you see a person who's shy what's the likelihood he's a math PhD versus like a business student
so you're like okay math PhDs are 10 times more likely to be shy so it's 10 to one but there's
like a hundred business students for every one math PhD and you just multiply down
so I would think of it in a similar way if your goal when playing the Lotto is to win it big like
when I don't know 13 million or whatever the big prize is but so that's your possible reward
but your odds of winning are one in 45 million you should only invest 50 cents right you should
never invest yeah yeah so then it's just not worth it for you yeah and like I said too I think uh
there are people making noises that like crypto was going to be a bigger deal and no one can make
those same sounds about uh the lottery right no one's saying this is the best use of your money
at least no one worth listening to no one who doesn't work for the lottery yeah and that's why uh
I in general and the same talent tend to recommend uh I talk about us like we know each other that's
not true at all but um you guys are challenges that's why I yeah that's why I agree with him
that you should be looking for domains that are pretty new because you can still get good returns
like the opposite is a very fragile return so a fragile idea would be to look like a company that
has had steady growth that is above average because the best case scenario for them is they
continue to do steady growth the worst case scenario is because this is unusual there's
something wrong here and it will collapse like and Ron seemed like a really good investment they had
like above average returns for their shareholders for years but they they had no positive shocks
like any shock to that could only hurt them that's interesting yeah I um you mentioned
the same books from the last time we were hanging out and I really should read some I'll start with
Black Swan um and what's interesting is that I know that that's a book kind of on like the quote
required reading lists for rationalists and yeah it seems that people are still missing the points
you know it's one thing to just read it but it's another to like actually do something kind of
like maybe the 40 hour work or the four hour work week right and you know even like the sequences
and stuff too right like you can get through and you can learn a bunch of trivia but like
actually putting a little work and getting there is an additional step that you don't get from just
knowing the stuff and I think people are intimidated by the idea of conceptualizing themselves as
perfect rationalists because we know we can't be but what you can do is have you read thinking fast
thinking slow yeah thinking Daniel Kahneman yeah so he posits that you only have a limited amount
of energy per day to like essentially do your really good thinking and most of the time you're
running on system one instinct right right so system one was the kind of quick intuitive responses to
problems or questions that you face and season system two was your thoughtful deliberative one
that you have to actively engage system one goes automatically system two is one where you have to
stop and think and you can only do that sometimes for days based on the point of the book and they
talks a lot about your six biases that's a great book yeah so what that means is that even the
best rationalist with the best diet and the best like procedure for getting energy and the best
neurotropic stack probably is only rational for about one fourth of their day like actually engaging
in a rational life so your goal should be to use those moments when you have downtime like a
downtime day to develop systems around you that are designed rationally so that you can operate
in your like system one thinking and have that do most of the work right so the you know if you
could only spend 25 percent of your time actually thinking hard then you try to spend some of that
time cultivating your automatic system to be less stupid and to like system two know when it needs to
kick in which is where like knowing about the biases helps a lot because you can train a system one
to like raise a flag it's like oh this is a situation where the availability availability
heuristic might kick in what do you think system two and kind of pass it off that way
um sorry where were you going with that no that's very similar I was thinking more
like ground practical level like here's a good example I am trying to get a little bit healthier
because I gain a lot of weight I sit down a lot through the day and it's something I can work on
now if I just leave myself throughout the week I'm going to succumb to the lowest like the lowest
energy state whatever is most available so what I've done is in the last like weekend I've done a
lot of pre-cooking and got a bunch of stuff done so now even when I'm not acting I don't have my
full rational energy at me I don't even have the opportunity to act badly nice yeah I like that I'm
doing something similar where um there's a gym at my work so I like I also have a gym at my
apartment but I've used that like 10 times since I moved here so my my thing is all right I'm not
going to let myself go home till I go to the gym and then that way like going to you know sitting
down and relaxing isn't even really an option so it's just like pre-committing and uh forcing
yourself to do stuff um to make those good choices that later when you're feeling lazy you you don't
have the opportunity to indulge that laziness um that sounds like a Tim Ferris style life hack
it kind of is and I don't think that he has any like grand life answers but if I were to advocate
for any one person who really gets how to apply instrumental rationality it would probably be him
like I don't think he's ever heard of the phrase but that's what all of his books come down to
like how can I in the most energy efficient manner go after the goals I want and I mean
that's that sort of brings us back I realized we've been on kind of a digression I wanted to
to talk more about like the initial stuff you raised so um like the kind of thing um
um things the rationality committee isn't doing well um and one of them I think he said was like
not marketing yourself well but it might be a way to paraphrase it um another was like not actually
achieving like not setting goals achieving them like maybe many people are but their goals aren't
ambitious for as smart as they as they say they are right is that an uncharitable way to put it
or is that just a quick paraphrasing that works no I think that's about correct so did you have
anything else on that list because I didn't want to uh I know we went down a couple rabbit holes
and that's something that the show just does but um I'm trying to be mindful uh so what else were
you thinking call me the chess shire cat I'm all about rabbit holes perfect um
um well from Mike's I this is one of the few things I feel confident talking about from having
done a lot of sales and one of it is I feel bad criticizing the body language like every person
who's taken a communications 101 class knows that 70 percent of how we communicate is body language
25 percent is voice tone only 5 percent is the words we are conveying and yet we spend so much
time focusing on making sure that our verbal communication is completely airtight and very
little focusing on voice tone and body language and it's harder for me to make a direct like critique
because each person is individualized in this case but my biggest suggestion would be either take a
martial arts or take a dance class and for voice tone just start doing karaoke or singing in the
shower like that one's the easiest because if you just experiment with it when you feel comfortable
the voice is a beautiful instrument I love rap music for that reason so yeah we should mention
that as one of your credentials that you're a studying professional rapper um I am trying to
work on an album right now yeah so cool see I I don't know I I you know I mentioned I've been a bit
more confident last couple years I started to figure out how to like actually sing and dance
in front of people I think I'm still gun shy from being a shy little kid um but I think I like that
point because inadvertently I've been doing something similar to different approaches so um you know
whether or not the numbers of five percent are your words and that sort of thing add up the the idea
that like yes you are communicating a lot through your body language and your tone um I don't think
those are deniable and you know even in I think this is something that like rationalists know if
they've read like Robin Hansen's new book uh elephant in the brain thank you I was blanking on it I've
got it right here I was going to pull it out figure out what it was um yeah so uh the I think the first
chapter uh so like the first third of the book is like setting up a case for why signaling theory
is plausible and why the elephant in the brain like uh metaphor makes a lot of sense and then
the last two thirds are like examples from every from just daily life and one of them is communication
and uh people like I think people know that like higher body language and your tone conveys stuff
people know that that's a big deal but like maybe it's it's weird it's like failing to take a step
so it's one thing to just like we talked about earlier um it's one thing just to just know that
oh yeah this this is the thing and then another to say okay well how do I actually improve if
I want to be listened to um or or make an impact or something so what I've been doing at work is
I kind of just I not necessarily copy but I mimic in my own style the like the tone and body language
of people that seem really well respected there um and so I don't think I do it enough for anyone's
like obviously ripping them off but when I'm trying to make like an actual point like to my boss
sort of my co-workers I sort of put on a different tone that I'm like knowingly doing because when
this guy that I'm thinking of talks that way people listen um so you know it's not necessarily the
same thing as like deliberate practice I don't think I've done that but just making it an effort
to be aware of the fact that hey um people will receive my message more than like just maybe me
making a compelling argument they need more than that um yeah that's interesting maybe part of the
the fallback or like the not fallback the the failure to engage there is that especially you
know for us online nerds almost all of the discourse there is your your actual content
of your message right um if I'm ready if I'm writing a couple paragraphs it doesn't matter
if I'm slouching in my chair right um so that could be part of it um but I mean almost all of us
interact with some people in real life and if you're you know hunched and shy when you're engaging
you know there's social anxiety and stuff but if you can find a way to overcome that which it's
worth trying to actually do rather than just like you know for whatever shortcoming you have if you
can find a way to engage and solve it do go for it right um so identifying your shortcomings and
not being afraid to stare at them I think is one big step that you can make and then you find things
like you know take an improv class to improve your ability to like dynamically engage in a
conversation or something. Toastmasters is a very well respected nationally known organization
um I have a lot of friends and family who've gone through them and you will become a really
good public speaker and it's not a skill to be trivialized the ability to command a large group
of people to pay attention to you and to take you seriously and to like thoughtfully engage with you
is powerful. Yeah you know we should have had an e-nosh on for this because I know that he's done more
walking the walk than I have and he's also been walking that walk longer but uh I know that he's
a Toastmaster lecture or Toastmaster speeches a few years ago and I think it was deliberately a
thing to like get more confident at public speaking and that'll make me more confident in
like addressing people to get my point across um and it's and it's not as bad as people think it is
like I was always a very extroverted person and I want to make it clear because I know there are
people who are naturally introverted who are listening to this who are thinking talking in
front of a group of strangers sounds like hell and I do not blame them at all because sometimes
it actually is but the important part to remember is unless you are on an island of cannibals who
will eat you the worst possible thing that can happen is that they will politely applaud you
and then snicker a little bit and then forget it after the next bad speech but that someone else
right and you know that was like this realization I had like in high school I was a pretty socially
shy kid and um I mean I still was kind of overcoming that last you know 10 years too but the uh I had
like I had articulated to myself what's called spotlight bias about knowing the name of it
which is basically where you walk around and this is you know every every uh you know pubescent
teenager thinking that everybody's paying a ton of attention to you and you know if your shirt's
not tucked in or you know you've got to sit or something everyone's going to remember and they're
going to you know it's going to be seared into their memory forever and they're going to judge you
but all it took was sort of like just this kind of third person view and for me to realize that I
don't do that to anybody else what makes me so special why would anyone be paying any extra attention
to me and man the like the anxiety of talking and stuff really falls away a bit after that
I mean just just I guess recognizing that like you know you're probably you know you might be
above average in niceness but you might not you might be roughly average and so if you're not
running around hating on people for you know stammering during a talk or you know failing to
reach the end of a sentence articulately then they're not going to do the same thing for you either right
and here's the thing you may very well encounter someone in the bottom 10 percent of niceness
who's going to be a jerk but that's actually the moment that you're going to be judged by
and it's really easy to just hold the moral upper ground and just like gracefully say I've
tried my best you're not the one speaking and like that's one of those things that I think a little
bit of preparation and practice really helps with like dealing with the people who will be jerks
is never going to be comfortable but having a plan for it before it happens means that you
immediately lose a lot of your stress I think that's one of the reasons I I really enjoy and have a
lot of respect for like stand-up comics um because you're out there kind of making a fool of yourself
saying silly shit and if it's not well received or if you got a dick if you gotta let me be more
articulate if it's not well received and you've got somebody being rude in the audience um you
know it's really easy to get disarmed from that and it takes like an extra skill to have a witty
comeback to shut down a heckler um and you know like those that's the situation where you're hitting
the bottom 10 percent of niceness kind of people or they just think that's the acceptable way to
engage in a at a comedy show or something but I always find that to be the dumbest thing you could
possibly do stand up because literally unless it is amateur night this is a person who has made
it their life decision to be funny and you're gonna try to out funny them at their place of work
right yeah this like I've I have never seen heckling go well that's all I've gotta say maybe
at amateur night you can get away with it but nowhere else yeah I mean you gotta think too the
audience is on the comic side right so you've gotta you've gotta be really confident that you're
gonna make a damn good point or be really really funny to uh or be very drunk yeah and and I have
an embarrassing moment with John Mulaney at comedy works a couple years ago that uh John Mulaney is
on my favorite side of comics he had a Netflix special called uh New in Town that my girlfriend
and I were a big fan of and then he was out touring kind of demoing his next show The Comeback Kid
which is also on Netflix now and the comic the club I went and saw him at was a small club and
like there's a lot of audience interaction and stuff and you know being a big fan sitting really
close to the stage I like I engaged on something and he immediately just like dropped his funny
facade and he like he turns to me and like you know he treats me like a heckler and I completely
get in hindsight that was all my fault because the the audience engagement that he had been
doing before was everything that he initiated and you know me just kind of wanting to be a part of
it was like oh if I say something I can be involved you know there's also a to drink
minimum at the bar or at the comedy shows so um somewhat of a lightweight but uh I feel like as
long as you didn't continue after that point you're probably oh no that was actually so that was the
funny thing about it was I tried to disengage immediately because I realized I realized immediately
like oh I fucked up this is on me I shouldn't have said anything I'm being an asshole and
I kept trying to say as like no no I I you know sorry I didn't you know I don't want to and he's
like no no let's talk about it I'm like let's not I'm sorry um so he he kept going for it longer than
I that I wanted to but again not again you know that was my bad I realized that my conduct wasn't
there's also like I think my first time like seeing a celebrity comic that you know at a show
that was like close enough to interact with um so you know I was excited and stupid but speaking
of how easily it is to be just completely slammed by a comic if they're perceiving you to be a heckler
yeah I've got personal experience there so but all that aside it's all this comes down to the idea
that there are very low hanging fruit that I think if each person in this community took it upon
themselves to say I have the resources and applying the sequences and the knowledge of this
community has helped my life a lot maybe I am an oddity but I don't think so like I don't think
I'm that much better or more clever or anything so if this is true imagine a world where every
single person who like you talk to is at least a little bit curious like oh you're doing that
rationality thing I've been seeing waves about that like that's not a crazy goal to achieve in
five to seven years but it's something that we as a community could engage in and the potential
returns are unknowably high yeah it sounds like I mean I feel like the bar is pretty unknowably
high there too you know like I said people aren't walking around like oh my god you're a scientist
that's so cool um I do feel like you know no matter how I don't know you're right I guess on one
level it's one thing to say I know all this cool stuff and I think it helped my life a little bit
and here's like my big explanations for why I think I'm doing better now than I was five years ago
and you know I think what you're envisioning is somebody you know who makes huge strides in
their life and people are like holy shit how'd you do it it's like oh well let me tell you
and that sounds appealing I just I just have no idea how to get there you know talking about it
more could help I don't even I don't think it's even huge strides though those are possible that's
kind of why I like Tim Ferriss he uses real good scientific examples to prove that those huge
strides are at least theoretically possible but the more important thing is that consistent strides
and smart ways of trying to do improvements in yourself that stick we have the data and
we can make a community that holds ourselves accountable maybe this is idealistic and I
have no right to impose on anyone else but if we want to say that we're trying to raise the
sanity waterline but we're not at even putting in 10 effort to meeting people where they are to
help read love like help pull them up essentially and that's what doing all this socializing
knowledge is it's learning the basics and the nuances of how to engage with people to get
them where you're at then we should stop pretending that we care about it huh like if if that's not a
goal and it's not act like a thing we want to do that's fine like it doesn't have to be an espoused
goal of individuals or the community but it's something I hear talked about a lot but yet I
very rarely see rationalists trying to go out and engage with the public even like on a personal
level or usually even on the big level most of the time on the big level it's them talking to
scientists or skeptics or people in related fields that's not not where most of America is it's not
where most the world is that's interesting yeah I mean like I sorry I'm I'm feeling sort of
somewhat scatterbrained like I have that effect on people well I think it's a bit you it's like
I'm coming I'm coming down from something and I'm feeling slightly under the weather but the uh
like yeah you're right the rationalist community talks a lot about like kind of just bemoaning
the fact that you know most people don't care about this sort of thing but and if there and if
there is you know I'm not I'm not super literate in a lot of the online community you know I read
a handful of blogs once in a while but so far as I know and I'm sure someone if anyone knows this
you know do send a link um to the blog or the article that talks about this but there isn't
a lot of systematized like all right how do we actually do this rather than just talk about like
why isn't why isn't the sanity waterline higher or you know um you know raising the problem how do
we you know what are ways that we've looked at to actually get this better it sounds like the
kind of thing that CIFAR would do the Center for Applied Rationality um they're they're so far as
I know their goal is more like actually articulating through like you know small studies like
which approaches teaching rationality actually work um but I can see them down the road getting
into like all right which which ways of conveying the awesomeness of rationality to lay people
actually work um but yeah I wonder why this isn't like a more attacked problem um it's
you know like I said it's the kind of thing that we care about and that people talk about
but why aren't we doing more um you know like in my life the you know like we've been doing this
podcast for two years because like I partly it was that when you go to you know the podcast
store on you know uh on your whatever you call it podcast app like my why am I blinking on this
the apple one I think it's just called podcast um any type of less wrong nothing comes up so like
uh I was like all right well I like listening to this stuff you know rationally speaking only
comes out every two weeks and it takes me 40 minutes to listen to it's like what else have I got um
so I was like all right well you know you know you mentioned doing what you can with resources
you have and I was like well I've got time and you know microphones aren't that expensive and uh
let's let's just give this a shot so I think I don't know if this is doing anything to raise
the sanity waterline or not but it was my like attempt to do some outreach and more like like
I said it was more kind of like self-serving well not self-serving in the sense that like it did
anything for me but I imagined I wasn't the only person who wanted to you know have something
kind of like this out there and so while I don't personally get the fun of listening to it uh other
people do so I believe the term I believe the term for what you did in the entrepreneurial community
would be scratching your own itch yeah that's a great way to put it and I didn't I wasn't worried
that term but I like it a lot um yeah so you know my itch is well does that apply because I mean
so my itch isn't really scratched because I'm gonna get any more rational stuff to listen to
because I don't listen to the podcast uh I mean I occasionally listen to one I listen to ones with
like guests and stuff um but you know I since I was there for the conversation I don't get the
the fun of like downloading it every two weeks and you know hearing it come out um
but at the very least I'm I'm hoping that it scratches the itch for you know the handle
people who wanted to hear it so well and it's also giving you the opportunity to talk to people
like I heard your third episode when you guys put that up with your interview with Eleazar
Yudkowski and you guys have interviewed Robin Hansen twice so even if it didn't give you more
podcasts to listen to it gave you the opportunity to engage with more rationalist communication
that's true and that was really the goal and that that's that's actually a good way to think about
it and you're you're right like um you know part of the way that I've been trying to apply these
skills in my daily life like I said is just like asking myself particular questions okay here's what
you want how can you get there and you know what sort of things would make you happy and I had this
realization a couple weeks ago that like younger Steven would be pretty jealous and happy for current
Steven um like you know I when I every time Brian Dunning's on the show I kind of fanboy
at him and tell him I've been listening to a show for 10 years um but man if I had told you know
20 year old Steven that you know hey down the road you're gonna be he's gonna be on your podcast a
couple times I'm like oh that's pretty exciting I don't know what to say about that um so I mean
I think for me I'm just trying to think of like this sounds like a lot of self padding on the back
of war it's like I'm happy to share that I'm being a happy person right now it's trying to
to signal the fact that rationality has made my life better and to get more people involved by
telling them how happy I am um but the the uh the other side of that is just like
you know like it sounds so obvious there's some disconnect between like being able to just like
hear a piece of advice and be like oh yeah you know that makes sense like then to actually do it so
like for me this is where this is where I actually am going to pull in a weird reference
of eastern Tantra
so there I'm sure you've heard the terms yoga and Tantra before right let's pretend I have it
so a lot of times when you hear yoga you imagine a lot of people doing weird stretches and poses
over mats and Tantra is almost always in reference to sex what they really represent in Hindu religion
and that the parts that I've understood is that yoga is about philosophy its goal is to achieve
quote unquote enlightenment through body and soul like synergizing for lack of a better term
and they have these like poses you go through and these big lofty thoughts
but Tantra has a different approach the whole of Tantra is technique that's what that word means
in the original script and the idea was instead of giving you a philosophy to understand the universe
we're going to tell you to do this meditation or technique because the act of doing it will
reveal the answer that you want and I think that this is one of the things that we don't have I
believe there should be a compendium of texts that are essentially practical applications of the
sequences in your daily life that we can give people before we give them the sequences because a
lot of times I think people learn backwards way better do something and then learn why it works
and that's that ties in great the last thing I was going to say on that was I think
you know again it sounds like one of those hollow pieces of advice but you just really
got to try it like the thing that I think stops most people from doing anything is they never
actually try you look at the problem and say that looks too hard I'm not going to go for it
or there's no way I can do that but you know if it's if the investment cost isn't too high to
you know if it's going to ruin your life to try then maybe you don't risk it but
you know it's the thing that stops people from doing things you know 100% of the time is not
trying it and you know like this is maybe the another example from my life of again it sounds
like I'm patting myself on the back a lot I'm just trying to actualize your advice of or your
suggestion of talking about how this has improved you know my life to motivate people to give it a
shot but um let's see what year is it 2018 so in like 2015 I'd never written a line of code and
don't be wrong I still suck I'm you know I'm new to it but I had this like mental model that anyone
who could do anything with computers with some savant who had been writing games since they were
in diapers and this was like a black box of just this obscure domain of magic knowledge that only
super geniuses had access to and then I met people who you know are programmers they're like
why aren't you doing this you're doing all these stupid jobs I'm like that's a good question I
would thought it was too hard and they're like oh no it's not that bad check this out they sent
over a couple links and I tried out you know like an online tutorial on python called automate the
boring stuff it's free online if you google automate the boring stuff um and the takeaway was like oh
this is human learnable by an average person like me I should be doing something like this this is
fun and I and it's not this impossible thing like I thought it was and so uh you know I decided to
just go gung ho at it and put my job went to a bootcamp and uh for like 50 hours a week for 19
weeks and got some some foundation in there and boom here I am happy and my life's better and I
like my job so like it's just it's interesting what making an actual effort to just try something
can do and you know I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend that you drop 16k on a bootcamp and you know
quit your job as the first step but like if something sounds hard and like oh I could never
do that just go give it a shot at a low investment first you know for most things there's free stuff
online or low entries to to trying stuff out and who knows what you'll find it could be really easy
and fun I usually go with uh if it costs me less than a date with a girl I think is cute or
substitute person you're interested in then I should do it because I'm more interested in myself
than I am in anyone I'm dating and I should be if I want to continue growing as a person
so if I can't even take myself out for a date then I'm doing something wrong that's a that's
a nice way to put about it and it puts you in a good position to yourself I think that's important
um and and uh I think you brought up two really solid things that people can implement right away
which is start asking yourself whenever you see something what is the littlest cost of investment
I can use to get involved and at least get my feet wet and two start writing down times you've
successfully like overcome or defeated something that you thought was harder than it was in actuality
and then next time you get intimidated because you've written down so many of these they will
be the first thing to pop into mind so the next time you are faced with something and your first
instinct is to say ah maybe that's like too hard for me you will have already made this
subconscious process where your brain will make a list of all the times you were wrong
and it wasn't too hard for you it was actually pretty easy that's awesome I like that a lot
from a personal example for me I was terrible with money and I'm if I'm being completely honest
I'm still not great but being involved in the rationality community first of all forced me to
be honest with myself because the longer I was had that blind elephant in my brain about my
inability to handle it the worse the problem got so it helped me confront it first of all
but then I started to ask myself what are the minimums I need to satisfy my wants and how
can I reduce all money intake and I approached it from a rational way and because I had lost my
defensiveness about that problem myself I've moved in a much better direction and
I have my first property in Florida that I'm Airbnbing starting next week and we're looking
at buying another one in Colorado so I might see you again sooner than I thought in the next like
year or two so things are starting to really improve for me in that way and that was not
natural I am not good with money by default at all but you recognize that we just said all right
how do I actually you know first of all not flinch away from acknowledging the problem but
how do I go about fixing it that's really cool man that's awesome and I think that a big part of
that was being epistemologically rational about myself because my mental map could never be accurate
I could never really make accurate and good decisions about myself if I wasn't willing to
look at this big spot in myself that's when Robin Hansen's elephant becomes visible when it has to
stand in contrast against reality yeah I like that that's a good way to think about it you know to
just focus and kind of square away at the problem and force yourself to look at it
and you know all the caveats aside that we've been talking too long to get into of like you know
how do you uh how do you recognize there's a problem if you can't see it that sort of stuff but
just you know noticing areas of non-optimalness and say all right what can I do to improve especially
if it's not that hard and I like the idea of saying you know if you've missed my cost it's less than
a date because you know it's less than a date you know a couple books or something um you know maybe
a date is a few hours so maybe it has nothing to do with money but you can invest like two hours
to watch like a lecture on something instead of like goofing off yeah that's awesome I like that
a lot I'm gonna keep that in mind I am pro laziness don't get me wrong I am too I think laziness
breeds efficiency so if I'm gonna try to improve myself or recommend others improve themselves
I tell them to do it in the laziest way possible because then it sticks especially yeah you know
just with the obvious kind of point there that like if it's not that hard you'll be more likely to
do it and I like that a lot there is one other topic I know we probably have to end soon but
there was one other fun silly-ish topic I wanted to bring up if that's okay with you yeah go nuts
I'm more conscientious of your time I know it's like 10 o'clock there so and you said you have
some tests tomorrow for something that you studied for all day uh statics yeah uh that's
another thing rationality helped me out with once my finances got in order I asked myself if I applied
all of my efficiency to my business how much spare time could I get and what could I do that would be
the most effective good and that's how I landed on my goal of going back to school and
developing a mixture of like real estate developing but that's another tangent for another day well
that'll be able to definitely kind of talk more about that too but what was your funny thing that
you wanted to get to so I think that a good way for a lot of rationalists to realize the difference
in themselves between when they are being rational and when they are rationalizing afterwards
is to engage in acting and play and the reason I say this is that when you I'm sure you've heard
the analogy fish probably don't and have a word for the ocean I haven't but I I like it
and part of that is I think humans and our consciousness swims in our personality that
is like who we are and we move around from focus to focus in there but we never really think about
what it is like what our personality actually is because it's part of what we associate with our
identity one of the things I've done for about a decade now is I'm a larper also known as live
action role playing I in fact I run a game here on the east coast called adventures wanted slight
plug I encourage I encourage guest plugs will there be section for that at the end too that sounds
awesome but um one of the reasons I recommend larping to a lot of introverts and rationalists
is it gives you a completely safe space to be a different person and the act of that is imagine
a version of yourself who is okay Stephen imagine someone who is almost exactly like you in
capabilities but is evil and then play that person yeah and here's the thing that you will discover
you can have and there are moments when you truly forget your role playing and that's
a lot of the greatest acting experiences as well when you will start subconsciously
rationalizing like that person and when that happens and then you go out of game and the
game's over for the night and you go to bed and you think about it you're gonna have the ability now
to like step outside of yourself and look at your personality because you've done it with
this fake personality you've created and say oh I wasn't actually being rational there I was just
rationalizing like the more different personality spaces you allow yourself to occupy and explore
and play around with the more you discover how much of your personality is fluid and what parts
of it are truly like set in stone and that helps you a lot because so I don't know if you've heard
the radio lab but they did a radio lab where they tested this and people who put on lab coats
were more like got 10 percent more questions right on a science test than when they didn't wear
the lab coat I hadn't heard that but that sounds really interesting and if I'm I want to make I
want to paraphrase this to make sure I understood it correctly at least part of it was that when
you're playing a role and then you find yourself rationalizing as that person you notice what that
feels like and you might be able to train grooves in your mind to notice when you're doing that when
you're not playing a role and so yes thank you for making that eloquent because I was kind of going
about that certuitously but it's a it's a way of practicing that third-person perspective on your
own cognitive process in a way that's fun most of the time that's nice that's awesome I like that a
lot I've never tried anything like that I've thought about like improv classes which is one of those
things where I've been putting it off forever improv like acting will definitely do the same
thing to you especially if you play a role for a very long time or go through the practices to the
point where everything becomes subconscious now do you think that for like you know introverted
people who really just aren't ready to try and tackle something like uh uh um improv classes
or something like that you know I think another way to role play someone who you aren't um it's
like whatever I play video games that like a lot of the character to choose if they're going to be a
good or bad person I always choose a good person because I'm like all right what would I do in the
situation uh so you know like only to see what would happen to like I blow up megaton and fall
out three um but then I loaded from another save because I felt bad um so I wondered if a way to
practice this at home if you don't feel like getting out or if you don't feel like ready to get out
and do it in front of people but we'd like to play a video game if you're already playing video games
yeah I guess I'm doing this at you you tell me if you think this would work you play a video game
by a shock or fallout or whatever where you can be a bad person if you want and it like you play
the role that you're not usually inclined to do and so then you know when you're making the decision
all right do I harvest this little sister and killer or do I let her go and save her um you
know if you choose the one that you don't usually go for and then you're rationalizing for your character
could that develop some of the same groups or do you think that's too easy I think it might work
if it's an MMO but I think you almost need humans or some kind of complex not like two or three choices
of options to really figure out where your character is creative and when they weren't
like one of the larping things that helped me was my very first character uh I was playing at a
do you ever see the old youtube video of a guy going lightning bolt lightning bolt I haven't
it's an old larve video I played at that game legends role playing in massachusetts
I wanted to play the most evil conniving character I could imagine so I invented a lawyer banker
in a fantasy world with elves and undead necromancers and stuff and I played him because
it was about as opposite from me as I could imagine and it was kind of scary to realize
how quickly and how effectively I started to just win in that mindset but it also gave
me a level of confidence because I was now like running my own little business essentially in
this game I started the first bank and did all these other silly things but they were definitely
self-motivated and engaged and I was like well if I could do that there I can't I do it in real
life like I could at least try to do the first step see where it's different that's really fun I
like that a lot and I think you're right that the social aspect weighs a lot because it's you know
like we talked about with Robin Hansen a couple episodes ago you know a large part of like where
your conscientiousness and self-image comes from is like in relation to talking to other people
or in fact with them anyway and so if you're if you're doing it at home on a not online video game
then you know you're not getting really any of that feedback because no one's actually judging you
or even actually judging the character to be
one of the things I want to bring up for people who are more introverted is LARPs also offer you
an opportunity to recontextualize your shyness um one of the examples that I'm thinking of is there
was a female player at our game who is like in my opinion almost socially crippling anxiety and
shyness she is a lovely young woman I'm very happy she's my friend and when she started playing
our game she didn't really want to talk to anyone so she decided to become an assassin
in six years she became the most terrifying person in our game we I have still have nightmares
because she out of game learned how to walk through a leafy forest without making a single noise
that's awesome and it is very terrifying you can embrace the things that you have
you know difficulty with and just you know make that part of your character I like that a lot that's
really cool and by the end of her character arc she was like making speeches in front of the whole
town and leading groups because she had realized that being quiet wasn't a hindrance it was just
part of who she was but she also learned when it wasn't appropriate and she had to she was able
to figure those things out in a safe context of a game and now she's been past that character for
a few years she's married she has a very happy life and I don't think she has any of those issues
anymore I might be wrong but she seems much better now that's awesome that's really cool
I still have nightmares so many nightmares I think you're on to something about talking about like
actualizing these skills making them seem really appealing you know to anyone who wants to better
themselves they hear about somebody's approach to solving one of these problems you know they'd say
a social problem you're having or a work problem or something and you know just hearing about
awesome things that people have done make it sound really attractive I like that a lot and you know
I've gotten excited just hearing about most of these right that's awesome
let me think we're closing up here on two hours is there anything else you wanted to
get out real quick or you know any plugs or anything for sure the only plug I would have
besides my rap album I'll let you guys know when that comes out you guys will get the first
demo but besides that if there are any rationalists near Lancaster Pennsylvania or Philadelphia
I'd like to do a meet-up and if anyone's interested in our game it's located in southeast Pennsylvania
Adventures Wanted Role Playing is our website on David Youssef I am a realtor here so on the
off chance that everyone wants to buy a house in beautiful Amish country I'm here to help awesome
well thanks for coming on chatting man I had a good time I hope that you know it was a
validly used for your time and I hope people thought that we did okay without Inyash here to
give us a third voice but wrangle us in well I think I think that's one of the reasons we
drive so well is that we kind of do a good job of wrangling each other and I think
but anyway no this was great I'd love to have you back on at some point I feel like there's
we barely scratched the surface and we didn't talk about any of the well we only talked about
one of the exciting things that we talked about when we got together for drinks when you were
here in Denver so I know that there's a lot of cool stuff left to talk to you about so
I appreciate it I'm very flattered and I'm honored to be another guest of this show that's
made me happy so many times oh man I appreciate that I still don't really know how to respond to
when people say stuff like that but I guess I'm really happy to hear that but I feel like it's
weird that I'm playing part of that role so to quickly transition away from that I will think
this week's this episode's Patreon supporter Christopher James for helping keep this podcast
alive and you know keeping the servers up and I don't know your support means a lot to us and
good job Christopher yeah and we can't let an episode go by without thinking Kyle he's the one
who makes this sound palatable as I said before all they can do is fix the audio he can't fix what
we talk about so Kyle you're the greatest thank you very much I remember the old episodes I remember
the old episodes before you were there oh god me too those were the worst when I tell people if
they hear about the show they gotta meet up and they want to check it out I say start with one of
the newer ones like a guest don't jump back to the first few we were still finding our sea legs there
but you know they're up there for to be immortalized in history so if you want to go back and see
how bad this was they were good enough to hook me I don't know what that says but they were good
enough to hook me well I won't make any judgment score what that says all right David well thanks a
lot I really appreciate talking to you
