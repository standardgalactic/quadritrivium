there is this sabotage
then sort of if you run all these possible worlds
together every passing day that you don't
see any sabotage is one where some of the
worlds where there is sabotage
are inconsistent because in some of those worlds
the sabotage had already happened then you had noticed
and so as time goes by and you see
this occurring
each of those all of the
more and more of the worlds in that universe
where this hypothesis is true are sort of dying off
and being ruled out from consideration
while none of the ones where it isn't happening
are being invalidated so
the pool of your hypothesis space that is taken up by
this hypothesis is false
grows over time
what other thing on reflection and
I think this comes up in the comments on this post
but I haven't read the comments for a while
although Governor Warren probably didn't know
the reason there was
intelligence to suspect the existence of
organized possible sabotage
at the time but not stuff they could talk
about publicly so
there's also an issue here
where they're trying
there's some really motivated reasoning here trying to point
whoever is listening to
what Warren is saying in the direction of
believing something that they know
for what's not the real reason
they believe it
I was going to bring up the motivated reason
motivated reasoning
and politics
because
Eleazar's kind of writing these as
advice to general people and then here's an example
of somebody doing the bad thing
but
the problem I have is some of the sequences
I'm trying to get people who aren't already
bought into it or in the rationality community
to see that this stuff is important
is some of these are just
ideas that if you said them were going to be really obvious on their face
like
the idea that
if there's no evidence for something
maybe that thing
doesn't exist
like if you tried to tell that to somebody as though
it were a revelation they'd be like well yeah no shit
but then
apparently this governor can
make this speech and people can be like yeah
that is suspicious that there's been no sabotage
there's probably going to be sabotage
yeah
and I think that
getting the full point of this
post requires the context
of
a thing that is often said otherwise
in sort of the scientific community I guess
that
the opposite claim of this title
that absence of evidence is not
evidence of absence
and I think that that is true outside of the context
of doing things that you would expect
to generate evidence
that particular one
I get the sense that
although I think technical limitations would have prevented
you from actually doing it
that the is should be italicized or bold faced
because people do fall back on that
frequently
in discussions ranging from religion
to alternative medicine to all sorts of other stuff
that the fact that there's no evidence in either direction
is a license to believe the specific thing
and
no the fact that there's evidence that we should be
that should be easy to find and we don't have any evidence
is in fact
weak evidence of absence
that the
absence of proof is not proof of absence
but absence of evidence is evidence of absence
right
or evidences in the sense is like
you should update
your probabilities at least a little bit
yeah
not necessarily a lot
it is the case that the amount that you update
when you don't see the thing can be much smaller than the amount that you update
when you do see the thing
if I ordered pizza
and I want to know if it will arrive
but I don't see the pizza delivery van
probably only makes my probability that it
has not arrived go up by
a very miniscule fraction each second
but if there's a second that comes by when I do see it
then my probability probably goes up to
99.99% unless there are
pizza van impersonators driving around my town
well that sounds like the mother of all segues
into the next step into the next post
I was hoping that somebody would do that
conservation of expected evidence
and this one
Eleazar starts talking about a priest name
I'm going to say this terribly
so I'm just going to say Frederick
Spieve on Langenfeld
Spade
Spade
Frederick Spieve
Spave on Langenfeld
I guess that's it
you heard the confession of condemned witches
and describe the decision tree for accusing condemned witches
if the witch has led an evil and improper life
she was guilty
if she had led a good and proper life
this too was proof for witches to symbol
and try to appear especially virtuous
after the woman was put in prison
if she was afraid this proved her guilt
if she was not afraid this proved her guilt
for witches to characteristically pretend innocence
and wear a old front
and the quote goes on
Eleazar points out Spade
was in the unique position to act as a confessor
to many witches
so he was able to observe every branch of the accusation tree
but in any individual case
you would only hear one branch of the dolena
so it's one-sided and this might not have been as obvious
he goes back to the rule that
absence of evidence is evidence of absence
and says you can't have it both ways
you would call
the more general law that this falls under
conservation of expected evidence
the expectation of the posterior probability
after viewing the evidence
must equal the prior probability
therefore for every expectation
of evidence there's an equal and opposite expectation
of counter evidence
or on average
you should expect to be exactly as confident
as when you started out
so if like the governor
in the previous post you claim no sabotage
is evidence for the fifth column
hypothesis you also have to believe
seeing sabotage is an argument against a fifth column
and the same he says for arguing
a good and proper life is evidence
that someone's a witch
or that God hides his existence to test humanity's faith
at the end
he asserts it's impossible for a Bayesian to seek
evidence confirming a theory
because you can't expect your confidence
at a fixed proposition to be higher than before
or I guess you might say
you can't control how confident you feel
you can only look for evidence to test a theory
I'm a bit confused
by the
statement that you should
be the same amount of confident before and after
do you understand that?
I guess your confidence equals 100%
the way that I see this is
like if I know that
in 10 minutes I'm going to see some evidence
the lab results are going to come back
but my confidence in my hypothesis right now
should be equal to
what I expect my confidence to be
the average confidence that I expect to have
in 10 minutes
which maybe currently it's 50%
and in 10 minutes I think there's
a two-thirds chance it'll be 60%
and a one-third chance that it'll be 30%
assuming that I have done my multiplication right
but that
