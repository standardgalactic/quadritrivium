oh wait she wanted to be the one to announce that
I wasn't supposed to tell anybody
and I'm laughing because I'm like well now I know where I get it
I like to just tell people don't tell me secrets
because I will blurt them out
like I don't remember in the moment
that yeah it's hard to keep track of all that stuff
and I think the thing is I think most people are this way
there's probably some people who are just naturally good liars
who have really good theory of mind or whatever
but like most people actually suck at telling lies
and keeping secrets
yeah I think one thing that maybe isn't acknowledged as much as it ought to be
is like there is a decent social class to telling someone a secret
and that you have now like burdened them with this potentially eternal responsibility
to like have knowledge that they can't transmit to people
and like even though it affects all sorts of other things that they do
yeah
like I think one thing people should do is say like do you want to hear a secret
oh and um just to finish the story about my sister
so my dad's telling me that she's
well you know she's not sure yet
so she didn't want to spread the news around
but she's just having really bad morning sickness
and I was like okay well
um I just got on Dance at Cheyenne on the black market
which is the best anti-nausea drug
for prescription only
gray market
the gray market in which specifies
I resemble that remark
Canadianfarmacy.com or something
inhousefarmacy.v which is also where I get my Cipro
okay
so I was like well now I have this drug that I could offer my sister
that would
I've read that it's used off label for morning sickness and seems to work quite well
is it cat A?
in order to give it to her
I would have to tell her that my dad told me
the thing that she didn't want him to say
like it's a
it's not I don't think it's scheduled it's a
what is cat A?
pregnancy category
oh
it's not
I don't think that there's
not enough data on
it's using pregnancy for them to
prescribe it that way but that's
I think why it's used off label
I don't think that they've observed any
adverse effects
according to Wikipedia there are no
known negative effects from with pregnancy
but it's not very well studied
okay I've
category B apparently no risk in non-human studies
so that's reassuring to some extent
yeah
yeah but that's like the kind of
thing that I would like my sister to choose
for herself to have that option but now
like I can't
because it's just like I just
sent her an envelope
it's a chat and like
I know your secret
just write an anonymous letter
of course somebody's going to really trust
anonymous letter full of
full of pills yeah
check this
sign it like someone who wasn't
supposed to be told
as far as the burdens of
of confidence is like that my general
policy is to be
at least reticent about sharing
something that my model of the person wouldn't
write a blog post about
and but if I've heard someone
if I've heard the person divulge
the same fact to more
in the presence of more than
three people or after telling
me to at least one other person
that I sort of treat that
as the commons
I think that's reasonable
yeah I think
my standard is generally like
if I think that
sharing it like if it's sensitive
enough that sharing it
might realistically cause
some kind of like social
or other kind of harm
to the person whose secret it is
I try to
just ask that
person can I share this
and
because
trying to like keep a lot of secrets
automatically by default
is just so constraining in what I can say
and the mental load of it
is pretty high as well especially if you have multiple
people in your life who
know or don't know
specific restricted things about each other
keep the table
of that meta knowledge is
really hard to hold in memory
yeah
I wanted to ask one other
thing for like well everyone's
here so we
agreed that probably front loading
all of the negative the undesirable aspects
going into a or
in a new relationship
maybe divulging all
of the bad things instantly is not the best idea
where does that go in when you're pursuing a new one
someone who is
as far as you know not aware of your interest
what do people think
would be a good is a good policy there
so
when you say if they are not like
aware of your interest are you talking about
telling them that you like them
or telling them
or possibly negative things about yourself
both right now
there are separate questions
and I'd be interested to hear about
either one that's more useful
I've made a habit
of just telling people that
I like them and
it's like hey
no pressure I'd like to go out or anything
but like thank you
and if you ever did want to go for your day
I'd be down for that and that has worked pretty well
and I think that
some of that though is that I still
present female
and probably
unless threatening
then somebody who presents male
might be
so I know that
that might be difficult for some people to do
and it took me a while to be able to do it
and it does really hurt being rejected too
the first few times I tried this
the person was just like oh okay thanks
for telling me and then
I was like so that's a no right
I still haven't heard whether it's a yes or no
but
you do it enough times and then like you get
guesses sometimes
and that balances it out
I've seen
I've had like internal questions
about that in the rejection direction as well
I've had one rejection ever
that was completely intellectually
satisfying in the extent that I was aware
I was made aware of the other person's reason
and while I disagreed with it
I didn't find the need
I was not compelled to dispute
or probe further
when I was in college
and I had started on nootropics
and the person I went out with
was a nursing student
and they
we had conversation about that
and they talked about their job and I talked about
the nootropics stuff that I was
interacting with at the time
and the
explanation that I got was
I greatly enjoyed this date
but this thing that you do
seems like a reckless willingness to self-medicate
that makes me doubt you as a partner
and on the one hand
that definitely hits close to home
and I disagreed with it
but that's also
a real reason
