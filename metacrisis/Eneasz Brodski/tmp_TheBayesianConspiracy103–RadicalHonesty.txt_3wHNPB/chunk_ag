yeah I'll definitely
make a note of that
I just want to wrap up
with this little I had a second
minute it's about the relationship
of radical honesty
to rationality
where
I think that this matters to
me I guess as a rationalist
because
it kind of relates to that whole concept of
guess versus ask a culture I forget if we've had
an episode about that exactly but I think we've talked
about it where rationalists
tend to prefer the ask a culture
word guess culture is more
the game theoretical providing like
plausible deniability excuses
for why people might do things that will help them
always like signal correctly
it's costly
I think in terms of again having to juggle
a whole bunch of different threads of like what's true
what you're allowed to say is true
what things people have told you that are true
but that you're not allowed to tell these people but you can tell
these people like
the
I guess like a core tendon of rationality
is that the truth is good
and it's good to pursue it so
like
I don't know how much
I want to make that like a really strong
moral imperative
because again I do think that
radical honesty is kind of
it's a choice that worked great for some people
probably people on the autism spectrum
especially
and I think
some people really dislike it
and they really enjoy playing signaling games
and that probably wouldn't be the best
you know style of
relationship for that kind of person
and that's fine
another thing is like
I think the Slickstart Codex
surveys
and really some other surveys have shown like
rationalist values they tend to have
openness like effective communication
and less regard for taboo
traditions and signaling games in general
so those are kind of the reasons I brought it up
and I guess
the other thing is that rationality
endorses this like idea of overcoming bias
which
learning not to lie to yourself
in order to be more effective
and less internally conflicted
and I think that this can help you
learn to do that internally
and also applying that in dialogue with others
can also help you just be less conflicted
pursue your goals
more directly so forth and so on
as far as
the signaling games
and the filtering that goes on
in a lot of normal social interaction
I would add that when I
started attending physical
rationalist events I
started to notice a lot more of my
bad social habits and kind of got better
at doing the baseline
socialization because of it
I don't have
I've had a hard time putting it into words
but
being in an environment where I wasn't getting any of the
I get unconscious cues to do a lot of them
but historically I've been a lot of filtering
and
sort of meta
reasoning about the conversation as it's going on
and
the
greater emphasis
on this authentic social interaction
in rationalist circles
caused me to notice what cues I wasn't
getting anymore
I didn't notice them when they were cues that I was getting constantly
but I
like the stare that doesn't exist
at the top of the staircase that you don't notice
until you trip
I only noticed it when I expected it
and it wasn't there
what kinds of cues
out of curiosity
specific things that I would normally
go out of my way to
never disclose to someone
I wasn't already in a romantic
relationship with
like
I have had a
life with a lot of interesting stories
and some of them are more interesting to certain
types of people than others
and I definitely
I've gotten better
in some small way
at identifying those categories of people
and targeting my
interactions accordingly
it's been healthy
I'm definitely still not very good at it
it's been healthy to notice
ways of getting better at it
I think felt this too
that
my brain does some sort of default
understanding of what are the norms here and then how much of myself
do I have to conceal or put filters around
so that I fit in with those norms
and that
in rationalist spaces
I can basically just turn these filters off
and not be projecting a version of myself
that is
more honest, not in the sense of
like truths and falsehoods
but in the sense of like what I would be like
in the absence of social pressures to act
otherwise I think it's maybe
carried back over to that like
experiencing being in a more
sort of safe environment to be myself
lets me
express more myself
in the everyday
world and be like oh you know
I can just be a little bit weird and that's like alright
I think that's definitely one of the
biggest psychological benefits
for me of
ask or teleculture versus
guest culture
something about the guest culture
that I just wanted to comment on from your
your three choices that you give people
about what kind of
communication they want is the
first one of like
socially acceptable performance
performative response
is that
as soon as you give someone
that as an option
they can no longer do guest culture
about it which is like if they would have chosen
that now they have to explicitly
choose it and that's like
especially with the way it's phrased it's like obviously
not socially allowed
and I think that this kind of thing
can trip guest culture people up
okay I'm honestly
a way that I just mostly find entertaining
but I still I might have to
I should work on a rephrasing of that
something like how much effort do you want to go
into not working not into not hurting
your feelings
actually I'm curious what
is the distribution of responses to this
most people
most people ask for the second one
I've gotten
one request for the third one and
about three for the socially
acceptable performative response
which I find trust me confused the crap
out of me at the time
for a reason that I didn't
notice until Phoenix just put words to it which is
once you know that yourself
and we're getting
to the sequence post but there is a sequence post that points out
once you recognize that an option
is self deceiving you can't
really enthusiastically pick it anymore
yeah
