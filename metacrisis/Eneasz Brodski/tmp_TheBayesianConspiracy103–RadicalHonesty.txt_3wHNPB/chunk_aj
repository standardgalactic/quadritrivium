the on average
I should not expect my confidence would change
because if I could forecast
my future beliefs then I would just
now believe whatever I thought I would believe in the future on average
since one of the
classical ways of introducing people to Bayes Theorem
is the test for a disease
that's got some prevalence in the general population
and the test is X% accurate
there's a good
there's a pretty good chance
given whatever accuracy of the test
the positive result means actual infection
and there's a pretty good chance that a negative result
means no actual infection
but the when you
if you run this on everyone
the probability that
you're still going to end up with
exactly the general population prevalence of the disease
that probability is not affected
by your testing it
okay
yeah that
that much makes sense
yeah
this realization could take a load off your mind
because then you don't have to worry about
how to interpret facts anymore
and ends with human psychology so screwed up
I think
which actually
I remember kind of
go ahead
I think I can sometimes utilize this a little bit
to make myself feel a little bit more rational
and do something like okay
I query my brain as to
what I expect to think in five years
about this decision
if my expectation of what I think
of what future wiser me thinks about this
is different than what I currently think
then maybe I try and update on
what current me thinks to more closely resemble
the future version of me that I think
has better information
like sometimes I think my brain is better
at forecasting what I will believe in the future
than it is at accurately having
an appraisal of what probability
I should assign something now
although I feel like in the spirit of this
you would have to then sort of
also have
the future you
that was wrong and
become both of them
yeah like
I think sometimes I can say like
I think maybe
half of all future me's think this is a bad decision
and half of them think it was a good decision
so I probably shouldn't be 90% confident
it's good right now I should really only think it's 50%
oh yeah
sure
this reminds me of the practice of doing
a pre-mortem
where
you're trying to come up with a plan
and then you're like
I think this plan is going to work for these reasons
but if I imagine
in the future
the plan has failed what happened
it can be easier to conceptualize it that way
and then you can kind of go back to the present
and alter your plan
that kind of way is to take into account
the things that went wrong
yeah I think
this is another theme of
maybe your brain is trying to like you sometimes
about
things that it would like to believe
and so you're starting this project
and parts of your brain are all very excited
and are telling you that nothing can possibly go wrong
but the part of your brain that looks into the future
or conditions on things having gone wrong
haven't quite gotten this memo
and so if you can ask other parts of your brain
then you can maybe circumvent
the parts that are trying to give you confirmation bias
and update your probabilities
that are not true-steeking
mm-hmm
that reminds me of another thing
that's tangentially related but uh
when earlier we were talking
about radical honesty
and poly I was remembering that
we haven't done this yet but uh
Minix and I heard in the multi-amory
podcast which I'm also going to plug
about the idea of doing a
relationship uh
what was it called a break up agreement
yeah it was when we were talking
about earlier in this discussion uh how you
break the news to someone
that you want to break up with them
I like the idea of
we have a break up agreement where we will break up
if these things become the case
and then that way that softens the blow
and like you don't get to argue about it anymore
if these things have become the case
then you're like well we both signed this contract
if you know of a list of example
break up contracts that sounds very interesting
and I would find it cool to read
yeah I also want to read that
that might exist I might be able to find it
and like it that sounds constructive
um I'm also
I remember uh during
this podcast's polyamory episode
uh that Katrina took an opposite
view on codifying thing or not
opposite took a different
and specific disagreeing
on at least the specific point view of codifying
things like that which may also
be worth being exposed to
you said that was just from a previous one
this podcast episodes
yes um before
before Jess was on uh Steven and Yash
and Katrina did a two part episode on polyamory
and I can't remember which part this comes up in
but uh
Katrina mentioned
a more skeptical attitude toward
codified rules on that sort of thing
that may also be worth listening to
I um generally
endorse not having codified
rules like
um
in regard to
trying to think of an example like uh
you can never come home like you can go on a date
but you like can't come home uh after
11 p.m. or something like that
I think that there's like obvious failure
modes for your rules like that
I think something like a breakup agreement I would say
is uh
the fact that both of you read it and that it's a living document
um
yeah I think
makes it less that kind of thing
I think I generally do agree with Katrina's view on that
yeah I think the being updated
makes it much more sort of
healthy in that respect but anytime you make some kind of
commitment like this
in the long term you are
in some sense saying
there's a thing that I worry my future self will do
and I want to
I like sort of don't trust my future self's beliefs
when they are trying to do this
so in some sense you're sort of like
you are distrusting some version of you with more information
that has come to some new feelings
or decisions so that's like at least a thing
to be wary of
yeah I think the breakup agreement thing is
is pretty categorically different
from other kinds of rules and agreements
in intimate relationships
because uh by its nature
it is like inherently
unenforceable because you're ending the
relationship um
and I think the point of them is
is more just like
here's what I intend to do
uh
and just like knowing that about each other can be
uh
it's very least help you
do a bit of planning even if like you know
that this kind of thing isn't enforceable
and can be something of a
comfort in like knowing that this person
