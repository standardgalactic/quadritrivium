and I was
that's a good signal that you might not
get along anyway
on the other hand
someone that honest about that sort of thing
I probably could have gotten along with
but yeah I was going to say
I really appreciate that response
which hers or hers
hers and that
it was
that's the kind of response I always
want to that kind of thing
like actually honest and informative
and like possibly actionable
yeah
yeah that's right
I don't think I've ever gotten a rejection
that
was the real reason
why they were rejecting me and that was always a bit frustrating
yeah
I don't I feel like
if I were in
the rejecting position of this
I would want to sort of ask for
consent or something like
I can give you a more brutally honest version
but I feel like someone might feel compelled
to say well yes I want to hear the truth
even if maybe they don't
maybe this is a baseless worry
but yeah because that's kind of on them
if they've said yes and then they can't handle
the truth well they said yes
but I don't know
I would be surprised if someone said
no I don't want to hear it
that's actually
a hack that I use pretty often
that I really enjoy
especially
if I think something is going to be a bit uncomfortable
for someone to hear
I ask them
if they want to hear it and provide enough kind of categorical information
for them to be able to
make some reasonable
kind of decision
and
mostly what this seems to get me is
that
almost every time the person says yes
but they have the choice to say no
and then if they say yes
because they have the choice
they then no longer feel like
this is being forced upon them
at least as much
and
this tends to result in people responding to
uncomfortable honesty much better
I was going to bring that up
hanging around Phoenix
has helped me also pick up this habit of doing the
would you like to hear
some data about me
or would you like to hear some feedback about
something that might be hard for you to hear
right now
asking before divulging
stuff when you get the sense that it might be
awkward
I think is a really good way to deal with a lot of the discomfort
of radical honesty in general
and sometimes my answer is like
I'm in emotional distress right now
let's try again in an hour
sometimes you watch the person
and you're like are you sure
and then you think about it
and you're like well maybe not right now
or
sometimes I've said yes but can you be very
gentle and kind
or maybe you said
it's a compliment or something
I've offered people
do you want a socially acceptable version
that won't give you anything useful
do you want
something actionable but where I'm taking care not to
still taking some care not to hurt your feelings
or do you want unfiltered stream of consciousness
I like that
I like that and also you said it quickly enough
that I forgot parts of the list
can you say that again slightly slower
do you want a socially acceptable
performative response that
won't give you any information you can act on
do you want
a response where I'm trying to give you
actionable information that may upset you
but will still go out of my way
not to just hurt your feelings
or do you want unfiltered stream of consciousness
I like that
I like that too
I also often try to encourage people
to do unfiltered stream of consciousness
when I think they're
filtering themselves too much around me
I think that's another
a benefit of being in a relationship
with someone who practices radical honesty
is like telling people
I won't hold it against you if you say something
and you're like no wait not that
maybe this
actually let's just drop this whole third
how about this other thing
that's the kind of conversation
that I actually am fine with and enjoy
I think a lot of people
model that kind of conversation as
it's going to be too confusing or frustrating
for the person to listen to
or that you have to absolutely stand by
every statement that you make
even if sometimes you blurt stuff out
you're like no not like that exactly
that's the kind of thing I wish I could think of an example for
speaking of difficult
relationship conversations
we've talked about
the beginnings of them and during them
but one thing that I've done when
sometimes a romantic partner will
say like oh can we talk about
a somewhat serious thing and then reassure me
that it's not a breakup conversation and I want to say like
no wait don't actually tell me that
because then when it is I'll be like
I will accidentally have been given this information
at a time that I didn't actually want to hear it
because you know I'd rather hear that
breakup conversation in a like
prepared emotional state
yeah
yeah I think there's this
that connects again with the like
telling people things they want to hear
kind of a rule where
I think like
timing things so that like the person
can actually receive it I think is pretty reasonable
you just have to be careful to not
keep waiting
forever for like the opportune time
and then never actually saying it
oh yeah one of the like
finer arts of radical honesty
is getting a sense of
when people are more amenable to it
like I think Phoenix said I keep trying to have a rule
where it's like we're not going to do hard conversations
after 11 p.m.
we keep failing at it but every time we do it's a bad idea
it was a lot of your kind of emotional processing
yeah I'm way more insecure
after 11 p.m. and trans out
I
met a note
I think we're at about like an hour and ten minutes of
actual audio
and we were
maybe going to talk about sequence posts
yes do we want to
start shifting over in that direction
give people a chance to bring up any more important
here's a radical honesty topics
yeah one short thing
that does not work well in audio format
to talk about at length
but which I think is worth a plug
is that my favorite webcomic is called
subnormality and often
features interesting complex characters
having the sorts of
genuine conversations with each other that
one might imagine in a society of
people who practice something like radical honesty
if we can include a link to a
a comic called subnormality tells the truth
I think this is maybe a has some interesting
templates for like conversations that might
not happen if people were quite as reticent
as they often are in
existing society
