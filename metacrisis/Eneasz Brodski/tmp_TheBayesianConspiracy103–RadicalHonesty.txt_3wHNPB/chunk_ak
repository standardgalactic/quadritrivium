intends to not just
ghost you if they're gonna break up with you
yeah for example
that's fair I can see value there
it's it's not so much it's not a
pre-commitment that okay if this happens we're never gonna see
each other again it's okay if this
happens then
I have the option that you can't
protest to break off at that point as we've
agreed which is a different
and more
I am more a different
whole different paradigm to which I'm more sympathetic
yeah and not to get too far down this
uh a bit of the interesting
topic but it's probably time that
we think of patron
oh yeah we've been going for a bit
uh Phoenix did you want to thank the patron
yeah I'm scrolling scrolling down
I
we want to thank
Roman
who
increased their donation from four to five
dollars which I'm going to interpret as
meaning that the show has gotten at least 25
percent better than it was before
yeah
I am gonna go with
that too because
that makes me feel good
so thank you Roman
and
does anybody have anything else they want to say before
we sign off
anything to plug
also
scroll through my list of things to say
he's got quite a list
um Drake's
expanded mind space has
a file of these things
the remaining items on the list I think are
not especially
conversation worthy I've gotten through most stuff
I'm good
yeah I was thinking about
I forgot to look up
things that I'm just like temporarily calling
honesty games
I don't know if there's an actual term for this kind of thing
but like circling is kind of
an honesty game and I remembered
another one hot seat which is neat
and I want to find more of these
and I wasn't prepared
to have a list of them on this episode
if I find a list I'll share it somewhere
also maybe a solicitation for listeners
to share good ones that they have played
and one discord community
that I'm part of has
a thing that you can opt into
where someone
elects to do an honesty hour
where you just commit to answering questions that are thrown at you
and
right yeah I think that's basically hot seat
but on discord
I think it's a good thing
yeah
okay
I feel like I
had some things that I want to plug but I'll remember
I'll do it next time
I'll just edit your own voice
oh I did remember a thing
I wanted to plug
this is
only this is somewhat related
to sort of difficulty of communicating
romantic things to people which is that
reciprocity.io
reciprocity.io
is a website in which
you are shown all of your Facebook friends
who also use this service
and two check marks
one for would you like to go on a date sometime
and one for do you want to hang out soon
and if you and the other person
both check each other's respective boxes
you are notified and so
this is a thing where if everyone used it
maybe 30% of all social dilemmas
would have been solved
yeah I wish that there was a third one
that was just has logged into
reciprocity like within the past month
because my list is mostly full of people
that I don't think ever check it
and I also often forget that it exists
they do give you a chance to
maybe this service is a ping for anyone
who is using it to go and update their
checkboxes
they give you the option to include a blurb
and mine always includes I last logged in
on this date
nice
that's useful
I might have to start doing that in some other places
I should do that on my ad monos box too
like I last updated my ad
this feedback solicitation on
yeah
yeah I like it
alright
I think that that is
all we have for this episode
of the Bayesian conspiracy
yeah
bye listeners we love you
I'm not actually going to
do that
but I am going to actually cause
yeah thanks for
also I'm just like praying
that when I click stop
audacity does not crash
oh yeah I'm not touching any buttons until grey comes over
and makes sure that they're the right buttons to click
I'm going to cut our audacity recording at this point
so just a second
alright the thing to do is click
stop and then save
