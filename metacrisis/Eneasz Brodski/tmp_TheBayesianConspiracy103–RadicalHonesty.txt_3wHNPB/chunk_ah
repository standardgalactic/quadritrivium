you can't pretend
to not be self deceiving
by doing it no no really I've totally
deceived myself
on that note shall we move on to sequences
let's do it
okay
our sequences this
week are
absence of evidence is evidence
of absence
and conservation of expected evidence
so
absence of evidence
the sequence begins with
quote from Robin Dawes rational
choice in an uncertain world
the quote talks about the internment
of Japanese-Americans during World War II
when California
Governor Earl Warren testified before
congressional hearing a questioner
pointed out there had been no sabotage
or any other type of espionage by the Japanese-Americans
up to that time
Warren responded I take the view
that this lack of subversive activities
the most ominous sign in our whole situation
it convinces me more
that perhaps any other factor that the sabotage
we are to get the fifth column activities
are to get
our time just like Pearl Harbor was timed
I believe we're just being lulled into a false sense
of security
and by the way a fifth column
that's referenced a few times in the sequence
it's just a group of people who undermine
a larger group from within
Eleazar says
consider Warren's argument
from a Bayesian perspective
where seeing evidence for something means we should
give our hypotheses higher probability
shouldn't the opposite also be true
using Bayes theorem
Eleazar lays out the math behind the Japanese-American
sabotage question
he says let E stand for observation of sabotage
negation of E for no sabotage
H1
for the Japanese-American fifth column hypothesis
and H2 for the hypothesis
that no fifth column exists
the conditional probability
P of E given H
is our confidence in E of H were true
a quote whatever the likelihood
one would do no sabotage
the probability of P
naughty
with H1
it won't be as large as the likelihood
that there's no sabotage
given that there's no fifth column
the probability of P
of naughty
given H2
so observing a lack of sabotage increases the probability
that no fifth column exists
so he says this doesn't prove no fifth column exists
but the probability theory
there's evidence
absence of evidence is always evidence
of absence
in real life a cause might not
reliably produce signs of itself
but the absence of a thing definitely won't produce any signs
and at the end
Eleazar brings up the fallacy of the gaps
in the fossil record
pointing out that because fossils form very rarely
it's feelable to trumpet the absence
of a weakly permitted observation
when so many other strong positives of observations
already are recorded
in that same vein
if there are no positive observations at all
then it might be time to worry
so hence the Fermi paradox
and he ends this by reiterating
your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more confused
by fiction than by reality
if you're equally good at explaining any outcome
you have zero knowledge
I forget if this was the first time
he ever actually
I feel like this was a quote that was
maybe a sequence or somewhere else
but I might be misremembering
just because I remember the quote so strongly
and I didn't remember that it belonged to the sequence
I think this is the
earliest use of that particular quote
or
is the noticing confusion post earlier
in the original sequences than this one
he definitely talks about noticing confusion
a lot
yeah I just don't know if it was this
this like
your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more confused
maybe because I heard it in methods of rationality
yeah because
Harry's conversation with Professor Quirrell
and Diagon Alley references this
and a couple of other very Yidkowski things
and
the thing
which in that vein reading the quote
from
Governor Warren
that
was in support of the internment made me think
I can't believe this you can't have every possible
observation confirm your theory
yeah
some quick google food suggests
that the sentence
your strength as a rationalist is your ability to be more confused
by fiction than reality
than by reality was
first made by Elegy Yidkowski
in a last wrong post two days
prior so this is part of a sequence
about this
about this notion but it is not literally the first
post
so you might have discussed it on like
the previous episode or something
yeah
I want to say that there's also a footnote
at the end of this one
where he says if any of this
sounds confusing see my discussion of Bayesian updating
towards the end of the machine and the ghost
the third volume of rationality
from AI to zombies
so I'll put a link to that too
I guess
the main thing I see here
that I take out of this is
that
lack of evidence for something
when contextualized
where like if you're doing something
that you would expect to generate
evidence for this thing if it existed
and you're like generating a bunch
of other evidence about other things
and
like you keep not seeing evidence
for a particular thing I think that
like that whole being there
sort of like shows up in the shape
of data points around it
and that shape is evidence
of the thing not being there
I think it depends
on
sort of how far the hypothesis
is sticking its neck out about a particular
piece of evidence
like until the LIGO
detected gravitational waves
we had an absence of that particular
evidence for general relativity
but we had a whole bunch of
other evidence for general relativity
that meant that the absence of this extremely
unusual phenomenon shouldn't be taken as
strong evidence against
but when we did finally observe it
this is something that's blindingly improbable
by under any other theory of physics
that we know about
so it's a strongly predicted
rather than
the absence of the detection was a
weakly permitted negative evidence
and the eventual detection was a strongly
predicted positive evidence
one lens
that I think is useful in thinking about this
is sort of imagining possible worlds
and so if we have
a world in which there is
no
no subterfuge by Japanese
Americans and one in which
