that they don't drink. They end up killing themselves. Actually, the hypothesis is that
alcohol provides a social lubricant and the people who don't drink tend not to have the
strong social connections, which are essential effectively in protecting their own life,
having the friends and the support structure that they need to handle the life's issues.
Why do you personally not drink? I don't like the taste.
I'd like to clarify my invitation to get together for a drink. It can be a drink of any liquid.
Yeah, yeah. Any non-lethal liquid, yes.
Well, we're happy to. Yeah, well, hey, that sounds great. And once again, thanks for talking
with us. I really look forward to reading through more of the atheist ethicists.
My pleasure. All right, have a good evening. You too. Thanks, bye.
You
