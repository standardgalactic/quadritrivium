consciousness to the problem and if there's anything nonviolent that i can do that can help
mitigate their publicity i'd be down to do something like that that i wouldn't have been able to do
had you not told me that this happened so it puts me in the bizarre mental position of
wanting non-violence and hating violence but realizing that it may be a necessary thing
that has to be there and i don't want to admit that speaking of non-violence in gondi just real
quick i i have a my my bone to pick with with gondian pacifism is that his whole approach
wouldn't have worked if his enemy had been crueler right so like the whole idea of like well i'm
gonna be nonviolent only works so like say if it's you know a small town only works like on a personal
level or a small subsection level until some person is prepared to be violent will come and
stop the violent the the aggressor right yeah so it's it's not a generalizable thing it i don't
know i guess it seems like they're they're dodging a hard question and uh just putting
pushing the problem to somebody else if the occupational forces just didn't care and we're
willing to wipe everyone out then if they win the nazis yeah exactly and not in not britain right
yeah so and here we are back at nazis yep godwind i mean not really because we've been talking about
it since the very beginning but you know what i mean that's right do we have anything else
so so recently there was the women's march and i know that uh there's been talk about
organizing mass scale protests every month i'm very curious to see how that goes marches are
another wonderful way yeah to non-violently resist and good on the women's march the largest
in history yes 2.5 million people oh god yeah no it's like across the nation huge turnout like
like this is like like like just to see how much of the country is resisting the new presidency
and and marching in favor of women's rights like it's it's pretty amazing i had a little bit of
my faith in humanity restored just slightly upon seeing that i went to the one in denver for a few
hours from saturday morning and it was awesome how was that it was fun i mean there were there were
fun science people but but what i really wanted to see was to kind of gauge the the feeling of the
crowd yeah and i also really was looking to see if there were any counter protesters and i didn't
see anybody i was i was wondering if there would be any sort of you know assaults against them or
something which i mean you know you're kind of putting yourself out there to get your ass kicked
if you're gonna go out there and uh i don't know but i'm not saying you should i'm just saying you
you're accepting that level of risk uh but i didn't see anything like that everyone was cool um
it was just i tried to get up i went up on like the the hill at the capitol building and then when
they moved to the 16th street mall i went up to like the third floor there and just people as far as
you could see it was huge um yeah everyone was peaceful and it was it was nice uh dude i wish i
would have been there at least an hour or two you know i mean if they're doing it again every every
i imagine uh turnout will probably diminish but you know that you guys people probably kept some
other signs so yeah fun stuff good on you yeah i mean it was more just curiosity i don't even
really know what their platform is i did look it up and they have like six rough platforms that
they're like you know what we're pro we're pro choice we're apparently anti anti choice there
there was there was the uh there was a sentiment to where isn't anti anti choice the same thing
as pro choice yes but they're called but they were anti uh anti someone else making the choice for
you what am i trying to say they were anti what's the other side called they're anti pro life people
they explicitly didn't want them to come oh uh there there were some pro life groups that reached
out and said hey we're we want to support and join in on this and then they were like yeah sure and
then people were like are you fucking kidding they're against our right to do stuff like oh yeah
never mind guys that doesn't make sense yeah i don't understand why how a pro life well because
they're also pro life against trump still oh sorry okay i was talking about specifically like
reproductive rights like like how would the well okay that it was a multi-purpose march so that
makes sense yeah a lot okay part of the march was and that's the thing the science ranged from
everything from trump has tiny hands yeah like yeah just get your you know get your laws out of
vagina and stuff and so right it it wasn't like a unified purpose it was but it was a general thing
and to me it was mainly about uh the the impression that i got was that it wasn't so much about any of
these specific platforms there was also concern for lgbt immigrants and stuff like that um it was
just solidarity with women and i'm like yeah that sounds like a message i can get behind yeah it's an
anti-trump and women's rights yeah the anti-trump part was interesting i mean i i don't have a
flushed out opinion on this but it is interesting like the idea that we're gonna rally against
the democratic process i mean i i'm probably i'm probably more anti-democracy than the average
person but i think they're yeah well the scent is part of the democratic process though it is it
is part of the democratic and and they're i'd be willing to bet that it's more it's it's less
protesting the democratic process and more the protesting specifically trump and the policies
that he has been enacting in the last well i think the women's march was was that on the 21st
yeah it was a whole weekend right it was saturday might have been the whole weekend but i think
the first the major was the 21st on saturday but but we've i don't know like i haven't i haven't
fact-checked this a hundred percent but i mean supposedly there have been some policies signed
off on by trump already that are very troubling um the i mean so i unfortunately i'm still kind
of like coming to grips with this i never really processed the possibility of him becoming president
until like 9 30 on november 8th yep and then right there right right through friday afternoon i'm
like oh someone will probably kill him at inauguration okay it's like maybe this one actually
happened and then it did and so like then i'm i'm getting i don't know four or five news articles
a day where it's like oh president trump signed in the keystone pipeline with an executive order
president trump signed to that bill that every republican signs that that keeps american foreign
aid from going to organizations that are pro-abortion yeah so that that might have been what you're
thinking of but that's the only that's the only anti-woman thing that i can think of that he's
done so far yeah was it is it is it the gate it's like the gag rule it's like if the so much is
mentioned oh no that that's that's a that's a domestic thing and that's always been a symbolic
that goes back and forth in fact george bush the first paper he signed clinton the first paper he
signed yeah they keep on doing it and they're doing it that doesn't actually do anything this was
specifically duos gives i think point zero one eight percent of its gdp to foreign aid this bill
kept any of that money going to from going to charities that uh help with like birth control
or abortion or anything like that okay so is it point one eight percent of gdp or point one eight
percent of point zero one eight percent maybe of gdp or of the government's budget uh government's
budget okay i think okay i thought i'll double check i these were in our ea episode um they're in
that also in singers uh the life you can save his book you have the shit that's been coming out of
the trump administration just in the last few days he still freaks me out like the fact that it's
actually affordable health care act the gagging the epa yep oh yeah by friday well he the climate
change page on the on the uh washington's on white house website was gone well that is also no
longer in spanish available in spanish that well that well the reason for that and i'm not i'm not
saying that you know what anyway no the reason for that was uh the the apparently we're clearing
everything for the new the new administration so like uh there's a new domain called obama
white house dot gov that had all that original content the twitter account potas president
of the united states was also moved to potas 44 for because they had all the obama's tweets right
so it was basically clearing the record for trump to put whatever i will say that like regardless
i i wouldn't be surprised if there wasn't a climate change section there later or
a lgbt section there later i mean well we'll see if those things make a comeback i'm kind of
curious exactly it's uh if they do that'd be nice i don't know how everything else made it and those
didn't make the cut but maybe they wanted to put their own spin on it and not have obama's spin
they cleared all the main like the like the central content everything but bare bones
is basically what it was oh okay i didn't know that there was no nuance to that well fingers crossed
that in the next couple weeks they put their shit together yeah and i can i can lighten my opinion
a little bit no i'm just i'm hoping things like it's gone on record trump's gone on record saying
that he thinks that climate change is a chinese hoax meant to undermine our manufacturing base so
oh there's that that reminds me my favorite sign at the at the rally so i did i also just kind of
enjoyed the experience of seeing like in public in a large crowd signs that had the word pussy and
cunt on them and like everyone loved them my favorite sign though was a big blow up of one of
trump's tweets that was this is appalling we should march on washington to to fight this
travesty nice it was it was when obama was in auger either won the last election or was inaugurated
and perfect so someone was carrying that around i thought that was my favorite sign i think my
favorite cheeky statement about the whole um nazi punch thing is uh it wasn't a punch it was an
alt handshake nice damn dude how do you even come out and just nakedly assert things that can be
proven false like within minutes really i mean it's that's that seriously that i i hate comparisons
to 1984 because it's such a fucking cliche at this point yeah or like or like or like or like
comparing the violent parts of the protest to like um our nation's independence yeah completely
different context but even just the fact that they come out and say something which is nakedly
false and easily provable so and just stick to it anyway it's bizarre you know part of it might
actually be a calculated move i mean think about it everyone's talking about how what's his butt
is saying that the crowd is biggest in history and no one's talking about what trump's actually
well i'm seeing people talking about what he's doing too some but i think that this is a large
percentage of conversation is is here talking about this obviously bullshit thing that's just
there to you know throw this out to us to fight over and complain about for the next week while he
goes off and does stupid shit which i mean it's obviously going to be like a distraction like a
distraction tactic basically yeah i think i mean i i don't know what the level of you never really
know like the level that these people are playing at but then if it wasn't calculated move that to
me would be what they're probably trying to do it might be giving them too much credit i mean
i think it's just kind of like a side effect but memes get circulated people just repost things
because it makes them feel good i i feel like the majority of it has this added side effect of like
yeah it's also kind of an obfuscation or not really an obfuscation but just a distraction
it's kind of incidental so but hey maybe they're all just masterminds i don't know i mean i don't
know what's just scarier the fact that the possibility that he's a secret mastermind or
he's got masterminds working for him or that he is as fucking idiotic as he seems
both are pretty scary i think i almost prefer masterminds he's just so extremely shrewd he's
just like so good at this that like he knows how to play crowd perfectly i don't i don't have a lot
of faith i don't have a lot of faith that trump himself is is a secret mastermind but he might
have hired masterminds but i think i prefer mastermind as opposed to just like blundering through
for the through the world in the most powerful seat in the world okay for the next four years i
think i'd rather have you know some sinister torch lit meetings with people hoods or a villain you
can respect because they're just smart right i think well and and like a smart villain probably
doesn't want to destroy the world whereas an idiot might wouldn't know if they're doing it right yeah
so yeah i mean you gotta think this is the fucking god damn this is the guy who you know
wants to restart the nuclear arms race to show the world that the os is still on top and this is
the guy who announced this dismiss things from the cia disney but but but my thing is like not
only is that the stupidest thing to say in the world but he also announced this to the world
on his twitter feed yeah and so like this is the caliber of person we're dealing with i consider him
the twitter in chief now really in chief that's that's what he does you know but when you made the
point that you did not see the trump thing coming i also did not see the trump thing coming i guess
since i didn't see the trump thing coming that uh despite how far off i think this whole fascism
taking over the government is on the other hand when trump first jumped in the primaries i didn't
think he would last two months i thought he was a clown and sort of every yep yeah but but he he was
running up against other clowns i guess so and he just had enough like machismo to kind of pull
it off he was just so supremely confident in his but the fact that i was so wrong about that means
i should probably consider that i may be very wrong about other things that i think are just
absolutely crazy well like the fascist taking over next month well yeah i mean it's i i there's
obviously more to it than that it's it's like i would i'd be careful not to compare two very
unlike things like like this is obvious this seems obvious you know i made a mistake here
therefore i might make a mistake here you know it's that's true i mean there is there was at
least a road that donald trump could potentially use to get to the white house even if we didn't
think he would take it whereas there's no road that i can see at all that the fascists will take
over the government the other thing too is that just because you're wrong about one improbable
thing doesn't necessarily increase the odds of any given improbable thing right that you also
sign the mobility to happening right yeah yeah those are isolated out do you think sometimes
they are you you seemed like you disagreed with me do you think there's a viable road for fascists
to take over the government that's see that's actually i really am undecided on that one i
i know that's kind of my that's been kind of my default but i like to be as informed as possible
before i really can have enough conviction to be like yeah i think that's a thing i mean on the
one hand i feel like a lot of it seems like a lot of people at least over the last couple
months have been very like hey if we look to history these are some patterns that have emerged
from history and and they kind of like match that to what's going on now and they're kind of like
this is the beginning of a fascist regime and i don't know if i entirely buy that
it's it's one of those things like like i'm just not very well versed in history i don't know a
whole lot about it it was never really an area of interest of mine so i can't really look at it from
that context right but it it does and again you know you go on the internet there's a lot
there's a high noise to information ratio in general you know they're like people post these
think pieces where there's they're like here's here's the road to fascism and here's like yes
trumps a fascist and i i don't know i i i like to be as accurate as possible so i have a hard time
taking those things at face value because they're they're often from people who have a very like
anti-authority like as a matter of principle mindset i've witnessed them say other things
that make me think a little bit or i mean i mean kind of and i think i mean like it gives me pause
and i i have a you know i'm skeptical what they're saying but i don't want i also don't want to be
like oh whatever it's a benign presidency and then suddenly it's too late and all these horrible
things have happened and i mean we've already seen in the last few days like all a benign presidency
oh no no i'm saying like like months ago people were were putting forth that idea like oh it's
probably gonna be a benign presidency nothing bad's gonna happen that's sort of where i
was i was think Stockholm syndromeed right like i'm like well fuck it we're already staring down
the barrel of it hopefully he's not gonna be as bad as i thought he was the day before he
became before he was elected right and there's and there's a general sentiment of like you know
like like you want to be wrong about like it's like well i think he's gonna be disastrous as a
president but i'd like to be incorrect about that because that's objectively better if he does
if he does good if he does well then then awesome then i was wrong and that's great that i was wrong
right we've already seen now that he's he's taken a seat in the last few days it's the people who are
like let's give him a chance or kind of eating their words now because i also had like non-zero
probabilities that in his inaugural address is going to be like you guys are all fucking idiots
i'm not a politician he was just he was going to just quit right then just give everyone the finger
so now the all none of those have happened i've already seen the words and headlines you know
president trump gave an executive order and i'm like oh my god there's no such thing as a benign
presidency this is so i'm already kind of like still processing this on a real level
it's terrifying did you hear his inauguration address i read it yeah when when he delivered
the line i am never gonna let you down i saw the same thing oh i heard someone i i didn't see that
part but i everyone was like do you just rick roll this i seriously thought the next line was
going to be something about uh giving us up or deserting us yeah because i'll never give you
i might have i might have shared the speech of my i i might have i think i would have loved
that is what i'm trying to say i mean to come out of kind of the the city it's math would have been
so funny yeah i i did read it i mean it was the exact benign bullshit that every politician says
plus some stuff that you know i can see why some people would find very appealing the idea of you
