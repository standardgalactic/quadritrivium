So it's interesting.
I was just reading about some history of this actually happening to people.
There was a guy, ah, I forget his name now, I should have written it down, but a leader
in KKK circles and he went to a liberal arts college to get his credentials, you know how
sometimes creationists go and get a biology degree so they can say, I am a, you know,
PhD in biology and I say evolution is bullshit, that kind of thing.
But some of his fellow students figured out who he was and that he was a, this, I'm not
sure if neo-nazi is the same as KKK, are they the same thing?
Well, KKK are white supremacists.
So like in a historical context, no, they're not the same, but I mean, there's definitely,
I would say there's quite a bit overlap between what people consider neo-naziism and the KKK.
Yeah, so he was a white supremacist and when his fellow students found out, instead of
attacking him, the Jewish students started inviting him over for dinner and after several
months of this, and he went and after several months of this, he broke down and realized
that he'd been told lies the whole time and he dropped out and became a normal person
and started fighting against the fascists, which I mean, it was interesting, there were
three or four different cases like that and obviously that's not going to happen all the
time, but it can happen and the important part isn't necessarily that you're trying
to convince the neo-nazi to change his mind because you're probably not going to convince
him with an argument any more than you're going to convince him with a punch, but at
least that prevents society from devolving into riots in the streets like they had in
Weimar, Germany, before the big rise and you are having the conversation for the people
around that are looking and seeing are these people on the left who proclaim tolerance
and peace among mankind just as bad as the right wing that they say they hate as soon
as they see someone who they violently disagree with, they go right into the punching and
the killing just like the Nazis do or do they actually stand by their principles and try
to talk things out and I think that is the greater effect of the punch that it not only
does it degrade the rule of law and bring the inevitable cold civil war we're having
to a more hot civil war area, but it also further polarize the two sides.
I see what you're saying, I think for me it's less about changing the individual's mind
and like you said it's about the crowd, so if somebody posts some disgusting article,
I mean if it's a small 200 person community you can pretty much just ignore it and let
them just have the crazy little club, but for whatever reason it makes it to a popular
red magazine or something you can write a response, you don't have to call the guy and
try and talk to him on the phone and change his mind, that might not work and I'm using
mail terms because I'm thinking of I guess we can be more inclusive if you want this
might be a situation where the exclusivity is fine.
Well the two sides that we're thinking about right now are Richard Spencer and the guy
that punched Richard Spencer.
But so if you can't change this person's mind which might not even be worth attempting,
you can write a response if you're worried that anyone's taking this person seriously
you know rather than send an assassin to his house.
Again I wanted to make my peaceful discourse stance very clear before I say that all the
arguments that sound like in favor of hitting Richard Spencer or similar people sound also
like arguments for killing him and it seems to me that killing him would have more advantages
for the people making some of these arguments, like it'll freak them out, it'll make them
afraid to go outside and just you know espouse these terrible beliefs, thin their numbers.
So you're just using fear as a deterrent basically?
Or yeah so I guess hitting them would be you know fear and some physical threat is deterrent,
but if you're serious about it then it sounds like you might as well just be start killing them.
I'm not saying that again I want to make 100% clear I'm not advocating that but it sounds like
it's a really easy slide from saying we should literally beat them into submission to where
they're scared to go outside and say their stupid things to where we should just make
it so they can never do those things again, right?
Who have we become when we're the ones resorting those tactics?
Not the good guys, right?
Well sure yeah no I mean so you mentioned that it was a black block member, is that a descriptive
term for anarcho-communist groups or is that specifically the name of a group because I'm
actually not terribly well versed in that?
I've just heard about them actually the last few days but from what I can tell they are a
specific group.
Okay I'd be curious to know if anyone claiming to represent them has made a statement of what
their intent was by like what was that actually their intent was to be like we needed to deter
these guys by using fear or was it to send a message like you said play the audience a little
bit or maybe not play the audience but send a message to the audience.
It could literally just been a happenstance occurrence where it's like hey it's that fucking
asshole that wants to kill a bunch of people right here I am I don't have anything harder than
my fist let's just go hit him sure and I can totally and I could totally see that so might not
have been a reason to attack there might not have been um but I mean if like hypothetically if
there were could it you know what what would it be would it be like these guys are extreme
it may have to it may have to involve violence at some point in time hey look I can do it you
can do it too I don't I mean I don't know that that is one of the slightly more um persuasive
arguments that I've seen is that once fascism has taken root to the point where the government is
on the side of the Nazis it's kind of a little late to fight I mean at that point it's obvious who
you should be fighting and do you take up guns and form revolutionary cells but you want to prevent
it from getting to that point if you can and this is a way to dry a line in the sand and say no we're
not going to tolerate this at any cost so would you say one of the better ways to prevent it is by
going through the motions of a civil society where we don't automatically resort to violent acts
yes that is that is my contention okay that the the prohibition on private political violence
is basically what makes civilization possible you cannot have any sort of civilized society
until you have you have this agreement that you do not use violence for political purposes
if you are not actually acting as the state as a cop who's on the job or as a soldier who's
fulfilling his duty you do not get to use violence to make political points if you are just a guy out
in the street because otherwise we revert back to a state of chaos and then no one is safe I mean
I'm not trying to use this as a way to defend Nazis because I hate Nazis I assume as much as
anybody although now I'm sure other people will be saying that I don't hate them at all but uh
there's god who was it um Sir Thomas Moore I think it was once said uh that a man who was a really
awful man everyone hated him but he didn't commit a crime should be let free and uh one of his friends
said you're giving him the benefit of the of the law here this is an awful person he's like
I would give the devil the benefit of the law if the devil didn't commit a crime and the guy says
really you would let the law protect the devil I would cut a path through the law to get to the
devil I would clear cut all of law to get to the devil and Thomas Moore said well then what do you
have left protecting you once all the laws are gone the devil can turn around and attack you
just as easily so laws are what protect us from this state of chaos and I think we do
we do a lot of harm to society when we decided that certain laws are no longer applicable and
right now I think it is far more harm than these few hundred Nazis can do to our society
but what about special exceptions so I'm with you and so if if Thomas Moore's interlocutor was like
no no I'm only going to break the law for literally the devil so what I could imagine someone saying
no no I'm I'm behind you we should be we should have people allowed to say you know whatever
that the earth is flat or something but calling for genocide or discussing it like it's a topic
on the table even maybe not saying all right I don't grab your guns Friday is when it starts
that I think is at the point where you're allowed to intervene right yeah there's a there's a big
call between saying you know the world would be a lot better place if there's certain demographic
people was all dead and saying all right guys grab your guns we're gonna make it happen I think at
the minute that you you start advocating for an actionable plan then you've crossed a line
but they might say uh just to backpedal a little bit I'm going to draw a special
exception for literally Nazis I'm talking to a person who says the world would be a much better
place if Nazis were gone off the face of the planet that sounds like scary rhetoric though
well right but he's the guy who's pro punching Nazis yeah no no I guess I see what you're saying
and then it just occurred to me that the response so I like my arguments to be generalizable yeah
yeah this is about Nazis for another for any other group and that suddenly turns into a really
dark sentence right right well right it's like that's like that's kind of a it almost seems
abstract right because it's like oh yeah of course of course the world I mean I'm sure the world
would be a better place if we didn't have people advocating we all the people who advocated for
genocide didn't exist in whatever capacity that might mean but there's a lot more nuance to it
right because how do you who are those people which people are you talking about right also
you're advocating for the genocide of those people I mean that's true also but I mean I'm not sure
I'm not sure if anyone gets tripped up there or not but that is uh seems like a weird contradiction
it's a I mean it's also how you define genocide or or eugenics because I am a strong advocate for
once the technology is there sterilizing everybody at birth in a reversible manner and once they hit
the age of majority letting them get that reversed as long as they petition all they got to do is ask
no IQ test or any of that other bullshit if you want to not be sterilized anymore we reverse it
for free on the spot you just want to make basically family planning not have to be a plan or have to
be an opt-in rather than an opt-out exact gotcha and uh there are people who would call me a eugenicist
for doing that and um that suddenly makes me a Nazi and you're not saying they have to pass a
test like I said they don't have to pass a test they don't have to write a big check so they don't
have to fit in any demographics they just have to I guess have access to the internet or a phone or
something and there are Christians who say uh that abortion is genocide yeah and that uh the
wait how would that be how would how does that follow what what what what would their reasoning
be I've never really never definitely never heard that one before disproportionate number of people
who get abortions are poor and um the this is being provided at Planned Parenthoods that are
supported by the government and so they're saying that the government is setting up baby
merger shops in inner cities to let the black people wipe themselves out they they're saying
that the fact that we support Planned Parenthood means that we are supporting black genocide
that sounds like a bottom line reasoning like they're against like that doesn't sound like the
kind of position you'd come to organically it sounds like they're already against abortion
they're trying to think what is the best way we can like make a make a punch and I would like to be
able to counter argue these people and say no you're wrong and here's why as opposed to being
afraid to leave my house because of the gangs that are going to be roaming around beating me for
being genocidal yeah I mean are we are we are we are we being way too charitable if we assume that
people should be able to differentiate between your position and and certain Christians calling
you a Nazi versus people like Richard Spencer who are very like overtly the world's full of fucking
idiots right like I said is that maybe that is charitable I guess but how it's it's not that
hard to single someone out and get a mob going after them as long as you use the right buzz words
and can point to a few things that look I suppose not well and I guess also the concern and the
concern that you're putting forward this whole time is that the second that we say it's okay to
start doing that for some groups who knows how big that how long that list can get yeah and that's
I mean the the scary part right you can say it's okay to punch Nazis but do we then have some sort of
level of evidence do they get hauled into court where we prove that they're a Nazi or is it just
once 51% of the populist thinks yeah he's probably a Nazi then he's a Nazi and do we take a poll is
it just the general opinion it's it reduces to whoever is the most willing to do violence to
people they don't like yeah just has to be the one vigilante they don't have to ask anybody
yeah I'm sure and I mean I don't know like like there are definitely some people who are more
extreme and with with the whole idea or the sentiment that like yeah we should totally just
like whip ass on some Nazis but then at least from what I've seen in my own personal Facebook feed
like most people who are who are like damn right we should punch Nazis are just kind of doing it
from a I don't know kind of a signaling standpoint where they're just like yeah I'm all about justice
I'm all about doing the right thing I hate these guys they're they're evil so and I'm a good person
so yeah fight evil people yeah I've seen and it's and and there's certainly an emotional
detachment because they're sitting here and they're in their homes or at work and with their
computers in front of them for a lot of them that's kind of a I don't know I mean it's a gesture
but it's it's basically saying don't be evil and fight evil where you do see it right so it's
sure isn't in a good way but I think that is the problem because no one is evil then okay that's
not entirely true but no one does evil for the sake of evil they always do it because they think
it's good when Richard Spencer says these things he says he does it because he thinks he is saving
the nation from I don't even know what he's saving it from and when people say it's okay to punch
Nazis they think that they are saving the nation from the next holocaust when really all they're
doing is degrading the rule of law the point is people always think that they're doing good when
they're doing evil and that's why I'm not okay with just signing on to yeah sure they're you know
they're on our side they're doing a good thing against evil no everyone thinks that they're doing
good that that's why you have the laws that stop things like actual violence and then draw a line
at bodily harm I was trying to think of parallels that might serve as intuition pumps like the
the public consciousness might be pro fighting ISIS would they be pro fighting ISIS sympathizers
at home would they be pro so someone in America shares a pro ISIS meme on their Facebook is okay
to hit them and when they go to when they're in public exactly um so I guess that sort of seems
to be the takeaway that you know once you open this door at all there's no there's no keeping
it from swinging all the way open I guess there's no bulwark to say no this is exactly where we're
stop it's okay to hit just these people unless you're gonna just uh you're gonna sound a lot like
god this is a bad comparison you're gonna sound a lot like Nazis and say no no we're not pro killing
the public just the Jewish public right I mean yeah well it's you know Nazis in in film and
literature they're like the de facto bad guys they're just they're just there do the exist to
be the bad guys that you feel okay in acting harm upon absolutely like I think it's a good idea to
take a problem where you have just one example then expand it right like what you're doing with the
whole ISIS example but Nazism has this has this I'm gonna use the word advantage but hopefully
you know what I mean it's got a historical context it's very easy to just be like to write them off
entirely and other them not that they go to example of like the baby eating monsters yeah 100%
absolutely that's one of the reasons like god went we just shouldn't use Nazis as a thing we label
people who aren't literally part of the Nazi party yeah it does carry a lot of baggage well that's
just that it carries baggage but it literally makes you subhuman and okay to kill oh yeah that too
I mean you don't have any rights because you're just so evil you're just you you've already screwed
right which I would be okay with if they actually were a Nazi like I see the pictures of Indiana
Jones punching a Nazi and people are like we should punch Nazis and no one points out that
about 30 seconds later Indiana Jones murders that Nazi when you see pictures of Captain America
punching Hitler people don't point out that we were out there to murder Hitler and we're glad he's dead
the the 1940s German Nazis do deserve to be killed and that's why they make such great villains
but calling anyone a Nazi automatically reverts into that subhuman status and so I'm really reluctant
to do it yeah I guess if you want to come out and raise your hand and say I'm a Nazi then you're
welcoming all of that filtering I guess but I don't know what to say about that I I don't know
I have a short list of notes here and most of it I've labeled it confusion upsides downsides
and the confusion takes up the bulk of the page downsides is a few bullet points and the upsides
