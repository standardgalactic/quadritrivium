publishes a website saying we should seriously consider black genocide you would pull them
into court you would say look here is the website here's his name on it here's the picture he posted
send him to jail for two years or however long it is or slap him with a $10,000 fine
I don't know what what the case may be that sounds appropriate I I wanted to at least because we've
done a lot of I think kicking back against the probe hunch position what what should people
be doing instead that strikes me as a very important question that I'd like to at least
consider but I don't I don't really have a good answer what was the question what should we what
should we do instead of people instead of punching Spencer and that community since we're mostly not
in favor of of hitting them in the street randomly and I guess to me I get my mind I mean because
I have hard time thinking of of like not worst-case scenarios as far as in this case like collateral
damage I imagine like throwing a brick through his window and killing a toddler like I mean you
know so would would they say well fuck it that toddler yeah I imagine some people rationalize
it and say well that's how people have been rationalizing all kinds of so yeah any social
movement that rely or that could plausibly lead to the death of innocent people like that kid at
University of Washington got shot I think he's well he's been moved from critical to
serious condition but that could have very easily killed him and it still might right so like I guess
if you're gonna say yeah I'm totally down with with violence against these people you're better
be prepared to say this is the amount of false positivism we're ready to tolerate what was what
was the shooting at the University of Washington that you're referring to oh that kid had a
anti swastika tattoo oh that looks like a swastika tattoo right okay um right so I mean you know
reasonable error if you're if your goal is saying I'm gonna kill Nazis
it's just a false positive we gotta accept yeah I mean I mean I mean rough tattoo choice but I'm
not gonna obviously it's not that person's fault and no one should be shot for for having any sort of
tattoo so I guess if we're not in favor of saying yeah hit them in the street what are we in favor
of what would be a better way to engage these assholes or just ignore them if there are 200
people I'm kind of in favor of ignoring them discrediting them as much as possible disrupting
them being really just like not inviting them to anything don't don't let them go into your
private spaces at the very least yeah that's obviously the first step I don't know shame them
shout them down like there's all kinds of non physically violent ways I mean you could be
aggressive with them and yell at them and until they go away argument gets counter argument is
is always my thing because they are just wrong about society being worse off when it's multicultural
and diverse and that's pretty fucking obvious to most people there there's a reason that there's
only a few hundred of them and they've been losing for decades in this country and I think
you know first of all giving the counter argument but also as you're saying pointing out that their
violent evil assholes drives people away sometimes reaching out to some of them and I talked earlier
about the guy who was invited to to Jewish dinners there was another guy who was had a swastika tattoo
on his face and was like on his forehead or I didn't say which where exactly on his face it was
but swastika tattoo on his face really really down on his luck and he was moving furniture to
make ends meet and a rich Jewish guy hired him and he was like well I hate this guy but I really
need to eat and pay rent so I'll move the furniture and afterwards the Jewish guy tipped him very well
and said you were awesome we want to come back and help me next week he was like yeah okay sure
and eventually they they got a pretty good rapport and the guy also dropped out of the
the Nazi movement and when he asked the Jewish guy hey why did you hire me when I had a swastika
right well you were a good worker and uh you looked like you were down on your luck and needed
some work and I said sure why not and I was like first of all props to that Jewish guy I would
seriously that guy I don't know what I would do in that situation but he broke down those barriers
and that was amazing but so there's that there's just mocking them um I will link to a podcast
about um how the KKK was taken down by Superman oh that's a great one yeah okay sounds interesting
oh well it's fantastic they um they had someone infiltrate the KKK and they always have their
secret meetings where they have their special robes and they talk in codes and all this
ridiculous codes to like grand dragon and all the stuff that you'd imagine kids would play with
yeah and the secret club the secret KKK club yeah it was seriously like boys in a treehouse having
their secret club and just the focus of this we really hate black people now let's have our
fun weekend activity or whatever let's go bowling with the sight of impotent rage yes yeah uh but
the guy worked for a radio program a superman program this was was this the 40s 30s it was before
tv was big radio was the big thing okay so yeah 40s probably yeah and um he leaked all this
information to the guys working on the superman program and superman started fighting the KKK
in the program and the KKK they would reveal all their all their secret codes they would just make
them look ridiculous they would point out that these are just dumb guys in a treehouse basically
and the uh people who are in the KKK their kids listen to the superman show and they would start
running around the playground playing superman versus the KKK that's brilliant yes and guess this
is this because this is all sounding like exactly like i just heard this very recently uh i think
it may have been a radio lab maybe it was this american life i'm not sure i i know it was probably
this american life i don't actually listen to either of those i i feel like i saw this in a
document or something very like within the last month because all like this is all very fresh for
me yeah but yeah it's hilarious they were basically shamed out of being the KKK because it was pointed
out how ridiculous and dumb they are sure and and after that the KKK i mean it was still a thing
but it became far less powerful uh so there's that there is a group called indivisible and they
have a website indivisibleguide.com i believe it is but i'll double check that uh and they are posting
all sorts of things on how you can resist the trump administration in a peaceful and possibly
effective way things you can do how you can contact your congress craters how you can put
political pressure on things from your own district at home uh and i will link that as well
but there's a lot of nonviolent things that people can do and that i think would be more
effective than trying to be violent sure the the other thing i i guess yeah people some of the
people in favor of like yeah it's okay to you know punch nazis i have said that well it's not
really violence because people like richard spencer are are they're the ones they're like
they're the oppressors they're the bad guys you know like like it's it's it's kind of that whole
thing i'm i'm probably not presenting it very well but i've seen this on a couple of friends
walls where they basically say you know i'm i'm a pacifist i'm against violence but doing this is
not violence which is i mean i i don't i don't entirely agree with that but it's mostly a semantic
thing i also think they vastly overestimate how much power he has and and that's entirely right
and i mean i think like again it kind of ties into like social justice movements where like any
any form of oppression where if you're if you're a member of society that holds the card so to speak
then then some of your actions can be considered as violence whereas some other ones might not be
even if on the surface they appear to such but the guy that punched him was also an able-bodied
white man oh yes no no i'm i'm aware yeah no i i'm just i was kind of grasping at straws for
that one because this is me just trying to like like here are some arguments i've seen
like they're not necessarily arguments that i agree with but they're this is some of the
rhetoric that i've seen kicked down and i that was very incomplete just for his argument because
it seems to me like the social justice left has a fair amount of power well yeah no i mean certainly
more than than richard spencer does anyway yeah i mean you you might you might say that
i i and i mean and and here's the other thing and this is this is kind of another
like i mean a guy got away with punching a man in the street well yeah no i mean it's just like
like and i think this happens sometimes in general with people who are very fired up
and and and fervent about these ideas of social justice is that the the the have a tendency to
conflate the idea of systemic power with individual power where it's like if you if you commit an
act of violence or you do something against someone on an individual level you think things like
racial discrimination will cut all directions if you're talking about one-on-one or in small groups
on a systemic level obviously that doesn't quite play out the same way but people people sometimes
seem to just kind of say like they look at a pattern they'll be like well this involved a
person of this color and this involved involved a person this other color so therefore that wasn't
actually racist that wasn't racially motivated so i mean that might be where some of that comes from
speak of weird rhetoric i there was a great well there is a great subreddit called change my view
where somebody put forward you know in the title the the thread their position and they'll defend it
as many paragraphs as it takes and then people will try and talk them out of it and in good faith
they tend to engage in fact if the original poster doesn't respond within three hours to the original
to to comments coming in the thread gets removed so that it it demands open like actual discourse
i think change my view is another wonderful way to fight this sort of thing without punching people
there was i just was reading one today somebody said i it was basically taking your position
they had your position they were being called nazi by their facebook friends because they were a
nazi sympathizer because they were saying you shouldn't hit nazis and he's like i'm not saying
you shouldn't hit nazis and saying you shouldn't hit anybody including nazis anyway so there were
sure the further down you go obviously just like with every sort of comment thread the worst the
the arguments get and they got to be kind of dumb all along the lines of like well at what point
are you allowed to hit him you know if there's some guy marching around with a gun saying
i'm going to shoot black people do you do pin him then do you wait till he takes aim you pin him
down yeah you call the cops immediately that's a threatable that's a credible threat of violence
yeah so i think there you know there are some times when punching is appropriate yeah and so some
of these were kind of dumb but i get the point they were trying to make but poorly was at where
where is the where's the line when is it okay to hit spencer i i think i i will put forward my own
idea on it and it was what i said earlier which is when it changes from talking about the the
notion as kind of just a circle jerky little thing about you know we have our our little
fringe belief let's sit here and engage about it back and forth to our little community
and saying all right guys grab your guns we're going to go do this i think the second that they
make a plan so you're so credible threat of violence right yeah i mean soon as he actually
were to single out a black person or a black neighborhood and say let's start here that is
when you intervene so i guess we're all that was a pretty quick answer i thought it might be a
conversation but i think that that's a fair thing i guess i think maybe the concern come back to that
could be something along the lines of what if they don't say all right guys friday night and it's
tuesday they say right now let's go do this and there's just not time so is there any point where
preemptive strike is appropriate and i don't really have a good answer to that i feel yeah kind of like
we've been that's sort of the issue we've been talking about that if you if you authorize preemptive
strikes you're going to get a lot of false positives you're going to have a hard time
pinning down it when exactly it's okay i think there's definitely a point where preemptive strikes
are appropriate but that requires a huge burden of of proof if you're advocating that sort of thing
if you're advocating being violent to someone else before they have been violent first right you
better have a damn good reason yeah and like and like what is sufficient evidence for that
in that case where you simply just don't have enough information like or or well actually even
without that just like what would sufficient evidence be in general like it's if it's if it's
if it's a too little too late thing where it's like okay we're just gonna be we're just gonna
hands off hands off hands off oh suddenly some horrible thing happens a bunch of people get
lit up in a neighborhood and it's like well we maybe if we'd listen to all those nazi punchy
puncher people you know like maybe this wouldn't have happened i i mean and i think that at least
in the usa maybe this is different in other countries but at least in the usa we are so
far away from nazis actually being a threat that is we are far more and we're not close to this
either but we are far closer to the threat of random mobs in the streets choosing people they
don't like and beating them than we are to the fascists taking over and implementing their
genocidal policies i'm sure true to social media in general like they're people who are you know
catastrophizing certain things and kind of making this assumption that like yeah it's gonna be it's
gonna straight up be third right all over again yeah do we even need to point out that the nazis
got started by having mobs of vigilantes in the streets they were not originally in power in germany
they started out as groups of thugs and kids wandering the streets saying the laws do not
punish the jews enough we must do it more for them right they were they were like completely
peaceful right they they actually did use violence in small groups they would punch people they would
beat people they would even now and then kill people but it started out with mobs beating
someone that they thought was not being sufficiently punished by the government right which is what
we have here yes a vigilante beating someone who he believes is not being sufficiently
silenced by the government we have a distilled version of that like a weaker yeah right now
i would definitely yeah we had one guy there there was i mean he ran after after the punch
because he knew he wouldn't get support enough support from the crowd to stick around and and
hang out so i mean and he also didn't want to get arrested yeah so it was a little different but
it does sound like a slippery slope to something like that right
yeah i don't know if it's a slippery slope but it's something that i would like to be on the
lookout for and the fact that people are gleefully cheering on the the guy who wants to who is
basically the small scale version of the uh brown shirts wandering the streets is is what
really horrifies me i think that's fair i i don't have much else to to weigh in on that
i'm certainly open to to civil counterargument i do have one argument pro punching that i really
kind of respect even though i don't want to what's that um the argument is that
there is no such thing as non-violence or non-violent action that is effective if there
isn't a also violent action um complimenting it that for example ghandi would have failed
in india if it wasn't for the fact that the british had just gone through a brutal world war
and were militarily weakened and just didn't have the the will to fight anymore uh that the
civil rights movement here in america would have never gone anywhere if it wasn't for the
fact that there were black panthers uh burning places and carrying guns around and that uh it
originally people when they saw martin luther king were just shocked and offended that he would
do such a thing and ask for for these concessions and then the black panthers show up with their
guns and their fire bombs and they realize well he's certainly much better than the black panthers
and we're going to have race riots on our hands and uh we would rather deal with martin luther king
than deal with these uh violent mobs and that is one of the reasons i do think that violence
sometimes is justified uh it certainly was in that case when the law was on the side of terror as
instead of on the side of order uh right but this it could be made a claim could be made that
this is serving the same function by having a minority who is violent and uh does that sort
of thing it gives more power to the nonviolent groups that all of a sudden people who were
kind of on the sidelines before uh join into the nonviolent movement and push that stronger
just because they want to avoid the the violence getting out of control it makes it makes the whole
problem unignorable yeah and you can't have that if you don't have some small minority that is doing
the violence do do you think it also could mitigate greater acts of violence by like this this this
relatively minor like this guy throws an elbow when he runs away if he is is part of the argument
also that like if if you sort of like if that didn't happen maybe something could have escalated
into an even worse act of violence before people would react to it and say hey maybe we shouldn't
do this oh i didn't hear that but that that is also a point yeah just something came to mind yeah
i mean it certainly raised my consciousness to the fact that there is even a a population of neo-nazis
in the united states okay like i i probably am not a representative demographic of of people
who pay attention so maybe i might be out of the loop on this one well i think you're probably
rather um basic uh american norm i think you're actually more informed than the the median american
which would make me think that most people didn't know that there was these neo-nazi groups
yeah probably less informed than the average listener though okay but um i mean yeah i suppose i
would have i guess i knew that there were skinheads and people swastika tattoos but i thought it was
mainly like prison gangs you know a few hundred people and that apparently is what it is but i
wasn't aware that they had some some tv time and that sort of nonsense so certainly raised my
