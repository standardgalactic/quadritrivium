is just two little things I'm like what could be the point of doing this is really what I'm
trying to think of I guess it is just a shut down terrible discourse so no one wants these people
to have a microphone except in principle right so yeah maybe that's the litmus test is that you know
unless we're talking abstractly no one actually wants to get these people to platform well I mean
yeah like like earlier in yasha you mentioned the west bro baptist church like what is the
worst thing that they've ever said they're mostly like they've said things about the lgbt
community basically right and mostly about god not liking them yes or hating them yes is that
like the worst they've ever done is just go around and say those things they've done a lot of things
they've I mean they're probably now most famous for picketing the soldiers of uh or the funerals
of soldiers oh right because uh america you know god hates america because america loves facts
or something so sure yeah sure so that kind of stuff right and then and then you have people
like richard spencer who say substantially worse things like and I know this was from an internet
wayback machine I haven't seen what he said recently but all signs seem to point to
hardcore white nationalist slash possible nazi I'm salutes and every all that imagery aside
aside from the subhumaneness I'm actually okay saying that he probably signs on to nazi ideology
yeah sure the only real direction I was going with that was just that like it seems like what he's
saying is substantial people in his his group is substantially worse than even what the west
bro baptist church says okay but then again that's kind of I mean that's kind of hard to compare
those two things I just well I think I mean to the west bro baptist church so far as I know
and I don't know a lot I think they they make claims that yeah you know homosexuality is the
worst thing ever and people who are gay are terrible but I don't think they're literally saying
but they don't advocate for killing them yeah so that that's I think that's
might be the line that some people draw they don't advocate for killing them
explicitly but they do say that like maybe okay with it yeah they do say that homosexuals
deserve to die that they should they're just not gonna do it but that that's but even that that
that quote earlier from alternative right calm was was more explicit than that right it was it was
like entertaining the questions like how might the world be better without these group of people
will lead to enlightenment and flourishing thought I mean west bro baptist does say that
about gays oh that the world would be better and more enlightened without them and they should
all be gone that's interesting so why aren't are all these people that are pro punching spencer
pro punching every west bro baptist person I would assume so if they were consistent but
they very strongly say only nazis yeah I guess there's there's like we keep talking about there's
this magical category for nazis it's it's it's it's it's it's it's topical and yeah I would
I'm willing to bet that they wouldn't necessarily say those that that same thing about the west
bro baptist church they specifically said they don't say that about the west bro baptist church
when I talk to them okay okay so I know um alternative right the the website did that
proceed right Bart I mean I don't remember how long ago it was okay because because you you
mentioned that you mentioned that Richard Spencer is like more or less the founder of the alternative
right movement I'm not sure if the entire movement but it seems that the name alt right came from his
coinage from his website okay okay and he's certainly a big main in the movement which is
interesting because none of us have ever heard of him before a few months ago right yep no the
first time I saw him was when he was in that hotel saying you know hail trump hail our hail our
people and everyone was throwing up the salute Stephen just said we don't want to give him a
platform but no one has ever given him a platform the only platform he gets is when he does things
so outrageous on camera that the news says oh my god look at how outrageous this is kind of
kind of like Milo Yiannopoulos yes yes exactly uh and and like uh the west bro baptists they only
get coverage when they're so fucking crazy that the media says look how crazy they are he doesn't
have any sort of uh job at a newspaper or anything of course in Milo's case I mean he's he's he's
more like an alt right troll right he's he's there to be an entertainer he's there to
stir people up and you know be inflammatory you know like like and paint the left in his
battle light as he possibly can and misconstrue their points and so on and so forth is it bad
that I'm sometimes entertained by Milo no I mean he's he's he's a witty guy like he's he's clearly
he seems like an intelligent person of the very you know but he's directing his his wits toward
being an asshole basically yeah I apparently need to get out more I have no idea you guys are talking
about oh he's he's another alt right celebrity yeah he's he's he's he's associated with bright
Bart yeah and he got his uh he was he the first twitter um person that guy's Twitter
twitter purged yeah well he was yeah he got banned from twitter um for being just so controversial
all the time but and I mean I I think it was more than just that I'm just giving kind of like a really
basic view of it but um this thing is the first person to get banned from twitter well not entirely
but there was a bit of a purge uh not too long ago of various alt right twitter trolls and I think
he was the first one in that wave right I see yeah it was it was it was like back in june or
something like that now and now of course he's he's using that to his advantage he's standing
up and being like well I wouldn't go back to twitter even if they begged me to and and so on
so he looks like this awesome martyr for the alt right or whatever it is but yeah no most of the
concerns around Milo uh what he talks about when he's invited to you know speak at a campus
by the republican club or whatever um like I believe there's a bit of a controversy about
him outing a trans person at a oh I did hear about this guy right yeah like like he named
the person's last name uh unopolis so it's like that's that's the person that was at
university of washington on friday yes uh so so that's that's who this was about that's why
yeah okay it's like why I am and yeah holy shit so now we've come full circle all right yeah
interesting now yeah so so like he was I forget which university he was speaking at but he like
he named a trans person that was attending that college and showed a picture of this person
and a lot of people view that as essentially an act of violence endangering the life of
that person by outing them and making it known that they were trans yeah that was actually an
article that I was reading here that's why I sounded so familiar yeah um I'm trying to scroll
through and find the name of the school but it's not super important guys it sounds like guys
sounds like a total dick um what do we what do we think about the argument that uh some speech
can be violence so I guess then we kind of fall back on so that's what a lot of people who are in
favor of Nazi punching would say yeah definitely and Sean you gave the example self-defense against
the classic example of yelling fire in a movie theater yeah in John Stuart Mills on Liberty
short book basically the the bible for libertarians but it's it's a short enough read you can read
it in half an hour or an hour if you're slow like me um the sentence that encapsulates the whole
thesis of the book is the freedom to swing my fist ends where your face begins and the whole
whole idea is that I can do whatever I want as long as I'm not hurting other people and
consenting adults can do whatever they want as long as they're hurting other people the example
that he gives as far as speech that might be somewhat relevant is that apparently it was common
for corn farmers to stock all their their harvest and then basically ransom it out and say oh no
we're super short you know we're gonna have to hike up sales a lot and uh that was the
analogy that he gave and he was saying that it would be perfectly acceptable for somebody to
have a town meeting and hand out flyers and say the town corn farmer might be trying to fuck us or
you know this this is a bad establishment that allows this to happen it wouldn't be
appropriate to have that conversation on the lawn of the town corn farmer and get everyone all riled
up and and hating on this this group of people or just that that it that it there's a reasonable
expectation that that could happen and so that's even where mill was ready to say you know what
I'm ready to draw the line on free speech there so I guess I don't like this is this is gonna
maybe sound somewhat annoying to somebody but I don't like that you're saying speech is violence
I think that that's I mean if speech is violence then what's then what's violence so it's it's
indirect right it's it's not like the words are actually physically harming people obviously but
it's it's it's that those words can lead to acts of violence like in in the case of the in the case
of people who are um marginalized or oppressed right oh so it can lead to actual physical
violence right well like the whole idea was was like again like if if Milo Yiannopoulos goes to
a college campus and outs a trans trans person that's potentially a violent act because there
are people that would do that oh okay I see the idea is that you don't dox people right right right
it's it's an invasion from privacy and you never know who might be willing to commit commit acts
of violence with that knowledge right yeah but that that also potentially gets into a bit of a
gray area slash slippery slope type thing so okay so I guess I'll I'll rescind my my comments on
speech not being I guess so no one's saying that the words themselves are violence they're saying
that no it's that it leads to violence and that's that's a bad thing that's obviously a fair concern
okay so personal story time again I can kind of understand the statement that threats are
violence in themselves because I when I lived at a different place once and one of my neighbors was
kind of an asshole and he would get drunk a lot and one time I was out and I got a call from my
so saying that the guy just yelled over from his porch I'm gonna go over there and shoot all of you
and I freaked the fuck out and I literally got lost driving home oh it was like I was 10 minutes
away because I was so out of my mind with with both rage and you know that when you want to kill
someone that's sort of the the shock of it that I couldn't drive straight I didn't know where I was
but I finally got home and if he would have been there like out front in front of our doors
it took me a few days to get over that because hearing someone that you love threatened like that
yeah it is it feels like violence and I can I can totally understand someone who uh
who is in a targeted minority someone who's black or Jewish hearing uh we should we should
consider black genocide being physically not physically but psychologically harmed by that
feeling that they very emotionally impactful right yeah um and it makes makes the idea of hitting
them seems super sympathizable fuck yes it does yeah no um I mean I understand why he was hit the
thing that I'm uh upset about is how many people are cheering this on and saying yes this is a
thing we should do yeah and and and not a lot of them and not everyone who advocates for punch
Nazi is is putting it in the terms that we're putting it they're not exactly presenting the most
nuanced they're they're using again the internet pathos right they're showing images of captain
america they're showing images of indiana jones they're saying well of course it's okay to punch
those people but but they're also very removed from it a lot of them are are not like like a lot
of the people I've I've seen who advocate for it are not necessarily members of a marginalized group
but they're all but they're oftentimes people who are sympathetic with people who are marginalized
they're very they're very you know they're very social justice minded I guess for them it might
make a certain degree of sense like yeah of course that you know like these are the people who are
going to be hurt by this their scale of violence is not the same as ours and thus so maybe so maybe
on some level they don't want like an axiomatic view of how a civil society works to get in the
way of protecting the marginalized people right they see themselves I mean I don't want to say
like saviors but like people who are the warrior and social justice warrior yeah yeah sure you're
stopping the holocaust from coming on our shores right no I I mean I understand that but there's
I would assume and I'll get into a comparison here in a second if you're worried about violence
against your group wouldn't you want the laws to be strong and strictly enforced because the problem
comes from when there are lynch mobs and there are people being beaten in the streets and the cops
being okay with that being like yeah no he's a nazi or yeah no he's a jew so it's totally okay
it's this guy can threaten people and yes that is frightening and that is infuriating but as long
as you know that if he tries to come after you the cops and the rest of society will be there to stop
that I think that is a stronger protection than going out and punching people and starting fights
in the streets yeah I think well you definitely have a point I but I guess I would I would say
that there are some marginalized groups who don't feel that the law has their best interests in mind
and and that's kind of a whole other can of worms or you know that's that's a rabbit hole and I
I'll admit I'm not I mean I mean I read about these things sometimes but I don't necessarily
feel like and there's a certain level I can't really speak to it on I guess I guess that comes
back to the whole efficacy point because one of the people I was talking with was big into the
punk scenes in the oh in the 90s oh and and let me get like like not neo nazi showed up to those
yeah and and they were like the only way to deal with them is to just punch them out and get them
out of there exactly they said yeah I've seen that before yeah yeah that the only way to deal with
them is to resist physically and let them know that they will be beat if they come to these spaces
yeah they're talking about skinheads who show up to punk shows and stuff yep yeah exactly just listen
to the music or to be tics both yeah I wasn't around for that scene I was way too young it's
loud thrashing music it appeals to people who have a lot of you know testosterone want to
fight on both sides and so uh they they would be a danger to bystanders they would overwhelm the
bouncer's ability to take care of the venue and it quickly became a social norm that you punch
nazis that that was just you see a nazi you punch a nazi you get them the fuck out of there or
they're going to ruin everything and make the place dangerous for people and in that case I totally
sympathize because a club like that is already an anarchistic lawless environment the police don't
come in there and they don't care about fights in punk clubs they're like whatever you you white
kids beat the fuck out of each other it's like this the microcosm of like a no man's land right
right and in those cases you do need that sort of violence and in that case I would be a proponent
of doing that but I don't think we have that situation on the streets of New York I mean
they're as you pointed out there are serious problems with how law enforcement is done in
this country and how it is in many places anti-minority and I can see how they would feel like
they're not being protected by the law and so they do have to take things into their own hands
right right they like they don't have that same confidence that you and I might have
exactly in the same situation we you know so I I guess like I just I just wanted to bring that up
is like I want to acknowledge that that's a thing you know in general that's an important
thing I'm wondering how to engage it I guess yeah I'm I'm a yeah I'm in kind of in the same boat
yeah I I mean ideally the best way to engage it is to make the law be actually just and the law
enforcement be just right easier said than done in ideal world yeah yeah race relations are not
where they need to be yet right I did have a sort of lateral move I wanted to discuss at least briefly
sure in Germany and at least at least Germany some other parts of the UK maybe it's against the law
to express beliefs of Holocaust denial yes oh that's right I did hear about that I wonder
if that you if you could say if someone might say well okay fine we don't have to hit on
we just make it against the law to say that you know we want to kill black people or something
I would actually be okay with that I I have a mixed position on this I would rather that there be a
law that singles out something that everyone in society agrees is horrific and should not be
tolerated and have it actually be codified as part of our laws rather than having this anarchistic
vigilante justice well if you had to pick sure between between random vigilant vigilante justice
and a lot of per prevent that express to believe but for me the best kind of argument I heard to
to this this law in the UK is that if if you're the kind of idiot who is a Holocaust denier
by all means put that on your Facebook or say it in front of a TV camera and let everyone know
how fucking stupid you are and then that way we can all update our opinions about you accordingly
whereas if you can't even express the belief then you know you might be friends with some idiot
Holocaust and I are not even know it right because they can't express that belief to you so I mean
if you say well you can't share Pepe the frog memes because it's whatever supportive of this
this shitty demographic of assholes well then they're going to just have some other maybe
secret signs or something but then for all you know they're going to be friends with these people
and I guess if it never came up then all the better but it seems like I'd be kind of in favor
of you if you're going out there and letting everyone know how dumb you are and the laws that
that might impede that I can see their their utility but I wonder if that's worth the cost
it might be I'm not really super tied to that belief but it is an interesting counterpoint
yeah I'm wondering how you would make that actionable like like like you're you're saying
have a law where it's illegal to basically talk about genocide or to advocate for it or something
maybe advocate for it I mean I think I wouldn't want to make a law like that case if someone
