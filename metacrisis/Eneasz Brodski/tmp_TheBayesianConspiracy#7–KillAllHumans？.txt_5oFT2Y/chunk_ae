of status you're not increasing your reproductive success at all is already at that level we should
we should probably point out about that treadmill is because I I mentioned it and didn't define it
either the hedonic treadmill is the idea that when something happens to make you happy you're happy
for a set period of time and then you revert back to the happiness level that you were at before
that happened studies show that people who win a lottery are happy for a few months and then revert
back to their their roughly base level of happiness and the converse is true of people who are injured
in uh debilitating accidents like uh quite or paraplegic although there has been some interesting
revitalization recently I bet it'll it'll sorry it also it also says that when you hit um that
when you're when you're looking at income levels and happiness people who are in poverty are unhappy
and then people who you know you hit about 70 grand and you're you're pretty happy and that's
about as happy as you're gonna get because after that you start get diminishing you start you start
to get diminishing returns so you can you can make double tripled up that you don't double or triple
your happiness yeah because those are all the things that are good yeah so I mean that's that's
the thing where if you get another girlfriend you're like oh I'm really happy for a short period
for a period of time and then like you know it reverts back to the mean and so then you're like
oh I gotta go get another new girlfriend or you know you publish a book or something that makes
you really happy after a year or two you're back to where you were before and you gotta you gotta
go forth and try again you always refer back to your happiness so you always gotta strive
to get up there uh you know again and again and again so we've we've we've implanted you with
the orgasmatron um so it was called the orgasmatron I think it was orgasmium I like
our gasmatron I like it too um the orgasmatron is barbarella we've it sounds more like something
you do to somebody rather than just like a state of b we we we we give it to anyosh
who is already the happiest person in the the whole wide room in the world he's now happier
we then we turn it off for an hour for repairs okay yeah do you turn do you put it back in
I imagine I would want to at that time but what's the problem because otherwise you're the
protagonist and brave new world uh no I understand uh the problem is that I don't consider that real
happiness I consider that the same kind of happiness that you get from taking heroin
couldn't you do both couldn't you couldn't you be on there couldn't you have the orgasmatron in
there and like well why is this a limiting factor couldn't you oh if I if I could just like you
know take some drugs the evening sometimes I mean I go out and get wasted every now and then yeah
I mean if I could just occasionally plug it in have a have a fun evening then I might be willing
to do that yeah it would just be if someone took away my ability to not be on the orgasmatron then
I would be upset but you wouldn't really be upset I because you'd have the orgasmatron
depends on whether I have the ability to think or not while the orgasmatron is going on kind of
yeah you're just really you're just really happy you're just nine or ten all the time you're in that
you're in that that kind of state that we were talking about earlier sounds too much like um
self modifying to the point where I'm no longer a recognizable person really is not yourself right
yeah so we're assuming that you have a self but that's a that's a whole that's a new episode
that is another episode yeah this isn't philosophy bites we can we can link to an episode on the
self there um so it's kind of like I'll go out and voluntarily take drugs some time but now
say I'm going to start or rather someone's going to start giving me drugs without my
without my informed consent beforehand and they're just never going to stop like that's that's sort
of where it's at right so it's like well you're happier now what's the problem but it's like
well I didn't ask for this and now I feel like I'm a different person than I was and if you'd
ask me before I would have said no well I think that's the reason heroin junkies are so sad uh
to to us I mean I I know I keep bringing up the heroin thing and you're like heroin junkies aren't
that happy and no they're not I had to point at the time of injection to get you know the bliss
which is great but we do consider their life sad because that's all it is just
even if they never had any downsides if it was just a constant bliss that would still be really
sad there's nothing else to their life you could replace any human with the same human and it wouldn't
really make a difference I'm sure that there's plenty of functional happy people who also take
heroin yeah I hear a lot of doctors we should we should we should make up a drug because it's
like the problem with soma can we just call them soma that's good soma that sounds awesome
was the drug from baby world so yeah the issue with heroin is and really any hard drug is that
it stops becoming about this is going to feel great and this is going to make me stop feeling
shitty yeah so it's more of a like it just makes the rest of your life suck and you just you're
trying to get more leveled out as opposed to really enjoying it like your first couple times right
but even orgasmium or soma or whatever we're calling it I would consider that sad because
there's just that one brain state there's no change there's no challenge you could swap out
any human for any other human at that point if they were all just maximally happy it wouldn't
matter if you had six billion people or one person yeah because every person is just a copy of the
same happy person yeah that's not horrifying to you you you would just keep I mean at that point
are you I would prefer a paperclip maximizer where the paperclip is a person in the maximum state of
happiness you could tile the universe with maximally happy person and that would be okay
I mean it's better than pushing the button I'd rather do that than push the button
like I don't I don't know if there's anything so I think the only I think the only thing that we
have to do at that point would be to just copy the amount of people as many times as we can right so
then we wouldn't want to limit growth we'd want to I mean we'd still want to maintain within resource
limits but if we could if everyone was equally as happy then we just want to make as many of
those as possible I would say at that point you had wiped out the human race and it wouldn't
matter if you push the button or not because that's that's not the human race anymore so
so I put some value on being human and having a human race around the definition you like the
definition you like having the label I I stop identifying as human yeah I don't think it's
just the label I think it is it is a ontologically different thing from what you are describing
but if your goal is to achieve happiness and this is constant happiness even if you're not a
even if you're not a human if you even what if you are just transhuman we should have tabooed
the word happiness an hour ago I feel like we're talking about shit yeah we should wrap this up
actually it's getting a little bit too but uh yeah so I feel like we're we're equivocating a
lot on what we mean by happiness so I don't think like the happiness that that humans today enjoy
and that they value it's the same kind of thing as orgasmic right I don't think that would be
happiness anymore that would just be a chemical state I take it I take back the whole button thing
if anyone has an orgasmium I'll take that instead I would take it for a few hours a couple times a
month you know yeah yeah just just just once just just once the first one's free Jesus so so what
do we what have we learned in this episode hypotheticals are when you when you first came in
here talking about pushing the button I didn't think you were a scary person like I know other
people would think like someone who'd wipe out the entire race if they could have scary but to me
it wasn't scary just like to relate to that you know now that you've said that you would be okay
with just reproducing the one happy person throughout the universe I find you a scary person
which is an interesting thing I didn't think this is where I would end the night nor did I know
that about myself until just now maybe next time we'll talk more about effective altruism although
you're still you're still awesome we can have different you know philosophies about the end
state of humanity and still be cool with each other that's the life lesson here people yes if you
can look past your if you can look past your your extrapolated volition differences even if you
don't pull her opposite things you can still be friends because right now you're not you're not
creating you're not necessarily in charge of creating the future but yeah I think next time
I want to I want to talk more about effective altruism I think that that's a fun broad topic
that is very popular in the rationalist community but also I think very transferable to everybody
else so maybe we can get Peter Singer into the studio here oh man that'd be awesome we can try
getting him in over skype I don't know if he's got time yeah well no I doubt he would fly out
today we'd have to I bet you we could do it if we made a big enough donation I don't know if we
have that kind of money yeah but if we did that would definitely be the way to do it because
then his coming here would mean a huge like decrease in pain and suffering what if we could
just all write bad checks just does that justify the mean no I don't think it does at least he
certainly would not say not agree to that and then neither would I do the whole truth thing
which we gotta have a we gotta have an episode about lying at some point yeah I wouldn't necessarily
endorse any there I was more I was just trying to make a joke but yeah well you also just gave away
like I hope Peter Singer isn't listening right now because you just gave away the part secret
yeah damn they're real checks Peter swears he's this is not that much money in the account
no there's times I'm I'm I'm super loaded that two trillion dollar check is totally
wipe out malaria if you come to the show all righty should we wrap it up then
and yeah any any last thoughts anyone want to get too really quick or I really wish that before
we come here like two years ago I read a comment on this wrong called suffering is valueless
which made a good argument I thought at the time I don't remember most the content now
which is why I want to go back and reread it I wish before we came here I'd reread that
because it had a an argument for why suffering should actually be considered valueless in ethical
theories and I will find that and send it to you and ask you what you think and then we will not
talk about it on the air because you know that'll be in the future and right now we're in the present
I want to see it too that sounds interesting okay and anything you want to plug or anything you
want to pitch yeah you should we can put two websites in there we talked about what can you do
right what can you what can you do if you if you think that we should destroy the destroy all life
on earth what can we do instead of that we can put up give well and then there's there's another
website I forget the name of right now but it goes over it's called like 8000 hours I believe
80,000 hours 80,000 hours that's more yeah once you're working part-time right 80,000 hours you
can put that in the in there that that's gonna that's like well you only have this much time
what's what's going to be the most effective use of your time so like what career based on your
skills and what you kind of want as a job in life little if I kind of give you give you a path
there fantastic we will link those both good resources yeah for sure well thanks for sticking
it through if you made it this far in this episode it was interesting if not necessarily a happy
topic yeah so thank you for joining us yeah we'll see you again in a couple weeks that's it thanks
come on fight
