that all progress is illusory or small i feel like i said you're just explaining away things
that would be counter evidence before you even have a chance to really interact with it uh he
also getting back to the actual thing that sparked our entire debate says that we correctly noted
that spencer does not publicly endorse any violent actions so he asks are we alleging
that he privately endorses violence we spent a lot of time arguing that peaceful ethnic cleansing
is not possible but even if we're correct our argument isn't really relevant to the question
of what he thinks is possible so if someone supports an impossible policy that does not
license you to accuse him of supporting some alternate policy and i think there is there is
a level where that is no longer true if if someone is advocating for something as ridiculous as
deporting quote unquote peacefully one third of the population he has to know that it has to be
done violently uh even if he like didn't understand that at first it would have been brought to his
attention very quickly and then to continue to support that policy despite the reality of its
effects on the ground means that he no longer cares that it would end in violent results you
have to at some point modify your rhetoric when when it becomes apparent what it means right
yeah i i mean i mean you could say well it's only violent if they resist and it's like yeah but
they're going to that's just this is one of those things where it's like you can just look at the
world and like i i think i feel like a lot of these positions that are being brought up are like
things that are just thought about and like no one even considers what it's actually like
out in reality and the reality is that yeah when you try and pull me away from my kid
i'm going to resist and then it's going to turn violent well you know that's on you for resisting
no it's on you for coming in here trying to separate us right so that i mean i think if if
spencer was being honest about wanting a peaceful ethnic cleansing then he would say he wants the
government to raise taxes on white americans to such a level that we can afford to buy out
one-third of the nation of all their property at fair market value plus whatever premium they would
place on the fact that they now have to uproot themselves move somewhere else get new citizenship
learn new languages and all that if you can give some i know there is a level of money where i would
be willing to move to australia or or port not Puerto Rico's in america or columbia or something
give me enough money and i will give you my house and my car and uproot myself and go somewhere
else but it's going to be a fucking ton of money and so if spencer is actually honest about this
he will say yes i want to raise tax rates on all white people in america by 50 for the next
three decades or however long it takes to raise enough money to buy out all these people so they
will happily voluntarily leave the u.s and if he isn't saying that if he's just saying oh we want
a peaceful ethnic cleansing and he knows that what that really means is throwing people out
against their will then he's he's a liar he is avoiding saying the words that we should punch
him and kick him and kill him if need be while obviously presenting that as what's going to what's
going to occur that first version where you mentioned like raising taxes doing it that way
i i find myself liking that in the same way that i like the intellectual honesty of like religious
fundamentalists who are like well every word of the bible is true i think they're wrong and i
disagree with them but i at least like the fact that they're consistent and so that like i don't
like what that vert that argument say if someone is making that i wouldn't like what they're trying
to do but damn i admire your consistency and your willingness to think it through and you know
bite the repugnant conclusions and just run with or not the repugnant conclusions the unfortunate
consequences yeah you know so like hey if you're gonna do all that i just agree with you but props
for thinking it out right at least you actually are advocating for a real peaceful cleansing right
i feel like that's plenty of very time unless we want to give him something unless there's
anything else we want to get on i have one last thing you got it sorry to keep trying to take
it off and no no i know you're you're tired of this but i think yeah i predict i won't be the
only one who feels that way you're okay so he said that since we personally literally asked
saying what we would be interested to hear what comments of ours were quote unquote horribly
backwards he says upon further reflection i probably shouldn't have used the word horribly
and i apologize the main topics you discuss are actually pretty good at being neutral with a few
exceptions he lists even more so than uh journal mainstream journalists which kind of seems like
damning with frank praise to me yeah it's like thank you yeah right okay you're better you're
better than boz feed well i mean you're better than sounds like even like cnn or whatever you're
better than box yay but on the other end he meant it in in i know a good spirits i know yeah
thank you for that i'm just making light of it he says the what usually what gets to him isn't
and the any specific topics but mostly things that are tossed off as an aside in the middle of a
podcast that bother him that betray a left-wing perspective some examples are when i opined
that human society is pretty good at figuring out what's moral and katrina joked that maybe this
is in doubt considering the election results and everybody laughed and he's like oh because
everyone's obviously anti trump haha i was like okay i mean well everyone in the room was yeah
and i'm not going to pretend that i'm not leftish and anti trump because i am and at least i am
putting my biases out there so you know them sure sure he said that in ash mentioned that he uses
emojis and work email at katrina suggested that his ability to do that and still be taken seriously
is due to his being a man and in ash readily agreed i thought about that i don't know i mean i did
readily agree at the time does he have a point that that's bullshit and it has nothing to do with
gender i mean i think another factor that we didn't discuss in the time because we did it really
quickly it was like different jobs that you have if you work in a small office yeah like my last
job it was a very small office me and two other people and there are both women and i was the
only guy there would be some some emojis back and forth yeah but that i mean that was we only
wrote emails kind of as a courtesy because we could literally just shout to each other so being able
to be taken seriously is like there's more there's one one factor to it than just yeah if you're
writing an email to corporate and it's way out there i do see what katrina is kind of getting
at though yeah i mean i also see what he's getting at two that i automatically went oh yeah i do get
more respect because i'm male i get the feeling i probably mail people generally do get more respect
though i will say that i will say that i take anyone who writes in comic sans not very seriously
regardless of their gender no do not use comic sans in your emails if you want someone to think
that you are being professional um and then he lastly says that uh when steven asked what the
manic pixie dream girl trope is i described it as used by white male directors because obviously
white people are boring and uncreative and in our shop and said well at one point in our said old
white men are the worst and fuck these white dudes ruining shit and he says because that's not
anti-white right even though you would never say that about any other when you're when you're
standing on top of the ladder the only people you can yell to other people are standing on top of
the ladder right yeah but no i'm just i i i see his point and i think that's actually a very good
point and i feel bad about doing that now and you are right i will try to lay off on saying that
sort of shit because that is also bullshit yeah i know i'm saying old white men are the worst yeah
yeah no like like i i feel like that's going to spur a whole other conversation but i do
like i i definitely have thoughts about the use of white men as kind of an invective i understand
why it's there like i do i really do i'm definitely brought up and it bugs me because i'm like if
you replace white men with literally anything else even if you'd say white jews it's the most
socially it's the most socially acceptable group to slam because of privilege it's it's it's it's
it's the whole punching up thing basically you're not you shouldn't be there should be no group
that is socially acceptable i kind of agree like i i think that like it's i don't know for a while i
didn't really it didn't really bother me but you see it so much and you see it included in really
intellectually dishonest arguments and it's part of the reason i've kind of like like it was cute
the first few times but it's been going on for decades now well yeah but i mean it's against
like negative sweeping generalizations of anybody right yeah yeah and so uh it could be that someone
might say oh you're just as a white guy you don't like hearing people say shitty things about white
guys like well hold on but you don't know me i also don't like hearing people say shitty things
about other people yeah and so i like again i like the rule of like being able to generalize my my
morality as much as possible and yeah i mean so drawing exceptions is weird i've heard people say
yeah this white guy was really loud annoying at the meeting i'm like wow you would not say that if
he was black yeah well if you said if he did you'd be an asshole but like it's okay if you say that
he's white and that like that is sort of weird it is a great double standard that can see where
that bugs people and i'm on board with that and i do recall just not too long ago hearing
someone complaining about someone who was kind of loud and obnoxious at a meeting
i think in the same thing yeah and then and then ended the sentence with it was a white guy of course
i was like what do you mean of course would you have said that if someone was being kind of stingy
with a tip and he was a jew of course well then well then he wouldn't have said anything right
yeah so no i your point is well taken and i will try to not do that sort of thing in the future
for what it's worth i took the impression that you're saying that's somewhat tongue in cheek
but it is the sort of like joke that there's no reason to keep making so yeah and we can
debate this but do you want to just decide now that we're not going to engage any more of his
stuff on the air and that if you want so you can i feel like that's part of the problem with like
discussing things is there's a little more no that's it okay i mean like future correspondences
because then it sort of just becomes like spending a lot of time engaging this one person with their
one ideas and it's not like giving way too much air time to ideas that we think are kind of gross
play but i don't know play but you're because because like it's it's it's kind of cool to have
someone with a differing viewpoint being like yeah you know like i like like i i consider myself
like i don't know i guess a left leaning moderate but like you know having someone who actually
believes like stuff on the right it's kind of like i'm not gonna this sort of call them a
bunch of names but like this sort of talking with people who are not on your side is really
important right it is what keeps society peaceful and then specifically one person because it seems
like in the last it seems like in the last two or three months like a 25 percent of our airtime
has been engaging this one person oh really okay and so okay i thought this was his first
email back to you from i i see your point i think that we don't want to give too much air time to
something like this but i do think it's it's good to engage it at least somewhat and the first
couple times yeah and to be like we're not running away from your issues we disagree and here's why
whereas opposed if someone was just to be ignored they'd be like well obviously they have no kind
on arguments which is why they're just ignoring me well that's why i invited him to post this on
the website or the subreddit okay and then that way you can be engaged by everybody
and if people are being dicks to you for whatever reason i'll try and shut them down too
uh that's the whole thing be nice to everybody and you know well it can if you find their
positions are pugnant say i find your positionary pugnant not you're a disgusting person yeah yeah
yeah no i'd like like that that's definitely the field of the podcast and like and isn't that kind
of the rationality thing is is like hear everyone out you know yes it is so oh we do have one last
thing in our last episode mr oliva wrote in saying hey what's up with katrina haven't heard her in a
while uh so we should probably mention at this point that katrina has become more and more busy
with her work to the point where she's basically working two jobs right now it seems like two and
a half ish yeah so she has not had time to be on the podcast lately and she says that looks like
it's going to be the case for the foreseeable future so unfortunately katrina is stepping back
from the podcast and she'll still be on every now and then for maybe certain specific issues that
she's really passionate about but uh it sounds like she's no longer going to be a regular feature
of the show she actually let us know this through like a quick message like i think she's that tied
up and we tried to get her to like record something that we could attach which we might be able to do
today for this episode it's it is unfortunate and i missed her contribution so we've been trying to
have at least a third person on for every episode to have somebody to engage with but it's not the
same and if you're noticing the lack uh we are too it was a very different perspective that she
brought to things and i really appreciated that because steven and me tend to agree on a lot of
things which makes for less of a diversity of opinions yeah it's it's less fun i guess that
sounds like about it i do have one thing to say that we have a few patreon supporters thank you
very much that's super awesome you guys rock yeah i mean it makes a big difference i think our
hosting costs are now covered yes our hosting costs are now covered for the website awesome so yeah i
mean we we still don't make any money basically off of this but at least it's not costing us a
monthly fee anymore it's not for what it's worth in yosh is paying everything so it's not costing him
any money right uh yeah but uh please feel free to support us on patreon if you want just a dollar
an episode or leave us a review on itunes that also helps or just let people know if you like
these episodes and thank you everyone has always has already done so yes and you can comment in
the various me places we mentioned on the subreddit or on our website great cool goodbye everybody
take care later
