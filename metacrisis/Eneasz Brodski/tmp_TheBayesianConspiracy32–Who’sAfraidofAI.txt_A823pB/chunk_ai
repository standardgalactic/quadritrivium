Both sides kept coming through, raping their land, taking whatever they wanted. They didn't.
They were living in a lawless anarchy land and they basically got by by forming very tight cohesive
family bonds and they were only loyal to their families and everyone else could suck a dick.
And they were rather aggressive and it's the the Reavers. They were actually called Reavers.
They would go out and raid other surrounding areas and take their stuff and bring it back
to their villages because that's how you survive in that sort of situation. And they eventually
came and some number of them came and settled in the Appalachians and the American South.
And that that sort of culture is still pervasive in the US in various areas. You can see it.
It's it's I know at least one person who who comes from that sort of culture
and I do think it's destructive. It's it's a bad culture. It is a low trust community.
It is an aggressive community and it is very much ruled by tribal loyalty to to just the
small group of kin and all outsiders are suspect and evil. Yeah, that's that's not like like
and and they're white. I think you're white. No, no, I have a shitty culture and they're white
and I can see the argument of how some people would consider that you know human nature,
but I don't think it needs to be human nature. It doesn't. I think it's the nature of that
culture, but it has nothing to do with human nature. It's it's not necessarily. No, like the
culture can hopefully be changed and we should be able to override that. I mean it will take.
I imagine it would take generations. You cannot do that in the course of one person's lifetime
right, but like when you grow up with that it is internalized, but
over time. Yeah, I think it could be fixed and that to me it feels like that is a thing that he
would call human nature that you were born to parents who are like this and you will be like
learn behavior. It's not and to me it's a cultural thing. Yeah, I absolutely would buy that. That's
that's a learn behavior. Like this is how it is. This is how we do things and I mean maybe there
are some genetic influence on it too. Maybe people who are naturally more aggressive due
to their genetic disposition do better in those sorts of cultures. So those sorts of cultures
still encourage people to to I would say it's always a little column a little column B. Right.
That's always the answer. I'm saying at least partially that is learned. I'm not saying it's
a hundred percent, but it's at least you know part of the way it's learned. So to be
people up to get food. I mean when we talked about this not too long ago when Sam Harrison had
a Sam Harrison when Sam Harris had his talk about God, what was it? Who was the talk with
with the races with the race issues in America? Yeah, that was with a Greg T. Lowry. I think
okay and and he brought up Greg brought up the point that it was just him and one of the person
was at three people. It was two. He brought up that if you're a young black man in the inner
city on the bus and someone scuffs your shoes, you can't let that go. You have to put up an
aggressive air because otherwise you will be victimized by other people who see oh look that
guy's a pussy. So you have to start a fight over him scuffing your shoes and now there's beef and
now people are going to die and that sucks and in my in my opinion that is another example of a
shitty culture and and I think this is where he gets this thing about black communities can't
be raised the level of white communities that there are certain cities that are majority black
that have that sort of shitty culture but I don't think it has anything to do with race. No, it
doesn't. It's not it's it's it's reinforced within that community like it's it's it's something to
do with crappy cultures. Yeah, it's an it's not crap. I think it's an accident of history and it
could have gone the other way but the fact that it went this way reinforces the position that oh
it is or it is a genetic thing that is it this is just your guys as you know genetic problems
and then that uh you know if that's your if that's your belief and that's your
policy making motivations then you're not going to like try and fund schools in those areas because
well they're doomed anyway and then things will just keep getting worse or at least won't get better
and so like it's I can see where this does come down to like sort of a base ideological difference
but it's one where I I'm I'm fine saying I think uh GT who wrote in was what is wrong there uh
I mean I I'm trying to be as like polite as I can about it but I think you're that I see
I think I can kind of see where you're coming from but I think you're just factually incorrect
like like not just ideologically but like as a matter of history and uh observation sure yeah
no like I like I like I think there's a there's a very strong emphasis on this like nature over
nurture thing when most things are both like you pointed out just a few minutes ago like it's
like yes there are things that are kind of that kind of come naturally to humans but that doesn't
mean like saying it's all human nature it just seems like a cop out like it's it's it's like
well let's not make it any better let's just leave it let's just and if you're gonna say it's just
human nature it's on you to explain why human nature is different among different populations
of people that have nothing in common other than like you know so if it's just among poor people
well what is it like are they genetically poor like if they'd inherited a million dollars would they
would they stay poor like the the argument is that yes they would squander the money and be
poor again within a generation well there's there's different that and the when you said is there
how is it that they're on these timelines they have evolved differently the argument being that
up until very recently and starting again actually there was this thing called a sort of mating
where generally rich people would marry other rich people and generally poor people would marry
other poor people which does in fact usually happen and that is what reinforces these sorts of
bad genetics of of managing money or whatever and in my opinion that's more of the thing of
the the reinforcing a culture staying the way it is because people don't cross contaminate their
cultures at all they they they stay they only know what they know but you know that their argument
is that it's a genetic thing rather than a cultural thing if anyone's curious i can dig this up
there's a really great write up for like why someone who was raised in a poor environment
if they happen to make you know if they somehow get $30,000 that they immediately spend it all
and that they don't have anything to show for it two years later this comes from positions that
make internal sense to the to people and like if you come from a place where it's a whole long
thing but there there is a position there and a an explanation there that doesn't fall back on
well last you know i just thought about it and this would seem to make to make the most sense
you know like i guess i'm not sure what how you would reflect in your own human nature or something
but the decisions that seem rational to people and you can't really fault them for given their
upbringing i think and i i get where like that seems wishy-washy and leftist wishy you know
wishing thinking but i i i challenge that i think that that it's i i guess i see where you're coming
from as far as how the timelines could have worked out but i still kind of call bullshit and
there's there's also the whole thing where when you're poor if you come into some money
you're surrounded by all your friends and family that are also poor i i people often say well
why don't you just save up you know a hundred dollars a week and and over time or maybe that's
too much save up ten dollars a week over enough time you'll have some amount of savings so that
you don't go bankrupt if suddenly you blow a tire and you have to pay spend a hundred dollars on a
new tire and then all of a sudden oh my god your bank overdraft fees are happening you have to borrow
money from a payday loan place they want all this extra money back and and it just is a cycle
but the problem is when when you are poor and you have nothing if someone comes to you and says
dude my tire blew out please help me you're like i'm sorry i can't help you i don't have any money
if you have some money and someone comes up to you you're like well you're my brother you're
my sister-in-law you're my uncle you need this money right now here is my money and so you can't
you end up not being able to save money not because you don't want to save money but because
you're a decent human being and people that you care about need money badly too yeah like how do
you justify putting money into savings like when you know for only 25 more dollars a month you can
help pay your grandmother's rent so that she's not left homeless at 80 right or your eight-year-old
niece can actually have that cavity filled instead of being in pain yeah constantly right so i mean
that's that's just like a matter of like low resources and then yeah that that that generates
habits and that's where like i mentioned yeah and then people are like well just stop smoking and
you'd save a hundred dollars a week on cigarettes and but you wouldn't save a hundred dollars a
week on cigarettes you'd give away those hundred dollars a week on other things like that and then
you wouldn't have the the slight relaxation and relief that comes from smoking cigarettes as well
so you're making your own life worse and you can't save that money anyway yeah which is a bummer
it's a thing i'm not sure how much more there's worth engaging here and let's go and keep going
well the his third thing was same-sex you same-sex unions can acquire the same respect as traditional
marriages which to me is come on weird on a number of levels because first of all the amount of respect
something is given is not a nature of anything yeah biological societal values yeah exactly like
what the fuck is he even saying and also does he not has he not read any history books there were
many times in history we were same-sex unions had just as much yeah respect as traditional quote
quote marriages i mean also like how much respect people have for regular marriages these days
anymore either right right like oh you know gay marriage that's that's abhorrent that's out of
the question but you know if you want to get married three or four or five times go for it that's
there's nothing wrong with that like maybe and that that's not fair maybe i'm i'm maybe on straw
manning someone might actually take a stance against both equally but i don't think that yeah
that the number the amount of respect that a person gives something is a relate to the whole
to anything that could be called human nature i don't know if i feel you i feel you're taking
a snapshot of the current conditions and using that to like kind of apply that to the idea of
human nature and like something that's immutable yeah my thing's very myopic yeah he uh i'm not
even going to bother going on he made he i mean do i don't want to like paint him in two negative
of a light but he kind of made a pro lynching argument which i'm not going to repeat because
lynching first of all killing people ever is bad but extra judicial violence we've we've already
said we really are not a fan of which is what lynching is and lynching is literally terrorism
and i cannot get behind state approved terrorism against one's own populace it's just fucked up
so anyways he goes on to say that on any issue where there seems to have been moral progress
an honest conservative will say that the progress is illusory or it came as a result of external
factors or it was actually regress or it was genuine but very small and to him it makes far
more sense to hold people to normal human standards of morality that we know are reachable rather than
to be disappointed that humans are not acting ways in the way that your pet utopia requires them to
act that's a huge cup out well and you can't you can't explain away any contrary evidence by
saying well i have these four categories of of fully general counterarguments that'll fall into
so if you point out well like look for example violence went down in the last century you know
people are way less likely to die of violent deaths than they were 500 years ago oh well that's
that's uh that's barely progress or that's illusory or you know like you can't you can't take any
sign of progress and shove it in any of those buckets kind of a priori right like you're
declaring yourself immune from contrary evidence i want to say that i thought this was sort of a
decent point it it hit me close to home anyway because in our ethics episode i had i put forth
the position that any system of morality which breaks the people that adhere to it is is doomed
to fail and you can't expect humans to hold on to it that it's it's just going to die out like
the shakers who who believe that people should not have sex period and they died out after generation
because they didn't have any children um it's that sort of thing and i i use it specifically
for the sort of morality that i have seen harm people in my life where they they put the welfare
of other people including strangers in such a high regard that they neglect their own lives and it ends
up destroying them either financially or emotionally and that really sucks and that is the sort of
thing i was speaking against so yes i do think that a morality that is impossible and that damages
the people that hold on to it is a bad thing so i agree with him in that regard but i mean on the
other hand but but you have a much more higher bar for where you think people can reach yes exactly
like i mean it works in your mouth but it's it's it's it's almost like he's putting forth this
this weird dichotomy of like of like well either you're just accepting things as they are or you're
striving toward utopia right where it's like it's like okay but i mean things progress is incremental
happens very slowly like like even if you don't perceive it to be a net good that does that mean
it's not and we can focus on specific problems you know so like we can we can eradicate specific
diseases that are killing people and that's progressed by any measure you're dead people it seems
like this weird like fundamentally philosophical view of of how things should be when it's like well
there's like a shit ton of nuance going on here that's why i feel like it's such a cop out i you
know to me it's it also feels kind of like a cop out because i mean you can you can say that a
system of morality which says theft is immoral is one that is not uh not one that functions for humans
because due to human nature people will always steal or something and i kind of think that at
that point it's bullshit your system of morality should say that theft is unacceptable and once
you get to the point where well it's human nature to steal and so any any system of morality that
says theft is bad is doomed to fail like you know let's screw you there is a level of things that
we can reach for and that we we should reach for and that really humans can accept without breaking
themselves so it seems to me like he is arguing that something very simple like give a modicum of
human respect and decency to people who are gay is like beyond what humans can achieve and and
it is a pet utopia to try to enforce that and like no just be a decent fucking human well it's also
it might be impossible to universalize like peter singer level charity but it's clearly not impossible
for humans to do because humans have done it at least a few but then then you can just point to
like oh they're just violating human nature well then if you can violate human nature that's the
same as subverting it and saying that you know we don't need to fall like there's there's the really
there was an entire community of people that subverted human nature to the point where they
didn't have sex anymore yes well and i mean you know violent resistance to oppression might be human
nature and yet uh gondi and his his group didn't or did nonviolent resistance the whole that's kind
of my other problem with just human nature arguments if you can it it's human nature when it works
for your position and it's you oh they're just violating human nature when there's a counter
example and if you can't or maybe they could do maybe they could have some convoluted way of
coming up about how on how like that supposed subversion of human nature was actually linked
to some other form of human nature and that that that form was stronger than the other human nature
i don't know like it seems like a needlessly complex and convoluted model right yeah you want
to put it to power and explanatory power i'm just i'm just thinking can set like like total
total like i'm making this up this isn't what i believe but like i'm just using a total bullshit
example like gondi you're like okay so so if it's human nature for violent protests and then but
then we say like oh well gondi was you know he was totally a pacifist and he resisted and you
could say oh well it's also human nature to want fame and he just wanted fame and that's why he did
and his his his his want for fame was higher than his his want for violence or something like that
so they i mean they could probably come up with some kind of work around to that and then it all
kind of stems the same thing but i you know it doesn't really change how i feel about it it seems
like if your philosophy says that it is human nature to dislike people of different skin color
and we can never change that but uh it's also human nature to be violent yet we expect you not to
murder people it seems inconsistent to me yeah that if you can expect people to not murder others
then you can expect people to be decent to people who are a different skin color
so there's there's an argument that and i'm gonna just turn this up to 11 just to draw
drive this point home um it's likely true that in the ancestral environment rapists had more
offspring than non rapists because you could impregnate a woman i'll say rape i'll say male
rapists probably had more offspring because you could pregnant a woman never see her again
she would have a kid and you could go on to do that as much as you want and yet that's not the
kind of human nature that i would think even gt would be behind right um and i mean we can make
this less disgusting and just talk about like other primates right um okay so it's a it's a
nightmare possibility of historical fact that this probably went down somewhere either in our
ancestry or in a cousin's ancestry um cousin species but that's still not the kind of thing
that you would want to endorse or just like throw your hands up and say well it's human nature we
got to just roll with it especially now well that's that's progress right yeah so uh to say
