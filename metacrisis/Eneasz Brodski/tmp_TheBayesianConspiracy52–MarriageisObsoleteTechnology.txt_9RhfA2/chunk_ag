Marriage isn't seen as a 24-hour check cashing place.
No, but what's the guy's name?
Bernie Madoff.
Yeah, there you go.
That was a giant Ponzi scheme.
Right.
And it wasn't made off until the moment he got caught.
Right.
But again, he got caught.
It was actually illegal.
Right.
But who's calling him on it?
Whereas the Black Mirror episode, it was perfectly legal and so was marriage.
Right.
I get the analogy that you're trying to make.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm just saying the analogy doesn't go as far as you want it to go.
Yeah, I know.
It's not the best analogy, but it's analogous in the fact that normally fraud is illegal.
And I feel...
But this isn't fraud.
This is...
No, it's not technically fraud.
There you go.
In the same moral wheelhouse because of how much you're signing away and how little you
know beforehand.
That is a travesty.
Yeah.
As I said before, I will never support ignorance on any contract.
Right.
Let it be marriage, whatever it is.
Yeah.
But that's a general statement to make.
If we solve that big problem, this marriage problem goes away.
A lot of it goes away.
Right, you go.
Yeah.
So let's defend this.
Personhood, we disproved because if I kill somebody, the other person's unliable.
So assets are shared because, and the only way I can defend this instantiation is to
go back to morals and to go back to self-identified wrong beliefs of society that we have somehow
for lack of will, don't have the ability to correct.
Okay.
So we think that it is a man's duty to, or let's say...
Let's put it on the...
The higher earner's duty.
The higher earner's duty to save and to kind of help the lower earner until they get to
the next step.
Right.
Which I mean, that's one of the reasons I am grossed out by this whole thing is because
I do not want to have a higher earner, lower earner sort of relationship.
I want to be in a partnership with an equal person.
But that's not...
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
We are...
A marriage, we define these things by majority.
Right?
A lot of people do, yes.
I mean, that's how the law gets passed anyway.
So what are we talking about here?
I am talking about ending up in a master...
Right.
You want a power equal footing for everybody and equally knowledgeable...
Yes.
That would be a considerable marriage arrangement, whereas what we have is a throwback to the
times when there was master and there was servant.
Right.
And that is the extent to which the median morality exists, therefore, what else is
the system could you have?
Yeah, the median morality is kind of shitty.
Great.
Okay.
That's the median morality.
What do you mean?
Oh, why are you defending the median morality?
I'm saying the median morality is shitty.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What else can I defend?
How can you say the median morality is shitty if that's the median morality?
Because it's shitty.
I mean...
Why is your information better than what the median morality is?
How do you know...
How do you have conviction in your right... in your righteousness?
If I didn't... if I wasn't convinced of that, then I wouldn't be coming on this podcast.
There has to be someone at some point that says, look, I know the median morality is
that slavery is cool, or I know the median morality is that women can't own property
or have jobs.
Right.
I know whatever the median morality is, is the median, but it is not good and we can
do better.
We can do definitely better.
Okay.
But I am saying the shitty bit is the issue there.
I'm not going to not talk about it just because I'm not in the majority.
No, no, no.
I'm not asking you not to talk about it.
I'm just saying it is the median morality.
Yes.
That is how most people go by.
That is what I am here to defend, median morality.
So when you say it's unconscionable, it's not unconscionable.
I apologize for putting you into the position of having to defend the median morality because
that was...
No, that's fine.
That was shitty on my part.
No, no.
It's shitty on my part because I accepted this ridiculous challenge.
Okay.
No, no.
But let's... when you say it's unconscionable, it's not unconscionable to the median morality.
It's unconscionable to your morality and my morality.
Okay.
That is my argument.
So it's unconscionable.
Right.
It's unconscionable by definition.
It's only unconscionable to people who follow this subset of morality.
Again, it depends on how you define the unconscionable by definition part.
There are people who would say that slavery is unconscionable regardless of...
Great.
If that was the median morality, that would have been great.
I mean, that would have been the truth of the land.
That would have been a law of the land.
Yeah.
Right.
But there are even the people who were in the minority back then, the Bentham's that
said slavery is unconscionable, they were...
Right.
I'm not saying you were wrong.
Possibly wrong based on the median.
Okay.
I'm not saying you're right or wrong.
I'm just saying this is the median morality, so you cannot...
So we in this room cannot throw words like, it is unconscionable because it is unconscionable.
I both can and I do.
What's the point of having these words if I don't ever use them?
No, you can use them.
I'm just saying it means different things.
Okay.
When you say it is unconscionable, the word left out, it is unconscionable to people
who think like me.
Okay.
Well, I think at this point we are running in circles around something that doesn't address
the root of anything.
Yeah.
I don't know whether we can say that the majority is wrong.
Yeah.
It's the majority right or wrong.
Yeah.
So...
Okay.
This is bad advertising.
Right?
All right.
And bad self-research.
Uh-huh.
Right?
So when I say I would defend the institution of marriage, I meant that people, I believe
that pair bonding is good and I believe that there should be a contract if we...
Let's take two things.
I believe pair bonding helps humanity.
Check.
Definitely.
Okay.
So as intellectual capacity increases, there's a tendency to write down things that we want
to do.
Yes?
Yeah.
Pair bonding has helped people, human beings, to the reason that we know.
So it would also help this more than Dunbar collection of society.
The intersection of that is what I call marriage.
Okay.
And I will defend that to the death because we're just putting rules on how I treat whoever
I want to pair bond with.
This instantiation bullshit is because the state comes in.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that's my point.
When I say I will defend marriage, I will defend a piece of paper with rules on it that
tells me how I have to treat somebody I pair bond with.
Okay.
Let me process that for a minute.
I mean, thinking about it, yeah, if you pair bonded with someone and you guys wanted to
write your rules down on a paper, that's actually probably a good idea.
Right.
But scale that to society.
Scale that to more than Dunbar.
It'll work for you and me.
Let's say you and me decide to pair bond.
Yeah.
Right?
And we write down how we want to treat each other.
Okay.
But why would not Steven and some other person who also just copy that?
They, I mean, they can use it as a model, but they should probably...
Right.
That's the point.
