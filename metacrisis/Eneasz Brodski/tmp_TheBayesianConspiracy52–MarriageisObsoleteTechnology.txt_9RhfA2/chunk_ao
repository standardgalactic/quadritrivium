Yep.
Well, thanks again to Kyle and thanks to Naveen for coming back on.
Yeah.
Thank you.
No problem, Duzan.
Sorry for the bad marketing of my position.
No, this was good.
I had a lot of fun.
Yeah.
This was good.
Thank you for not being more clear when I asked for it.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Sorry.
But I did want to plug one thing.
The project that I mentioned when I was here last time, Standard Meta, is now live.
And people are using it.
So tell us again quickly what it does.
It's a self-regulation framework for crypto projects.
So again, going back to our hatred of the government creating regulations, it's a self-regulation.
It's a bottom-up approach to what the STC would do, but it's a bottom-up approach to
it.
Awesome.
Okay.
Thanks.
Bye.
