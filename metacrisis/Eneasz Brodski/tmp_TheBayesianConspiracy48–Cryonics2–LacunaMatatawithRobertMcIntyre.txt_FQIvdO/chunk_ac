calculator in its own right because you can still do your taxes on it right you press the buttons
that adds the numbers that's what a calculator does and you know between neuroscience and pure
science I think it's very clear that the brain is a computational device and so the brain can be
emulated the brain can be copied the same way that other computational devices can be copied
which is maybe very difficult to do so and then the other thing like neuroscience is that
the brain clearly is a is is more of a static structure than people people think it is because
you can pull someone down in ultra round hypothermia or because you know there are many situations you
can can cause to happen where there's no electro activity anymore right you know that there is some
static structure that's sufficient to capture all of your memories and that was very exciting
because that means you don't have to scan someone rather arrive the minimum thing you need to do
is figure out how to preserve someone right so you know originally I wanted to uh figure out how
to digitize brains I saw that that the technologies for doing that in an active way are really really
famously difficult I went into AI actually to hope to you know build something that could figure out
how to do upload it right because it seemed like such a hard problem that maybe you need to step
back and work on building better tools but then after figuring out a little bit more about you
know what you could viably do as a minimum sort of product for brain banking that you could actually
preserve a brain instead of having to scan the whole thing in and digitize it I thought you know
maybe that is practical maybe you can use some of the tricks that people have come up with over
the last 50 years and actually make a brain dating technique that could preserve the information
and provely preserve the information and that seemed just about tractable and I felt like I
could maybe do it and uh there was a surprise and I really wanted to win the prize so uh I did that
you you make it sense is you're like oh here's a prize let's go and try to win it but you know my
dad and I were uh I went on this walk and was like son what would you do if you weren't doing AI right
and I thought about it then I was like well I'd figure out how to bank brains you know
because that'd be also a pretty valid thing to do yeah and uh we actually that night I was like
actually that's kind of kind of a neat idea that's before that a bit so we went and read a bunch of
cryo biology literature and we weren't really very impressed uh because like 1950s you know
was finding polgay uh figure out how to preserve sperm with glycerol and if you look at the current
cryo biology papers a lot of them are still talking about preserving sperm to the nth degree
so there's not been too much progress over the last 15 years or so and so you know we were
a bit skeptical but then when I saw the brain preservation foundation right and they were
talking about just preserving you know synaptic connectivity and evaluating it rigorously with
electron microscopy I thought well you know cryo biology is maybe not the right way to be thinking
about this um sort of they're trying to preserve brains and they're trying to preserve metabolism
and it's really the preserving metabolism part that is is a difficult part so they're actually two
competitors for this brain preservation prize which I you know started volunteering for and one
of them was uh was 21st century medicine and they were doing the cryo biology approach right
so their goal was to preserve the brain and preserve the metabolism right and they were
running into a lot of difficulties because that is a very hard thing to do and there was another
team in Germany that was trying to prepare a brain for electron microscopy right and so of
course in the process of of doing that we would have had to have preserved the brain insufficient
quality to win the brain preservation prize and so they were trying to preserve brains and
stain them with heavy metals and turn them into plastic so that you put them in an electron
microscope and so they were still not really doing just the core of of the problem right and I was
like I'm just going to put both of those things together right because because the hard part
from the McCoolis technique was not the initial preservation it was the staining and plastic
embedding that's necessary for electron microscopy and the hard part from cryo biology and the weakness
was um you know you can't store a brain that's been just preserved with aldehydes for 100 years
and cryo biology had the total opposite um they had a really good answer to long-term storage which
was vitrification but they struggled at the early stages of the preservation process to
efficiently lock down biomolecules right and so I used the short game of the of the German guys
on the Pula and the long-term game from the cryology guys and put them together our is it
is are you and your team the literally the only people working on this in terms of just preserving
the brain right now you know uh in some ways every neuroscience lab in the world touches on
brain preservation to some degree or another um because if you want to study the brain you
got to do something about locking structures down but as far as I know we're the only group that's
focused on whole brain preservation with the explicit goal of of developing memory preservation
so first of all that is terrifying I thought there were more people working on it but second of all
thank you so much for doing this the good work of this this is just I I I do not know how to express
my gratitude enough I second that sentiment well you know I think it's I think it's pretty it's a
pretty wild you know riot and I really hope I can get something that that's a good solution
and you know basically the deal is um we can preserve whole connectomes right and the question
is is preserving a whole connectome sufficient to preserve memories and neuroscience gives a
tentative yes right now but uh anything you can do to make that uh less tentative is going to be
very useful so uh you know over the next uh couple of years uh you know we're kind of gearing up to
focus on how to do memory preservation right and uh you know I think that that's doable um because
you know I proved that I could preserve all of the synapses in a brain but I didn't have to scan
all the synapses to do that what I did was I just said look anywhere you want and if there's even one
synapse that's disrupted I lose okay and Hayworth looked in 10 different places and decided it was
good um and so you know I think you can do a similar trick for proving that you can preserve
all the memories it's not so much about totally reconstructing a brain right which is economically
infeasible and really difficult it's more like constructing weird experiments that look sort of
like zero knowledge proofs where you know you wouldn't be able to sort a group of 10 brains
of the two different groups without accessing some type of information that's correlated with a memory
right or you know arguing about here's like a transfer function of how you know a set of neurons
were and here's you know us approximating that transfer function with sufficient detail to replicate
the behavior right um after scanning it in like those types of things and I'm actually working
right now with with several neuroscientists to try and put together you know what those
experiments look like it's something we've been thinking about very carefully over the last two
years but I think that is tractable I do think and and there's already very interesting results
like it's already in the literature that you could optogenetically so so here's the experiment
all right and this exists in the literature if you put together a few papers um although it would
be useful to do it explicitly um but here you go all right you have 10 mice all right and uh in each
of the 10 mice you're going to label two ingrowns okay that kind of represents a place memory all
right and one of them is red and one of them is green so you know uh you got the kitchen and
that's green you got the living room and that's going to be red all right and then in five of those
mice uh you create a fear memory of the kitchen and the other five you make the fear memory of the
living room okay and so it's just a single memory and that's the main core thing that separates the
two groups of mice all right and then you preserve all their brains with your brain preservation
technique and then you can do anything you want uh after you've done the preservation but the goal
is to sort the 10 brains into two groups okay and if those two groups then correspond to the
two original training groups then that's proving that you've preserved one bit of memory one high
level bit associated with you know were they afraid of this place or this other place um and if you
can't sort them then that technique's worse than a technique that can sort them right you can always
argue maybe if you had better analysis you could sort them after all but I like these types of
approaches because they're creating kind of a new empirical system for evaluating preservation
protocols and that's that's a new science that I think we ought to have is you know being able to
evaluate memory preservation brain banking techniques uh really rigorous like this and that
is the next thing that you're going to be working on or that you are working on right now yeah so
uh let me let me uh back up just a little bit you won the small mammal brain preservation prize
are you working on the large mammal one too is there is there difficulty scaling it up to a
larger animal no so to give you an idea um I mean the whole point of this is I want to scale it up
to humans yeah and I wouldn't have designed it in a way that wouldn't scale easily because to me
there's not very much of a point and so the the key deal here is you're doing perfusion right so
you're going through the vasculature of the animal and um no matter how big that animal is the the
circulatory system is already designed to deliver blood oxygen and sugar to every single cell right
so if you can co-opt that system for your own use um and use it well you're going to get to every
cell to give you an idea of the scalability of this it took me about seven months or so uh to
make this work for a rabbit brain okay um and a lot of that was chemical development and uh guess
how long it took me to modify it and build the machines design them and uh get it ready to work
for a pig brain uh three more months it took me five six weeks it took me five hours
and it worked awesome um that was designing the machine and building it and and and preparing
the chemicals for us so you got the large mantle prize pretty much on lock youth that you think now
well so uh we submitted for the prize and um i have independently evaluated some electron
micrographs from those pig brains myself and to me they look pretty good um i think it's it's
definitely a contender uh they're being evaluated right now so um we ought to hear more than that
pretty soon but i would i would give it a you know higher than 70 chance that we're going to win that
prize now i'm i'm really curious about this since the since the fixing the brain first with the
um aldehydes was it maldehydes um it's a it's a glute aldehyde which is a part of this chemical
class of of aldehydes that include formaldehyde acrylin balanda hide all that all that good stuff
okay so since fixing the brain first with an aldehyde and then taking as long as you need to
to put in cryo protectants and then squeezing it slowly it seems like such a superior technique
are alcor and ci adopting this technique in their preservations well uh no but there's good
reasons why they wouldn't want to um and the main reasons come from a it's a very demanding technique
if you're going to fix something with aldehydes you really almost would need to be there right as
the animal dies right okay and preferably you actually um euthanize the animal as part of
the preservation process um it's much less forgiving in in some states that's legal and
i totally am hoping to die in one of those states if possible but but uh you know alcor um for better
or worse you know if you look at their recent preservations right uh they wouldn't be very
equipped to to actually do this for individuals because there's generally a lot of time after
death before they start getting preservation procedure right so an initial flush of cryo
protectants will to some degree open up the vasculature an initial flush of gutturaldehyde
is not going to do that for you and then the other part is this almost philosophical debate
which is you know a lot of people don't like the idea of uploading um or don't like the idea of
sacrificing this metabolic ability if you care very much about preserving the actual like cells
that make up your brain then it's almost a non-starter to glue them all together right um
because the most realistic way you're going to get someone back from a procedure like this is an
advanced imaging technology that's going to create a digital simulacrum of that brain while the
original brain like the original antikythera mechanism is permanently fused into the solid
mass that is never going to work again right and you know there's some debate over that because i
mean like i would still argue that if you're you know got some kind of crazy direct slurry of
nanotechnology or whatever that it'd probably be easier to cut crosslights than to infer structure
but in any case well and do they even need their original brain back with advanced enough technology
couldn't they just regrow if they if they're wedded to an organic meat body could they just
regrow a brain and structure the neurons so that they are mapping to the the preserved solid glue
chunk of brain that you have is yeah but some people some people believe that that wouldn't be
them huh if they are copied just be a copy you know those that come in uh common deal right it's
kind of like you know if you were writing your term paper you know and then suddenly your computer
dies all right and now you don't have your term paper anymore and you know the sense of dread comes
because you really needed this and you know you don't have time it's it's too really soon uh it's
due the next morning right if someone then came and said oh hey actually uh there's a backup of
this in the cloud okay yeah uh impressing keys and now suddenly you have your term paper again
you know some people might feel like now their term paper is back some people may start crying and
say but it's not the same term paper it's not the same bits that it was you know and so some people
will feel that way about their their brains as well so because it's not the same one so because
of those people Alcor is not not implementing this thing well I wouldn't say that but I mean uh
if someone signed up for something that they that they thought was one way and then they changed
to another way that might be you know a problem oh I see so we oh so we almost have to petition them
to start another track of services where they will uh fix the brain I mean not right now obviously
but after there's been more development down this track well you know people like Hayworth have said
that they don't think Alcor should be preserving anybody um because if you don't have a technique
that you know preserves synapses for him it's like a non-starter right and so you know Hayworth
probably argues that um until such time as you can show that you're preserving synapses right um
there's almost no point to even doing a technique at all you know that's tricky because that competes
with this idea of well let's do the best we can right and and hope that the future will be able
to fix whatever we did wrong and then then you've got this problem of well what do you define as
the best we have right because now we've got this technique that is sort of the best cryobiology
technique in the world okay um but it doesn't have evidence that it that it really preserves
synapses right you've got another technique that absolutely will kill every cell irreversibly
right but if you look at it with an electrical microscope it looks really pretty right you know
what do you use depends on how you're viewing the problem I think I'm less worried about you
Inyash or about this than you are Inyash uh I don't plan on dying this month so I'm hoping that
you know in hopefully several decades there will be fines to the best available practices that are
you know out there and it won't well I mean when you talk about they it's it's literally just me
that's working on this right now so uh I do wish that there is more than just literally one guy I
do regret um but hopefully in 40 years that won't be just you I mean that's when you say hopefully
in 40 years I I was much more optimistic about those sorts of things when I was in my 20s I'm
like yeah people are working on it and now that I'm like in the later half of my 30s already
I'm like oh my god two decades have gone by since I first started becoming aware of this thing and
it's been two decades without much progress like I'm actually down to the point where just saying
I hope people work on it isn't enough several more decades could pass I don't plan on dying
in that I don't think I'll be dying in the next few decades but I want to have been made a little
more progress than was made in the last few decades you know well I mean look when when
biology was first you know coming onto the into the forefront people sincerely believed
in the 60s that we would have some reversible suspended animation in five years and I mean
really respectful people believe this similar to how you know like Minsky literally at the
Dartmouth conference assigned the entire problem of computer vision to like two grad students as a
three month project okay you know just just make computers be able to see like how hard could it
be and it turned out that that these things were way harder than anybody could have imagined and so
you know this we're going to get it pretty soon sometimes that doesn't happen right and I was
really motivated to try and make it happen because you know I think we've got a good shot of doing
it now we know so much more about brains and memories and we've got all these cool chemical
techniques and there hasn't been too much effort towards you know approaching from an information
perspective that there's a lot of rolling fruit and it's a it's a good thing to be doing yeah so
how do you how do you get funding for this right now because I can't imagine that it you know pays
for itself well we have funding from the national institute of mental health and we work with the
synthetic neurobiology group at MIT the Ed Boyden and we're working on connectomics
technologies right so this this this thing I made is the most advanced brain banking technique in
the world and if you want to use it to really study brains at especially human brains at the
nanoscale level there's nothing else that can can really do that and and preserve samples for
