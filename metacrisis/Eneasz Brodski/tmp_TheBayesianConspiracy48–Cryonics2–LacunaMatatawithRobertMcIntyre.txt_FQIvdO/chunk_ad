really long time so one project that that I'm literally am working on right now like in mixing
chemicals for it as we're talking is this idea of taking a brain that's been preserved with
altitude statewide prior preservation and being able to do useful things with it such as preparing
it for electron microscopy so right now I'm banging my head against this this problem of
staining and plastic embedding for electron microscopy that that Nicole has you know been
struggling with for years and it turns out it's really hard problem it's kind of kicking ass right
now but today hopefully we'll finally get something that that's that works really well so how terrified
do I have to be that your funding is going to dry up and you're going to have to like go get a job
doing accounting or whatever well you know I want you to keep working on this for a long time is the
I basically committed my life to making this work so you know I'm going to figure out a
way to make it work no matter what we've got we have some private funding as well which we'll
get too far into but it's a little it's a little precarious now I guess I do think that we're right
on the cusp of people you know really seriously reconsidering this whole idea of preservation
and pouring some more resources into it and part of my job is to explain that well and get
excited about it so you know I think a terrific job of that I'm optimistic about about the future
you know I got a it's kind of my responsibility to keep next home alive and funded and be able to
do some of this good research one of the really exciting projects that that I'm very interested
in is preserving the first human brain um with allied sewage crop preservation um in a research
context uh you know so this is like if someone who but donates their body to science and then
basically slicing that brain and having it independently evaluated um and actually you
know working out what the real time course is for brain degradation after death um human neurons are
tougher than a lot of other neurons like animal uh neurons of rabbit mouse etc um and nobody really
knows when the connectome degrades in a human model um that research just hasn't been done at
least I've never been able to find it and I've looked pretty extensively and so you know figuring
that out something useful so that we could say you know two hours after death the connectome's
still there five hours after death it's not there that type of thing um I suspect that
number's two hours but I don't really know um and so you know getting some of that research done
in a research context I think is is key right because then you're going to be able to say
here are the parameters by which we can guarantee that we can preserve your connectome right is
there anywhere that like I personally and maybe any other listeners that are are moved to can
donate to help fund this sort of thing I mean donate money yeah um you know right now I think
it makes more sense to do it from a you know for profit perspective as a company at least I want to
I want to try that out okay and so you know we focus more on getting grants um but I mean if
anybody's interested in talking about it more um I'd be more than happy to talk to them we can thank
you you know me at at R at Neck Tome R at Neck Tome yeah R for Robert and uh be more now to talk
to anybody who's who's curious about it or wants to learn more about it or you know all that good
stuff and Neck Tome is N-E-C-T-O-M-E dot com yeah okay excellent this crap we've been going about an
hour um did you want to do I do I'm assuming you have important things you need to get back to
yeah I need to go uh need to go prepare my osmium tetroxide stain now and and try to kill myself
doing it and uh got some got some meetings uh later on in the day so I am gonna have to run
but it's been a real pleasure talking with you it has been fantastic uh I I there were so many
more things I wish we could have gotten to but maybe some other day yeah well you know if you
want to get into the details of of electrolyte cross spear really anything uh more than happy
way to do another one I assume you edit these things and don't just post them raw right yes so
you know if you want to do another another hour like next weekend and then have two to put together
who could do that especially if you wanted to prepare you know some questions or something
and you know sorry for being a bit hectic today whatever you want to do uh possibly I will have
to check with Steven and check our calendars but uh next week or maybe the week after uh that sounds
really good yeah cool okay sounds fantastic thank you so much for joining us and when you have a
moment uh go ahead and drop me an email and we'll figure out at another time well before I let you go
Robert thank you again um this was one of the most riveting conversations I think that I've had on
the podcast and I think one of the most important I uh I guess I try to think of multiple ways to
express gratitude but thanks again this was fantastic and uh you know please keep doing what
you're doing a lot of us are counting on you and while we were talking I I finally got that thing
done so I was a bunch of powder earlier now it's finally a nice golden solution so fantastic there
we go cool all right well thanks again see you around bye bye bye we can just dive in and say
you know and for listener feedback we can do it in the standard order and then just cut and paste
at the end if you want okay all right all righty today we would like to thank Alexis Goldeski
for helping support us uh you make this possible and help bring it to everyone else thank you very
much Alexis and because we don't have Kyle Moore this week to do a sound effects for us we're just
gonna go dun dun dun dun thanks Alexis yeah you're awesome and moving on to listener feedback
Eddie loved to comment on the website on the social media and outrage culture
episode and I think that was one where you and I talked about engaging in arguments with
really uh savvy wrong people like that climate science denier guy so Eddie said regarding the
need to be more informed to win arguments I think that street epistemology is a perfect tool for
engaging with people who may know more about a topic than you do even if the topic at hand is
well above your level asking questions like why do you believe this is true is a good way to encourage
the interlocutor to examine their own position as an outsider by the way they've gotten into the
sd crowd on facebook etc sent our episode on it so thanks cool that Eddie I hope it's working for
you yeah I actually just had something similar happened yesterday where I was talking to my mom
about uh how you probably I heard shouldn't take vitamin d late at night better to take it in the
morning uh because your body usually gets most of its vitamin d from the sun and so possibly might
uh disrupts sleep a little bit if you take it late at night and I was like yeah I don't say don't
believe at all that sounds like bullshit that's a load of crap I don't know why you're telling me
that it's like okay I mean that's interesting but why do you believe that and I was like uh I just do
it was interesting to see the change on her face when I I didn't challenge her belief I just asked
her why she believed it you know and that made her actually stop and consider and we talked about it
for a little longer after that yeah and it's not a question I think most people ask themselves when
they think they know things regarding I guess that thing in particular I just take a daily
multivitamin in the morning because I think for the most part if you eat anything like a balanced
diet you don't need vitamins because you're getting enough of everything but since I don't it helps
and then there's always the controversy as to how much your body can really absorb from a
multivitamin right yeah I don't take ones that have like 5000 percent it's the four dollars for
a hundred that you get at target or whatever I figure for a few cents a day it's not a big deal
exactly I can spare a few cents a day there's there's more things to be worried about than
whether people are you know wasting a few cents a day although you can take too many vitamins and
hypervitamin toxicity is a real thing or is it hypervitaminosis I forget which
turns out that vitamin k is a treatment for hypervitamin toxicity okay I don't know what you
do if you overdose and vitamin k well let's ask a scientist anyway regarding this so that I think
that the the fundamental questions what do you think you know how do you think you know it that
sort of thing and just straight socratic method you know what do you mean I guess asking naive
clarifying questions I think that would work great on the casual conversation with like you know our
moms about over the counter med they're taking or people we bump into at work about whatever right
yeah but with a sophisticated arguer like that climate science denying guy I'm not convinced
that would work it might be worth trying for fun but I feel like they would have answers to that
they I mean I'm sure that Grover Norquist would have and I know Ken Ham does too for all the
questions that you can ask him about creationism yeah I get them feeling that what was his name
Horquist Grover Norquist Norquist would be much more capable of like an actual dialogue
ham would just say like well you know we have that answer it's in this book no no it's like
Ken Ham knows all the answers he goes in debates I just I saw part of his debate with with Bill
and I and that's what he kept saying oh really and I would ask like you know well what about this
and he's like well we actually know that it's in this book I don't know if you've heard of it it's the
Bible oh my god so yeah I mean it's like it like he's clearly not playing the same game right maybe
it wasn't ham maybe it was um I know there's some people that that are creations that are much more
researched on that and have answers like well you know if you do this and this with the biology
then that happens oh sure like yes you can get I so I don't think I give Ken Ham the sophisticated
arguable status like Dinesh D'Souza or Francis Collins might be right where you talk to them
and they would talk about things like macro evolution versus micro evolution that sort of thing
but if you're coming in from you know where Socrates claims to come from and like I really
don't know anything I feel like you wouldn't know if you heard a really good bullshit answer
whether or not it was bullshit and I mean it gives you it gives you a tool to dig with
yeah for sure but they might have this bedrock that while wrong is solid enough that you can't
dig it anymore right yeah but um but it's better than just trying to it's probably better than
trying to challenge them on things that you have a like weak understanding of so I guess
maybe this would be worth trying at some point I wonder if we can grab somebody that we disagree
with at some point and bring them on for something fun and that knows a lot more than us about a
topic that shouldn't be hard to find no it should I'm sorry you went to school for more than a month
you probably know more than us awesome well thanks Eddie I like that that feedback and that's
something to consider hell yeah I have some feedback this was on the subreddit we were referred
by ceremonial Carl Popper to a post by Sam Zedat or Sam Zedat maybe I'm not sure this is the
website where we talked about the scene like a state I got about half of my material from that
website so I got some respect for it I'm going to greatly cut down the what is said in the post
just to get to the real meat because the guy is very loquacious what's the term for when you use
more words than you necessarily need to one word for it is long-winded another way to put it is
thorough okay yes very thorough I'll give them that and by the way have you read any of this guy
have you read any of the last psychiatrist no I swear to god I have this conspiracy theory
that after the last psychiatrist retired from blogging like a year or two later he was like
I want to start again but I don't want to start as the last psychiatrist so now he's posting on
Sam Zedat instead because sounds absolutely like the last psychiatrist how do you spell Sam Zedat
Sam ZDAT oh that's not okay just like it sounds yeah I don't remember the name of the actual
poster of this which is terrible I hate it when people have a name in their blog title but it's
not the name of the person but anyways this is for our social media episode first of all the
article points out that Tristan Harris is selling an app so he has sort of a vested interest in making
you feel like you are addicted to social media that I believe that app is called time well spent
or something it's a way to reduce how much time you're spending on social media oh sure and so
he's like right away aha monetary motive but he makes some very interesting points he says
Facebook records two billion monthly users if they pay five dollars a month then they won't need
to addict you because the whole point of addicting someone is to get revenue through
advertising if you get revenue from this five dollars a month you don't need to addict you right
he goes on to say avoiding the attention apocalypse is cheaper than a pack of cigarettes I guess
apparently none of that is so addictive for them to risk charging one 30th of a smoker's budget
if social media isn't worth five dollars a month to you then what does that say about how you value
your time and if the responses all my friends are on it and they write interesting things
then how little do you value your friends time goes on to say the classic critique of media is
that it tells you what you want to hear media tells you what you want to hear but sharing it tells
others what you want them to think about you so sharing an article tells your friends that you're
the kind of guy who shares this important article so anyone interested in the addiction article
either has a problem or wants to gloat but focusing on the problem people they need to
understand why they keep doing a thing being on social media that does not satisfy them further
they need it explained in such a way that they are not to blame this is precisely what Tristan
what Tristan Harris offers an explanation for why you have no power and why some other has it
the problem with advertising and media interest in heres is not that they fail to provide you
what you want is that they give you exactly what you want all of the time and you just wanted the
wrong thing which is why i say that he sounds very much like the last psychiatrist they very
much have a vibe of stop being a shitty person and stop being narcissistic and really look at
yourself and fix yourself in a in a really non-sugar-coated way and and i liked that article
and i just wanted to share that a little bit too so can you paraphrase was he pro tristan
harris or anti tristan harris he's anti everything he's kind of anti humans but
somewhat anti tristan harris anti social media anti people who use social media anti people
who complain about using social media too much that sort of thing okay so there's nothing he's pro
then because like it sounds like he's pro like he and he and tristan harris agree that we're using
social media too much yes but he's pro growing up and being a goddamn adult and recognizing
that the reason you use uh they're both very big on narcissism the reason you use social media is a
narcissistic impulse to present an image of who you are to other people sure and i mean that's
really what social media is for right here's the pictures of me when i'm having the most fun and
looking the best here's the articles that paint me in a good light because this is what i'm in uh
worried about this is what i think is important and so uh he's saying that that is a narcissistic
thing and it is damaging to people and probably to society in general when there's a lot of people
like that that are more concerned with the uh style and the image they're presenting than the
actual substance of their character yeah you won't find any disagreement with me on that as far as how
people like that's why people share what they share on facebook right well about half of them
probably the other half just like cute doggo pictures sure but they're the kind of people
who want people to know that they share dog pictures everything's just sharing dog pictures
you just like the cute dog it's signaling all the way down right um yeah so uh Tristan has this
app and i'm looking at it right now isn't seem to me like any more uh less good than like those uh
like an adblock app or what are those ones i forget what it's called but because i've never used them
but you can set up apps that you can blacklist certain websites and say okay once i have this
extension and go engaged on chrome it won't let me look at facebook or any of those apps for uh
you know three hours or something because i want to actually work yeah productivity apps yeah
so i i guess i don't see why do you bring up Tristan Harris's app because Tristan Harris was
really big and all over the media recently yeah but like he so he has a motive to share this but
yeah like he saw a problem is trying to fix it and if you can make money while doing it that's
just a win for him too right right but i don't think that i didn't get the impression anyway that he
you know kind of made up the problem and then provided the solution for it right so like that's
like what a snake oil salesman does right this doesn't seem like snake oil it sounds like he's
actually trying to sell a solution to an actual problem yes i i think Tristan Harris is doing
good work by sounding this alarm which i guess we a lot of people are already aware of it but it
takes someone oftentimes to stand up and say hey this is actually a problem before people are willing
to acknowledge it and also kind of providing a thing that can help the the last psychiatrist
and those sorts of blogs i'd really like to be very cynical about everything right on i can take
part of the brand not without incident on the subreddit says again about social media i think
that dispassionate cynicism or disengaging is probably more dangerous to humanity than
unwarranted outrage and i don't know what do you think about that because i'm kind of of the opinion
that unwarranted outrage is probably worse partly because that gets you things like lynch mobs and
also because it gets you uh recently eliezer started posting another sequence of posts slash a new
book and uh he mentioned that there is a nutrient solution that some premature infants are given
to treat a condition uh that they're born with which is lacking a very important nutrient uh
it's one of the omegas the point is this nutrient solution is basically poisoning and killing babies
at a rate of maybe a hundred a year or so and it's super easy to fix all you got to do is swap out
the soybean oil with fish oil it's cheap it's easy there's a decent amount of people that know this
