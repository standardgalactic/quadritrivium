and yet we as a society cannot get it done you just due to fda regulations and other things you
cannot get that nutrient solution for your baby that will not poison it if it has this problem
and he mentioned that one of the things is if you bring this up like to try to get attention
to the issue and fix the issue there's not enough outrage left in society to to be outraged about
a hundred dead babies a year we're too busy being outraged about you know what some celebrity said
or who is being a douchebag on twitter recently and so that is sapping all of the outrage that
could be used for actual productive things like saving babies lives to just fight in the culture
wars i think i agree on both counts i'm certainly certainly my my intuition was the same as yours
that like if you're just cynical all you're gonna do is just like sit at home and think about how
dumb everyone is but if you're outraged over nothing you're inclined to get online and ruin
someone's life or help ruin someone's life or yell at people in real life or something right
um you know warranted outrage is totally i think a thing that you know as long as your your outrage
is productive i'm i can get behind and understand right well first of all yeah the outrage fatigue
though yeah if you're getting fatigued you have something productive to do at home you know that
requires physical labor but you burn all your energy working out then you can't actually get the
work done and the working out doesn't actually do anything for anybody then you're wasting all
that energy right and then allows you falls apart because you get healthier but whatever right
this you just get sicker yes but there was a woman who she had like 150 twitter followers and
tweeted some shitty joke before traveling to uh to africa did you hear about this yes yeah so
she said go in africa hope i don't get aids and then her second tweet was just kidding i'm white
yeah i mean whether or not it's a funny joke like i feel like a comedian like sarah silverman
could have got away with it right but it's one of those intentionally offensive jokes that is in bad
taste yeah might be funny if you're in the mood and you know it's even it's funnier too if it came
from so do the reputation as a comedian right but so what ended up happening the the quick version
is that she tweeted this out you know again 150 followers she's not sitting there on top of a mountain
of a million followers i don't know what's a big number that's probably a lot while she was in
the air for 10 hours she like hit number one or two on trending on twitter and she was just ripped
apart and then when she landed she's like oh everyone hates me i've got a million death threats
and i've lost my job um so like i feel like people get online to rip her apart bad joke or not even
if she meant it or rather even if she this was coming from a malicious place which i'm not convinced
it was i didn't read the full dissection of what happened here but and unless she's working in public
relations that probably doesn't have much of an impact on her job to be making shitty jokes yeah to
be making shitty jokes it is interesting though and i do have mixed feelings about like do you want
somebody who believes bad things to be working for you right on the one hand like their beliefs don't
really you know if you were a neo nazi you could still do your hunting job just fine i could but if
my black or jewish co-workers knew that i was a neo nazi that would make working with me very
difficult in the office probably sure and since you have to work with other people that can be an
issue well like i said i feel like even louis ck or another comedian could have gotten away with
this right it's also just weird because nobody had ever heard of her because she had 150 twitter
twitter followers and this just exploded and set her life on fire so um because people at home were
like i'm outraged at this and i think that brings up something that we need to talk about at more
length at some point that i really understand that response and i don't really get being offended on
behalf of other people um like who's like is that joke offensive to me maybe but it's probably
definitely offensive to somebody but should i be offended for them and if i am do they have to stop
right i don't really get offense but that's a whole other thing we should definitely do an episode
on offense deal i will say though that on the other hand lots of dispassionate cynicism gets you
to quirrell voldemort quirrell from methods of rationality i mean that was basically his shtick
he is the dispassionate cynic and that's when you can sit back and watch atrocities happen and be like
yeah well you know humans gonna be humans first race war huh oh summer first race war huh um so
that's that's also a problem and dispassionate cynicism could just as easily get you the same
thing as like so a hundred babies a year die whatever i don't have time to switch out my oils
that's true and that race war thing was a rick and morty reference so we're not really laughing
at race wars um aren't we though pointy nipples versus what uh spiral nipples yeah yeah so i guess
that's true maybe i mean the key you know i think with a lot of answers with a lot of things like
this that involve extremism is go for that golden mean ericetelian virtue and say look moderate your
outrage moderate your your cynicism leaves energy to be productive because yeah if you're overly
cynical then you learn that oh yeah this person did all these terrible things uh you know kevin
spacey last week had all those confirmed or those i guess confirmed he more or less said i probably
did that to some of these allegations i think it makes sense to have some level of of outraged
about that and there's you know a response that sounds appropriate um but then you can go over
the top and whatever some people someone probably tweeted i want him dead or it'd be great if he died
i don't i almost never feel that way about anybody but that's a whole other thing i think it kind of
goes back to all debates or bravery debates which is a scott alexander post saying that basically
a lot of reaction that people have is what they see their community going too far in one direction
and they're trying to pull it back and people in a different community who is going too far in the
other direction are like are you fucking crazy you want even more of this and so i imagine using that
as a model that not without incident is probably in a place where there is a lot of dispassionate
cynicism that's hurting him whereas we're in a place where there's a lot of unwarranted outrage
that's hurting us we're both right just in different places yeah that makes sense nice compromise and
i i think i stand by the fact that moderation is probably the key there first all was the
utkowski posts where are those at uh those are at lesser wrong dot com and by the way for anyone who
is uh or who used to be on less wrong dot com and doesn't know about this yet there is an effort to
an actual like real legit effort that seems to be gaining some serious traction here to revive
the lesser on community over at lesser wrong dot com oh it's at lesser wrong dot com yeah yeah and
they've got posts up by uh this v who i really like and elias redkowski and a whole bunch of other
big rationalist names which let's see we have an email here from satir so they signed it their last
paragraph here was asking about starting a rationality discussion society in our local area
what sort of essential skills and knowledge we would recommend i don't know if i'm the best
person to ask about that like we started the one here but that was kind of just like we had the
catalyst from the methods of rationality wrap-up party yeah and i just wanted to keep that going
i totally want to have a whole episode about that and include max harms on it yes so that is that
is worth coming that's on the list i wanted to let you know and there's another thing on here
that we might be able to hit pretty quickly um i think it'd be interesting if you did an episode
at some point where you showed how one implemented bajian skills for instance i've yet to explicitly
apply bayes praise be his name uh law uh they clarify that was tongue-in-cheek um yes so we're
one of those communities that's like by the way i'm just joking about this crazy thing
for myself i can answer that pretty quickly and that i've so far never put pen to paper
and calculated my my priors versus the impact of the expected evidence and that sort of thing
but the main thing that i do to adjust my thinking is that i realized that my beliefs about the world
are not the actual facts of the world yeah um the map versus territory distinction yeah and like so
that sounds super obvious and it kind of is in retrospect but it's not a distinction at least
i made on my own 10 years ago because what you believe about the world feels just like how the
world is right and your beliefs don't have to be i believe this or i don't believe this you can
say i believe this with 85 percent confidence or whatever you only have to assign an 85 versus 86
percent but you can say i'm pretty confident and those confidence levels i think keep you epistemologically
humble in that if someone comes to you with evidence against whatever belief you have
you're not going to say well that has to be wrong because i have this belief and it's right
you could say oh i didn't expect to see things like that because i was pretty sure this was right
can i bring up my parents again just because lately i've been trying to sneak some rationality
into their intellectual diet go nuts okay so i was talking with my dad he made this comment about
my sister was joking around with my mom and said that my mom needs to be on anti anxiety medicine
and my dad said no no she was my sister was saying that she needs to be on anti anxiety medicine
not my mom and my mom was like no she totally said i need to be on it and my dad was like
hmm you might have a point but i'm gonna go with 99.99 percent certainty that she was saying it about
you and not about herself and so my mom called her up and uh verified that she was talking in
fact about my mom not about herself and my dad was like huh okay well you know i said i wasn't
100 sure and at this point i was like okay dad i didn't say this at the time when you made your
confidence declaration but for for you to say that you have 99.99 confidence in something is
extremely much stronger than you think for example me and my friends every now and then as part of
our rationalist thing try to make some predictions about the future and we make a number of them
and if we predict that like 10 things will happen with 70 confidence we want to be right
for seven of them and wrong for three of them because that means we are accurately calibrated
if we were like right about nine of them and only wrong on one we would feel ashamed because
we were too unconfident we should have been 90 confident in those predictions or at least we
would feel wrong because i don't know if we want to encourage shame there but i was trying to shame
him a little bit for saying 99.99 i agree took two significant figure or significant digits into
it like one in a thousand chance of being wrong and something that minor that's one in 10 000 i told
him that if you had been us you would have had to make 10 000 statements of equal confidence and
only gotten one of them wrong and do you really think that was a statement that strong because
first of all you know that just as a human sometimes you hear things wrong and that was a pretty easy
one to hear wrong so that by itself should have dropped you down to like maybe 90 and also you
know your daughter i know my daughter she's kind of a person who would make a mean joke about my
mom needing anxiety medicine but never ever saying that about herself so that should have updated you
even more like i would have said even if i had heard with my own ears her saying that she needs
medicine once i heard someone saying no no she was thinking about your mom i would have been like
okay yeah i'm dropping down to 70 confidence even though i heard with that with my own ears just
from what else i know and so i think i think i managed to get through a little bit to him that
confidence is is more important than just saying well you know i'm almost positive take those things
that you know into consideration what you know about a person and what you know about how likely
it is to mishear something yeah throw in the fallibility of memory there and i'd be like you
know what you're probably right so it's you know it's it's those kinds of things where you
you help people think about their beliefs in a probabilistic manner rather than just right or
wrong yeah i agree um you know if you want to make a Bayesian calculator and do the math you're
welcome to but that's sort of to me just like an exercise in i wouldn't i don't want to say it's
pointless the the key is like not to say okay i guess it should be 86 confident not 84 because
what are you supposed to do with that information right but the idea is to to get some ability to
calibrate your confidences and like i said for me it's just keeping your beliefs about your beliefs
non binary right so that's that's my quick take on that i think that's that is a very good basic
rationality skill that doesn't take too terribly long to teach and really gets you on the road
cool yeah that's where i'm at too okay i have a post on the subreddit by rtlpu saying i've heard
the sentiment that children are boring a few times in the rational sphere and on this podcast
i beg to differ being around a child is watching ascension being learn in real time highly interesting
to me at least do we say kids are boring we probably said doing things with kids is boring
that's possible too i definitely i know i've said that because i think i might have been quoting a
louis ck bit where he's talking about watching them read cliford the big red dog at the rate of 30
minutes a page yeah and you have to sit there being super bored and super proud because it's
awesome watching them read and it's got to be satisfying but at the same time it's like the
story's boring you're reading in a really boring way but yeah i will say i was i was the oldest
of my siblings and i taught them things often and if it hadn't required a college degree i
totally would have gone into teaching because i really love teaching and i am still around
young kids every now and then and so i totally agree watching people learn in real time is
fucking fascinating especially when it's like a little kid and they first grasp for the first time
like that big things far away look smaller but that doesn't make them smaller you know
it's just it's really neat but on the other hand the majority of the time that you're around kids
you got to do things that are really fucking boring so i guess it's it's more of a if the kids are
your own you probably spend a lot of time doing boring life keeping kids alive maintenance chores
as opposed to the cool learning bits but you're i think you're definitely right there are some
really cool parts about seeing a new being learning things yeah teaching is a lot of fun and it's
gratifying you know to understand it while yourself what age level were you would you have
considered teaching at oh i'm like as a job after i got out of high school i'm sorry what age
would you want people to would your students to be oh so i could do like the early grades
between second and fourth maybe or i could do high school because in high school then you
get to start teaching them really cool shit right but i do not want to teach middle schoolers because
that was i i really should not say bad things but an entire class of people but but that was
referred to yourself as a middle yeah middle schooler that was a terrible place in my life
and i have very negative connotations of middle schoolers especially middle school age boys so
i would not want to be within a mile of them especially not in large concentrations i've
just personally no for sure i completely agree so i thought about teaching for a while i have a
couple family or a couple family members who are teachers oh cool and so i mean first of all if you
want to make half of what you make now teaching is not that hard to get into i don't think you don't
really need a full college degree to i mean depending on what level you want to teach and all that
you just need a teaching certificate yeah with various charter schools and such they they're not
public schools public schools down to you don't need a i mean maybe a bachelor's but um
often not i think i mean a bachelor's is four years of my life and like 80 thousand in debt for
sure but i think and i can double check this but when i was talking to my aunt about it at one
point she had said that it's not that bad to get into and certainly i think if you want to teach
second to or yeah second to fourth graders they don't need you to have a you know a degree in
whatever you're talking about because they're guaranteed to know more than them anyway when i
thought about teaching but you gotta know how to teach like teaching itself is also a skill
sure you can buy a book it'll be fine yeah i i couldn't teach kids i think i would be frustrated
trying to cross that inferential distance between just there's so much to get across to get them to
have any idea of what you're talking about and then you're just teaching them like times tables
and all that stuff and um i taught someone skiing once and it took me half the day on the slopes
just to learn how to teach them like you just do the skiing right and you don't think about it and
it's like having to think about what you're doing and how to explain what you're doing and get them
to figure out how to do what you're trying to say it's yeah it was it was a full day project because
half the time was just me figuring out how to say it yeah and like noticing what you're doing to make
yourself not fall or go faster or whatever right yeah so i believe teaching is a legit skill it
takes time to learn oh yeah for sure i was being tongue-in-cheek and i said you could grab a book
on teaching and master it in five seconds i understood it was a joke okay yeah to be to be
clear it is a challenging thing that i certainly don't have to do at that level like i've done i
when i was at college or when i was in uh at csu i was the teaching assistant for one of the classes
i taid but um i wasn't a teacher aid i was a teaching aid it's a little different uh actually i
think it was both um and it's gratifying you know you can explain stuff to somebody and then you
know when their eyes light up and understanding that's super gratifying but you know those were
young adults it's a lot easier i think for me in my personality style i had a philosophy professor
once who well at least he expressed to me in whatever capacity he could without losing his without
jeopardizing his job without teaching sucks and like the environment surrounding his teaching
sucks and obviously not everyone feels that way but he felt like he did more time more effort
arguing to with the board and the administrators to try and teach stuff the way that he thought
