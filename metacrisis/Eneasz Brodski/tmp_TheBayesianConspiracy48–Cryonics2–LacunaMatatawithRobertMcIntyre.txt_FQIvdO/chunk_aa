Hello conspirators! A couple quick things before we start this episode. Kyle Moore is still on
vacation so our sound quality is not quite what we would like it to be but I fear that even his
expertise couldn't have saved us on this one. Our guest Robert McIntyre was working in the
background in the lab that he works at throughout the episode and you can hear the equipment.
The sound quality on our end was mixed because of the way we had to set up the mics. I was in
the different room on a different microphone and we're coming in at all different volumes but it's
all on one track and it was a nightmare to edit so please try and bear with us on this one because
I think that even though we've had a lot of fun conversations on this podcast in the last couple
of years I think this is one of the most important especially to anybody who is sold on cryonics.
Some of Robert's work in this field is I think groundbreaking and will really change the the
terrain going forward so it's really worth powering through some of the audio to try and get
through this one. We are planning on having him back on in the near future for another episode
if anyone wants to send us questions to submit to him for that episode you can do so at the
subreddit r slash the Bayesian Conspiracy you can send us an email at Bayesian Conspiracy
podcast at gmail.com or comment on this episode on the website at the Bayesian Conspiracy.
Anyway try and uh stick through and enjoy this episode thanks.
All right it's supposed to talk to you guys. Yeah you too so uh. It's gonna try to do this.
We should start with saying hello this is the Bayesian Conspiracy. I'm Inyash Brotsky.
I'm Steven Zipper and my name is Robert McIntyre. Yes hello we have Robert McIntyre with us today
and Robert McIntyre is uh well I I met Robert at Burning Man when someone I think it was you
wasn't it brought up questions about bioethics just just sitting around in a in a tent chatting with
people. It was that lady who was uh it was actually a lady who was studying oh what was it uh
uh feminism through the lens of I forget but but she was studying like uh plays from
from the 1800s. Oh okay. And somehow from that we got into bioethics and then later on you came
up to me and you started a conversation about cryonics and I I had no idea who you were at the
time you were just like you know another cool guy at Burning Man uh but you started out I was
thinking a good place to start this would be possibly the the Dead Sea Scrolls uh comparison
that you brought up to me. Did you want to start? Oh yeah. Sure so uh the way I see brain preservation
um is that the goal is you want to preserve uh the data that's contained in that brain
so that you could then eventually extract that data all right and one uh way to be thinking about
this is in terms of data that's been preserved over thousands of years uh through various natural
circumstances so uh you know here's a good comparison between like Dead Sea Scrolls and
those that existed in Pompeii so uh when the when Pompeii got destroyed by this volcanic eruption
a bunch of ash came down and it just buried uh the whole town city type of place
so hot that there wasn't very much oxygen that actually carbonized some of these scrolls and so
if you look at them they are just they look like they've been burnt to charcoal basically black
incredibly fragile um it seems kind of hopeless uh that you could ever read anything from them
and they're still physically in the same about shape as they were uh when they were
buried and so recently up into the scroll rolls right yeah if you imagine you know
if you were able to kind of kind of cook some scroll you know at a really high temperature
so that it carbonizes but it doesn't actually catch on fire and turn to ash um it's it's like
charcoal scrolls and so uh google uh in in junction with this uh university actually
uh x-ray through these scrolls and unroll them digitally and you can read the text in them
which was very impressive um on the other hand if you have a hole in a manuscript which they call
rapuna um it doesn't matter how advanced your imaging technology is uh you're almost certainly
never going to be able to fill in that hole right because information is simply not there
to be imaged at all is the so you know the term lacuna does that deter for the hole or for the
scroll uh lacuna is a hole in a document okay so oh shit hold on i want to think about brain
preservation uh well another another very comparison is the anti uh catheter mechanism so this was uh
one of the first computers our lisa analog computer that was built by the greeks over
2000 years ago and uh it had this this crank on one side and uh you could spend this crank and
in this network of over 40 years would spin oh and hey rob tell you when holidays are going to be
in the future robert can i stop you for a second i am having issues with my wi-fi i'm going to go
downstairs and uh get hooked up hardline okay all right in that case we are back wonderful so you
had just yep sounds good uh lacuna is a hole in document a lacuna lacuna okay that's your
vocabulary word for the day lacuna it's a hole in a document that obscures the text and so you're
not going to be able to easily reconstruct that other than just by inferring it from the surrounding
text which the bigger the hole the rap more rapidly you get into basically being an impossible
problem yeah um so you know imagine you have a paragraph and then you just have a hole and
literally a physical hole in the middle of that paragraph um i think uh what was it you
ever seen eternal star sign in this spot was mine yes that was a great movie well that company i
believe was called lacuna right oh shit i have no idea the one that erased your memories i didn't
know what the word meant so the name didn't stick out to me at all yeah so i thought that was kind
of cute because they were going in and basically erasing memories you know putting holes in the
story of your own life uh and they were called lacuna as a company nice good name um and so
yeah so to get back to this uh anti-preparation mechanism uh this was a geared instrument that
was built by uh Greek uh mathematicians astronomers over 2000 years ago and it had this
crank that you could spin and a sister of gears a very beautiful object and it would calculate
when the next eclipse was or when the next holidays were going to be or where the planets were going
to be um as you turn this crank you would you know kind of advance forward in time and it would show
you where these uh celestial bodies are going to be um and this was super advanced it had what's
called a differential gear um they're kind of a gear with two sets of teeth on it but could uh
you know adjust the gear ratios and they wouldn't invent differential gears until i believe the
1400s or 1600s so super ahead of its time and then these romans came and kind of took the
anti-cauthera mechanism and it was on this roman ship um and the ship hit this storm and uh sank
by the island of antipathyra and all the treasures and things that were in that ship
to the bottom of the ocean got covered up with mud and salt and salt and such uh and they were
lost until 1900 uh when these sponge divers came and they got hit by a similar sort of storm and
knocked off course right on top of where the the ship uh the roman ship sank a long time ago
and they figured while they were there they might as well go sponge diving you know so the
the trip wouldn't be a total loss and instead of sponges they found to this day the still the
greatest uh buried or sunken treasure find ever um bunch of neat statues um a lot of cool you know
clay objects and they found this anti-cauthera mechanism as well but it was this inscrutable
hunk of mud encrusted gear types of things and they knew it was really fancy and and
see some of the gears right on the on the sides that were exposed but they didn't dare try to
take it apart because uh you know it was it was kind of lost cause right uh they were worried
they were gonna break it and so this is 1900 right and it was on earth in 1901 and it sat until
1980 or so when they finally had uh x-ray technology that could go and actually image through it without
disrupting it physically and then they were able to see the positions of the gears um and and figure
out uh how it was built and figure out you know exactly how it was working and now people make
versions of this kind of for fun uh you can even download one on your phone and spend these virtual
gears around you know a million times faster than you could ever spend the physical gear around
and it's going to do the same calculation that the original anti-cauthera machine did so you know
the the ocean preserved the arrangement of the gears with enough detail that we were able to go
and and create that same system again and those original gears are never going to spin again
but those original gears guide uh the way that other gears are going to be spinning
and you know so that's a long way of saying that that i think yotta emphasized
getting brains into a state where you could um in theory uh reconstruct them but the actual
functioning of the individual neurons you know like whether they can metabolize sugar for example
is it nearly as important as the data that's been encoded in those neurons um
and the reason you you brought this up and you were speaking to me about it was because
you said that uh you are not signed up for cryonics right now is that correct well i am
currently signed up for cryonics right now actually oh you are i thought you uh you were not
no no i am okay um it's it's the type of thing i think is a very low very very low chance of
succeeding given given what i know now and so that motivates me to try and make something that
will work better um so that's that's kind of what i'm working on right now yes like i mean so i've
got a quick question today i think you're working in that literally as we're speaking because you're
setting up that uh i i'm mixing chemicals as we're as we're currently speaking to do some
do some experiments today that's awesome um so i had a quick clarification question hold my
clarification i guess just dive in you said that the that preserving the um the data that's stored
on the brain is more important than than preserving i guess absolutely everything you know you give the
example of of uh what was that word for lacuna polls in yes thank you oh yeah so the i guess my
question is that uh what's the way to put this what format is the information in the brain stored in
that is relevant here well it's thought that information stored in the brain by physical
remodeling of synapses and so a synapse is a connection between one neuron and another neuron
and it's almost like you know if you take your put your arm out and uh you guys can record video
right not for the podcast not for podcasts all right so uh you know if you if you stuck your
arm out in front of you that would be just grabbed onto your elbow right you're gonna see how you
have this long arm right and you have a hand kind of grabbing onto it and those are kind of like
what synapses look they look like you know one thing reaching out and and walking on to another
longer thing um since uh neuron will send out something called a dendritic arbor
which you know it makes a bunch of uh it looks like a huge tree with a bunch of branches going
everywhere anywhere along that tree other neurons might be able to reach out connect to that and
make the synapse right and you know all of those neurons are going to be talking to that one neuron
the with the dendritic tree and uh you know influencing it to fire more fire less um in
proportion to how intensely they're connected to the tree and then the neuron's job is it kind of
integrates all that information together and then it decides whether it wants to fire uh an action
potential or not and then that neuron itself is connected with a lot of other neurons or
reaches out and touches their trees and so the brains this huge network of of neurons that are
talking to each other through synapses um and when you encode a memory you see that your synapse is
changing size and the bigger synapse is the more powerful a connection it's making in the more
strongly it'll influence the behavior of that neuron so for example there's some really cool
experiments where you can literally watch a motor memory being encoded in motor cortex in a mouse
as that mouse learns a new task you can label just exactly the synapses that are expanded in size
during this learning experience and then you can cause those synapses to to shrink back to their
original size with some very clever um basically optogenetic techniques and when those just those
synapses are shrunken it erases that motor memory so um it's not like we know everything about how
memory is working the brain but we we know more than is is generally appreciated I think
and uh you got this deal called you know the synaptic theory of memory which is is sort of the
current dogma of neuroscience it says that you know to a first approximation synapses aren't
coding memory so so to answer your question of what does it look like um you know if you could
preserve the physical structure of these synapses so that you can say for each neuron you know what
other neurons are connected to and how strong is it connected to those neurons um it seems that
that is definitely essential for preserving memories um and there's still debate over whether
that's sufficient for preserving memories so that that's exactly what that's meant to oh but if you're
not preserving the synapses then it would be unlikely that you're preserving memories maybe
there's some redundant system or maybe there's some way to infer it but like those lacunas right um
if there's very tiny holes in a document you probably won't have too much trouble inferring
text as you make those holes bigger um and they obscure just one or two characters you still might
be able to totally recover the text as you make them bigger and they get rid of a whole word then
depending on the text you may still be able to recover it but then as they start getting rid of
multiple words or whole sentences or just a half of the paragraph somewhere uh your problem quickly
grows into something that's basically impossible to really get the words back and right you had
up to me a recent uh out preservations at alcor and you have made the lacuna comparison to to
point out the problems with how they the the preservation was happening can you can you go
into a few of the recent preservations for me and why you were worried about what you'd read well
okay so um let's say let's bring up the last thing that alcor did um because they keep a
log of their preservations and um if you look at the last several preservations like you take a
look the last six or so you're gonna find there's quite a bit of time between death and even when
the preservation is started um so you know let's actually let's actually bring one up can you can
you take a look oh you have that sure hold on you know where they are right uh i do not actually
i'm assuming at alcor site but i don't know more than that yeah let's go let's see that's what we
got here um here we go alcor.org slash cases yep all right so let's just pick the last one okay
i had a quick thing that i think too well i pulled that up so i can follow along so right around
robert covered with the encoding of memories um is about all that stuff is about the limit of my
understanding of that sort of thing and the question i wanted to ask really quick was in your
opinion or is this known whether or not the um so like you said synapse is fire when the action
potential threshold is reached um is there any importance to say this synapse is 60 towards
its threshold for action potential uh and if so is that information durable but they call that um
sub threshold signaling and it's it's definitely a thing neurons do and it's definitely
you know useful some there's like neurons in many cases work very digitally you know it's
either an all or nothing type of deal of course in the dendritic arbor itself right as that neuron
is trying to figure out whether to fire or not those sub threshold potentials are kind of battling it
out and the geometry of that dendritic arbor may matter very critically for what the ultimate
signal is going to be in the neurons cell body um so that you know what it's going to decide and
even the lengths of the of the different trees you know if it takes a signal a little bit longer
to reach um one part of the arbor then it takes another you know those can have interesting
effects you can set up some interesting you know timing around that um there's a lot of very interesting
review papers on dendritic computation which you know we can uh send out to your your listeners
if they want to look at it in more detail on the other hand there's also been some recent really
good work in simulating neurons and they they've asked us the exact question you know how specific
do you need to get to still get reasonable behavior that approximates what's what the neurons actually
do in life and they found that at least for the system they were studying you didn't need to do
very much more than a very crude approximation of the dendritic arbor if that so it probably matters
yes and most of what you get that is the geometry of the tree right so if you're preserving the
structure of everything including the dendritic trees including the synapse including even some
proteins that are contained in that synapse in the the ion channels and the receptor proteins
that that exists that synapse the more you can preserve the better and the less structural
distortion you can cause in the brain the better so you know let's let's put the last one so we
you see this a 1649 Robert Whitaker right third of june 2017 right so this is this is the most
recent one while these games that i wanted to thank you for that dive in that's exactly what
i was looking to hear and do you have anything relevant to send along to us on the website that
would be really cool yeah there's some really cool papers in city two uh one's a review paper about
nearing the confrontation that's really good read and one of them is just a recent attempt to stimulate
neurons where you know they try different types of simulations that go into more complex approximations
of the dendritic arbor and finally there's not much of an effect for those neurons in person
awesome all right thanks sorry for the discomfort the uh disjointed conversation here let's dive
into Robert Whitaker's case all right so you know i'll just summarize this for you but you guys
are reading it too so uh you know feel free to point out anything you feel is necessary but
let's see so we have saturday june third Robert was found deceased at home and alcore gets notified
