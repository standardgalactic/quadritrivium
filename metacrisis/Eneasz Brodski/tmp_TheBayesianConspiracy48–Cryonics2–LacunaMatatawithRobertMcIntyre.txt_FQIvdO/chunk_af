would work rather than just actually teaching yeah and i'm also worried i hear that like
half your time or more is dealing with the one or two problem students in the classroom and i
don't want to do that and it sounds like a drag so i have the additional problem that i couldn't
teach adults like at a college level because i look like a junior high school student or maybe a
high school student so like i think i'd have a hard time commanding respect when they're all
taller than me and have beards um so but i thought like it would be fun to get around some of that
culture friction to teach at a part at a private school um a you'd probably need a lot more
credentials to do that but b you could get on board with how the private school does stuff
and then they might give you more freedom to do whatever you want as long as they're learning
stuff and that sounds like more fun because if you're just burning fuel trying to do your job
that's super discouraging and disheartening yeah but yeah teaching is fun and i think learning
or watching kids learning is probably a lot of fun and i can't imagine what it's like to be a parent
and watch your kid take its first steps and form its first full sentence and that sort of thing
i'm sure it's awesome so this one is probably going to be a little bit of a discussion on our
website the basin conspiracy dot com sends you says whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you guys appear to be
unsure about what conservatism and liberals and all that means because we we started talking about
which party is more more in favor of freedom right yeah yeah said you says i think this is a
great point because i think there's also that's also a result of your two party system either
you're in the red camp or you're in the blue camp in germany we have the fdp which basically stands
for less government control in all areas less surveillance less control in the economy all
that and i think that's what liberals are about and i think that is also what i meant when i said
that liberals were the ones that are trying to scale back government because when i think of liberals
i think of more like the libertarian like the classic definition of liberal being don't control
other people but then you brought up that the blue party in our system tends to be the one that tries
to regulate heavily a lot of businesses and get involved in a number of things that are really a
lot of government control but on the other hand the red party is the one that wants to come into
your bedroom and tell you what drugs you can't do who you can't sleep with what religion you
should be and they are slightly less regulatory but really just regulatory in a different way
i agree i don't think that either party is non-regulation and you don't want no regulation
i mean i read john stuart mills on liberty but it's you know five what's it i don't know i'm
holding my fingers like a centimeter apart it's a really small book but that's i'm not up to date on
like the best libertarian philosophy i mean there's a there's a version of that that makes a lot of
sense but i don't know how you run a society that way um certainly not a good society uh you need
regulation at some point so like you want uh somebody to say yeah you can't be putting out
that much waste you know you can't just dump it in the park yeah um so i mean which which party is
going to say that's for too much regulation you can't tell me where i can't put my radioactive
waste hopefully both parties are on board saying you can't put that shit in the park or anywhere
right but you're right one party is saying no look here's the kind of sex we want you to have
and that well you know we're gonna make it a big deal or uh you can't do this with your body
you want an abortion um what is what's a good example of blue control i don't really see registering
guns as a infringement on control uh in in our society it is in our society it's viewed that way
yeah there's here is a physical object that you are not allowed to own but i don't think that
that wasn't what i was saying i was saying registering it is different than saying you
can't have one yes it's just like you know no one's no one's saying you can't buy a car but we
want to know which ones you have yeah right that's that's government surveillance right yeah that's
the government knowing what you own where you live but that's different than saying you can't do it
just yeah but it surveillance a lot of people have negative um thoughts about that as well i'm not a
huge fan of surveillance either but i'm not that anti-surveillance in principle uh in practice
it tends to be shitty and so i am in practice someday yeah i might i'll have to talk about
my radical transparency roots i think we talked about that a bit with chase did we yeah okay and
eventually i abandoned them i think there's a difference between surveillance and control
one is saying we're gonna watch you do this stuff the other thing you can't do this stuff right
but watching you is the first step to control they don't have to put cameras in our bedrooms
to outlock asex right right um assuming that they wanted to like let's say if this was india
you know sex legal in india uh my impression is that it is i read something like that just this
morning okay um if it's not it's legal somewhere right so they don't have they don't have cameras
in bedrooms like they don't need to surveil you they're just saying you can't do this and if
someone says you did we're gonna kill you or jail you or whatever the whole of the government being
able to know where you are at all times by tracking your phone data that we talked about recently is
sort of a government surveillance thing oh absolutely so what what was the point that
we missed there that they drew contention with i want to uh that we were confused as to
what is conservatism and what is liberalism yeah and i guess the other thing is that libertarianism
is further to the right on the spectrum if you're drawing a flat line than liberalism right liberalism
is the far left conservatism is the far right and libertarian is far or is right in the center
depending it's maybe one of those weird things that like every sci-fi movie does when they fold
a piece of paper and half and punch a hole through it right um maybe it hits both like
any kind it does yeah but i think libertarian is it's weird in some way it's it's more right
and some things and more left in others yeah because like not regulating business is very
conservative right yeah um but you know not caring what drugs you use is very liberal yeah so maybe
i view it as more right of center maybe it's because people that i know that our libertarians are more
inclined towards conservatism than liberalism i think the reason it has such a very strong flavor
of rightism in our society is because libertarians at some point got together and decided that
since this is only a two-party system in america and libertarians literally can't run
right now and get a have a shot of winning any seats that they're going to vote republican
more often than democrat because republican are more closely aligned to the more of the
things they care strongly about so even though i don't consider them either right or left
since they tend to vote the same way the rightists vote they have the the right flavor yeah that
makes sense okay i got one last thing which is pretty short uh this is just as an an
informative thing google plex bite on the subreddit says regarding the valuation of intellectual
property my estimate for the value of the concept of a comedy film is certainly incredibly rough
but you could fairly easily make rights holders accurately value their property with the threat
of auction if a government evaluator feels that the right holder has undervalued their property
then the evaluator can demand an auction for the property where the rights holders proposed
value is their maximum bid putting them at considerable risk risk of losing the property
at auction proportional to their undervaluation which is an interesting way to fix that google
plex bite has obviously either thought or read a lot about this topic yeah no it's a good insight
thank you for sharing that with us yeah that is really cool i don't have enough knowledge there
to challenge or confirm that but i i like where it's going my freshman one-on-one objections
were knocked down by your having thought about this for more than five minutes perfect uh in that
case i think we're done with listening feedback and we can wrap it up cool awesome thanks for listening
and we'll see you again in two weeks now i'm good bye
