Hello conspirators! A couple quick things before we start this episode. Kyle Moore is still on
vacation so our sound quality is not quite what we would like it to be but I fear that even his
expertise couldn't have saved us on this one. Our guest Robert McIntyre was working in the
background in the lab that he works at throughout the episode and you can hear the equipment.
The sound quality on our end was mixed because of the way we had to set up the mics. I was in
the different room on a different microphone and we're coming in at all different volumes but it's
all on one track and it was a nightmare to edit so please try and bear with us on this one because
I think that even though we've had a lot of fun conversations on this podcast in the last couple
of years I think this is one of the most important especially to anybody who is sold on cryonics.
Some of Robert's work in this field is I think groundbreaking and will really change the the
terrain going forward so it's really worth powering through some of the audio to try and get
through this one. We are planning on having him back on in the near future for another episode
if anyone wants to send us questions to submit to him for that episode you can do so at the
subreddit r slash the Bayesian Conspiracy you can send us an email at Bayesian Conspiracy
podcast at gmail.com or comment on this episode on the website at the Bayesian Conspiracy.
Anyway try and uh stick through and enjoy this episode thanks.
All right it's supposed to talk to you guys. Yeah you too so uh. It's gonna try to do this.
We should start with saying hello this is the Bayesian Conspiracy. I'm Inyash Brotsky.
I'm Steven Zipper and my name is Robert McIntyre. Yes hello we have Robert McIntyre with us today
and Robert McIntyre is uh well I I met Robert at Burning Man when someone I think it was you
wasn't it brought up questions about bioethics just just sitting around in a in a tent chatting with
people. It was that lady who was uh it was actually a lady who was studying oh what was it uh
uh feminism through the lens of I forget but but she was studying like uh plays from
from the 1800s. Oh okay. And somehow from that we got into bioethics and then later on you came
up to me and you started a conversation about cryonics and I I had no idea who you were at the
time you were just like you know another cool guy at Burning Man uh but you started out I was
thinking a good place to start this would be possibly the the Dead Sea Scrolls uh comparison
that you brought up to me. Did you want to start? Oh yeah. Sure so uh the way I see brain preservation
um is that the goal is you want to preserve uh the data that's contained in that brain
so that you could then eventually extract that data all right and one uh way to be thinking about
this is in terms of data that's been preserved over thousands of years uh through various natural
circumstances so uh you know here's a good comparison between like Dead Sea Scrolls and
those that existed in Pompeii so uh when the when Pompeii got destroyed by this volcanic eruption
a bunch of ash came down and it just buried uh the whole town city type of place
so hot that there wasn't very much oxygen that actually carbonized some of these scrolls and so
if you look at them they are just they look like they've been burnt to charcoal basically black
incredibly fragile um it seems kind of hopeless uh that you could ever read anything from them
and they're still physically in the same about shape as they were uh when they were
buried and so recently up into the scroll rolls right yeah if you imagine you know
if you were able to kind of kind of cook some scroll you know at a really high temperature
so that it carbonizes but it doesn't actually catch on fire and turn to ash um it's it's like
charcoal scrolls and so uh google uh in in junction with this uh university actually
uh x-ray through these scrolls and unroll them digitally and you can read the text in them
which was very impressive um on the other hand if you have a hole in a manuscript which they call
rapuna um it doesn't matter how advanced your imaging technology is uh you're almost certainly
never going to be able to fill in that hole right because information is simply not there
to be imaged at all is the so you know the term lacuna does that deter for the hole or for the
scroll uh lacuna is a hole in a document okay so oh shit hold on i want to think about brain
preservation uh well another another very comparison is the anti uh catheter mechanism so this was uh
one of the first computers our lisa analog computer that was built by the greeks over
2000 years ago and uh it had this this crank on one side and uh you could spend this crank and
in this network of over 40 years would spin oh and hey rob tell you when holidays are going to be
in the future robert can i stop you for a second i am having issues with my wi-fi i'm going to go
downstairs and uh get hooked up hardline okay all right in that case we are back wonderful so you
had just yep sounds good uh lacuna is a hole in document a lacuna lacuna okay that's your
vocabulary word for the day lacuna it's a hole in a document that obscures the text and so you're
not going to be able to easily reconstruct that other than just by inferring it from the surrounding
text which the bigger the hole the rap more rapidly you get into basically being an impossible
problem yeah um so you know imagine you have a paragraph and then you just have a hole and
literally a physical hole in the middle of that paragraph um i think uh what was it you
ever seen eternal star sign in this spot was mine yes that was a great movie well that company i
believe was called lacuna right oh shit i have no idea the one that erased your memories i didn't
know what the word meant so the name didn't stick out to me at all yeah so i thought that was kind
of cute because they were going in and basically erasing memories you know putting holes in the
story of your own life uh and they were called lacuna as a company nice good name um and so
yeah so to get back to this uh anti-preparation mechanism uh this was a geared instrument that
was built by uh Greek uh mathematicians astronomers over 2000 years ago and it had this
crank that you could spin and a sister of gears a very beautiful object and it would calculate
when the next eclipse was or when the next holidays were going to be or where the planets were going
to be um as you turn this crank you would you know kind of advance forward in time and it would show
you where these uh celestial bodies are going to be um and this was super advanced it had what's
called a differential gear um they're kind of a gear with two sets of teeth on it but could uh
you know adjust the gear ratios and they wouldn't invent differential gears until i believe the
1400s or 1600s so super ahead of its time and then these romans came and kind of took the
anti-cauthera mechanism and it was on this roman ship um and the ship hit this storm and uh sank
by the island of antipathyra and all the treasures and things that were in that ship
to the bottom of the ocean got covered up with mud and salt and salt and such uh and they were
lost until 1900 uh when these sponge divers came and they got hit by a similar sort of storm and
knocked off course right on top of where the the ship uh the roman ship sank a long time ago
and they figured while they were there they might as well go sponge diving you know so the
the trip wouldn't be a total loss and instead of sponges they found to this day the still the
greatest uh buried or sunken treasure find ever um bunch of neat statues um a lot of cool you know
clay objects and they found this anti-cauthera mechanism as well but it was this inscrutable
hunk of mud encrusted gear types of things and they knew it was really fancy and and
see some of the gears right on the on the sides that were exposed but they didn't dare try to
take it apart because uh you know it was it was kind of lost cause right uh they were worried
they were gonna break it and so this is 1900 right and it was on earth in 1901 and it sat until
1980 or so when they finally had uh x-ray technology that could go and actually image through it without
disrupting it physically and then they were able to see the positions of the gears um and and figure
out uh how it was built and figure out you know exactly how it was working and now people make
versions of this kind of for fun uh you can even download one on your phone and spend these virtual
gears around you know a million times faster than you could ever spend the physical gear around
and it's going to do the same calculation that the original anti-cauthera machine did so you know
the the ocean preserved the arrangement of the gears with enough detail that we were able to go
and and create that same system again and those original gears are never going to spin again
but those original gears guide uh the way that other gears are going to be spinning
and you know so that's a long way of saying that that i think yotta emphasized
getting brains into a state where you could um in theory uh reconstruct them but the actual
functioning of the individual neurons you know like whether they can metabolize sugar for example
is it nearly as important as the data that's been encoded in those neurons um
and the reason you you brought this up and you were speaking to me about it was because
you said that uh you are not signed up for cryonics right now is that correct well i am
currently signed up for cryonics right now actually oh you are i thought you uh you were not
no no i am okay um it's it's the type of thing i think is a very low very very low chance of
succeeding given given what i know now and so that motivates me to try and make something that
will work better um so that's that's kind of what i'm working on right now yes like i mean so i've
got a quick question today i think you're working in that literally as we're speaking because you're
setting up that uh i i'm mixing chemicals as we're as we're currently speaking to do some
do some experiments today that's awesome um so i had a quick clarification question hold my
clarification i guess just dive in you said that the that preserving the um the data that's stored
on the brain is more important than than preserving i guess absolutely everything you know you give the
example of of uh what was that word for lacuna polls in yes thank you oh yeah so the i guess my
question is that uh what's the way to put this what format is the information in the brain stored in
that is relevant here well it's thought that information stored in the brain by physical
remodeling of synapses and so a synapse is a connection between one neuron and another neuron
and it's almost like you know if you take your put your arm out and uh you guys can record video
right not for the podcast not for podcasts all right so uh you know if you if you stuck your
arm out in front of you that would be just grabbed onto your elbow right you're gonna see how you
have this long arm right and you have a hand kind of grabbing onto it and those are kind of like
what synapses look they look like you know one thing reaching out and and walking on to another
longer thing um since uh neuron will send out something called a dendritic arbor
which you know it makes a bunch of uh it looks like a huge tree with a bunch of branches going
everywhere anywhere along that tree other neurons might be able to reach out connect to that and
make the synapse right and you know all of those neurons are going to be talking to that one neuron
the with the dendritic tree and uh you know influencing it to fire more fire less um in
proportion to how intensely they're connected to the tree and then the neuron's job is it kind of
integrates all that information together and then it decides whether it wants to fire uh an action
potential or not and then that neuron itself is connected with a lot of other neurons or
reaches out and touches their trees and so the brains this huge network of of neurons that are
talking to each other through synapses um and when you encode a memory you see that your synapse is
changing size and the bigger synapse is the more powerful a connection it's making in the more
strongly it'll influence the behavior of that neuron so for example there's some really cool
experiments where you can literally watch a motor memory being encoded in motor cortex in a mouse
as that mouse learns a new task you can label just exactly the synapses that are expanded in size
during this learning experience and then you can cause those synapses to to shrink back to their
original size with some very clever um basically optogenetic techniques and when those just those
synapses are shrunken it erases that motor memory so um it's not like we know everything about how
memory is working the brain but we we know more than is is generally appreciated I think
and uh you got this deal called you know the synaptic theory of memory which is is sort of the
current dogma of neuroscience it says that you know to a first approximation synapses aren't
coding memory so so to answer your question of what does it look like um you know if you could
preserve the physical structure of these synapses so that you can say for each neuron you know what
other neurons are connected to and how strong is it connected to those neurons um it seems that
that is definitely essential for preserving memories um and there's still debate over whether
that's sufficient for preserving memories so that that's exactly what that's meant to oh but if you're
not preserving the synapses then it would be unlikely that you're preserving memories maybe
there's some redundant system or maybe there's some way to infer it but like those lacunas right um
if there's very tiny holes in a document you probably won't have too much trouble inferring
text as you make those holes bigger um and they obscure just one or two characters you still might
be able to totally recover the text as you make them bigger and they get rid of a whole word then
depending on the text you may still be able to recover it but then as they start getting rid of
multiple words or whole sentences or just a half of the paragraph somewhere uh your problem quickly
grows into something that's basically impossible to really get the words back and right you had
up to me a recent uh out preservations at alcor and you have made the lacuna comparison to to
point out the problems with how they the the preservation was happening can you can you go
into a few of the recent preservations for me and why you were worried about what you'd read well
okay so um let's say let's bring up the last thing that alcor did um because they keep a
log of their preservations and um if you look at the last several preservations like you take a
look the last six or so you're gonna find there's quite a bit of time between death and even when
the preservation is started um so you know let's actually let's actually bring one up can you can
you take a look oh you have that sure hold on you know where they are right uh i do not actually
i'm assuming at alcor site but i don't know more than that yeah let's go let's see that's what we
got here um here we go alcor.org slash cases yep all right so let's just pick the last one okay
i had a quick thing that i think too well i pulled that up so i can follow along so right around
robert covered with the encoding of memories um is about all that stuff is about the limit of my
understanding of that sort of thing and the question i wanted to ask really quick was in your
opinion or is this known whether or not the um so like you said synapse is fire when the action
potential threshold is reached um is there any importance to say this synapse is 60 towards
its threshold for action potential uh and if so is that information durable but they call that um
sub threshold signaling and it's it's definitely a thing neurons do and it's definitely
you know useful some there's like neurons in many cases work very digitally you know it's
either an all or nothing type of deal of course in the dendritic arbor itself right as that neuron
is trying to figure out whether to fire or not those sub threshold potentials are kind of battling it
out and the geometry of that dendritic arbor may matter very critically for what the ultimate
signal is going to be in the neurons cell body um so that you know what it's going to decide and
even the lengths of the of the different trees you know if it takes a signal a little bit longer
to reach um one part of the arbor then it takes another you know those can have interesting
effects you can set up some interesting you know timing around that um there's a lot of very interesting
review papers on dendritic computation which you know we can uh send out to your your listeners
if they want to look at it in more detail on the other hand there's also been some recent really
good work in simulating neurons and they they've asked us the exact question you know how specific
do you need to get to still get reasonable behavior that approximates what's what the neurons actually
do in life and they found that at least for the system they were studying you didn't need to do
very much more than a very crude approximation of the dendritic arbor if that so it probably matters
yes and most of what you get that is the geometry of the tree right so if you're preserving the
structure of everything including the dendritic trees including the synapse including even some
proteins that are contained in that synapse in the the ion channels and the receptor proteins
that that exists that synapse the more you can preserve the better and the less structural
distortion you can cause in the brain the better so you know let's let's put the last one so we
you see this a 1649 Robert Whitaker right third of june 2017 right so this is this is the most
recent one while these games that i wanted to thank you for that dive in that's exactly what
i was looking to hear and do you have anything relevant to send along to us on the website that
would be really cool yeah there's some really cool papers in city two uh one's a review paper about
nearing the confrontation that's really good read and one of them is just a recent attempt to stimulate
neurons where you know they try different types of simulations that go into more complex approximations
of the dendritic arbor and finally there's not much of an effect for those neurons in person
awesome all right thanks sorry for the discomfort the uh disjointed conversation here let's dive
into Robert Whitaker's case all right so you know i'll just summarize this for you but you guys
are reading it too so uh you know feel free to point out anything you feel is necessary but
let's see so we have saturday june third Robert was found deceased at home and alcore gets notified
by the personal assistant who'd gone out shopping and so you know this is a situation where this
person already been dead for some amount of time beforehand and then someone discovers them and then
they call alcore and the people from alcore come in at 9 30 arizona time not sure exactly what okay
they're always using um they're always using military time here okay so june third 16 25
they find that this person has died okay and then 9 30 arizona time sunday morning so uh we're talking
about the next day june fourth on sunday right 16 16 25 to 9 30 all right so you know that's
that's about 16 30 to 9 30 so how many hours is that uh from four to nine that's 12 and another
five so 17 hours all right so that's 17 hours before anything even starts okay he's lying there
presumably at room temperature they claimed surgery went well confusion went better than
expected good flow was established and if they finished attempting to do this crowd preservation
at 12 50 arizona time so another four hours or so uh or sorry another three hours and in 20 minutes
and then they uh put this person in a dry ice um and sent him over and they're going to cool him
down so the key takeaway here is uh you got 17 hours of what we call normal thermic ischemia uh so
there's another one of your words of the day is it ischemia meaning lack of adequate blood
flow to maintain life in a tissue and layman's terms that's real bad news for crowd preservation
as my is my understanding well you know what i would like to see is a clear study of how
grains degrade over time um in the situations that that alcor normally expects and then that
should be the answer to you know what do we think about whether information is being preserved or
right so you know the what i'd like to be seeing is arguing about this from a synaptic point of
view saying our synapse is preserved how well can they be traced back to whatever neuron they're
coming from um those types of questions does that make sense yes that's awesome and then we should
judge whether our preservation procedures you know good or not based on how well it's preserving
the synapses but unfortunately you know not much is known about how human connectomes degrade over
time uh after death uh connectomes another good word this is the set of all your synapses so you've
got your genome and that's kind of how you build someone's body and then a connectome is kind of
how you build someone's memories and mind personality and and so you know it's a technique
that preserves the connectome is almost certainly going to be better than a technique that doesn't
preserve the connectome right with a couple of caveats there all right a lot of the biopreservation
protocols you know that are currently used for chronics are based around the discipline of
cryobiology right and so this is you know the science of of applying cold to biology and seeing
how that breaks out or how you can preserve it right um encompasses a lot of things including
how you destroy tissue of cold and also how you might preserve tissue right and one of the crowning
achievements of prior preservation would be the ability to preserve an organ so that you could
transplant it right uh and you know ideally you can be able to store organs for years and then
warm them back up and transplant them right and so you know the field of cryobiology is very
interested in maintaining life of the cells right maintaining their metabolic capacity maintaining
their ability to be successfully used in a transplantation scenario right um but i would argue
that that's not quite the thing we want when it comes to preserving brains right for a heart
of course you know a heart is only good for pumping blood so if it's not capable of pumping blood
there's really nothing good you can get out of it right so if your preservation technique doesn't
make it still be able to pump it's no good right but a brain is there for doing computations and
storing data right and so you know you might very well say i don't care if the brain can still
function if these these neurons in particular can still fire or if they can still metabolize sugar
or you know do the typical things that that are required to be alive what i care about is is the
data still there right um and so that would be you know more looking at this from the perspective
of computer science and neuroscience and even you know in some ways kind of like library science
right we're trying to we're trying to preserve information and it gives you some new opportunities
right if you're willing to sacrifice the metabolic capacity of your of your brain for better information
preservation that might be a really good trade to be making definitely for the brain in particular
but you're not going to necessarily want to be doing that if your your founding discipline is
this crab allergy right because that's totally antithetical to crab biological techniques right
you don't want to you know totally destroy the metabolic capacity of a heart and say
hey but the structure of the heart you know those muscle fibers still look exactly like they did
when the heart was alive right that's only going to be good for anatomical studies right so the uh
the field and so those are those are the things so the the research that's going on in that field
is kind of not useful for what we want with the brain because they're trying to preserve the function
rather than the structure well you know if you perfectly preserve the function and perfectly
preserve the structure that's even better right if you could achieve what they call um uh suspended
animation right where you could actually shut down an organism and bring it back and have it walk
off the table uh clearly you could prove that that preserves memory by just doing standard memory
assays like we do for animals or just if it's a person just ask them and interview them for a while
right yeah um but in lieu of that the question is what are the empirical tests you want to do
to determine whether a preservation protocol works or not or whether it's better than another
preservation protocol right and I think in lieu of total and complete perfect revival um you know
of course you can choose different segments that you're going to use for these protocols
but I think the one that that maybe you ought to be choosing is the ones that are informed
by neuroscience telling us how our memories encoded and so I think a really good first step
is inectome preservation can you preserve all the synaptic connections such that we're still
traceable um that was what the brain preservation prize was all about it laid down this challenge
that said uh how do we preserve brains so that we know the connective is still there
or can we preserve brains so that we know they're connected with us there and uh you bring
up the brain preservation prize we have not mentioned this yet in the podcast and I am very
remiss not having said that but you actually recently won the small mammal brain preservation
prize yes that is right we won that uh well like February 13th last year um for this year I guess
and uh yeah that was that was a lot of fun and uh we're still fighting for the large
mammal brain preservation prize and and hopefully we'll we'll know more about that very shortly um
so what what exactly is the small mammal brain preservation prize and how did you go about winning
that small mammal brain preservation prize um is the scientific prize kind of like you know the x
prize um that was was put together by this non-profit called the Brain Preservation Foundation
and they're really interested in in looking at this from a more neuroscience perspective and saying
we want to be able to preserve brains um arrays are there and the first step is preserve the connective
so let's make a prize for that because it seems achievable and the prize is very simple um you
can do whatever you want to these brains uh to preserve them and the criteria is you've got to
be able to make a very good case that your preservation techniques will keep the brain
stable for at least 100 years and number two is you're going to submit brains you've done this to
to the Brain Preservation Foundation and then they're going to independently evaluate uh the
quality of the preservation with electron microscopy we're just going to look at the synapses
and they're going to evaluate them the same way that they would evaluate their own
attempts at studying the brain um because it's generally understood what good brain preservation
looks like you know good synaptic connectivity and what damaged synaptic connectivity looks like
and so that's independently evaluated hello uh oh i think we lost so uh by an alien he's named
uh Sebastian Sonsubation who's a neuroscientist at Princeton who's really popularized the word
connectomics wait wait wait can you can you back up about 30 seconds so you dropped out for a
little bit yeah sure so so the deal is look you're a preserver brain um you need to make a really good
argument that it'll keep that brain preserved for at least 100 years you got to send it to the
Brain Preservation Foundation and they're going to look at the synapses and see if they're well
preserved um and that basically means for every synapse you can trace it back to a neuron what
kind of surprised me is that i had sort of assumed that they something like this had been done before
okay froze you know small test brains and then looked at them and saw that they were decently
preserved that was that not the case well for over 50 years we've known how to uh temporarily
preserve brains by profusing them with uh aldehyde fixatives and we've known how to image brains very
well um but only a slice of the brain okay and so the problem is if you just preserve a brain with
aldehydes it'll eventually degrade over time it's hard to make a case that that would last for at
least 100 years because although the brain's been very well preserved it's still aqueous it's still
in an environment of water and the random thermal emotion of that water is going to cause degradation
over time especially with the lipids you know brains mostly lipids and proteins and aldehydes
like either aldehyde or form aldehyde do a good job locking down proteins and don't do as good a
job locking down lipids and so you'll find in very old chemically preserved brains that you get this
kind of lipid film developed at the top of the uh vessel that the brain is in and this is caused
by migration of lipids over over many years just due to the thermal action of water and the freezing
the brain didn't help uh stop that well you can't just freeze a brain that's been preserved with um
which is to aldehydes because you'll get the ice crystals and although you'll you know stop this
thermal motion of water the ice crystals are going to tear up all your synapses and uh just
caused a lot of of major mayhem everywhere and to prevent that the perfused the brains with some sort
of cryo protection solution right or did that yeah so the the technique I came up with is called
aldehyde stabilized cryo preservation and it's combining kind of best of both worlds from the
chemical fixation and from the cryo perspiration you start with aldehydes lock everything down
and then you can take your time adding cryo protection slowly so that you don't distort
anything um and then you can vitrify that brain by pulling it down and it'll be solid and uh you
can then warm it up and demonstrate that that the snap to connectivity is deserved and that is that is
what you did yep that's right that is fucking fantastic now why hadn't they been doing that
before because I I had always heard that they did use cryo protectants like alcor and ci and such
well they use cryo protectants but they don't use fixatives at the beginning okay and so you can't
demonstrate that you can burn synapses with the current cryo protectants only right you need the
fixatives to stabilize everything first so what they do right now is just put in cryo protectants
and freeze it and your your contention is that that does not really fix things in place and preserve
them the way they should be preserved well it's never been demonstrated that that it preserves
synapses right um so you know what I'd like to see is in an animal model you know do things similar
to what happens to humans so you know let them sit for 17 hours and do your preservation and slice
that brain up and and look at it with electron microscopy and see how good it is um no one has
done that yet and not really I mean um I have always assumed that someone had just taken animal
brain and put cryo protectants in it and frozen it and then unfrozen it and looked at it well
sometimes that that is done sometimes it's looked at but it's never been demonstrated to preserve
synapses right I did not realize yeah but there's not very much stuff that's been that's been done
unfortunately um and a lot of the things that are done are done on you know animals zero minutes
the scheming time right but even those the problem is uh without the fixatives your brain is kind of
degrading over time right and so you don't have unlimited time to get this cryo protectant in
right um and you got to be way more careful about what cryo protectants are using um because you
know the brain is much less stable right so what happens practically is these brains end up getting
dehydrated and then when you try to image them uh the resulting electron micrographs are
uninterpretable we can't really make out synapses we can't make out structures um it doesn't look
very traceable and so the contention currently is that you know maybe it's is traceable anyway if you
could somehow expand it or with some other technology you could see that they're there but um in terms of
of a neuroscientist like Ken Hayworth being able to look at it and say yeah this is traceable like
this ought to retain the structures and put memory um that can't currently be done um with
traditional cryo protecting techniques such as are used by Alcor yeah so the people that have been
preserved recently maybe in the far future once we have really advanced technology we can decode
what's been what's been done due to the uh cryo protected profusion but it's going to be it's
it's going to be hard and you are trying to process less hard and more stable you know I don't think
humanity is ever going to be able to fix some of these Lagunas in ancient documents I just don't
see how you do it it's gone the information is destroyed and no matter how sophisticated you
can image the remaining pages right you're not going to get past a hole and so the question is you
know when we preserve brains now is it more like rendering them inscrutable but still fundamentally
with their information intact or is it you know like the burned up uh
carbonized scrolls from Pompeii or is it more like the Lagunas in these scrolls where you're
never going to be able to infer anything um and that gets into a lot of subtle things
and some of this stuff in such but yeah sorry what were you saying Stephen I was going to say
some of the things that I've read people contend that even if the Laguna is my new word at the
day like you said uh even if they they lose say 30 percent of their memories or something
if they have to relearn you know relearn how to hold a spoon or whatever it is that you know some
fidelity going into the future is still better than nothing um well sure yeah you know obviously
the less the less you lose the better certainly I want to keep as much as possible yeah and I think
you know in getting into a situation where you might not be able to get hardly anything back
it really depends on on a lot of more subtle factors but without getting too into the details
um I guess you know my thoughts are why not it's something that you know preserves
the connectome and kind of works in there you know my thoughts exactly as well I completely
agree I'm not defending the old practice that just I'm saying that I think this was a known issue
that people just sort of fit the bullet on um well yeah there's nothing to do but I mean let's do it
as well as possible yeah I think there there can sometimes be some complacency there it's like
you know if you think that anything is possible in the future um then it sort of doesn't matter
but in that case why even bother getting preserved right like yeah if you really believe that the
future can can fix these holes right then just cremate yourself and then figure out how to you
know look and look at the you know like in the like in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
who they said oh just looking at this one pie or something you can see the whole universe and
everything that's ever happened and all that good stuff but you know if you want to come back
within this century using modifications from technology we currently have but faster you know
like an electron microscope but a million times faster um the path to that is you know preserved
the connectome so how did you get involved because apparently you found out that things
were not sufficient and you started working on this what what brought that about I mean it's not
like it's hard to find out and the Alcor is super but bored on what they can do and what they can't
do Alcor doesn't claim that they preserve the connectome they claim you know based on cryobiology
we're going to try to apply the best cryobiological techniques similar to an organ preservation
technique that we can and hope for the best that's their that's their case right were you already in
some sort of a biological program uh well you know I've always wanted to understand how the brain
works and digitize memories right like since I can remember that's what I wanted to do and it
seemed like it would be a very difficult problem so that's why I went to MIT and originally I was
going to be studying you know current ways that they use to scan brains and understand how brains
work and try to make them scale up so you could apply it to a person and kind of extract their
memories and digitize them while they were alive that was what I was imagining right but you you
put something into their brain you'd use some advanced imaging technology and do it that way
and I quickly realized after looking at you know what existed at the time that that was really hard
and you know although we probably can put something like that together it's going to be an
awful long time before that's really practical right um but studying neuroscience and studying
neuroscience I realized you know a you know if you've ever emulated a system before you know
that a good enough approximation of a computational system basically is that computational system
right a calculator uh you can use that to add numbers and use to your your taxes right and
then imagine a simulation of that calculator like in a video game right um you might just superficially
simulate it right where it's just a thing that you've has buttons or something but if you really
got into the details and simulated with that the transistor level right the individual little
circuits in that calculator suddenly it's not just a really a simulation of a calculator it is a
calculator in its own right because you can still do your taxes on it right you press the buttons
that adds the numbers that's what a calculator does and you know between neuroscience and pure
science I think it's very clear that the brain is a computational device and so the brain can be
emulated the brain can be copied the same way that other computational devices can be copied
which is maybe very difficult to do so and then the other thing like neuroscience is that
the brain clearly is a is is more of a static structure than people people think it is because
you can pull someone down in ultra round hypothermia or because you know there are many situations you
can can cause to happen where there's no electro activity anymore right you know that there is some
static structure that's sufficient to capture all of your memories and that was very exciting
because that means you don't have to scan someone rather arrive the minimum thing you need to do
is figure out how to preserve someone right so you know originally I wanted to uh figure out how
to digitize brains I saw that that the technologies for doing that in an active way are really really
famously difficult I went into AI actually to hope to you know build something that could figure out
how to do upload it right because it seemed like such a hard problem that maybe you need to step
back and work on building better tools but then after figuring out a little bit more about you
know what you could viably do as a minimum sort of product for brain banking that you could actually
preserve a brain instead of having to scan the whole thing in and digitize it I thought you know
maybe that is practical maybe you can use some of the tricks that people have come up with over
the last 50 years and actually make a brain dating technique that could preserve the information
and provely preserve the information and that seemed just about tractable and I felt like I
could maybe do it and uh there was a surprise and I really wanted to win the prize so uh I did that
you you make it sense is you're like oh here's a prize let's go and try to win it but you know my
dad and I were uh I went on this walk and was like son what would you do if you weren't doing AI right
and I thought about it then I was like well I'd figure out how to bank brains you know
because that'd be also a pretty valid thing to do yeah and uh we actually that night I was like
actually that's kind of kind of a neat idea that's before that a bit so we went and read a bunch of
cryo biology literature and we weren't really very impressed uh because like 1950s you know
was finding polgay uh figure out how to preserve sperm with glycerol and if you look at the current
cryo biology papers a lot of them are still talking about preserving sperm to the nth degree
so there's not been too much progress over the last 15 years or so and so you know we were
a bit skeptical but then when I saw the brain preservation foundation right and they were
talking about just preserving you know synaptic connectivity and evaluating it rigorously with
electron microscopy I thought well you know cryo biology is maybe not the right way to be thinking
about this um sort of they're trying to preserve brains and they're trying to preserve metabolism
and it's really the preserving metabolism part that is is a difficult part so they're actually two
competitors for this brain preservation prize which I you know started volunteering for and one
of them was uh was 21st century medicine and they were doing the cryo biology approach right
so their goal was to preserve the brain and preserve the metabolism right and they were
running into a lot of difficulties because that is a very hard thing to do and there was another
team in Germany that was trying to prepare a brain for electron microscopy right and so of
course in the process of of doing that we would have had to have preserved the brain insufficient
quality to win the brain preservation prize and so they were trying to preserve brains and
stain them with heavy metals and turn them into plastic so that you put them in an electron
microscope and so they were still not really doing just the core of of the problem right and I was
like I'm just going to put both of those things together right because because the hard part
from the McCoolis technique was not the initial preservation it was the staining and plastic
embedding that's necessary for electron microscopy and the hard part from cryo biology and the weakness
was um you know you can't store a brain that's been just preserved with aldehydes for 100 years
and cryo biology had the total opposite um they had a really good answer to long-term storage which
was vitrification but they struggled at the early stages of the preservation process to
efficiently lock down biomolecules right and so I used the short game of the of the German guys
on the Pula and the long-term game from the cryology guys and put them together our is it
is are you and your team the literally the only people working on this in terms of just preserving
the brain right now you know uh in some ways every neuroscience lab in the world touches on
brain preservation to some degree or another um because if you want to study the brain you
got to do something about locking structures down but as far as I know we're the only group that's
focused on whole brain preservation with the explicit goal of of developing memory preservation
so first of all that is terrifying I thought there were more people working on it but second of all
thank you so much for doing this the good work of this this is just I I I do not know how to express
my gratitude enough I second that sentiment well you know I think it's I think it's pretty it's a
pretty wild you know riot and I really hope I can get something that that's a good solution
and you know basically the deal is um we can preserve whole connectomes right and the question
is is preserving a whole connectome sufficient to preserve memories and neuroscience gives a
tentative yes right now but uh anything you can do to make that uh less tentative is going to be
very useful so uh you know over the next uh couple of years uh you know we're kind of gearing up to
focus on how to do memory preservation right and uh you know I think that that's doable um because
you know I proved that I could preserve all of the synapses in a brain but I didn't have to scan
all the synapses to do that what I did was I just said look anywhere you want and if there's even one
synapse that's disrupted I lose okay and Hayworth looked in 10 different places and decided it was
good um and so you know I think you can do a similar trick for proving that you can preserve
all the memories it's not so much about totally reconstructing a brain right which is economically
infeasible and really difficult it's more like constructing weird experiments that look sort of
like zero knowledge proofs where you know you wouldn't be able to sort a group of 10 brains
of the two different groups without accessing some type of information that's correlated with a memory
right or you know arguing about here's like a transfer function of how you know a set of neurons
were and here's you know us approximating that transfer function with sufficient detail to replicate
the behavior right um after scanning it in like those types of things and I'm actually working
right now with with several neuroscientists to try and put together you know what those
experiments look like it's something we've been thinking about very carefully over the last two
years but I think that is tractable I do think and and there's already very interesting results
like it's already in the literature that you could optogenetically so so here's the experiment
all right and this exists in the literature if you put together a few papers um although it would
be useful to do it explicitly um but here you go all right you have 10 mice all right and uh in each
of the 10 mice you're going to label two ingrowns okay that kind of represents a place memory all
right and one of them is red and one of them is green so you know uh you got the kitchen and
that's green you got the living room and that's going to be red all right and then in five of those
mice uh you create a fear memory of the kitchen and the other five you make the fear memory of the
living room okay and so it's just a single memory and that's the main core thing that separates the
two groups of mice all right and then you preserve all their brains with your brain preservation
technique and then you can do anything you want uh after you've done the preservation but the goal
is to sort the 10 brains into two groups okay and if those two groups then correspond to the
two original training groups then that's proving that you've preserved one bit of memory one high
level bit associated with you know were they afraid of this place or this other place um and if you
can't sort them then that technique's worse than a technique that can sort them right you can always
argue maybe if you had better analysis you could sort them after all but I like these types of
approaches because they're creating kind of a new empirical system for evaluating preservation
protocols and that's that's a new science that I think we ought to have is you know being able to
evaluate memory preservation brain banking techniques uh really rigorous like this and that
is the next thing that you're going to be working on or that you are working on right now yeah so
uh let me let me uh back up just a little bit you won the small mammal brain preservation prize
are you working on the large mammal one too is there is there difficulty scaling it up to a
larger animal no so to give you an idea um I mean the whole point of this is I want to scale it up
to humans yeah and I wouldn't have designed it in a way that wouldn't scale easily because to me
there's not very much of a point and so the the key deal here is you're doing perfusion right so
you're going through the vasculature of the animal and um no matter how big that animal is the the
circulatory system is already designed to deliver blood oxygen and sugar to every single cell right
so if you can co-opt that system for your own use um and use it well you're going to get to every
cell to give you an idea of the scalability of this it took me about seven months or so uh to
make this work for a rabbit brain okay um and a lot of that was chemical development and uh guess
how long it took me to modify it and build the machines design them and uh get it ready to work
for a pig brain uh three more months it took me five six weeks it took me five hours
and it worked awesome um that was designing the machine and building it and and and preparing
the chemicals for us so you got the large mantle prize pretty much on lock youth that you think now
well so uh we submitted for the prize and um i have independently evaluated some electron
micrographs from those pig brains myself and to me they look pretty good um i think it's it's
definitely a contender uh they're being evaluated right now so um we ought to hear more than that
pretty soon but i would i would give it a you know higher than 70 chance that we're going to win that
prize now i'm i'm really curious about this since the since the fixing the brain first with the
um aldehydes was it maldehydes um it's a it's a glute aldehyde which is a part of this chemical
class of of aldehydes that include formaldehyde acrylin balanda hide all that all that good stuff
okay so since fixing the brain first with an aldehyde and then taking as long as you need to
to put in cryo protectants and then squeezing it slowly it seems like such a superior technique
are alcor and ci adopting this technique in their preservations well uh no but there's good
reasons why they wouldn't want to um and the main reasons come from a it's a very demanding technique
if you're going to fix something with aldehydes you really almost would need to be there right as
the animal dies right okay and preferably you actually um euthanize the animal as part of
the preservation process um it's much less forgiving in in some states that's legal and
i totally am hoping to die in one of those states if possible but but uh you know alcor um for better
or worse you know if you look at their recent preservations right uh they wouldn't be very
equipped to to actually do this for individuals because there's generally a lot of time after
death before they start getting preservation procedure right so an initial flush of cryo
protectants will to some degree open up the vasculature an initial flush of gutturaldehyde
is not going to do that for you and then the other part is this almost philosophical debate
which is you know a lot of people don't like the idea of uploading um or don't like the idea of
sacrificing this metabolic ability if you care very much about preserving the actual like cells
that make up your brain then it's almost a non-starter to glue them all together right um
because the most realistic way you're going to get someone back from a procedure like this is an
advanced imaging technology that's going to create a digital simulacrum of that brain while the
original brain like the original antikythera mechanism is permanently fused into the solid
mass that is never going to work again right and you know there's some debate over that because i
mean like i would still argue that if you're you know got some kind of crazy direct slurry of
nanotechnology or whatever that it'd probably be easier to cut crosslights than to infer structure
but in any case well and do they even need their original brain back with advanced enough technology
couldn't they just regrow if they if they're wedded to an organic meat body could they just
regrow a brain and structure the neurons so that they are mapping to the the preserved solid glue
chunk of brain that you have is yeah but some people some people believe that that wouldn't be
them huh if they are copied just be a copy you know those that come in uh common deal right it's
kind of like you know if you were writing your term paper you know and then suddenly your computer
dies all right and now you don't have your term paper anymore and you know the sense of dread comes
because you really needed this and you know you don't have time it's it's too really soon uh it's
due the next morning right if someone then came and said oh hey actually uh there's a backup of
this in the cloud okay yeah uh impressing keys and now suddenly you have your term paper again
you know some people might feel like now their term paper is back some people may start crying and
say but it's not the same term paper it's not the same bits that it was you know and so some people
will feel that way about their their brains as well so because it's not the same one so because
of those people Alcor is not not implementing this thing well I wouldn't say that but I mean uh
if someone signed up for something that they that they thought was one way and then they changed
to another way that might be you know a problem oh I see so we oh so we almost have to petition them
to start another track of services where they will uh fix the brain I mean not right now obviously
but after there's been more development down this track well you know people like Hayworth have said
that they don't think Alcor should be preserving anybody um because if you don't have a technique
that you know preserves synapses for him it's like a non-starter right and so you know Hayworth
probably argues that um until such time as you can show that you're preserving synapses right um
there's almost no point to even doing a technique at all you know that's tricky because that competes
with this idea of well let's do the best we can right and and hope that the future will be able
to fix whatever we did wrong and then then you've got this problem of well what do you define as
the best we have right because now we've got this technique that is sort of the best cryobiology
technique in the world okay um but it doesn't have evidence that it that it really preserves
synapses right you've got another technique that absolutely will kill every cell irreversibly
right but if you look at it with an electrical microscope it looks really pretty right you know
what do you use depends on how you're viewing the problem I think I'm less worried about you
Inyash or about this than you are Inyash uh I don't plan on dying this month so I'm hoping that
you know in hopefully several decades there will be fines to the best available practices that are
you know out there and it won't well I mean when you talk about they it's it's literally just me
that's working on this right now so uh I do wish that there is more than just literally one guy I
do regret um but hopefully in 40 years that won't be just you I mean that's when you say hopefully
in 40 years I I was much more optimistic about those sorts of things when I was in my 20s I'm
like yeah people are working on it and now that I'm like in the later half of my 30s already
I'm like oh my god two decades have gone by since I first started becoming aware of this thing and
it's been two decades without much progress like I'm actually down to the point where just saying
I hope people work on it isn't enough several more decades could pass I don't plan on dying
in that I don't think I'll be dying in the next few decades but I want to have been made a little
more progress than was made in the last few decades you know well I mean look when when
biology was first you know coming onto the into the forefront people sincerely believed
in the 60s that we would have some reversible suspended animation in five years and I mean
really respectful people believe this similar to how you know like Minsky literally at the
Dartmouth conference assigned the entire problem of computer vision to like two grad students as a
three month project okay you know just just make computers be able to see like how hard could it
be and it turned out that that these things were way harder than anybody could have imagined and so
you know this we're going to get it pretty soon sometimes that doesn't happen right and I was
really motivated to try and make it happen because you know I think we've got a good shot of doing
it now we know so much more about brains and memories and we've got all these cool chemical
techniques and there hasn't been too much effort towards you know approaching from an information
perspective that there's a lot of rolling fruit and it's a it's a good thing to be doing yeah so
how do you how do you get funding for this right now because I can't imagine that it you know pays
for itself well we have funding from the national institute of mental health and we work with the
synthetic neurobiology group at MIT the Ed Boyden and we're working on connectomics
technologies right so this this this thing I made is the most advanced brain banking technique in
the world and if you want to use it to really study brains at especially human brains at the
nanoscale level there's nothing else that can can really do that and and preserve samples for
really long time so one project that that I'm literally am working on right now like in mixing
chemicals for it as we're talking is this idea of taking a brain that's been preserved with
altitude statewide prior preservation and being able to do useful things with it such as preparing
it for electron microscopy so right now I'm banging my head against this this problem of
staining and plastic embedding for electron microscopy that that Nicole has you know been
struggling with for years and it turns out it's really hard problem it's kind of kicking ass right
now but today hopefully we'll finally get something that that's that works really well so how terrified
do I have to be that your funding is going to dry up and you're going to have to like go get a job
doing accounting or whatever well you know I want you to keep working on this for a long time is the
I basically committed my life to making this work so you know I'm going to figure out a
way to make it work no matter what we've got we have some private funding as well which we'll
get too far into but it's a little it's a little precarious now I guess I do think that we're right
on the cusp of people you know really seriously reconsidering this whole idea of preservation
and pouring some more resources into it and part of my job is to explain that well and get
excited about it so you know I think a terrific job of that I'm optimistic about about the future
you know I got a it's kind of my responsibility to keep next home alive and funded and be able to
do some of this good research one of the really exciting projects that that I'm very interested
in is preserving the first human brain um with allied sewage crop preservation um in a research
context uh you know so this is like if someone who but donates their body to science and then
basically slicing that brain and having it independently evaluated um and actually you
know working out what the real time course is for brain degradation after death um human neurons are
tougher than a lot of other neurons like animal uh neurons of rabbit mouse etc um and nobody really
knows when the connectome degrades in a human model um that research just hasn't been done at
least I've never been able to find it and I've looked pretty extensively and so you know figuring
that out something useful so that we could say you know two hours after death the connectome's
still there five hours after death it's not there that type of thing um I suspect that
number's two hours but I don't really know um and so you know getting some of that research done
in a research context I think is is key right because then you're going to be able to say
here are the parameters by which we can guarantee that we can preserve your connectome right is
there anywhere that like I personally and maybe any other listeners that are are moved to can
donate to help fund this sort of thing I mean donate money yeah um you know right now I think
it makes more sense to do it from a you know for profit perspective as a company at least I want to
I want to try that out okay and so you know we focus more on getting grants um but I mean if
anybody's interested in talking about it more um I'd be more than happy to talk to them we can thank
you you know me at at R at Neck Tome R at Neck Tome yeah R for Robert and uh be more now to talk
to anybody who's who's curious about it or wants to learn more about it or you know all that good
stuff and Neck Tome is N-E-C-T-O-M-E dot com yeah okay excellent this crap we've been going about an
hour um did you want to do I do I'm assuming you have important things you need to get back to
yeah I need to go uh need to go prepare my osmium tetroxide stain now and and try to kill myself
doing it and uh got some got some meetings uh later on in the day so I am gonna have to run
but it's been a real pleasure talking with you it has been fantastic uh I I there were so many
more things I wish we could have gotten to but maybe some other day yeah well you know if you
want to get into the details of of electrolyte cross spear really anything uh more than happy
way to do another one I assume you edit these things and don't just post them raw right yes so
you know if you want to do another another hour like next weekend and then have two to put together
who could do that especially if you wanted to prepare you know some questions or something
and you know sorry for being a bit hectic today whatever you want to do uh possibly I will have
to check with Steven and check our calendars but uh next week or maybe the week after uh that sounds
really good yeah cool okay sounds fantastic thank you so much for joining us and when you have a
moment uh go ahead and drop me an email and we'll figure out at another time well before I let you go
Robert thank you again um this was one of the most riveting conversations I think that I've had on
the podcast and I think one of the most important I uh I guess I try to think of multiple ways to
express gratitude but thanks again this was fantastic and uh you know please keep doing what
you're doing a lot of us are counting on you and while we were talking I I finally got that thing
done so I was a bunch of powder earlier now it's finally a nice golden solution so fantastic there
we go cool all right well thanks again see you around bye bye bye we can just dive in and say
you know and for listener feedback we can do it in the standard order and then just cut and paste
at the end if you want okay all right all righty today we would like to thank Alexis Goldeski
for helping support us uh you make this possible and help bring it to everyone else thank you very
much Alexis and because we don't have Kyle Moore this week to do a sound effects for us we're just
gonna go dun dun dun dun thanks Alexis yeah you're awesome and moving on to listener feedback
Eddie loved to comment on the website on the social media and outrage culture
episode and I think that was one where you and I talked about engaging in arguments with
really uh savvy wrong people like that climate science denier guy so Eddie said regarding the
need to be more informed to win arguments I think that street epistemology is a perfect tool for
engaging with people who may know more about a topic than you do even if the topic at hand is
well above your level asking questions like why do you believe this is true is a good way to encourage
the interlocutor to examine their own position as an outsider by the way they've gotten into the
sd crowd on facebook etc sent our episode on it so thanks cool that Eddie I hope it's working for
you yeah I actually just had something similar happened yesterday where I was talking to my mom
about uh how you probably I heard shouldn't take vitamin d late at night better to take it in the
morning uh because your body usually gets most of its vitamin d from the sun and so possibly might
uh disrupts sleep a little bit if you take it late at night and I was like yeah I don't say don't
believe at all that sounds like bullshit that's a load of crap I don't know why you're telling me
that it's like okay I mean that's interesting but why do you believe that and I was like uh I just do
it was interesting to see the change on her face when I I didn't challenge her belief I just asked
her why she believed it you know and that made her actually stop and consider and we talked about it
for a little longer after that yeah and it's not a question I think most people ask themselves when
they think they know things regarding I guess that thing in particular I just take a daily
multivitamin in the morning because I think for the most part if you eat anything like a balanced
diet you don't need vitamins because you're getting enough of everything but since I don't it helps
and then there's always the controversy as to how much your body can really absorb from a
multivitamin right yeah I don't take ones that have like 5000 percent it's the four dollars for
a hundred that you get at target or whatever I figure for a few cents a day it's not a big deal
exactly I can spare a few cents a day there's there's more things to be worried about than
whether people are you know wasting a few cents a day although you can take too many vitamins and
hypervitamin toxicity is a real thing or is it hypervitaminosis I forget which
turns out that vitamin k is a treatment for hypervitamin toxicity okay I don't know what you
do if you overdose and vitamin k well let's ask a scientist anyway regarding this so that I think
that the the fundamental questions what do you think you know how do you think you know it that
sort of thing and just straight socratic method you know what do you mean I guess asking naive
clarifying questions I think that would work great on the casual conversation with like you know our
moms about over the counter med they're taking or people we bump into at work about whatever right
yeah but with a sophisticated arguer like that climate science denying guy I'm not convinced
that would work it might be worth trying for fun but I feel like they would have answers to that
they I mean I'm sure that Grover Norquist would have and I know Ken Ham does too for all the
questions that you can ask him about creationism yeah I get them feeling that what was his name
Horquist Grover Norquist Norquist would be much more capable of like an actual dialogue
ham would just say like well you know we have that answer it's in this book no no it's like
Ken Ham knows all the answers he goes in debates I just I saw part of his debate with with Bill
and I and that's what he kept saying oh really and I would ask like you know well what about this
and he's like well we actually know that it's in this book I don't know if you've heard of it it's the
Bible oh my god so yeah I mean it's like it like he's clearly not playing the same game right maybe
it wasn't ham maybe it was um I know there's some people that that are creations that are much more
researched on that and have answers like well you know if you do this and this with the biology
then that happens oh sure like yes you can get I so I don't think I give Ken Ham the sophisticated
arguable status like Dinesh D'Souza or Francis Collins might be right where you talk to them
and they would talk about things like macro evolution versus micro evolution that sort of thing
but if you're coming in from you know where Socrates claims to come from and like I really
don't know anything I feel like you wouldn't know if you heard a really good bullshit answer
whether or not it was bullshit and I mean it gives you it gives you a tool to dig with
yeah for sure but they might have this bedrock that while wrong is solid enough that you can't
dig it anymore right yeah but um but it's better than just trying to it's probably better than
trying to challenge them on things that you have a like weak understanding of so I guess
maybe this would be worth trying at some point I wonder if we can grab somebody that we disagree
with at some point and bring them on for something fun and that knows a lot more than us about a
topic that shouldn't be hard to find no it should I'm sorry you went to school for more than a month
you probably know more than us awesome well thanks Eddie I like that that feedback and that's
something to consider hell yeah I have some feedback this was on the subreddit we were referred
by ceremonial Carl Popper to a post by Sam Zedat or Sam Zedat maybe I'm not sure this is the
website where we talked about the scene like a state I got about half of my material from that
website so I got some respect for it I'm going to greatly cut down the what is said in the post
just to get to the real meat because the guy is very loquacious what's the term for when you use
more words than you necessarily need to one word for it is long-winded another way to put it is
thorough okay yes very thorough I'll give them that and by the way have you read any of this guy
have you read any of the last psychiatrist no I swear to god I have this conspiracy theory
that after the last psychiatrist retired from blogging like a year or two later he was like
I want to start again but I don't want to start as the last psychiatrist so now he's posting on
Sam Zedat instead because sounds absolutely like the last psychiatrist how do you spell Sam Zedat
Sam ZDAT oh that's not okay just like it sounds yeah I don't remember the name of the actual
poster of this which is terrible I hate it when people have a name in their blog title but it's
not the name of the person but anyways this is for our social media episode first of all the
article points out that Tristan Harris is selling an app so he has sort of a vested interest in making
you feel like you are addicted to social media that I believe that app is called time well spent
or something it's a way to reduce how much time you're spending on social media oh sure and so
he's like right away aha monetary motive but he makes some very interesting points he says
Facebook records two billion monthly users if they pay five dollars a month then they won't need
to addict you because the whole point of addicting someone is to get revenue through
advertising if you get revenue from this five dollars a month you don't need to addict you right
he goes on to say avoiding the attention apocalypse is cheaper than a pack of cigarettes I guess
apparently none of that is so addictive for them to risk charging one 30th of a smoker's budget
if social media isn't worth five dollars a month to you then what does that say about how you value
your time and if the responses all my friends are on it and they write interesting things
then how little do you value your friends time goes on to say the classic critique of media is
that it tells you what you want to hear media tells you what you want to hear but sharing it tells
others what you want them to think about you so sharing an article tells your friends that you're
the kind of guy who shares this important article so anyone interested in the addiction article
either has a problem or wants to gloat but focusing on the problem people they need to
understand why they keep doing a thing being on social media that does not satisfy them further
they need it explained in such a way that they are not to blame this is precisely what Tristan
what Tristan Harris offers an explanation for why you have no power and why some other has it
the problem with advertising and media interest in heres is not that they fail to provide you
what you want is that they give you exactly what you want all of the time and you just wanted the
wrong thing which is why i say that he sounds very much like the last psychiatrist they very
much have a vibe of stop being a shitty person and stop being narcissistic and really look at
yourself and fix yourself in a in a really non-sugar-coated way and and i liked that article
and i just wanted to share that a little bit too so can you paraphrase was he pro tristan
harris or anti tristan harris he's anti everything he's kind of anti humans but
somewhat anti tristan harris anti social media anti people who use social media anti people
who complain about using social media too much that sort of thing okay so there's nothing he's pro
then because like it sounds like he's pro like he and he and tristan harris agree that we're using
social media too much yes but he's pro growing up and being a goddamn adult and recognizing
that the reason you use uh they're both very big on narcissism the reason you use social media is a
narcissistic impulse to present an image of who you are to other people sure and i mean that's
really what social media is for right here's the pictures of me when i'm having the most fun and
looking the best here's the articles that paint me in a good light because this is what i'm in uh
worried about this is what i think is important and so uh he's saying that that is a narcissistic
thing and it is damaging to people and probably to society in general when there's a lot of people
like that that are more concerned with the uh style and the image they're presenting than the
actual substance of their character yeah you won't find any disagreement with me on that as far as how
people like that's why people share what they share on facebook right well about half of them
probably the other half just like cute doggo pictures sure but they're the kind of people
who want people to know that they share dog pictures everything's just sharing dog pictures
you just like the cute dog it's signaling all the way down right um yeah so uh Tristan has this
app and i'm looking at it right now isn't seem to me like any more uh less good than like those uh
like an adblock app or what are those ones i forget what it's called but because i've never used them
but you can set up apps that you can blacklist certain websites and say okay once i have this
extension and go engaged on chrome it won't let me look at facebook or any of those apps for uh
you know three hours or something because i want to actually work yeah productivity apps yeah
so i i guess i don't see why do you bring up Tristan Harris's app because Tristan Harris was
really big and all over the media recently yeah but like he so he has a motive to share this but
yeah like he saw a problem is trying to fix it and if you can make money while doing it that's
just a win for him too right right but i don't think that i didn't get the impression anyway that he
you know kind of made up the problem and then provided the solution for it right so like that's
like what a snake oil salesman does right this doesn't seem like snake oil it sounds like he's
actually trying to sell a solution to an actual problem yes i i think Tristan Harris is doing
good work by sounding this alarm which i guess we a lot of people are already aware of it but it
takes someone oftentimes to stand up and say hey this is actually a problem before people are willing
to acknowledge it and also kind of providing a thing that can help the the last psychiatrist
and those sorts of blogs i'd really like to be very cynical about everything right on i can take
part of the brand not without incident on the subreddit says again about social media i think
that dispassionate cynicism or disengaging is probably more dangerous to humanity than
unwarranted outrage and i don't know what do you think about that because i'm kind of of the opinion
that unwarranted outrage is probably worse partly because that gets you things like lynch mobs and
also because it gets you uh recently eliezer started posting another sequence of posts slash a new
book and uh he mentioned that there is a nutrient solution that some premature infants are given
to treat a condition uh that they're born with which is lacking a very important nutrient uh
it's one of the omegas the point is this nutrient solution is basically poisoning and killing babies
at a rate of maybe a hundred a year or so and it's super easy to fix all you got to do is swap out
the soybean oil with fish oil it's cheap it's easy there's a decent amount of people that know this
and yet we as a society cannot get it done you just due to fda regulations and other things you
cannot get that nutrient solution for your baby that will not poison it if it has this problem
and he mentioned that one of the things is if you bring this up like to try to get attention
to the issue and fix the issue there's not enough outrage left in society to to be outraged about
a hundred dead babies a year we're too busy being outraged about you know what some celebrity said
or who is being a douchebag on twitter recently and so that is sapping all of the outrage that
could be used for actual productive things like saving babies lives to just fight in the culture
wars i think i agree on both counts i'm certainly certainly my my intuition was the same as yours
that like if you're just cynical all you're gonna do is just like sit at home and think about how
dumb everyone is but if you're outraged over nothing you're inclined to get online and ruin
someone's life or help ruin someone's life or yell at people in real life or something right
um you know warranted outrage is totally i think a thing that you know as long as your your outrage
is productive i'm i can get behind and understand right well first of all yeah the outrage fatigue
though yeah if you're getting fatigued you have something productive to do at home you know that
requires physical labor but you burn all your energy working out then you can't actually get the
work done and the working out doesn't actually do anything for anybody then you're wasting all
that energy right and then allows you falls apart because you get healthier but whatever right
this you just get sicker yes but there was a woman who she had like 150 twitter followers and
tweeted some shitty joke before traveling to uh to africa did you hear about this yes yeah so
she said go in africa hope i don't get aids and then her second tweet was just kidding i'm white
yeah i mean whether or not it's a funny joke like i feel like a comedian like sarah silverman
could have got away with it right but it's one of those intentionally offensive jokes that is in bad
taste yeah might be funny if you're in the mood and you know it's even it's funnier too if it came
from so do the reputation as a comedian right but so what ended up happening the the quick version
is that she tweeted this out you know again 150 followers she's not sitting there on top of a mountain
of a million followers i don't know what's a big number that's probably a lot while she was in
the air for 10 hours she like hit number one or two on trending on twitter and she was just ripped
apart and then when she landed she's like oh everyone hates me i've got a million death threats
and i've lost my job um so like i feel like people get online to rip her apart bad joke or not even
if she meant it or rather even if she this was coming from a malicious place which i'm not convinced
it was i didn't read the full dissection of what happened here but and unless she's working in public
relations that probably doesn't have much of an impact on her job to be making shitty jokes yeah to
be making shitty jokes it is interesting though and i do have mixed feelings about like do you want
somebody who believes bad things to be working for you right on the one hand like their beliefs don't
really you know if you were a neo nazi you could still do your hunting job just fine i could but if
my black or jewish co-workers knew that i was a neo nazi that would make working with me very
difficult in the office probably sure and since you have to work with other people that can be an
issue well like i said i feel like even louis ck or another comedian could have gotten away with
this right it's also just weird because nobody had ever heard of her because she had 150 twitter
twitter followers and this just exploded and set her life on fire so um because people at home were
like i'm outraged at this and i think that brings up something that we need to talk about at more
length at some point that i really understand that response and i don't really get being offended on
behalf of other people um like who's like is that joke offensive to me maybe but it's probably
definitely offensive to somebody but should i be offended for them and if i am do they have to stop
right i don't really get offense but that's a whole other thing we should definitely do an episode
on offense deal i will say though that on the other hand lots of dispassionate cynicism gets you
to quirrell voldemort quirrell from methods of rationality i mean that was basically his shtick
he is the dispassionate cynic and that's when you can sit back and watch atrocities happen and be like
yeah well you know humans gonna be humans first race war huh oh summer first race war huh um so
that's that's also a problem and dispassionate cynicism could just as easily get you the same
thing as like so a hundred babies a year die whatever i don't have time to switch out my oils
that's true and that race war thing was a rick and morty reference so we're not really laughing
at race wars um aren't we though pointy nipples versus what uh spiral nipples yeah yeah so i guess
that's true maybe i mean the key you know i think with a lot of answers with a lot of things like
this that involve extremism is go for that golden mean ericetelian virtue and say look moderate your
outrage moderate your your cynicism leaves energy to be productive because yeah if you're overly
cynical then you learn that oh yeah this person did all these terrible things uh you know kevin
spacey last week had all those confirmed or those i guess confirmed he more or less said i probably
did that to some of these allegations i think it makes sense to have some level of of outraged
about that and there's you know a response that sounds appropriate um but then you can go over
the top and whatever some people someone probably tweeted i want him dead or it'd be great if he died
i don't i almost never feel that way about anybody but that's a whole other thing i think it kind of
goes back to all debates or bravery debates which is a scott alexander post saying that basically
a lot of reaction that people have is what they see their community going too far in one direction
and they're trying to pull it back and people in a different community who is going too far in the
other direction are like are you fucking crazy you want even more of this and so i imagine using that
as a model that not without incident is probably in a place where there is a lot of dispassionate
cynicism that's hurting him whereas we're in a place where there's a lot of unwarranted outrage
that's hurting us we're both right just in different places yeah that makes sense nice compromise and
i i think i stand by the fact that moderation is probably the key there first all was the
utkowski posts where are those at uh those are at lesser wrong dot com and by the way for anyone who
is uh or who used to be on less wrong dot com and doesn't know about this yet there is an effort to
an actual like real legit effort that seems to be gaining some serious traction here to revive
the lesser on community over at lesser wrong dot com oh it's at lesser wrong dot com yeah yeah and
they've got posts up by uh this v who i really like and elias redkowski and a whole bunch of other
big rationalist names which let's see we have an email here from satir so they signed it their last
paragraph here was asking about starting a rationality discussion society in our local area
what sort of essential skills and knowledge we would recommend i don't know if i'm the best
person to ask about that like we started the one here but that was kind of just like we had the
catalyst from the methods of rationality wrap-up party yeah and i just wanted to keep that going
i totally want to have a whole episode about that and include max harms on it yes so that is that
is worth coming that's on the list i wanted to let you know and there's another thing on here
that we might be able to hit pretty quickly um i think it'd be interesting if you did an episode
at some point where you showed how one implemented bajian skills for instance i've yet to explicitly
apply bayes praise be his name uh law uh they clarify that was tongue-in-cheek um yes so we're
one of those communities that's like by the way i'm just joking about this crazy thing
for myself i can answer that pretty quickly and that i've so far never put pen to paper
and calculated my my priors versus the impact of the expected evidence and that sort of thing
but the main thing that i do to adjust my thinking is that i realized that my beliefs about the world
are not the actual facts of the world yeah um the map versus territory distinction yeah and like so
that sounds super obvious and it kind of is in retrospect but it's not a distinction at least
i made on my own 10 years ago because what you believe about the world feels just like how the
world is right and your beliefs don't have to be i believe this or i don't believe this you can
say i believe this with 85 percent confidence or whatever you only have to assign an 85 versus 86
percent but you can say i'm pretty confident and those confidence levels i think keep you epistemologically
humble in that if someone comes to you with evidence against whatever belief you have
you're not going to say well that has to be wrong because i have this belief and it's right
you could say oh i didn't expect to see things like that because i was pretty sure this was right
can i bring up my parents again just because lately i've been trying to sneak some rationality
into their intellectual diet go nuts okay so i was talking with my dad he made this comment about
my sister was joking around with my mom and said that my mom needs to be on anti anxiety medicine
and my dad said no no she was my sister was saying that she needs to be on anti anxiety medicine
not my mom and my mom was like no she totally said i need to be on it and my dad was like
hmm you might have a point but i'm gonna go with 99.99 percent certainty that she was saying it about
you and not about herself and so my mom called her up and uh verified that she was talking in
fact about my mom not about herself and my dad was like huh okay well you know i said i wasn't
100 sure and at this point i was like okay dad i didn't say this at the time when you made your
confidence declaration but for for you to say that you have 99.99 confidence in something is
extremely much stronger than you think for example me and my friends every now and then as part of
our rationalist thing try to make some predictions about the future and we make a number of them
and if we predict that like 10 things will happen with 70 confidence we want to be right
for seven of them and wrong for three of them because that means we are accurately calibrated
if we were like right about nine of them and only wrong on one we would feel ashamed because
we were too unconfident we should have been 90 confident in those predictions or at least we
would feel wrong because i don't know if we want to encourage shame there but i was trying to shame
him a little bit for saying 99.99 i agree took two significant figure or significant digits into
it like one in a thousand chance of being wrong and something that minor that's one in 10 000 i told
him that if you had been us you would have had to make 10 000 statements of equal confidence and
only gotten one of them wrong and do you really think that was a statement that strong because
first of all you know that just as a human sometimes you hear things wrong and that was a pretty easy
one to hear wrong so that by itself should have dropped you down to like maybe 90 and also you
know your daughter i know my daughter she's kind of a person who would make a mean joke about my
mom needing anxiety medicine but never ever saying that about herself so that should have updated you
even more like i would have said even if i had heard with my own ears her saying that she needs
medicine once i heard someone saying no no she was thinking about your mom i would have been like
okay yeah i'm dropping down to 70 confidence even though i heard with that with my own ears just
from what else i know and so i think i think i managed to get through a little bit to him that
confidence is is more important than just saying well you know i'm almost positive take those things
that you know into consideration what you know about a person and what you know about how likely
it is to mishear something yeah throw in the fallibility of memory there and i'd be like you
know what you're probably right so it's you know it's it's those kinds of things where you
you help people think about their beliefs in a probabilistic manner rather than just right or
wrong yeah i agree um you know if you want to make a Bayesian calculator and do the math you're
welcome to but that's sort of to me just like an exercise in i wouldn't i don't want to say it's
pointless the the key is like not to say okay i guess it should be 86 confident not 84 because
what are you supposed to do with that information right but the idea is to to get some ability to
calibrate your confidences and like i said for me it's just keeping your beliefs about your beliefs
non binary right so that's that's my quick take on that i think that's that is a very good basic
rationality skill that doesn't take too terribly long to teach and really gets you on the road
cool yeah that's where i'm at too okay i have a post on the subreddit by rtlpu saying i've heard
the sentiment that children are boring a few times in the rational sphere and on this podcast
i beg to differ being around a child is watching ascension being learn in real time highly interesting
to me at least do we say kids are boring we probably said doing things with kids is boring
that's possible too i definitely i know i've said that because i think i might have been quoting a
louis ck bit where he's talking about watching them read cliford the big red dog at the rate of 30
minutes a page yeah and you have to sit there being super bored and super proud because it's
awesome watching them read and it's got to be satisfying but at the same time it's like the
story's boring you're reading in a really boring way but yeah i will say i was i was the oldest
of my siblings and i taught them things often and if it hadn't required a college degree i
totally would have gone into teaching because i really love teaching and i am still around
young kids every now and then and so i totally agree watching people learn in real time is
fucking fascinating especially when it's like a little kid and they first grasp for the first time
like that big things far away look smaller but that doesn't make them smaller you know
it's just it's really neat but on the other hand the majority of the time that you're around kids
you got to do things that are really fucking boring so i guess it's it's more of a if the kids are
your own you probably spend a lot of time doing boring life keeping kids alive maintenance chores
as opposed to the cool learning bits but you're i think you're definitely right there are some
really cool parts about seeing a new being learning things yeah teaching is a lot of fun and it's
gratifying you know to understand it while yourself what age level were you would you have
considered teaching at oh i'm like as a job after i got out of high school i'm sorry what age
would you want people to would your students to be oh so i could do like the early grades
between second and fourth maybe or i could do high school because in high school then you
get to start teaching them really cool shit right but i do not want to teach middle schoolers because
that was i i really should not say bad things but an entire class of people but but that was
referred to yourself as a middle yeah middle schooler that was a terrible place in my life
and i have very negative connotations of middle schoolers especially middle school age boys so
i would not want to be within a mile of them especially not in large concentrations i've
just personally no for sure i completely agree so i thought about teaching for a while i have a
couple family or a couple family members who are teachers oh cool and so i mean first of all if you
want to make half of what you make now teaching is not that hard to get into i don't think you don't
really need a full college degree to i mean depending on what level you want to teach and all that
you just need a teaching certificate yeah with various charter schools and such they they're not
public schools public schools down to you don't need a i mean maybe a bachelor's but um
often not i think i mean a bachelor's is four years of my life and like 80 thousand in debt for
sure but i think and i can double check this but when i was talking to my aunt about it at one
point she had said that it's not that bad to get into and certainly i think if you want to teach
second to or yeah second to fourth graders they don't need you to have a you know a degree in
whatever you're talking about because they're guaranteed to know more than them anyway when i
thought about teaching but you gotta know how to teach like teaching itself is also a skill
sure you can buy a book it'll be fine yeah i i couldn't teach kids i think i would be frustrated
trying to cross that inferential distance between just there's so much to get across to get them to
have any idea of what you're talking about and then you're just teaching them like times tables
and all that stuff and um i taught someone skiing once and it took me half the day on the slopes
just to learn how to teach them like you just do the skiing right and you don't think about it and
it's like having to think about what you're doing and how to explain what you're doing and get them
to figure out how to do what you're trying to say it's yeah it was it was a full day project because
half the time was just me figuring out how to say it yeah and like noticing what you're doing to make
yourself not fall or go faster or whatever right yeah so i believe teaching is a legit skill it
takes time to learn oh yeah for sure i was being tongue-in-cheek and i said you could grab a book
on teaching and master it in five seconds i understood it was a joke okay yeah to be to be
clear it is a challenging thing that i certainly don't have to do at that level like i've done i
when i was at college or when i was in uh at csu i was the teaching assistant for one of the classes
i taid but um i wasn't a teacher aid i was a teaching aid it's a little different uh actually i
think it was both um and it's gratifying you know you can explain stuff to somebody and then you
know when their eyes light up and understanding that's super gratifying but you know those were
young adults it's a lot easier i think for me in my personality style i had a philosophy professor
once who well at least he expressed to me in whatever capacity he could without losing his without
jeopardizing his job without teaching sucks and like the environment surrounding his teaching
sucks and obviously not everyone feels that way but he felt like he did more time more effort
arguing to with the board and the administrators to try and teach stuff the way that he thought
would work rather than just actually teaching yeah and i'm also worried i hear that like
half your time or more is dealing with the one or two problem students in the classroom and i
don't want to do that and it sounds like a drag so i have the additional problem that i couldn't
teach adults like at a college level because i look like a junior high school student or maybe a
high school student so like i think i'd have a hard time commanding respect when they're all
taller than me and have beards um so but i thought like it would be fun to get around some of that
culture friction to teach at a part at a private school um a you'd probably need a lot more
credentials to do that but b you could get on board with how the private school does stuff
and then they might give you more freedom to do whatever you want as long as they're learning
stuff and that sounds like more fun because if you're just burning fuel trying to do your job
that's super discouraging and disheartening yeah but yeah teaching is fun and i think learning
or watching kids learning is probably a lot of fun and i can't imagine what it's like to be a parent
and watch your kid take its first steps and form its first full sentence and that sort of thing
i'm sure it's awesome so this one is probably going to be a little bit of a discussion on our
website the basin conspiracy dot com sends you says whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you guys appear to be
unsure about what conservatism and liberals and all that means because we we started talking about
which party is more more in favor of freedom right yeah yeah said you says i think this is a
great point because i think there's also that's also a result of your two party system either
you're in the red camp or you're in the blue camp in germany we have the fdp which basically stands
for less government control in all areas less surveillance less control in the economy all
that and i think that's what liberals are about and i think that is also what i meant when i said
that liberals were the ones that are trying to scale back government because when i think of liberals
i think of more like the libertarian like the classic definition of liberal being don't control
other people but then you brought up that the blue party in our system tends to be the one that tries
to regulate heavily a lot of businesses and get involved in a number of things that are really a
lot of government control but on the other hand the red party is the one that wants to come into
your bedroom and tell you what drugs you can't do who you can't sleep with what religion you
should be and they are slightly less regulatory but really just regulatory in a different way
i agree i don't think that either party is non-regulation and you don't want no regulation
i mean i read john stuart mills on liberty but it's you know five what's it i don't know i'm
holding my fingers like a centimeter apart it's a really small book but that's i'm not up to date on
like the best libertarian philosophy i mean there's a there's a version of that that makes a lot of
sense but i don't know how you run a society that way um certainly not a good society uh you need
regulation at some point so like you want uh somebody to say yeah you can't be putting out
that much waste you know you can't just dump it in the park yeah um so i mean which which party is
going to say that's for too much regulation you can't tell me where i can't put my radioactive
waste hopefully both parties are on board saying you can't put that shit in the park or anywhere
right but you're right one party is saying no look here's the kind of sex we want you to have
and that well you know we're gonna make it a big deal or uh you can't do this with your body
you want an abortion um what is what's a good example of blue control i don't really see registering
guns as a infringement on control uh in in our society it is in our society it's viewed that way
yeah there's here is a physical object that you are not allowed to own but i don't think that
that wasn't what i was saying i was saying registering it is different than saying you
can't have one yes it's just like you know no one's no one's saying you can't buy a car but we
want to know which ones you have yeah right that's that's government surveillance right yeah that's
the government knowing what you own where you live but that's different than saying you can't do it
just yeah but it surveillance a lot of people have negative um thoughts about that as well i'm not a
huge fan of surveillance either but i'm not that anti-surveillance in principle uh in practice
it tends to be shitty and so i am in practice someday yeah i might i'll have to talk about
my radical transparency roots i think we talked about that a bit with chase did we yeah okay and
eventually i abandoned them i think there's a difference between surveillance and control
one is saying we're gonna watch you do this stuff the other thing you can't do this stuff right
but watching you is the first step to control they don't have to put cameras in our bedrooms
to outlock asex right right um assuming that they wanted to like let's say if this was india
you know sex legal in india uh my impression is that it is i read something like that just this
morning okay um if it's not it's legal somewhere right so they don't have they don't have cameras
in bedrooms like they don't need to surveil you they're just saying you can't do this and if
someone says you did we're gonna kill you or jail you or whatever the whole of the government being
able to know where you are at all times by tracking your phone data that we talked about recently is
sort of a government surveillance thing oh absolutely so what what was the point that
we missed there that they drew contention with i want to uh that we were confused as to
what is conservatism and what is liberalism yeah and i guess the other thing is that libertarianism
is further to the right on the spectrum if you're drawing a flat line than liberalism right liberalism
is the far left conservatism is the far right and libertarian is far or is right in the center
depending it's maybe one of those weird things that like every sci-fi movie does when they fold
a piece of paper and half and punch a hole through it right um maybe it hits both like
any kind it does yeah but i think libertarian is it's weird in some way it's it's more right
and some things and more left in others yeah because like not regulating business is very
conservative right yeah um but you know not caring what drugs you use is very liberal yeah so maybe
i view it as more right of center maybe it's because people that i know that our libertarians are more
inclined towards conservatism than liberalism i think the reason it has such a very strong flavor
of rightism in our society is because libertarians at some point got together and decided that
since this is only a two-party system in america and libertarians literally can't run
right now and get a have a shot of winning any seats that they're going to vote republican
more often than democrat because republican are more closely aligned to the more of the
things they care strongly about so even though i don't consider them either right or left
since they tend to vote the same way the rightists vote they have the the right flavor yeah that
makes sense okay i got one last thing which is pretty short uh this is just as an an
informative thing google plex bite on the subreddit says regarding the valuation of intellectual
property my estimate for the value of the concept of a comedy film is certainly incredibly rough
but you could fairly easily make rights holders accurately value their property with the threat
of auction if a government evaluator feels that the right holder has undervalued their property
then the evaluator can demand an auction for the property where the rights holders proposed
value is their maximum bid putting them at considerable risk risk of losing the property
at auction proportional to their undervaluation which is an interesting way to fix that google
plex bite has obviously either thought or read a lot about this topic yeah no it's a good insight
thank you for sharing that with us yeah that is really cool i don't have enough knowledge there
to challenge or confirm that but i i like where it's going my freshman one-on-one objections
were knocked down by your having thought about this for more than five minutes perfect uh in that
case i think we're done with listening feedback and we can wrap it up cool awesome thanks for listening
and we'll see you again in two weeks now i'm good bye
