by the personal assistant who'd gone out shopping and so you know this is a situation where this
person already been dead for some amount of time beforehand and then someone discovers them and then
they call alcore and the people from alcore come in at 9 30 arizona time not sure exactly what okay
they're always using um they're always using military time here okay so june third 16 25
they find that this person has died okay and then 9 30 arizona time sunday morning so uh we're talking
about the next day june fourth on sunday right 16 16 25 to 9 30 all right so you know that's
that's about 16 30 to 9 30 so how many hours is that uh from four to nine that's 12 and another
five so 17 hours all right so that's 17 hours before anything even starts okay he's lying there
presumably at room temperature they claimed surgery went well confusion went better than
expected good flow was established and if they finished attempting to do this crowd preservation
at 12 50 arizona time so another four hours or so uh or sorry another three hours and in 20 minutes
and then they uh put this person in a dry ice um and sent him over and they're going to cool him
down so the key takeaway here is uh you got 17 hours of what we call normal thermic ischemia uh so
there's another one of your words of the day is it ischemia meaning lack of adequate blood
flow to maintain life in a tissue and layman's terms that's real bad news for crowd preservation
as my is my understanding well you know what i would like to see is a clear study of how
grains degrade over time um in the situations that that alcor normally expects and then that
should be the answer to you know what do we think about whether information is being preserved or
right so you know the what i'd like to be seeing is arguing about this from a synaptic point of
view saying our synapse is preserved how well can they be traced back to whatever neuron they're
coming from um those types of questions does that make sense yes that's awesome and then we should
judge whether our preservation procedures you know good or not based on how well it's preserving
the synapses but unfortunately you know not much is known about how human connectomes degrade over
time uh after death uh connectomes another good word this is the set of all your synapses so you've
got your genome and that's kind of how you build someone's body and then a connectome is kind of
how you build someone's memories and mind personality and and so you know it's a technique
that preserves the connectome is almost certainly going to be better than a technique that doesn't
preserve the connectome right with a couple of caveats there all right a lot of the biopreservation
protocols you know that are currently used for chronics are based around the discipline of
cryobiology right and so this is you know the science of of applying cold to biology and seeing
how that breaks out or how you can preserve it right um encompasses a lot of things including
how you destroy tissue of cold and also how you might preserve tissue right and one of the crowning
achievements of prior preservation would be the ability to preserve an organ so that you could
transplant it right uh and you know ideally you can be able to store organs for years and then
warm them back up and transplant them right and so you know the field of cryobiology is very
interested in maintaining life of the cells right maintaining their metabolic capacity maintaining
their ability to be successfully used in a transplantation scenario right um but i would argue
that that's not quite the thing we want when it comes to preserving brains right for a heart
of course you know a heart is only good for pumping blood so if it's not capable of pumping blood
there's really nothing good you can get out of it right so if your preservation technique doesn't
make it still be able to pump it's no good right but a brain is there for doing computations and
storing data right and so you know you might very well say i don't care if the brain can still
function if these these neurons in particular can still fire or if they can still metabolize sugar
or you know do the typical things that that are required to be alive what i care about is is the
data still there right um and so that would be you know more looking at this from the perspective
of computer science and neuroscience and even you know in some ways kind of like library science
right we're trying to we're trying to preserve information and it gives you some new opportunities
right if you're willing to sacrifice the metabolic capacity of your of your brain for better information
preservation that might be a really good trade to be making definitely for the brain in particular
but you're not going to necessarily want to be doing that if your your founding discipline is
this crab allergy right because that's totally antithetical to crab biological techniques right
you don't want to you know totally destroy the metabolic capacity of a heart and say
hey but the structure of the heart you know those muscle fibers still look exactly like they did
when the heart was alive right that's only going to be good for anatomical studies right so the uh
the field and so those are those are the things so the the research that's going on in that field
is kind of not useful for what we want with the brain because they're trying to preserve the function
rather than the structure well you know if you perfectly preserve the function and perfectly
preserve the structure that's even better right if you could achieve what they call um uh suspended
animation right where you could actually shut down an organism and bring it back and have it walk
off the table uh clearly you could prove that that preserves memory by just doing standard memory
assays like we do for animals or just if it's a person just ask them and interview them for a while
right yeah um but in lieu of that the question is what are the empirical tests you want to do
to determine whether a preservation protocol works or not or whether it's better than another
preservation protocol right and I think in lieu of total and complete perfect revival um you know
of course you can choose different segments that you're going to use for these protocols
but I think the one that that maybe you ought to be choosing is the ones that are informed
by neuroscience telling us how our memories encoded and so I think a really good first step
is inectome preservation can you preserve all the synaptic connections such that we're still
traceable um that was what the brain preservation prize was all about it laid down this challenge
that said uh how do we preserve brains so that we know the connective is still there
or can we preserve brains so that we know they're connected with us there and uh you bring
up the brain preservation prize we have not mentioned this yet in the podcast and I am very
remiss not having said that but you actually recently won the small mammal brain preservation
prize yes that is right we won that uh well like February 13th last year um for this year I guess
and uh yeah that was that was a lot of fun and uh we're still fighting for the large
mammal brain preservation prize and and hopefully we'll we'll know more about that very shortly um
so what what exactly is the small mammal brain preservation prize and how did you go about winning
that small mammal brain preservation prize um is the scientific prize kind of like you know the x
prize um that was was put together by this non-profit called the Brain Preservation Foundation
and they're really interested in in looking at this from a more neuroscience perspective and saying
we want to be able to preserve brains um arrays are there and the first step is preserve the connective
so let's make a prize for that because it seems achievable and the prize is very simple um you
can do whatever you want to these brains uh to preserve them and the criteria is you've got to
be able to make a very good case that your preservation techniques will keep the brain
stable for at least 100 years and number two is you're going to submit brains you've done this to
to the Brain Preservation Foundation and then they're going to independently evaluate uh the
quality of the preservation with electron microscopy we're just going to look at the synapses
and they're going to evaluate them the same way that they would evaluate their own
attempts at studying the brain um because it's generally understood what good brain preservation
looks like you know good synaptic connectivity and what damaged synaptic connectivity looks like
and so that's independently evaluated hello uh oh i think we lost so uh by an alien he's named
uh Sebastian Sonsubation who's a neuroscientist at Princeton who's really popularized the word
connectomics wait wait wait can you can you back up about 30 seconds so you dropped out for a
little bit yeah sure so so the deal is look you're a preserver brain um you need to make a really good
argument that it'll keep that brain preserved for at least 100 years you got to send it to the
Brain Preservation Foundation and they're going to look at the synapses and see if they're well
preserved um and that basically means for every synapse you can trace it back to a neuron what
kind of surprised me is that i had sort of assumed that they something like this had been done before
okay froze you know small test brains and then looked at them and saw that they were decently
preserved that was that not the case well for over 50 years we've known how to uh temporarily
preserve brains by profusing them with uh aldehyde fixatives and we've known how to image brains very
well um but only a slice of the brain okay and so the problem is if you just preserve a brain with
aldehydes it'll eventually degrade over time it's hard to make a case that that would last for at
least 100 years because although the brain's been very well preserved it's still aqueous it's still
in an environment of water and the random thermal emotion of that water is going to cause degradation
over time especially with the lipids you know brains mostly lipids and proteins and aldehydes
like either aldehyde or form aldehyde do a good job locking down proteins and don't do as good a
job locking down lipids and so you'll find in very old chemically preserved brains that you get this
kind of lipid film developed at the top of the uh vessel that the brain is in and this is caused
by migration of lipids over over many years just due to the thermal action of water and the freezing
the brain didn't help uh stop that well you can't just freeze a brain that's been preserved with um
which is to aldehydes because you'll get the ice crystals and although you'll you know stop this
thermal motion of water the ice crystals are going to tear up all your synapses and uh just
caused a lot of of major mayhem everywhere and to prevent that the perfused the brains with some sort
of cryo protection solution right or did that yeah so the the technique I came up with is called
aldehyde stabilized cryo preservation and it's combining kind of best of both worlds from the
chemical fixation and from the cryo perspiration you start with aldehydes lock everything down
and then you can take your time adding cryo protection slowly so that you don't distort
anything um and then you can vitrify that brain by pulling it down and it'll be solid and uh you
can then warm it up and demonstrate that that the snap to connectivity is deserved and that is that is
what you did yep that's right that is fucking fantastic now why hadn't they been doing that
before because I I had always heard that they did use cryo protectants like alcor and ci and such
well they use cryo protectants but they don't use fixatives at the beginning okay and so you can't
demonstrate that you can burn synapses with the current cryo protectants only right you need the
fixatives to stabilize everything first so what they do right now is just put in cryo protectants
and freeze it and your your contention is that that does not really fix things in place and preserve
them the way they should be preserved well it's never been demonstrated that that it preserves
synapses right um so you know what I'd like to see is in an animal model you know do things similar
to what happens to humans so you know let them sit for 17 hours and do your preservation and slice
that brain up and and look at it with electron microscopy and see how good it is um no one has
done that yet and not really I mean um I have always assumed that someone had just taken animal
brain and put cryo protectants in it and frozen it and then unfrozen it and looked at it well
sometimes that that is done sometimes it's looked at but it's never been demonstrated to preserve
synapses right I did not realize yeah but there's not very much stuff that's been that's been done
unfortunately um and a lot of the things that are done are done on you know animals zero minutes
the scheming time right but even those the problem is uh without the fixatives your brain is kind of
degrading over time right and so you don't have unlimited time to get this cryo protectant in
right um and you got to be way more careful about what cryo protectants are using um because you
know the brain is much less stable right so what happens practically is these brains end up getting
dehydrated and then when you try to image them uh the resulting electron micrographs are
uninterpretable we can't really make out synapses we can't make out structures um it doesn't look
very traceable and so the contention currently is that you know maybe it's is traceable anyway if you
could somehow expand it or with some other technology you could see that they're there but um in terms of
of a neuroscientist like Ken Hayworth being able to look at it and say yeah this is traceable like
this ought to retain the structures and put memory um that can't currently be done um with
traditional cryo protecting techniques such as are used by Alcor yeah so the people that have been
preserved recently maybe in the far future once we have really advanced technology we can decode
what's been what's been done due to the uh cryo protected profusion but it's going to be it's
it's going to be hard and you are trying to process less hard and more stable you know I don't think
humanity is ever going to be able to fix some of these Lagunas in ancient documents I just don't
see how you do it it's gone the information is destroyed and no matter how sophisticated you
can image the remaining pages right you're not going to get past a hole and so the question is you
know when we preserve brains now is it more like rendering them inscrutable but still fundamentally
with their information intact or is it you know like the burned up uh
carbonized scrolls from Pompeii or is it more like the Lagunas in these scrolls where you're
never going to be able to infer anything um and that gets into a lot of subtle things
and some of this stuff in such but yeah sorry what were you saying Stephen I was going to say
some of the things that I've read people contend that even if the Laguna is my new word at the
day like you said uh even if they they lose say 30 percent of their memories or something
if they have to relearn you know relearn how to hold a spoon or whatever it is that you know some
fidelity going into the future is still better than nothing um well sure yeah you know obviously
the less the less you lose the better certainly I want to keep as much as possible yeah and I think
you know in getting into a situation where you might not be able to get hardly anything back
it really depends on on a lot of more subtle factors but without getting too into the details
um I guess you know my thoughts are why not it's something that you know preserves
the connectome and kind of works in there you know my thoughts exactly as well I completely
agree I'm not defending the old practice that just I'm saying that I think this was a known issue
that people just sort of fit the bullet on um well yeah there's nothing to do but I mean let's do it
as well as possible yeah I think there there can sometimes be some complacency there it's like
you know if you think that anything is possible in the future um then it sort of doesn't matter
but in that case why even bother getting preserved right like yeah if you really believe that the
future can can fix these holes right then just cremate yourself and then figure out how to you
know look and look at the you know like in the like in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
who they said oh just looking at this one pie or something you can see the whole universe and
everything that's ever happened and all that good stuff but you know if you want to come back
within this century using modifications from technology we currently have but faster you know
like an electron microscope but a million times faster um the path to that is you know preserved
the connectome so how did you get involved because apparently you found out that things
were not sufficient and you started working on this what what brought that about I mean it's not
like it's hard to find out and the Alcor is super but bored on what they can do and what they can't
do Alcor doesn't claim that they preserve the connectome they claim you know based on cryobiology
we're going to try to apply the best cryobiological techniques similar to an organ preservation
technique that we can and hope for the best that's their that's their case right were you already in
some sort of a biological program uh well you know I've always wanted to understand how the brain
works and digitize memories right like since I can remember that's what I wanted to do and it
seemed like it would be a very difficult problem so that's why I went to MIT and originally I was
going to be studying you know current ways that they use to scan brains and understand how brains
work and try to make them scale up so you could apply it to a person and kind of extract their
memories and digitize them while they were alive that was what I was imagining right but you you
put something into their brain you'd use some advanced imaging technology and do it that way
and I quickly realized after looking at you know what existed at the time that that was really hard
and you know although we probably can put something like that together it's going to be an
awful long time before that's really practical right um but studying neuroscience and studying
neuroscience I realized you know a you know if you've ever emulated a system before you know
that a good enough approximation of a computational system basically is that computational system
right a calculator uh you can use that to add numbers and use to your your taxes right and
then imagine a simulation of that calculator like in a video game right um you might just superficially
simulate it right where it's just a thing that you've has buttons or something but if you really
got into the details and simulated with that the transistor level right the individual little
circuits in that calculator suddenly it's not just a really a simulation of a calculator it is a
