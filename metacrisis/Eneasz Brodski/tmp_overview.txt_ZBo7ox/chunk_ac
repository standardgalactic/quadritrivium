   - GPT-3 is significantly larger than GPT-2 with 100 times more parameters (175 billion vs. 1.5 billion).
   - The model's size and the amount of data available have a complex relationship, but there is enough text on the internet to potentially train even larger models, provided the scaling laws are favorable.

5. They wrap up the episode by acknowledging the support of their patrons and reminding listeners they will be back in two weeks. The episode is sponsored by "the Pointless One" and mentions Voodoo Donuts for their popular branding, even though the hosts found the donuts themselves overhyped and too sweet.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy 121 – Crony Beliefs.txt
1. The quality of the wood has been affected by climate change, with the current hotter and drier conditions leading to more combustible wood that contributes to larger, hotter, and longer-lasting fires. This makes it harder to fight and control wildfires.

2. Climate change is a significant factor in the increased flammability of vegetation, although the extent of its impact compared to the overall increase in available fuel is still a matter of debate.

3. The ongoing wildfires in the western United States this year could potentially reduce the fire load for the next few years if a significant fraction of the available fuel has been consumed. However, optimism about a reduction in fires should be tempered with an understanding that without careful management, the situation could continue or worsen.

4. The conversation touched upon the possibility of using nanotechnology as a solution to prevent wildfires by breaking down wood into less flammable substances, though it was noted that introducing such technology into the ecosystem comes with risks and should be approached with caution.

5. Both hosts agreed on the importance of updating knowledge based on new information and the concept of "less wrong" as a guiding principle in learning and understanding complex issues like wildfires and climate change.
