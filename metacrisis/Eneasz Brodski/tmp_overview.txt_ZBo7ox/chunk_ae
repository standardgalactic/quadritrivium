1. **Atheism Misconceptions**: The conversation began with a discussion about the misconceptions surrounding atheists, including the false stereotypes that are often loaded with negative connotations. This leads to the mention of an article from Slate Star Codex (now LessWrong) that exemplifies this problem by using the strict technical definition of atheist to tar people with various negative assumptions.

2. **Ad Blockers**: There was a brief mention of ad blockers, specifically "uBlock Origin," which is an open-source ad blocker for browsers like Chrome and others. It was noted that some ad blockers might now allow ads from users who pay enough for an exception, but open-source alternatives ensure transparency about what is being blocked or allowed.

3. **Feedback and Support**: The hosts expressed their appreciation for listener feedback, whether through comments on their website (TheBazingConspiracy.com), the subreddit (r/TheBazingConspiracy), iTunes reviews, or financial support via Patreon. They also acknowledged the efforts of their sound engineer, Kyle Moore, who contributes significantly to the quality of their podcast.

 In this episode of The Basin Conspiracy podcast, the hosts discuss the nature of lying and its implications on trust and reality perception. They explore why people we trust are often better at lying to us because we believe them more, which means we expend less mental effort assessing their truthfulness. This trust can lead to us accepting a misrepresented version of reality without question. The hosts argue that lying is an act of imposing one's own model of reality on another person, which can have negative consequences for decision-making and understanding the world. They also touch upon the idea that asking loved ones subjective questions like "How does my hair look?" is often a request for affirmation rather than a genuine desire for their honest opinion. The hosts emphasize the importance of truthfulness and the impact of trust on our interactions with others. They thank Kyle Moore for improving the podcast's audio quality, invite listeners to comment on the episode at thebasinconspiracy.com or r/thebasinconspiracy, and remind everyone that the podcast's logo has been updated and is now visible on iTunes. The episode concludes with a light-hearted note about how flushing a toilet can have a drug-like effect due to the release of dopamine associated with the act.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy 37 – AlphaGo Returns.txt
 In this conversation, the participants delve into philosophical and speculative ideas about the nature of existence, free will, and the concept of a "perfect path." They consider the possibility that life could be like a video game speedrun where everything is pre-designed to align perfectly, or perhaps each individual's life is their own speedrun to be executed as efficiently as possible. The discussion touches on the idea that the universe might contain many variations of perfect runs, with each person executing their own unique and harmonized path.

The group ponders the nature of reality and what it means to be "real," with one participant expressing difficulty reconciling the perceived lack of reality in others. They explore the connection between all beings and the idea that the universe might be a highly interconnected system.

The conversation also touches on the human tendency to find patterns in chaos, the role of personal choice in perceiving order or design in the world, and the possibility that the universe operates like a learning machine, improving over time through repetition and practice, akin to how a program like AlphaGo might refine its playstyle in games like Go or chess.

The dialogue ends on a light note, with gratitude expressed for the conversation and a promise to meet again in two weeks. The participants sign off, appreciative of each other's company and insights.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy 38 – Transhumanism pt 1.txt
 Emi, Steven, and Shelley engaged in a deep discussion about the ethics and implications of creating human beings, particularly through advanced AI or genetic engineering. They explored various aspects, including the idea of raising a child to provide them with all the benefits one might have wished for in their own childhood. The conversation touched upon the concept of cloning oneself to improve upon one's upbringing and genetics.

Steven expressed a desire to give his hypothetical child all the advantages he lacked, and to potentially clone himself to see if he could do better than his parents did for him. The discussion then shifted to the narrowness of tailoring a person for specific roles like being a scientist or musician, versus the broader societal context for creating an optimal addition to a population managed by an AI.

They considered a scenario where an AI is responsible for creating one more person to fit optimally into society, which Steven considered his "least bad" option for creating a person. The group acknowledged that there are ethical concerns and potential problems with creating humans in such a manner, but they did not reach a consensus on whether any scenario for creating people could be deemed good or ethical.

The conversation was extensive and philosophical, touching upon the nature of parenting, the role of society, and the responsibilities of potential creators. They wrapped up the discussion with thanks to their listeners, Patreon supporters, reviewers on iTunes, and acknowledged the efforts of their sound engineer, Kyle. The podcast ended after nearly two hours, with the hosts signing off and expressing their appreciation for the engagement and input from their audience.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy 41 – Ritual and Spirituality.txt
 The discussion revolves around the concept of social circles and their optimal size, often cited as 150 people, a number suggested by anthropologist Robin Dunbar. This number is thought to be a cognitive limit to the number of relationships individuals can maintain at one time. The hosts explore the idea of whether it's optimal to cultivate deeper relationships with fewer people or to have shallower connections with many more. They touch upon the benefits of emotional connections across different cultures and the value of historical figures, like Jesus or Muhammad, who may have influenced the social circles of a billion people each. The podcast ends with a reflection on the importance of closing rituals, such as saying goodbye at the end of the podcast, which signifies the end of the experience for the listener and the hosts. They also thank their sound engineer, Kyle Moore, for his technical contributions to the podcast.

1. **Topic of Nature vs. Nurture**: The discussion centered around the balance between innate abilities (genetics) and the influence of environment and parenting on a child's development, particularly in terms of intellectual or talent-based pursuits like chess.

2. **The Polgar Sisters Example**: It was mentioned as an example of how strong parenting can influence a child's abilities, as seen with the Polgar sisters who were raised to become chess grandmasters by their father.

3. **Innate Capability vs. Parenting**: The conversation touched on whether a child has the innate capability to become a grandmaster or if strong parenting could make up for a lack of such innate talent.

4. **Environmental Influence**: It was noted that the child's environment, including their peer group and community, also plays a significant role in their development, which can be vastly different depending on where they are raised.

5. **Shared Environment Concept**: The discussion mentioned the concept of shared environment, which encompasses all aspects of a child's life not due to genetics, including parenting, home environment, and schooling.

6. **Misconceptions in 50% Genetic/50% Environmental Split**: It was pointed out that the statement suggesting 50% of outcomes are due to genetic factors and 50% due to shared environment might be misleading because it does not account for the full complexity of environmental influences.

1. The discussion began by considering the comparison between the harm of catching a disease and the ethical considerations of incest, particularly when individuals are raised together from a young age. The speaker emphasized that their stance against banning consensual adult activities does not extend to endorsing them, as seen in the example of Woody Allen's relationship with his adoptive daughter.

2. The speaker clarified their position on adults who were raised together but are not genetically related. They consider this scenario to be problematic, even if they are not biologically related, due to the dynamics of their upbringing and the potential psychological impact.

3. The conversation touched upon the case of an actress whose parents were adopted brother and sister. This example was used to illustrate the speaker's views on personal autonomy and the right to make choices with one's own body, as long as no one is harmed.

4. The speaker expressed that while they do not advocate for banning any activities, there is an inherent unease or "side eye" given to situations involving individuals who grew up in close proximity, whether or not they are biologically related.

5. The speaker acknowledged that personal reactions to such situations may influence one's interactions with others, but ultimately, adults have the freedom to make their own choices.

6. A shout-out was made to the sound engineer, Kyle Moore, who ensures the podcast sounds great and handles technical issues seamlessly.

 The discussion revolved around the political and economic dynamics within the cryptocurrency space, particularly focusing on Bitcoin. The participants explored the game theoretical economic incentives that drive the behavior of users, merchants, and exchanges, emphasizing the importance of finding consensus among these groups for the system to function effectively. The conversation referenced a medium post by 21.co's CEO, Balaji Srinivasan, which details the factors affecting decentralization and inequality in the distribution of Bitcoin.

The discussion highlighted the unique role of developers as a separate group with their own motivations, distinct from users or investors. The participants agreed that the ongoing debates about technical details like block size or consensus mechanisms are driven by profit motives rather than necessarily for the betterment of the system itself.

Tor stresses the importance of user experience and the tendency of security experts to prioritize their own interests over the needs of everyday users. The podcast's hosts expressed a desire to have Tor back on the show for further discussions, acknowledging the complexity and novelty of governance in the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies.

The conversation wrapped up with an agreement that there are still many topics to explore and that there is ample room for future dialogues on the subject matter. The hosts thanked Tor for joining them and expressed their appreciation for the audience's engagement with the podcast.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy 48 – Cryonics 2 – Lacuna Matata with Robert McIntyre.txt
1. The discussion touched upon the topic of surveillance, where it was noted that while there is a general aversion to surveillance due to its potential for misuse, practical applications can sometimes mitigate concerns. For instance, the debate over whether sex is legal in India serves as an example of how surveillance can be a form of control rather than just observation.

2. The conversation also explored the nature of conservatism, liberalism, and libertarianism, emphasizing that libertarianism might be positioned further to the right on the political spectrum because its emphasis on limited government overlaps with conservative values in some areas, despite being more permissive on personal freedoms, which are often associated with liberal values.

3. The group discussed the influence of the two-party system in America, where libertarians have decided to align more closely with the Republican Party because their shared values make it a more favorable alliance for achieving political representation.

4. Lastly, a Google Plex bite on the valuation of intellectual property was introduced, suggesting that the concept of a comedy film has an incredibly rough but potentially quantifiable value. The proposal involved government evaluators determining fair market value with the option to auction off the rights if they are undervalued, thereby incentivizing accurate assessment of intellectual property by the rights holders.

In summary, the podcast or discussion covered the nuances of surveillance and control, political ideologies like conservatism, liberalism, and libertarianism, their practical implications in politics, and a novel approach to valuing intellectual property through government-initiated auctions. The session concluded with gratitude for the insightful conversation and a commitment to revisit the topic in two weeks.

1. **Human Connector Preservation**: Robert McIntoch is working on preserving the human connectome, which is a comprehensive map of all the connections between neurons in the brain. His project aims to demonstrate this preservation using a brain from a deceased individual. The success of this endeavor would be a significant step toward digital emulation of consciousness and self-awareness.

2. **Memory Preservation**: McIntoch also touches on the challenge of preserving memories for future digital emulation. He suggests that memory preservation can be approached as a zero knowledge proof, where an experiment is designed to reveal the existence of memories without needing to understand their exact encoding. This approach could circumvent current limitations in tracing brain tissue and large-scale memory storage.

3. **Brain on a Chip**: There are companies developing technologies to grow real cortical neurons on a chip, which can be recorded from and may eventually lead to recreating the computation of such neural networks using emulation techniques. This could provide a platform for testing memory preservation methods.

4. **Future Collaboration**: McIntoch is open to returning to the podcast to discuss the results of the next phase of his project once it's complete. He also suggests that sharing electron micrographs of the preserved brain tissue could be part of future discussions.
