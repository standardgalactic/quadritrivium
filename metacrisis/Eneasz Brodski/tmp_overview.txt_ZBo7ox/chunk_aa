Processing Overview for Eneasz Brodski
============================
Checking Eneasz Brodski/Any anti-tech movement is necessarily a pro-slavery movement.txt
1. The conversation began by discussing how modern comforts are built upon historical labor and suffering, specifically referencing the transition to the metal age and the need for charcoal instead of coal due to iron smelting requirements. This process required extensive deforestation and manual labor.

2. The discussion then shifted to reflect on the privilege of contemporary society, where people enjoy conveniences like electricity without having to consider the human cost or historical labor that made it possible.

3. The hosts considered a hypothetical scenario in which modern amenities like electricity were lost, but with the availability of slaves, one might still prefer to maintain luxury rather than return to a life of hardship. This highlights the complex relationship between technology and human labor.

4. It was pointed out that any anti-technology stance is inherently pro-slavery because the advancement of technology historically required vast amounts of human labor, which often involved exploitation or forced labor (such as slavery).

5. The hosts agreed that while it's easy to criticize historical practices from a position of modern comfort and privilege, it's important to recognize and acknowledge the hard work and suffering that went into building the foundations of contemporary society.

6. The conversation emphasized that the use of technology is not inherently problematic but rather a product of human history where the benefits often came at a significant cost in terms of human effort and suffering.

7. The hosts suggested that any movement against modern technology would inevitably be regressive and, by default, support the return to conditions that relied on exploited labor, thus aligning with the historical use of slave labor to fuel progress and innovation.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/Banning Violent Porn Harms Women Disproportionately.txt
 The passage reflects on the implications of pornographic websites banning content that depicts violence or non-consensual acts. The author acknowledges that such policies may inadvertently limit women's access to types of adult content they prefer. This is seen as a form of unintended harm, where efforts to curb potentially harmful content can end up restricting the choices and preferences of the very group these measures aim to protect.

The author points out that fighting for the right to access such material is challenging due to the sensitive nature of the topic and the potential for being misunderstood or perceived as supporting harmful behavior. The argument is made that individuals who are not dependent on a corporate employer for their income are better positioned to advocate for the preservation of this content, as they can speak more freely without fear of repercussions on their employment.

The author emphasizes that the preference for certain types of pornographic content among women should be respected and that removing such content from access can be harmful to those who genuinely find it consensually appealing and engaging. The overall sentiment is that the current approach to regulating online adult content may be misguided and could have negative consequences for its consumers.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/Blue Pill⧸Red Pill in Roko's Blender.txt
 The discussion revolves around the philosophical thought experiment known as the "trolley problem," which presents a moral dilemma where a person must choose between allowing a runaway trolley to kill five people on one track or diverting it to kill one person on another track. The conversation delves into the implications of this scenario, particularly the reaction to the hypothetical "blue pill" (which represents the decision to maintain the status quo with all its risks) versus the "red pill" (which represents a deliberate choice to accept a certain risk or danger).

The participants express indignation at the framing of the question, which seems designed to provoke a strong reaction. They reflect on the cognitive failure the thought experiment can reveal and acknowledge that in reality, anyone would take the red pill to avoid any risk whatsoever. The conversation also touches on the negative aspects of online discourse, particularly on platforms like Twitter, where such thought experiments can be met with harsh judgment rather than constructive dialogue.

One individual prefers to stay away from such online discussions by not being on Twitter, while the other finds value in discussing these ideas in person, as it feels more civilized and less confrontational. They also touch on the positive impact of disconnecting from the internet, as seen during their upcoming time at Burning Man, where they expect to feel happier due to a lack of access to online distractions and toxicity.

Overall, the conversation highlights the importance of critical thinking when faced with moral dilemmas and the potential negative effects of engaging with online commentary. It also emphasizes the value of personal choices in maintaining mental well-being by limiting exposure to harmful aspects of digital communication.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/Less Wrong Sequences Discussion 30.txt
 In this discussion, the group reflects on the complexity of explaining complex ideas to an audience that may not share the same level of understanding or knowledge. The example provided is the challenge faced by Eliezer Yudkowsky when he attempted to convey the rationality and importance of scientific evidence, particularly in the context of molecular technology being considered "scientific" as opposed to pseudoscientific or mystical beliefs like astrology.

The difficulty lies in the inferential gap between the expert (Yudkowsky) and the layperson. This gap includes not just the immediate evidence but also the underlying principles, logical steps, and foundational knowledge that lead to the conclusion. Yudkowsky's attempt to bridge this gap is exemplified by his Sequences series, which is an extensive collection of posts designed to explain rationality and other complex topics step by step.

The group acknowledges the impressive feat of attempting to convey such nuanced information, especially when faced with skepticism or criticism from those who have not undertaken a similar effort to understand the subject matter. The discussion highlights the importance of empathy and clear communication when conveying complex ideas, as well as the challenges of overcoming preconceived beliefs or biases that may prevent individuals from accepting new information based on scientific evidence.

In the next episode, the group plans to discuss the specific posts in Yudkowsky's Sequences that deal with scientific evidence, legal evidence, rational evidence, and the classification of molecular technology as either scientific or not. They also note that they accidentally skipped over several sequence posts in their current discussion and will need to backtrack to cover those missed steps.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/TBC Episode 199 Trailer.txt
 It seems you're exploring the concept of polyamory versus monogamy, and your thoughts touch on several key points:

1. **Perception of Freedom**: You've noticed that polyamory is sometimes perceived as inherently more "free" or liberating compared to monogamy, which can be seen as imposing restrictions. This framing can create a virtuous dichotomy where polyamory is viewed positively and monogamy negatively, without considering the complexities of individual relationships.

2. **Sustainability of Relationships**: You've found that in your experience, polyamorous relationships have allowed you to maintain a longer-term sexual interest and spark with partners than when you were monogamous. This suggests that for you personally, polyamory has been beneficial in keeping relationships fresh and interesting over time.

3. **Moral Evaluation**: You've considered the moral implications of both polyamory and monogamy, questioning whether polyamory is objectively "morally better" than monogamy. You've acknowledged that fewer restrictions might be preferable but also pointed out that expecting individuals to always choose the morally better option in relationships is unrealistic due to societal pressures and personal preferences.

4. **Social Judgment**: You've observed that there is a lot of judgment surrounding relationship choices, with a bias towards viewing polyamory as superior, which may not accurately reflect the reality of individual experiences or the potential for healthy monogamous relationships.

5. **Why Isn't Everyone Poly?**: Finally, you're asking why more people aren't choosing polyamory if it's seen as morally better and potentially offers a more sustainable relationship structure for some individuals. This could be due to various factors, including societal norms, personal inclinations, the complexity of managing multiple relationships, fear of judgment, or simply a preference for monogamy.

In summary, your reflections touch on the complex interplay between personal freedom, moral judgment, relationship dynamics, and societal expectations. You're questioning the simplistic dichotomy often presented between polyamory and monogamy and considering the reasons why people might choose one over the other based on individual circumstances and preferences. It's clear that the decision to engage in polyamory or monogamy is not straightforwardly better or worse, but rather a personal choice influenced by a multitude of factors.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy  88 – UBI and Other Forms of Evil Taxes.txt
1. Stan Lee discussed his experience working with Ed Bryant on comics, particularly their collaboration in the Wild Cards series. Bryant, who was respected and old-fashioned, always preferred receiving printed copies of written material rather than emails, and once wrote "bravara writing!" on a submission from Lee, which Lee found incredibly motivating and exciting.

2. Stan Lee's novel "What Lies Dreaming" is available for purchase in both ebook and paperback formats. The ebook costs $9.59, while the paperback copy is more expensive due to print-on-demand costs, approximately $16.99, which is still a reasonable price considering it's a paperback book by an acclaimed author.

3. Patron Marcine Jaco was highlighted for their support, and the hosts mentioned that while they don't have elaborate rewards on their Patreon page like some other shows, any patron with a request within reason can reach out through Patreon or the show's website for a response.

4. Listeners are encouraged to engage with the show by leaving comments on TheBaseInConspiracy.com or on the subreddit r/TheBaseInConspiracy. The hosts appreciate their audience and value feedback and support.

5. The podcast thanks its patrons for their support, signs off, and wishes everyone a great night.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #1 - What Use is Rationality？.txt
1. **Topic Introduction**: The podcast discusses the concept of reliability and its assessment when evaluating different sources of information, particularly in the context of trusting a friend's judgment versus a doctor's expertise.

2. **Reliability Assessment**: The hosts emphasize the importance of assessing a person's reliability based on past behavior rather than their perceived likeability. For instance, you might trust a doctor more than a friend who is studying medicine but not excelling in it.

3. **Horns Effect**: The horns effect refers to the tendency to believe negative hearsay about someone, especially when the information comes from multiple sources. The hosts suggest that this effect can be mitigated by considering the reliability of the sources and not solely the number of sources.

4. **Personal Experience vs. Probabilistic Thinking**: The hosts differentiate between personal feelings towards a person and the assessment of their reliability. They argue that while you might like your friend more, you should still consider their track record when evaluating what they say.

5. **Listener Engagement**: The hosts invite listeners to submit comments or questions about the episode through the website TheBaseonConspiracy.com or by sending an email to BayesianConspiracyPodcast@gmail.com. They encourage constructive feedback and suggest topics for improvement.

6. **Sign-Off**: The podcast concludes with a sign-off from hosts Inyash, Katrina, and Stephen, reassuring listeners that they will see them in two weeks on the next episode of the Bayesian Conspiracy Podcast.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #10 – Polyamory (part 2).txt
 The podcast discussion revolves around the concept of open relationships versus traditional monogamous partnerships. The hosts address the common structure of the "relationship escalator," which typically involves moving in together, getting married, and potentially having children in a set order. They contrast this with polyamory, where individuals engage in multiple consensual romantic relationships simultaneously, often with primary partners who are the default go-to people in their lives.

The hosts emphasize that polyamory can offer more freedom and flexibility, allowing for easier planning of one's life and the possibility of moving without necessarily taking a partner along. They also acknowledge that some individuals prefer the stability and security of a traditional monogamous relationship.

The podcast suggests that hierarchical polyamory is a common approach where individuals designate primary partners, but the hosts note that not everyone finds this model freeing or desirable. They invite listeners to bring well-reasoned arguments in favor of any relationship model to the table, as long as the discussion remains respectful and polite.

The hosts remind listeners to engage with the community in a civil manner and to use rational discourse when discussing sensitive topics like relationships. They encourage listeners to submit questions, write a Bayesian conspiracy for the podcast, and leave reviews on iTunes to help the show reach a wider audience. The conversation ends with a reminder that while relationship choices are personal, it's important to respect others' choices and discuss these topics rationally.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #11 – Voting.txt
 In this episode of the podcast, Brian and Tim discuss various aspects of voting systems, touching upon their pros and cons, and the challenges of making them more democratic and informative. They consider the potential for incentivizing voters to be better-informed and express their opinions honestly. While they agree that first-past-the-post systems have issues like tactical voting, they also point out that some other systems can have problems such as voter irrationality and the potential for run-off systems to become protracted.

They explore the concept of monotonicity in voting systems and express that the most important issue is voter irrationality. Tim shares his experience with political campaigns and debates, highlighting how the way politicians present themselves can be off-putting. Brian mentions using text-to-speech technology to depersonalize political speeches and make them more digestible.

The discussion also touches upon historical figures' perspectives on democracy, such as Plato's views equating democracy with anarchy and the famous quote by Winston Churchill (or possibly misattributed to Albert Einstein), which suggests that democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others.

While they aim to explore and potentially solve problems within the podcast, they acknowledge that solving all the problems of voting systems is a lofty goal and has not yet been achieved. The episode wraps up with a light-hearted moment, referencing popular culture and iconic figures, before signing off.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #12 - Listener Feedback (fixed).txt
 In this episode of the Bayesian Conspiracy Podcast, hosts Ian and Graham discuss the rational approach to decision-making and its application to various subjects, including conspiracy theories, scientific consensus, and the admiration of public figures like Brian Dunning from Skeptoid. They emphasize the importance of adapting one's beliefs based on evidence and better models or methods, as seen in science and Bayesian rationality.

The hosts also address listener questions, touching upon the role of virtue ethics and Stoicism within the rationalist community. They encourage listeners to engage with the podcast by submitting their questions and feedback through the subreddit, episode-specific posts on the website, or email. They suggest integrating these interactions into future episodes to manage the content more effectively.

Listeners are invited to provide their preferred names or usernames for personalized interaction and to offer reviews on iTunes to support the podcast's visibility. The hosts look forward to continued audience engagement and meaningful discussions in upcoming episodes.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #13 – Game Theory.txt
 In this episode of The Basian Conspiracy podcast, hosts Zach and Polly continue their discussion on polyamory, addressing questions from listeners. They explore the complexities of managing jealousy and the importance of open communication within polyamorous relationships. They also touch upon the idea that polyamory might not be suitable for everyone and emphasize the necessity of mutual consent and respect in any relationship dynamic.

Zach addresses criticism he received for comments made in a previous episode, particularly an offhand remark about involuntary celibacy (incel) culture. He clarifies his intention was not to generalize or disparage individuals who are involuntarily celibate but to highlight that even the most unlikeable people do not necessarily fare better in monogamous relationships than in polyamory. He apologizes for any offense caused by his wording and reiterates his sympathy for those who struggle with finding partners due to various reasons.

The podcast also acknowledges receiving only one review on iTunes, a negative one citing the podcast's title as "stupid" and the hosts' comments as dismissive and offensive. Zach and Polly invite listeners to provide their own reviews and ratings to help support the podcast.

In closing, they bid farewell to their audience, encouraging them to tune in for future episodes, and remind everyone that feedback, whether positive or negative, is valuable and welcome. They wrap up by emphasizing the importance of respect and understanding in discussions about relationship dynamics and personal preferences.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #14 – Street Epistemology.txt
1. **Topic Introduction**: The hosts continue their discussion on the morality of self-sacrifice and how it can lead to depression and diminished returns for society if people are sacrificing themselves without considering their own well-being. They mention the concept of scrupulosity, where individuals feel a pathological need to help others, often at the expense of their own lives.

2. **Giving What We Can**: The discussion turns to the Giving What We Can pledge, which encourages individuals to commit to donating a percentage of their income to charitable causes, as a balanced approach to helping others without overburdening oneself.

3. **Conspiracy Theories**: There's a mention of how Wikipedia had a page listing conspiracy theories that turned out to be true but later removed it, which inadvertently validated conspiracy theorists who believed the listed events were true because they were documented on Wikipedia.

4. **Infinities and Morality**: The hosts discuss the concept of infinite values in morality, specifically how something infinitely bad would still be just as bad whether done once or repeatedly. They agree that when dealing with moral value, it's more practical to use a very large but finite number rather than infinity.

5. **New Logo**: The podcast is excited to announce the launch of a new logo designed by Jess Dickey, which will be up on their website by the time this episode goes live. They express gratitude towards Jess for the new design.

6. **Closing**: The hosts thank their listeners for tuning in and promise to return with new content in a couple of weeks. They sign off and invite everyone to look forward to their next discussion.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #15 – Animals.txt
 In this episode of the Bayesian Conspiracy Podcast, the hosts discuss the dynamics of keeping secrets within polyamorous relationships compared to monogamous ones. The hosts consider a hypothetical scenario where one must keep information from a sibling due to the confidences shared with a partner. This leads to a broader conversation about the nature of secrets and confidentiality in relationships, noting that while it's not unique to polyamory, it does add complexity as the number of partners increases. The hosts reflect on the assumption in monogamous relationships that both partners will know anything shared between them, which is legally protected as privileged similar to attorney-client privilege. They emphasize the importance of trust and communication within all relationship structures. Listeners can engage with the podcast through email at thebayesianconspiracy@gmail.com or by joining the discussion on Reddit at r/BayesianConspiracy. The hosts also mention that more information, links, and content will be available on their website, which is accessible from their podcast page. They conclude the episode by inviting listeners to reach out through these platforms and to engage with the community on Reddit.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #16 – Animals Again.txt
 The podcast discussion revolves around the concept of belief and how people approach evidence and prophecy fulfillment. The hosts touch upon the skepticism towards religious prophecies versus the acceptance of scientific ones, using a quote that illustrates this contrast: "Priests say they can move mountains and no one believes them. Scientists say they can move mountains and no one doubts them." They highlight how some within the rationality community embrace being challenged and argue that rationalists make friends by engaging in debates. The hosts encourage listeners to share their thoughts and questions, whether through email or public forums like the subreddit, and promise to address more comments in future episodes. They conclude the episode by reminding everyone they will return in two weeks, inviting the audience to continue the conversation.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #17 – The Feels.txt
 In this episode of The Baysian Conspiracy podcast, the hosts discuss the ethical implications of destroying smallpox and the concept of inherent value. They explore whether it's worth preserving something just because it has unique qualities or if it's okay to destroy it for the greater good. The conversation touches on the value of pathogens as a product of human innovation and the idea that non-human entities, like beehives, should have their own determinations of value recognized and respected.

The hosts reference historical events, including an anecdote about President Andrew Jackson's response to an assassination attempt, which leads to a discussion about how leaders have interacted with the law and the enforcement of decisions made by powerful institutions like the Supreme Court.

Listeners are encouraged to send in their comments and questions for the hosts to address in future episodes. The podcast invites engagement through Reddit and its website, TheBaysianConspiracy.com. The episode concludes with a thank you to the audience for their participation and a reminder to tune in after a couple of weeks for more discussions on various topics.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #18 – Robin Hanson Interview.txt
 In this conversation, the speakers discuss the ethical considerations of having children, particularly in terms of the potential impact on future generations. They touch upon the idea that while one doesn't have an obligation to create new life, if one chooses to have children, one should strive to make the world a better place for them. The speakers also reference the philosophical work of Derek Parfit, specifically his "Representative Person Argument" from "Reasons and Persons," which explores the implications of our actions affecting future people. One speaker plans not to have children due to personal happiness considerations, while acknowledging the potential joy that parenting can bring to others. They emphasize the importance of considering the well-being of future generations when making reproductive decisions. The conversation wraps up with a suggestion for listeners to engage in these discussions on the subreddit or by sending an email to the hosts.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #19 – Political Pitfalls.txt
 In this episode of the Bayesian Conspiracy podcast, the hosts discuss the question of whether a being made of silicon is as valuable or "real" as a carbon-based life form. The debate centers around the idea of consciousness and whether it can be replicated in non-biological substrates like silicon. The hosts argue that the value or importance of a being, whether biological or artificial, should be based on its behavior and its similarity to beings we recognize as conscious. They suggest that if a silicon-based entity behaves indistinguishably from a human, it should be valued similarly.

The hosts also touch upon the issue of reproducibility, noting that it might be easier to replicate a being on silicon than one that is biological. However, they emphasize that this does not necessarily mean that one is more valuable or "real" than the other. The discussion leads to the conclusion that the burden of proof for claiming that what happens on silicon has no value lies with those who hold that belief, not with those advocating for the equality of consciousness regardless of substrate.

The podcast encourages listeners to engage with the content provided on their website, including blog posts and supporting materials, which are updated with each episode to offer additional context and resources. The hosts invite feedback and discussions from the audience through their subreddit and email. The conversation highlights the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence and consciousness, questioning what it means to be "real" and how we assign value to different forms of existence.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #2 - What is this “Sanity Waterline” you speak of？.txt
 In this episode, the hosts discuss the importance of rationality, especially as lifespans potentially extend to great lengths or even immortality. They emphasize that as people live longer, it's crucial to have a system in place that allows for belief updating rather than relying on natural mortality to phase out undesirable ideas. The hosts highlight the value of changing one's mind when presented with new information and the importance of not viewing being wrong as a failure but as an opportunity to improve one's understanding. They look forward to discussing strategies for engaging in difficult conversations without viewing personal beliefs as sacred cows in their next episode, where they will interview Elias Ryatowski. They also extend a shout-out to a former CIS admin on the DS9 BBS from the 90s named Pat Captain Picard, expressing gratitude for their assistance back then. The hosts sign off with a reminder to listeners to stay tuned for their upcoming interview with Elias in two weeks.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #20 – What’s important.txt
 The discussion revolves around a hypothetical scenario where an advanced alien civilization demands 10% of Earth's GDP annually or they will torture millions of people on Earth-like planets. The implications and ethics of this demand are debated. One perspective is that negotiation with such demands, akin to negotiating with terrorists, is not advisable due to the potential power imbalance and lack of moral responsibility. The concept of Pascal's Mugging is mentioned, where the validity of an extraordinary claim affects its seriousness.

The ethical obligation to care for beings, especially those created by others, is questioned. The owner of Colorado, for instance, would not have a moral duty to feed strangers at the expense of his own state's welfare. The discussion touches on game theory and the importance of verifiable outcomes in moral decisions. The episode concludes with a reminder to listeners to engage with the community on Reddit, email the podcast directly, and visit the website for more content. Additionally, a plug for the next episode of another podcast, "The Methods of Rationality," which will cover the first chapter of a rationalist Superman fanfic called "Metaplanetary."

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #21 – Kids, These Days.txt
1. The discussion revolved around the ethical considerations of artificial intelligence and what gives an entity moral worth, particularly if it can pass a Turing test.
2. A listener named Westward suggested that simply passing a Turing test isn't sufficient for moral consideration.
3. In response, it was argued that even if an AI or a sophisticated simulation is indistinguishable from a human in conversation (passing the Turing test), the precautionary principle should be applied: one should not take risks that could lead to harming such an entity, given that we cannot definitively determine its consciousness or lack thereof.
4. The Turing test, despite its flaws and the fact that some humans can fail it, serves as a starting point for discussing machine consciousness and rights.
5. The hosts emphasized the importance of erring on the side of caution when dealing with entities that could be conscious but are indistinguishable from non-conscious ones.
6. The episode concluded with a reminder to listeners to submit their feedback through the website, email, or the subreddit, and promised a new episode in a couple of weeks.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #22 – Moral Philosophy.txt
1. **The Conversation**: The hosts discuss ways to deal with violent feelings or ideation without acting on them, particularly from the perspective of someone who has had such thoughts but never acted upon them. They touch upon the difference between ideation and visualization, and whether these thoughts were ever directed at specific individuals or were more general and impulsive.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The urge for violence is not unique and can be common among teenagers, often influenced by external factors such as societal norms around masculinity.
   - Both hosts have experienced fleeting violent thoughts but emphasize that they were never an intention to harm anyone specifically.
   - The conversation acknowledges that while they themselves are peaceful individuals, such thoughts can be universal in some form among people.
   - They discuss the importance of impulse control and how different circumstances or encouragement might have influenced their actions.

3. **Outcomes**:
   - The hosts conclude without specific listener feedback, but they aim to provide useful insights into coping with such feelings by applying reductionist thinking.
   - They suggest tackling different philosophical problems in future episodes and end the episode by thanking listeners for their engagement and inviting them to return for more content.

4. **Missed Listener Feedback**: The hosts note that they often cannot predict how long the listener feedback segment will be, as it depends on the interactions they receive. They also joke about tackling a seemingly simpler philosophical question in the next episode, such as free will.

5. **Closing**: The episode wraps up with gratitude to listeners for their time and engagement, and a reminder to tune in for future discussions on various topics. They sign off and bid their audience goodbye.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #23 – Desirism with Alonzo Fyfe.txt
1. Desirism is a normative ethical theory developed by Arthur Schopenhauer and later expanded upon by David Frederick. It posits that actions are morally right if they promote the fulfillment of desires, and wrong if they hinder it.
2. Schopenhauer's influence on Nietzsche and existentialism is significant, as these philosophers also emphasized the importance of will, individuality, and the critique of conventional moral systems.
3. The good life, according to desirism, involves cultivating desires that lead to fulfillment for oneself and others, avoiding desires that cause suffering, and understanding that all events are determined by the necessary chain of causes and effects (Laplace's demon).
4. To learn more about desirism, one can start with David Gómez's blog or his new Wiki site, which provides a comprehensive overview of his thoughts on the subject.
5. Arthur Schopenhauer was influenced by Eastern philosophies, particularly Buddhism, which is evident in his ideas about the illusion of the self and the importance of detaching from desires to achieve true happiness and peace.
6. David Frederick's work on desirism has brought this obscure ethical theory into contemporary discourse, making it accessible for modern audiences to consider its implications for living a good life.
7. Regarding the use of intoxicants like alcohol, Arthur Schopenhauer was skeptical due to their tendency to impair judgment and potentially lead to harmful behaviors. However, there is research suggesting that moderate drinking can have health benefits due to the social connections it fosters, which are crucial for mental well-being.
8. David Frederick himself does not consume alcohol because he dislikes its taste, but his stance is based on the principle that impairing judgment is generally detrimental.
9. The conversation between Arthur Schopenhauer's ideas and their application to contemporary ethical issues remains relevant, as seen in the discussion about desirism and the good life.
10. For those interested in exploring more of David Frederick's thoughts on desirism or Arthur Schopenhauer's philosophy, his blog and Wiki site serve as excellent resources, and he is open to sending additional information for further understanding.

Checking Eneasz Brodski/The Bayesian Conspiracy #24 – Signaling.txt
1. The discussion on farm subsidies acknowledged that while government support can prevent farmers from going broke due to factors like poor weather, there are issues with the current system. One major issue is that unsold products compensated for by the government are often destroyed, which is seen as a waste and could be used more productively. This destruction can also lead to price fluctuations and harm local farming communities in countries receiving food aid from the U.S.

2. Regarding the analogy between AlphaGo (a DeepMind AI that beat a world champion at Go) and bacterium moral weight, it was clarified that both systems are complex and their outcomes cannot be predicted analytically but must be observed in practice. However, the complexity of a system or technology is not a valid metric for determining its moral value.
