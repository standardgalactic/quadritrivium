of what we talked about in the conspiracy episodes or conspiracy theories episode where you no one
has the time to really become an expert on everything and you end up having to trust some people
right so you're an expert on some then then it comes down to like who who which experts do you
trust right i think if you're best off trusting the consensus if there is a solid consensus that
sounds like because then at least there is a large body of experts who have all looked at things and
come to the same conclusion yeah that's that's sort of us trying to go with this but then i was
i was having a conversation i was having a conversation with somebody uh actually before
i came here who is a very intelligent person and a beluga literalist like talking snake and
flood and all that stuff um well if you think that we live in a fun video game so like to him
he might hear that and he would say yeah i did go to the experts and talk to all the elders of my
churches right so it's i don't i can't think of right off a general way to combat all of that
and that might be beyond the scope of that question i do want to get some more listener
especially if he goes to his elders a lot and they usually have good answers or at least
satisfactory answers to him right right well i mean just answers in general about life things you
know sure oh yeah they have answers in other domains where they aren't obvious or like where they
aren't uh saying we the bible are closely right so yeah that's that's a good point that is a tough
thing and kind of far afield from halo and horn's effect how do you combat them i guess do your own
homework for the best that you can and look into the reputation of that domain of expertise of the
person who's giving that argument if you can't and for and for where halo and horn's hits you most
which is in people that you know and various personalities um just try to take each argument
on its own merit i do do a kind of thing where or i do kind of do a thing that if i find myself
agreeing to something strongly when i'm reading i try to if i notice myself doing that i'll try
and go back and read it and tear it apart because i think like the fact that i'm really enjoying this
and you know liking the delivery and agreeing with it i want to try and counter for that and
make sure that it can stand up to like i might not have been as scrupulous reading it as i otherwise
would have been so i i do deliberately try and go back and do that that might be one way too to
try to keep that in mind so do we have other listener feedback i i also like just having
a wide variety of friends because when there are people that are invested in one opinion they tend
to have better arguments for it this person uh said that they think we spent a lot of time talking
about the moral value of simulated beings and they are not sure that simulated beings had
necessarily have any weight at all uh they put forth the example of if i were to give you a black
cube and say that in this cube is simulated the entire earth aside from the cube itself obviously
for recursion reasons would you give it the moral weight of the entire world they said specifically
that um if a simulated being only interacts with a simulated environment they have no moral
weight at all and that you know what if he can prove that the black box actually has
a thousand people or the entire world within it does that change our answer at all
and they went on to say that if the black box was hooked up to a camera and a robot arm
they would maybe assign a tiny bit of moral weight to it because now it can interact with
the world a bit with the outside world but still not very much yeah i don't think their opinion
holds much water no no why is that let's say that you copy paste the entire world and all
of its inhabitants right does does one version have more moral weight than the other that's just
kind of i don't know it's a silly question um and as for simulate simulated if i guess the question
is is it perfectly simulated let's assume yes assume yes don't any yeah right because otherwise
you're talking about dualism you're talking about like oh do we all have some magical magical soul
stuff that's floating around um right above our heads you know recording everything i don't know
what it would be doing but or are we like the idea of philosophical zombies so we created a
world of philosophical zombies no because there's no such thing as that yeah no i i i see i agree
on one hand and part of this is because first of all i expect that there is a good likelihood
if i survive that long that i will someday be a simulated being and so i would like for there to
be a some moral consideration given to me and i'm also not entirely sure that we're not in a
simulation right now which is just my own personal little weird hang up and i apologize for that at
a time you don't have to apologize okay but i would i would prefer that the substrate i am
being simulated on if that is what is happening we're not to be turned off right also we are
just just the way that we understand the world it's not like we're we're special little amazing
right we're all we're all groups of molecules and atoms and energy and in different patterns
it's not like we're something like freaking special compared to something that is an exact copy of us
like that's just but to bring it back to uh what i was saying in the previous episode the you know
the only rights that anything has is the rights that it can convince other people to grant it
whether it's by being charming or by force and the the box does not have ability to affect anything
in our world and so we it wouldn't really have any rights aside from those that or any moral
weight aside from what we could convince other people to to grant it you know right again it
doesn't have to do any convincing right right um i think the because he used the term intrinsic moral
weight and i think that is a problem with yeah there is no such thing yeah and so should we
value those things yeah do you have an obligation
to trillions of of life forms um on in including including the all important human life forms
even if they're not in the same form as you yeah probably yeah obviously you do like i do
normal people would what's that i want to weigh on this weigh in on this too um so this was the
question from dark lord asriel uh i think was a batman character other than the dark lord part
i bet asriel is a lot of a lot of things i i know i'm pretty sure the uh the smurfs uh
in the smurfs the name of the cat that always was hunting them that's probably where batman
got it from okay um i i found your question on reddit and uh assuming that we could verify
that the black box contained a perfect simulation of earth other than the black box itself um
if we could verify it it's hard to see i'm i guess i'm kind of just seconding what
inyash and katrina said that it's hard to see why it would matter like the substrate that you're
running on would make a difference as to how much you matter like but there is something to be said
about the externalities that your behaviors have so like uh if killing you would destroy the environment
then that's a bigger concern than if it wouldn't right like we talked about that with the animal
stuff um but that doesn't mean that like you literally have no matter if the if the environment
isn't affected by you yeah somebody handed me a box and said there is an entire copy of earth in
here and also it's going to destroy the earth that you live in i'd be like smash right you know
it because uh you know half a dozen of one and six of the other right so i read a interesting
short story which i think was actually uh posted on the less wrong forums back when it was when it
was a thing uh that an alien race had contacted humanity and they had several million of these
little black pebbles and in each one of them was a simulation of earth and they were torturing
everyone on that earth unless we were and they would stop doing that if we were to give them 10
percent of our gdp i'm paraphrasing i don't remember if this is exactly what it was if we were to
give them 10 percent of our gdp every year the entire earth's collective gdp uh then they wouldn't
torture these millions of earths of people and the uh there's a lieutenant reporting to his
general he's freaking out he's like what the hell do we do do we declare war on them right now
this is going to be a hell of a fight these are really advanced aliens but we can't just let them
do this and the general's like whatever he takes the pebble crushes and says we've gone going back
to bed fuck off because i don't know we don't negotiate with terrorists i mean not just because
we don't negotiate with terrorists it was it was implied that those simulations had no moral weight
at all hmm or that if they did it was it was the aliens that would be that would be considered the
you know moral bad actors of this and we didn't have a responsibility to go fly out and try to
rescue every single earth that is being that is being threatened i think the ladder's there okay
because what are they gonna do right like there's there's there's no power no no control there and
also maybe they'll get bored of spending all their time torturing earths right they know that
they're not gonna get anything out of it but versus if you if you give a mouse a cookie i've been
using a lot of phrases like that if you if you give an alien 10% of your earth's GDP then they're
going to win a glass of milk so for game theoretic reasons we shouldn't like like steven said we
shouldn't negotiate with terrorists yeah yeah i think that he was being sarcastic but he was being
somewhat serious too i think it was also just it was i'll take both okay so there's also you know
like the the Pascal's mugging kind of reverse scenario right where so like when the when the
initial question it's like if i told you this box had a million earths in it and it's our trillion
beings in it like okay so it's a shoe box you're insane but if i could verify it then this becomes
like an important question right so the verifiability is kind of what makes that a serious conundrum
if they just handed me this pebble saying this is this contains a trillion beings you better give me
a billion dollars a year or i'm gonna kill them all or something like that's i don't know that's
that's a that's a weird set of affairs but i don't know if we did all that much justice to
the question but i will say i think you don't necessarily have a moral obligation to a being
unless you had something to do with them coming into existence so future civilizations shouldn't
care about your emulated mind i don't know i don't know i i i think yeah but not 10% of their
gdp care just to keep me running i hope that i could provide something of value that they would
want to keep me around for or if not i could threaten them with something that would allow me
to stay alive but i don't know in the end why should they care or just that question right
so like my time is done yeah and then that brings you back to so what is the obligation of the guy
who owns colorado to feed these people instead of guarding the colorado borders with his army of
drones right uh everyone's gonna think that he's a jerk and he won't have any friends he can make
his drone friends thank you so much for listening um you can comment on our subreddit for the
