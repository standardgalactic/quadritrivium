on earth for a while when climate change gets out of control versus well that that is the the way of
putting it versus literally everyone who could ever possibly exist in the future will never make it
because ai went bad right or i went wrong so there is like a utility weighing there that even though
like it might be farther out and you could even say less likely makes it way more important anyway
right like there's if there's people working on creating a god we should be at least a little
bit concerned that this god is not a bad sort of god so there's a there's a future future items
discount right um it's one of the things that's going on there the other thing is that it may be
that there's a general consensus in most people's minds that it's incredibly unlikely i am actually
very happy that this has been getting more and more traction recently there's been a lot more
people coming out for this there's several foundations that are now looking into the problem
that have been created over the past few years and i think this is one of the uh areas where
people like elia zaryatkowski should get some credit because he was on the forefront
and even though no one wants to very few people uh are willing to say yes i was influenced by him
he was a a large driving factor in the early years to actually get this sort of research started
speaking of willing to draw attention to the problem speaking of will mcaskill again and
know that he mentioned utkowski as far as one of the earliest people to start talking about
ai safety and all that sort of thing so yeah somebody's not afraid to associate with him and
will is a pretty cool guy um sam harris just came out with a ted talk last week on ai risk and it's
like 14 and a half minutes worth checking out if you've never considered this problem it's a great
quick introduction uh then read superintelligence um which is a little more of an investment but i
i think that's by nick bolstrom that's right yeah i think we could easily be 10 years behind where
we are right now if it wasn't for elia is there speaking of less than 10 years advanced on this
than we are now and 10 years can make a huge amount of difference in something like this i
think if god king ilang were to run for president he'd become president almost immediately oh he was
born in the u.s and when i insert now that i don't think that any of these people are gods or kings
oh that was meant to obvious jest uh to anyone who wants to quote mine you're doing so disingenuously
i am disappointed we can fix this problem by making them god kings can we did that well not us
personally oh then forget it i'm not willing to collaborate with people that sounds exhausting
yeah that's another maybe if there was some sort of singleton around they could do that for us
that's another question um is it worth it to to raise up these these subjects into the political
sphere or is that actually um something that might make them more divisive and difficult to
take action on i see that's a good question because there's only so much political capital you have
and i think that is one of the reasons people don't in general uh very often talk about animal
welfare because you only have so much political capital to spend on issues and most people don't
see that as an issue that it is worth spending their resources on they'd rather talk about global
warming or uh or the minimum wage or something something that they personally feel is more
important so there's a personal risk to people for bringing it up but is there a risk that otherwise
topics that people wouldn't disagree about might become politicized in some way that's exactly
what i was thinking when you mentioned the question was what if you know the reds you know
we're like you know what this a i thing is a thing then the blues would have to say no it's not
and uh would they have to uh there are some of them might feel like they have to there are bipartisan
issues there are i wonder how i guess i don't know enough about political history i'm sure
something has come up lately that both sides agreed yes this is actually important but it's easier
to think of examples where they don't think that right uh it is because those get a little bit more
traction don't they that's true everything something that everyone agrees on people can get behind
but maybe i think in general nuclear proliferation is uh both sides are against it hopefully true
i would uh so yeah there's an example of being able to come together on a serious risk maybe
but i wonder if it's like an edge thing you know like ai is not super mainstream yet maybe in a few
years yeah it really does if one side were to jump out and say something then the other side might
feel inclined to put them down for it look they're thinking they're agreeing with all these
yeah or start awarding golden fleece awards what's that for getting fleeced oh i don't even
remember what what politician did this way way back in the day but they were looking at different
expenditures for research government expenditures for for all sorts of different research programs
and some of them sound ridiculous but are super important like collecting grizzly bear scats for
dna right to figure out how many different bears there are in a certain area or all sorts of different
information about them and so you'd be like and he would read them off read off these descriptions
think about the ignoble awards right so um he'd be like our taxpayer money's going to this project
that sounds silly but it's actually super important and it wins the golden fleece award
because the taxpayers you just got fleeced that's one way that it can happen that a lot of these
things cost a lot of money right potentially cost a lot of of taxpayer money and if you are concerned
about the government spending and you're concerned about about people losing their income to projects
that they haven't approved to approved of personally then then that's one direction to go on that
that is interesting i do have a candidate related question to somebody who's no longer on the ticket
i know that bernie sanders talked about universal income did he do so anticipating
projected loss of jobs or was that just something he liked does anyone know i didn't follow that
closely because that would be an interesting example of a candidate that did actually care
about an issue that likely will be a problem in 20 years right so can i bring up one last one that i
just read about i think yesterday please do sorry no uh the possible coming of the the possible
ending of the age of the gun which it was why are you saying that this is something that's not
extremely talked about what how is this different than the whole gun control no no this this is not
in gun control at all this is uh the issue that so back in the bad old days of which there are many
but uh pre pre firearms the uh political power was wielded by people who basically spent their
entire lives training to be the killer elite and spending vast amounts of capital on things like
full body suits of metal armor and war horses things that are really expensive that the average
person could not afford i remember things differently in yosh but i'll say i'll get into that in a bit
because i've been around that long yeah right god i am younger than i thought but uh so a lot of
political power was projected right by this by a small elite group of people who spent the warrior
class and uh once militias were easily could easily go up against these people with only a few weeks
of training and no more than a metal tube and some gunpowder it quickly brought down that whole
regime and now people had well governments were much more concerned about their people rebelling
and were also i've heard it argued helped bring about the whole middle class as a thing that exists
in history because uh aside from the merchant class but uh people now had some political power
they could organize a large enough group of them and attack the government itself
rather than being beaten down by the warrior classes and with the growing power i guess of
drones the growing what is independence what is it when you are not dependent on a human
to control the automation okay the drone warfare nowadays you could get back to a situation where
a single person with vast resources can lay claim to a large territory and doesn't have to care about
having other people there to help him defend it that's interesting that's a really interesting
substitution where'd you read this oh i don't remember it was just yesterday yeah it was just
yesterday i don't remember exactly where it was that i read it all right he'll find it and we'll
put it up i will find it but there you know as as we were as i was saying earlier about the basic
basic guaranteed income as a way to combat the fact that most people will not be able to be
employed in any sort of meaningful way the thing that people have is there's lots of us and we
can band together and we can take these resources and redistribute them into what we consider equitable
whether or not it is equitable there is the fact that there's the threat of violence uh of the masses
and which is one of the reasons people think that capitalism was ranked in a bit in the 50s
because the guest world governments were seriously worried about communist revolutions
even in america and so we're throwing a lot of concessions out to workers once that is no longer
an issue you can just say i am one of the elite one percent that can still make a living i own
all of colorado and i have the factories i need to make drones to defend all of colorado what are
these other people going to do they they could just starve to death outside the borders because
they can't fight against factories full of drones that are just being pumped out that's an interesting
course before one man could not defend colorado by himself he would need a bunch of other people
on his side to help him defend it that's not interesting i want to read the the long version
of that okay lots of futurism going on here folks yes so what was your uh alternate remembering of
the past oh oh um it was just a bunch of stuff about knights okay super interesting not going to
get into it not important listener feedback listener feedback yay steven do you have russell's
comments i do on our very first listener feedback episode we read a section of an email from russell
and and apparently it was the wrong section and actually having reread the email i still had it in
our in our folder and it was kind of obvious actually what part was the feedback and what part
wasn't so now i feel bad sorry russell but i told you we get we'd fix it and here we are quote
the halo and horns effects describe the tendency of overall impressions of something to influence
one's opinion of specific properties of that thing which we kind of talked about one or two
episodes ago the halo and horns effect might talk about the halo and horns effect yeah back
to the question back to the feedback it's also true that reputable people are hard to come by and
that reputation is a good heuristic for believing true things in situations where we lack direct
evidence how do we reconcile this how how do we reconcile this should we consider bill gates
as concerns about ai safety important because he's proven himself successful to be wait excuse me
because he has proven himself to be a successful it business person with the same line of thinking
indicate that we should trust the coach brothers about climate change cook cook whoops there i am
not knowing what i'm talking about they're financial people or something right yeah uh they're
they're major funders of uh libertarian think tank great well that shows how much i i shows how
little i know about stuff they also make a lot of money off of uh things that emit carbon
gotcha well so do we all welcome especially me and my and my backdoor business and coal mining
so got the black lungs the big lung pop um so the the claim is that we have a great heuristic
for determining if information is true or not right or reliable or not and that is the
reliability of the person who is giving us the information right next that's a reasonable
heuristic a lot of the time yeah it is reasonable heuristic a lot of the time that's why we have it
and also because it is a huge pain in the butt to go do all of the original research yourself
right and um become a specialist in all these different fields literally impossible it well
it is now in because we're not in permutation city right or ends where you can where you can
learn whatever you want because you get all the time in the world and all the resources
so i think he's i kind of feel like he's uh conflating reputation with the horns and halo
effect though because that bias is specifically about if one thing is good about someone you
tend to think everything else is also good and you give that more weight whereas reputation is
more along the lines of i know this person is good at this thing so i should trust him at this
thing i don't know if he was conflating them or if he's using it as a specific example just to
yeah sorry so bill gates in the situation um if bill gates is concerned about ai we know that
we know that he's actually involved at high level tech right and would actually know about
things like that and so we should value his opinion but with the coke brothers they are
not only not climate scientists they also we can say that the coke brothers are incentivized to
not be supporters of climate change referent reformations this is correct yes i want to um
contest the bill gates is a good authority on ai okay i don't know that he is i mean he might be
because he worked on uh operating systems back in the 70s 80s and then was very successful in
business does not necessarily mean he has kept up to date on research and really knows much of
anything about ai well i don't know that he's even said anything about ai yes oh okay well good for him
well so i think this is something that the question eludes to is uh you know i might not
take my neighbor's position on astrophysics seriously but i'll take nilda greys tyson's
word for it and that's because he happens to be an expert at it yeah um so that's a reasonable
yeah so the domain the domain of expertise is kind of a good narrowing down of when to
know whether to check your your heuristic for but do you believe what nilda greys tyson says
about say evolution or uh well no he's actually terrible on that stuff so that's why i brought it
up i was actually talking to somebody about this he's actually like he's flippantly uh neglectful
of considering ai risk as well it does come down to what they know about and so you have to do a bit
of research into it's like if i had no idea who bill gates was and someone said bill gates says ai is
uh not a problem and lindsay lohan says it is who do i whose word do i take for it well not knowing
who either of those people are i'd have to do a little homework to see whose word i should take
or i could do the homework myself but but then you would decide bill gates probably right maybe
lindsay lohan has a secret ai enthusiast i don't know um i pulled a name out of my head i should
remember the one of that i think this brings up eliezer's argument that uh argument screams off
authority because we would both think that bill gates is more of an authority than lindsay lohan
on these things since he works in tech worked in a technical field and he's older and he is
possibly smarter i i don't actually know how smart either of them are but my prejudice says
say the nerd with the glasses is smarter than the hot check right the bill going i know going
entirely off of stereotypes wow i so i don't believe you i don't think that you're going
entirely off of stereotypes i think that you have additional information about both of those people
okay like building a tech empire that actually is something that you reasonably have to be
very intelligent to do and to not bankrupt your company after windows 8
he wasn't he wasn't the ceo at that time oh that's how he touched that right
some patchy right yeah he retired a while before so um but i i don't i mean i assume lindsay lohan
is slightly more intelligent than average but not as intelligent as bill gates but i don't have
anything to base her intelligence on aside from the fact that someone successful generally
tends to have something going for them so that they aren't fleeced by uh all the people around
them trying to take their money sure so you have other reasons i just i don't want you to say that
it's a hot chick versus a nerd with glasses i do not accept that from you okay okay all right
weeks have better weeks we expect expect better from me yeah fine um i see what i see we're going
with painting the broad picture and using like general stereotypes though um well but but oh
sorry as i was saying yeah because i i got off like totally got off on the subject by using
those terrible arguments and i'm sorry but what i was saying is that uh but if you are presented
with arguments from both people without knowing who they are you can judge based on the arguments
because maybe lindsay lohan has spent a lot of her free time researching this sort of thing
and talking with uh ai researchers she maybe she has access to those you know people who knows
and bill gates is probably spending all his time working out the malaria foundation and about
getting better schools since that's a lot what a visit gates foundation does now and hasn't had
the time to look into uh ai research just because he's busy doing other good things you know not
because he's a tool or anything and so lindsay lohan may have better arguments and the fact that
the arguments are better thought out and presented screens off that authority effect yes okay that's
true but that also does give a benefit to like a better argument for the better presenter right
yes it does so like uh good call it there is something to be said about looking into somebody's
past credentials and all else being equal if my crazy neighbor and i don't really have a crazy
neighbor so i mean this is a completely fake person um my crazy neighbor and uh you'll do
ask tyson tell me something even if it's tangentially science related even knowing
tyson has some failures of of perfect information there i'd probably take tyson's work for it
tentatively until i have a chance to look into it right um so like well but but should you because
we already have some examples of him being less than rigorous that's true of his opinions so but
also very confident in his presentation exactly right but yeah that's kind of both so so it um as
again we talked about in the previous episode it hinges on you being able to deeply understand
both of the arguments and understand the evidence that's presented and be able to compare it right
but in the event that you can't i mean in the event that you can't it doesn't matter what they're
saying because you're gonna you're gonna do you're gonna go with the authority figure this is kind
