They grandparents all got polio but I didn't. As far as the conversation level it's getting
I haven't I don't I should make it clear at the outset that as far as the current candidates I
don't follow that closely at all so I'm not sure what their what the current candidates are currently
saying. I watched the debate they didn't actually get into that many topics. No although the debate was
kind of fun to watch I will say. I watched a few minutes of it. I really wish that we could have
Donald Trump every year just like as a jester and without any actual you know chance that he'd get
elected. So the goal for this podcast or this episode was to not talk about the camera. Sorry
yes no my bad we should cut that. Well we'll just we just won't go any further on that. Okay I will
say as long as we're on the topic. We're not on the topic. The saturday night live version of the
debate was less funny than the real one. That's true. All right that's all I'm gonna say. That is
true. There's just a whole lot of medical medical ones apparently anything involving medicine
anti-aging research. That was the big one I was going to bring up. Yeah neurodegenerative disease
research all of that stuff that would you know potentially greatly improve human life. There
is at least some research being done in the neurodegenerative diseases but there is no one okay
there are very few people willing to say we have to find a cure for aging and get on the
shit now and I think we're we're getting close to the point where we could actually launch some
sort of aging manhattan project and and get at least a good toehold on this problem start start
things and there's still no one talking about it because I don't know I talk I talk to sometimes
people especially uh when you talk to religious people or when I've talked to religious people
there's always this feeling that it is against God's will and that humans shouldn't be immortal and
even a lot of people who aren't religious are like well who wants to live more than their 80 years
you know that's just obscene. Do you think that people are comfortable with diseases like Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's which primarily affect the very old? No I mean there is research on those being
done which I am grateful for. There is but I know somebody gosh I don't remember if she was with the
Parkinson's or Alzheimer's Foundation but she was talking about how research for for new cures
is they don't even fund that. Really? Yes um what they turn their money towards is things like
dealing with Alzheimer's um having good life with Alzheimer's just stuff that already exists because
it they get more bang for their buck that way. That's interesting. In terms of actually improving
people's lives. Every year or two I do hear something about like we've made another step forward
on possibly treating Alzheimer's. I think people do care a lot about those diseases especially
Alzheimer's. I think I've never met anybody who's relaxed about the topic. It's impacted almost
everyone. Right well I'm just the idea of losing yourself while still being able to walk around and
do stuff. It's terrifying for everybody. Alzheimer's really terrifies me because it's the thing that can
kill my brain before I can get frozen. Exactly. Speaking of like funding cures though there was
an interesting um I think it was Will McCaskill the author of Doing Good Better and the founder of
the Center for Effective Altruism. I don't think this was his his proposal but I heard the idea from
him of not necessarily funding research directly but giving a huge cash prize to the group who
comes across like a cure. Whether it's a cure for a disease or a new antibiotic or whatever
that way you're not blowing a million fortunes on everybody who wants to try their hand at
researching it but the group that does get there gets a big payout. They do have a Methuselah
prize right now I believe. Is that a Methuselah the old age old dude in the bible? Yes the oldest
living supposedly the oldest living dude something like 900 whatever years. Oh because he's still alive
No no no no the oldest lived I guess not living uh sorry. He was born in the future according to
the bible and still alive. He uh but the prize was for someone that can uh what is it create a mouse
or keep a mouse alive for 10 times longer than the normal mouse lifespan I think. Oh that's a
safe time to like plan out your bet then right so like yeah I'll pay you in 50 years when you've
proved that you can do that. Um was that was the Methuselah prize given up by the government or by
the Methuselah foundation like Aubrey de Grey's group. It was a private foundation. Okay yeah
probably the Methuselah project then. Okay. Aubrey de Grey is the guy doing all that research.
Yeah awesome guy I think he's close to 50 now and he looks like he's 80 it's kind of interesting
he's anti-aging he doesn't look unhealthy he just looks super old he's got this old Gandalf beard
it's I think he hasn't shaved in 40 years yeah since he since he could not have to start shaving
right right no razor has ever touched that face I uh but other than his beard he's a pretty awesome
guy check out Aubrey de Grey I'm sure he's got a TED talk and YouTube videos in fact we'll find one
so check it out on the website. His uh his charity the one that does research on and high aging
is the second one that I give to behind Mary in total uh you know dollars per year right on
which I mean still isn't very much I don't give as much as I probably should I find it kind of
disgraceful that it's still a private thing and not something that we as a society are working on
because people will throw money at all sorts of you know rare diseases for cute puppies but
everyone it's it's a stalling tactic everyone is eventually going to die of aging if we don't
figure out this aging thing. I heard something really interesting the other day on the radio
that uh pharmaceutical companies are not interested in developing vaccines
okay anymore because they're one-time use and since there's such a great deal of time and money
and resources that go into creating a vaccine or creating any kind of product that the only
way that they can really recoup that is with something that people use regularly like heart
medication for example. We're treating chronic conditions yeah which is another freaking reason
we need to make research less costly pull back the FDA a little bit yep well that sure is political
well so it is but at least it's not red or blue political is it it is it is yes okay I think it
is not intentionally because usually um I usually are I guess our red side is the anti FDA side
and our blue side is the pro FDA side I'm not anti FDA I'm for um not having the yes
not having them quite as as rapid and expensive as they are and it not just FDA it's also a
legislation problem when the current holders of medicine can sue anyone that makes anything even
remotely similar to their thing and that part is weird yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna have to
parts also highly discussed that's true it is I know it's weird to have an episode it's weird to
pull especially Enya's back from talking about things that people like to talk about to talk about
things that people don't like to talk about so I will I will pull back I'm sorry well the things
that people don't like to talk about are tend to be things that we like to talk about tend to yeah
that's why that's why I thought that we could exactly get some mileage out of so I don't know
if it's being so much pulled back as it is just being redirected exactly um I just spin you around
bulldog you're a bulldog right now in this analogy oh okay I will start chasing my tail then
as far as like the charge that you know like big pharma likes to treat chronic conditions and not
cure them I mean there's not it's it's not a like to it's that the that there is a serious
incentive oh yeah sure and disincentive but there's also like you know if you could develop an AIDS
vaccine like that would be awesome I think that I mean I'm not sure if uh not just awesome like
because it would be great but it would be uh or great for people I think it would be a big money
maker too even if it was a one-off shot I guess it's it's a red flag for me that goes off like a
like an alarm in my head at the charge of really anything big pharma this uh well I see so I think
I understand I mean that was the first thought in my head when I heard this person you know on the
radio who's saying that they just do not have the incentive right like it's really hard for a
business to work on something where they're not going to be able to recoup their costs absolutely
no and that's and that's that's a completely uh fair and accurate thing to say uh I guess I was
that was just my knee-jerk reaction was just mentioned something that uh along those lines but
no it's certainly true I mean imagine if um if iPhones lasted for 15 years right it'd be really
hard to uh like unless you sold them for $5,000 to make any money off of them so the idea that you
know you're the new one comes out two years later helps keep those companies in business right yeah
well luckily technology and um technology and innovation constantly improve iPhones are the
first thing in my mind because there's one sitting in front of me there are better examples
there's that saying the used cars mill the used car salesman saying I was a tongue twister
I don't want to sell you one car for 15 years I want to say three cars over 15 years
in that it's more lucrative for me to have you keep coming back and buying more cars and it's
for me to sell you one great car you know what could fix all this soft driving wait that wouldn't
fix it necessarily no no what post scarcity economy yeah which is a thing I bring up because
that is also a thing that uh the canons don't talk about very often because resources are scarce
and and human needs are infinite that's funny yeah Russell brought that one up but right but uh
we are getting to the point where less and less people are going to be employable in in the near
future because more things are being taken over by automation and this is a thing that I see people
complaining about sometimes but the politicians do not address it at all they're like we're gonna
bring the jobs back to America it's like no you're not the jobs are going to the robots the jobs are
gone this is actually a great segment another one on the list yeah well I mean literally yeah that
is literally a piece on the list someone was really excited about the idea of basic income yes as a
potential solution for that issue I was remembering an article which I'm going to be sure to link
about how steel jobs are not coming back to the US they haven't really gone anywhere it's just that
the industries become so much more efficient so kind of interesting yeah it's up there that is going
to be a huge change for society because we at least in America I don't know how it is in other
countries but we very much have an ethos that in order to deserve being alive you should be working
and if you aren't working there's there's no reason for you to to collect well that's our that's the
only way we have to to move around resources yeah well it's not the only way but it's the main way
that we have but I think the ethos that you know it's just alluding to is that it's not just that
because it's what we have it's it's a a character thing you know if there's something about the
work a day person who goes and labors and that that's that's a more meaningful existence yeah
that's uh that is going the way of the but it's fine but it's fine to be a child who doesn't work
and it's fine to be uh maybe I guess less fine now I don't know but it's fine to be a
wife who doesn't work right well there's a lot of work in the house I guess a spouse
who doesn't work maybe maybe some and it's fine to be an independently wealthy person who doesn't
work right it's I I don't know how much of that's tied up in in this value judgment and how much of
it is actually related to people literally have to work in order to get money but there's there's
that's how we show value there's gonna be a sharp break at some point because if this isn't going to
happen overnight it's going to be slowly more and more people just cannot participate in the economy
because they don't have these skills and the intelligence to do it anymore and I mean everyone
is going to get there eventually right I'm not looking forward to the day when I can no longer
contribute anything of value and at some point a large massive people are going to say we don't
want to die of starvation there's nothing we can do give us some resources and other people aren't
going to want to give them the resources I don't think and I hope it doesn't come down to violence
but what else are you going to do you're gonna either have to convince everyone that we need a
basic income or there's going to be bloodshed right yeah and I think that's I mean so there
is something like to be said about like the work for what you have kind of mentality that is out
there whether or not like it doesn't really apply to children because they don't have you know the
skills to have jobs but people look down on people who don't work for a living not necessarily in
some of the education that you mentioned but like if you get handouts right uh you know even if it's
like legit people are like oh I I guess maybe not everybody but I this is a mentality that I think
some people have I guess it depends on who you're getting those handouts from if it's a family member
or if it's um through a through a taxpayer program right sure I think even I guess I mean that's
a bit of a no entity versus an unknown entity right but uh you know some of the first jobs to go
are going to be um I guess maybe maybe the first thing that people are going to really freak out
about well I mean one of those already happened like nobody makes cars anymore come yeah machines
make cars that used to be you know a huge employing thing but we were talking about uh automated
driving right yes exactly and it's like three million jobs right now something like that I know
that it's uh we were we were seeing um Matt actually looked this up kindly during our meeting and
said that more than I think it's Matt more than 3.5 percent of our working population works in the
trucking industry which doesn't necessarily mean that they're drivers but I think a lot of people
are drivers right and then that doesn't necessarily include taxi drivers and people doing other kinds
of driving work I know that just taxis I think is something like 230 or 270,000 jobs in the
United States and I don't think that includes Uber and Lyft yeah and so you know it'll be in 10 I don't
know we can guess years but at some point they're not too just in future in our lifetime is likely
you can either say well I can either wait for a human to show up and then have to listen to their
radio and tip them and stuff or I can order an Uber with my car it'll be here shortly and I don't
have to tip them and it'll go you know I want to worry about human error while being behind in the
vaccine so nobody's going to be there will be no human drivers for Uber at some point.
I asked my Uber driver last time I took one how he felt about self-driving cars and the
automation of Uber and he made a frowny face and kind of an angry noise and then wouldn't talk about
it yeah I mean how do you feel like that you won't let go out of work one exist in you know
in some years right that's a that's a rough question but it's a it's a reality question right
I'm trying to think of another industry that's not driving that I guess uh we were talking briefly
too about fast food uh a lot of these are being are not a lot yet but there are some test locations
that are fully automated I think they're just drive-throughs maybe you can go in and order on a
kiosk or something but you know even if it's just a drive-through location that's going to bring
plenty of people your stuff will be perfect every time if you order it properly and it won't it won't
cost uh whatever they program it properly properly and bring in both the correct stuff
whatever eight dollars an hour times five is per hour to make your food right five employees
right eight bucks an hour roughly unless it's peak hour and there's more it's two in the morning
there's less but that's the minimum wage currently in Colorado is it actually eight bucks I was
throwing out that number as slightly above minimum wage oh I think yes I think it's around eight
dollars go Colorado you're 47 cents above the last time I looked oh still well below what you need
to live but give them what rental rates are like here yeah so I was I was kind of thinking about
the idea that people aren't really interested in talking about machines and efficiency and innovation
as what is taking people's jobs because those are seen as positive things and I was wondering
you know why for a lot of these different subjects they're not discussed um Tangela suggested
that there isn't a good guy bad guy situation the the the thing that would fit the bill for bad guy
is not something that people are willing to put in the bad guy slot like innovation oh okay right
yeah um innovation increased efficiency right doctors farmers are not people that we want to
put in our bad guy slot the increased efficiency thing brings back is reminiscent of our conversation
with Robin Hansen right one avenue this can go down is just having a million times
duplicated person running on drugs doing all the jobs right yeah it's hard to see how that would
be shut down you know it'd be an innovative solution technology to get us there and hey it's
just capitalism when it's happening you've got there's an interesting thing that no one is talking
about because it seems very far out right now but the concept of a singleton to to avoid these
sorts of fates a singleton being a single entity that has absolute control over the government
and you know the entirety of the world government not just one country or one state
because really the only way you could prevent something like Robin Hansen's age of n that he
was if it is technologically possible would be to have a sort of totalitarian ruler that makes it
impossible to do anywhere they don't have to it doesn't have to be a single ruler
yes it has to be a unified it just has to be a unified regulatory system so is it like a a group
of people or is it one super villain with a regular mars i believe a group of people would be okay as
long as they were able to stay sick uh unified Robin Hansen mentioned that the you know when we're
like wow seems kind of weird that people would be cool with killing themselves every day um he's like
yeah there are weird people out there but at first there's not really enough weird people
that they can do things if if they've been told that they can't do it you know what i'm saying
it only needs to be one person that's okay with being killed every day not really not really if
the vast majority of people are the ones who are making the rules right so it can be as long as it's
as long as the majority of people are making the rules in that case yes but all you need is one
