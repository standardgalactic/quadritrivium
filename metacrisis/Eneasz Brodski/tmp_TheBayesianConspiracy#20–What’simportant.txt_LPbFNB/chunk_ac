small country like north korea that says yeah go ahead do whatever you want with this technology
and then they will take out compete everybody else right with their robot that's why i said it just
doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be like a group of clones or a single person with a ray gun
on mars it can be just most people using what they think is common sense in order but with the power
to then enforce that worldwide right right yeah the the power to enforce on everyone worldwide is
really the important part and i think that is something that we will at some point have to
talk about even though no one wants to talk about it because that's basically saying i think that we
should install a tyranny that can control everything i've never seen the problem with that
body was cool about it well that's that's always the problem right
but like a powerful king would be awesome if the king wasn't a dick all the time so i mean
that's the king never made any mistakes really exactly you fuck up one time when you're all
powerful that can be a pretty bad fuck up well there are you know organizations like EU right who
are now getting a lot of referendums thrown at them but even the EU doesn't have that much power
over individual member states and people just know as it turns out it does turn out that people
can just leave so like you couldn't this the singleton i'm assuming the singleton position
wouldn't work if people could just like i'm opting out no you are not allowed to opt out so that
sounds like a that doesn't like a hard sale right it sounds desirable if done perfectly but it would
be a hard sale i think well it's um or you could do a what you can offer as part of the group is so
great that opting out so that a few weirdos can copy themselves a million times is just not worth
it there's there's no such thing there'll always be someone who thinks it's worth it even if they
just want to say someone i mean like a country there's not gonna be a country that thinks it's
worth it there it is depending on how powerful the technology is you could have a large town of
i i i don't think you need to be i don't think you need to be singleton minded i in order to make
this work i i like that we disagree on this because then this is something we can actually talk
about unlike the the people the politicians who are not willing to talk about that whatever let's
move on to the next okay wait sarcasm it was sarcasm but also not you know you do not want to spend
very long on this particular topic i'm actually spending at least two more minutes on it okay
maybe okay why don't why don't you weigh in i'm i'm sort of on the fence that's why i'm
i moved to hear more about this uh this is the first i'm maybe the second time i've heard of
singletons and the first time i've heard it spelled out in detail and i'm curious what the
strong case is for it the strong case for it is uh have you read meditations on malik by it's
got on xander it's been on my list for a while i got through half of it at one point and then i
fell into my breath my open tabs and i'm not found it again okay it's well i mean it's probably his
most powerful work at least so far but it's also not a very accessible one you have to have already
read him a bit in his other topics to really get it but uh what it basically comes down to is
coordination failures are um slowly driving us to destroy our values in order to get economic
gains it's a lot like the three bodies amitani story where in order to survive you have to give
up a little thing that you value in order to get a little bit of a economic advantage and as everyone
is doing that it is kind of a race to the bottom it's like now you cannot have a well most people
cannot have a single earner household anymore both parents have to work because that is how much the
cost of living has gone up and part of the reason the cost of living has gone up is because it's
because so many houses do have uh two uh two incomes and so drives up the cost of education drives
up the cost of housing drives up the cost of everything so that you can't have single earner
houses anymore and all things considered for each individual household it's better to have two incomes
but uh and taken as a society as a whole now that everyone has to work if to do to pay the same
amount of bills that uh only one person had to work for before is kind of a downside and so it is
sort of it is this sort of coordination problem that you keep trading off more and more things
and eventually you get to like an age of n thing where you're trading off even the ability to uh
feel love because that takes away from time you could be working right you're trading uh away
your ability to have to be in awe of art because that is again that's a emotion you could be using
to be in awe of your wonderful uh accounting algorithm that you've put together instead
and so uh as singleton is a way to combat malik who is the the the uh the metaphor the metaphor
in the story um that drives everything to this ground state uh singleton would be a way to say
no stop i am the czar of working or whatever and we are not going to go down this road even though
it would be individually better for each one of you because if everyone does it it's worse as a
collective for all of us as far as uh state star codex and scott luxander i'll say really quick i
was reading his review of age of n and he talks about nick lands i think he wrote a book or something
where it's kind of like if age of n went poorly and age of m already looks kind of bleak so it
kind of painted the picture that i think maybe he mentions the maybe i'm assuming alexander
mentions it again in the meditations of malik because it sounds like it was going straight
there yeah everything's automated in fact there's not even people around any works industry just
running itself so i broke my back racing malik to the heavens and all i got was this disney land
without any children oh man that's awesome so is permutation city what happens if the age of m
goes great yes i think so not not miss permutation city is well in my opinion it's a horror novel but
uh it's it's definitely a much brighter take on the age of m scenario i'm not as well read in
science fiction as i should be so judge me into like everyone um fiction isn't a thing for everyone
yeah no it is it is for me i just haven't gotten around to it they're able to get to a point where
they have infinite processing power pretty much and they can do whatever the hell they want for
forever yeah that doesn't sound so bad so seeing how it's a horror story well so people
oh yeah no spoilers um people are able to focus and get mastery on all sorts of different
topics they spend a lot of time together they can modify themselves however they want to
it's modifying yourself they can have lots and lots of children um anyway it sounds kind of
awesome um and it's a paradise kind of dreamt up by by someone so yeah that's that's it that's all
you need to know about the book now you don't need to read it you got it it's a fantastic book well
i've already heard that so i guess i don't need to read it to know how fantastic it is right i'll
check it out it's on my it's on my list here's something that is definitely spoken about um in
in newspapers because it's quite sensational but it's not spoken about by serious political
candidates at least for the most part and that's things like settling other planets
i think it's spoken about minorly in terms of funding different interplanetary space exploration
programs but when it comes to like settling mars yeah it's interesting that i guess i guess one
reason for that might be and this is something i can't remember where i heard this as as a general
rule of considering what candidates talk about but it was years ago that a lot of these things if they
have a trajectory of success that was like 15 years well you're gonna be in office for max of eight
and you're running you're gonna you know you're running for a four-year term so you're a senator
yeah right but if you're running for president in the united states you can serve for two four-year
terms and that's it then you can't be president anymore i'm assuming i don't know why i spelled
that out everyone knows how i'm assuming even if you're a pavelist there's no that there's something
like that over here if you have a 15-year track plan that would just reform education make everything
awesome well you don't have time to implement it so you don't you're not going to waste time talking
about it maybe right yeah uh you know we won't be on mars in eight years you show results fast
exactly and big big things don't happen fast so maybe that's why some of these things aren't on
there but as a general rule to keep in mind i guess as far as interplanetary thing but doesn't
seem like a selling point though at least get every nerd to vote for you and there though
yes i don't think i for one would not be convinced i'm not i'm not convinced i was saying
somewhat somewhat jokingly but i mean it would be nice if one candidate was like hey you know what
this musk guy seems to have some idea what he's talking about what's uh i want to bring him in
on at least for lots of meetings even if it doesn't have time to be a cabinet member and we're gonna
look seriously into what he's doing maybe give him all the money that he wants and uh like he
doesn't want that much he's already super rich right but maybe give him a dedicated landing
pad i don't know whatever it is we're gonna work with we're gonna work on these cool things that
are not just fun but useful tech right well the government's already partnering with private
satellite launchers to um go to the space station for example that's because they don't want to pay
massive to it you supply it yeah something else that somebody mentioned that i think falls under
the same purview as the it's not gonna happen in 48 years is the heat death of the universe
jesus is what is what somebody suggests is an important issue the candidates and the press
i mean i think that's an almost no one ever talks about the heat death of the universe
i think that's an important issue essentially but uh we have so many other things billions of
years out yeah billions but yeah so like probably trillions the south the the the headline is like
trillions that's right i'm actually not sure because it's five billion years until our sun burns out
yeah i thought how much longer after that a lot i'm assuming at least a week
but the uh i think what could a candidate say other than like yeah at some point in the very
distant future the universe is gonna basically wink out and there's nothing we can do to stop it so
vote for me right so i think so there's no solution there's no at least nothing that we've
plausibly thought of yet yeah there's no solution nobody cares not even i care about that right now
i don't even care i have a lot of long-sighted goals but it is it is something they don't talk
about that's technically true all right but there you have it wrestled that's why nobody talks about
heat death of the universe wrestled brought that up yeah that sounds like a wrestle sort of thing
to bring up do write it do write in and tell us why they should talk about it or if there's something
if there's a steel man of that because you gotta get started early i'm sure there's something i mean
just stomping ideas into the ground i guess literally the early is better but i mean there are
other priorities right yes um i do think that you could get some cheap points and it wouldn't
even cost that much to say yes we're in favor of of a interplanetary humanity right um that's one
sentence and you don't have to elaborate you don't have to know what you're talking about but i think
you could get some some wins that way uh how many is some i mean let's think back nobody's going
after the vegan vote maybe more than you would lose whereas whereas you might lose endorsing
vegans okay no i mean you might not you might lose votes right because you piss off every meat
eater try to get the vegan endorsement might might alienate you from a lot of other people consider
like consider someone campaigning for the atheist vote right like there's uh somewhere between six
and twenty percent of the united states doesn't identify or what identifies atheist and no one's
clamoring for that vote because it would shun everybody else seemingly so i think part of it
is that kind of cost-benefit analysis of is it worth getting this many people pissed at me to get
this many people to like me i also don't think it's a very good signal if you're trying to convince
people of stuff no one's going to care if you say i'm in a supportive interplanetary humanity
because there's nothing you can do about it anyway you can say that and sure both sides can say it
and it doesn't mean anything well you can be like i'm taking all military spending and i am redirecting
it all military spending is costing lots of jobs i don't think presidents can even do that
they could say i'm in i can say i'm in favor of doing that and then not get votes yeah that's true
um there was that that presidential candidate some years ago i think it was two elections ago
one of the moon base is that newt gingrich oh no that was much more than two elections ago was it
i think so yeah in any case whatever the story is that at one point there was a candidate who didn't
end up being a major party candidate who wanted a moon base and people made fun of him for it so
so it's true that that talking about doing space stuff isn't enough to make you the president so
there's we do have one case example of that yeah all right okay how about electronic rights
that's a fun topic this is actually something that i hadn't given that much thought about until uh
i don't know if we want to name names or not who was it do you remember chase okay talk to me about
this a couple months ago and uh it's a i mean it's something that i thought about but i didn't
know it had a formal name and it turns out it's not just a page on wikipedia there's a whole thing on
digital rights the idea that you own your uh i guess digital memory the same way that you own your
mental memory like my iphone knows where i've been how long i've been there who i talk to um
everything about that and that that shouldn't belong to the government that should belong to me
like that that is as much me and this phone is now is sort of an extension of your brain
and in actuality that will be some case that was something like that'll be the case in the future
yeah like more literally yeah yeah so you know even pre-neural implants whether i get like a gps
in my arm that you know interacts with my smart house um or something like that right so at some
point things will be literally inside your body that will have digital components well there's no
no no there's already things literally inside your body what uh i don't know if you followed the
article i've chased uh sent or maybe posted on facebook but there are a lot of electronics in
people's bodies right now like they're uh pacemakers oh yeah that's a good point which they are not
allowed to uh fix or or touch in any way at all because of digital rights management that's insane
yeah there okay there's a good reason for saying that you shouldn't have an app on your phone that
you can swing like you can you know just your thermostat you know just kill yourself because i
mean uh but to to say that yeah it's not unusually modifiable no matter what you have to go to
technician because that's how the law is written that seems like an absurd misappropriation of the
intended reason uh i know that you can treat parkinsons with uh electrode implants there's a
there's a lot of electronics inside people now probably shouldn't be able to control that with
your phone but you shouldn't have to i mean maybe you there's there's a head there's a heads right
maybe maybe if it's inside your body you should be allowed to do whatever the hell you want to it
that sounds like a safer general proposal maybe even saying someone else should be able to well
and certainly safer than saying that you are not allowed to and only someone else can there's
nowadays they have drms on tractors uh in regular use apparently a tractor needs an oil change uh
every 16 hours of use or so that's what he said yeah yeah so more than once a day if you're running
it all day oh did we do it here on the contractors no this was that the last lesson i made a month
ago okay yeah and and he was saying that uh they have a little toggle on the on the oil uh reservoir
yes that that's the scientific term yes that is uh drm protected so that you cannot change your own
oil and you have to call someone out and do it for you every 16 hours even though changing oil
has to be done every other day and is the simplest thing in the world but because they put this little
electronic thing on it which you legally cannot fuck with they uh they they can't maintain their
own tractors tractors are shockingly interesting considering considering how how boring they sound
let's do elaborate i mean for example um when i was in gis okay a lot of these tractors are hooked up
with satellite data so and and they're able to take data from measuring nutrient levels in
different parts of the crop and perfectly mix the fertilizer that's gonna it's gonna go on the
crop in different parts are you serious yes for the correct nutrient level okay that is
magnificent exciting that right that is not i yeah that's awesome i i thought that you know big
lawn mower no that's why i'm telling you i know that's exciting that's awesome tractors that's
that is really interesting that might sound sarcastic but i meant that oh no i know you did
she can see my face so yeah no that's that's that is kind of mind-blowing think of all the other
things that change your own oil yeah and they could also you know plant different crops for
different you know kinds of places and a lot of that's automated and where they turn and everything
take that farmers i'm kidding well this is this is part of efficiency right that's right no the
reasons we've gone from 90 percent of people farming to less than two percent of people
no problem there we can just keep that going efficiency all the way right right yep they
could never be any downsides to that but speaking of automated things general intelligence
general artificial intelligence would possibly become a huge issue in like a humanity threatening
issue if if it is not programmed correctly which no one seems to be really talking about because
it sounds too crazy science fictiony well maybe it sounds that way because people who are in the
ai i feel like robin hanson said it's saying it's 200 to 500 years out i mean some people like robin
hanson but there's other people that are saying that could be as little as 50 years and the important
thing is to get started on it now that's not in eight years you know how hard it is to get people
to do anything about climate change it's actually affecting people right yeah it's one of those things
there should be some way to spell out the difference between like yes things get a little hard for us
