Jacqueline Newsom. Thanks, Jacqueline. Thanks so much, Jacqueline. You are awesome. You help us
play this lottery every day. That's right. And this is especially to you, but to everybody,
we don't like have good rewards on our website. We've had one person like ask for the little
sound bite that we have on there. They don't have anything. I think I try to message,
I try to try to message everybody who, you know, signs on as a patron. And sometimes they get
backlogged and I occasionally miss some. But if I missed you, message us. And if you want to,
and if I have, I always try to say like, let us know what we can do. And that stands for anybody
before we call your name. Hey, this is fun. Do that. Suggest your own rewards because we don't,
we didn't think of good ones who put the Patreon accounts. So we consider things within reason
that are proportional to the effort involves and all that stuff. But and I will say that the best
reward is the warmth you put in our hearts. That's right. That's the reward that we get. So
that's the word they get to, if you want your reward, that's more tangible for yourself.
Right. Then, then you know, making us do funny things on air.
Funny how. I don't know, reading things in silly voices. Yeah.
What? All right. And on that happy note, are we ready to call it? Yeah. All right.
Thanks all for listening. We will get back into much less morality stuff going forward.
That's right. See you in a couple of weeks. Bye. Bye.
