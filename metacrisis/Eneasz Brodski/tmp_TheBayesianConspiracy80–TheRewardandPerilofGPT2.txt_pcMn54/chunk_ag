lot of people who've read the story particularly adults who have kids or our teachers but um
that's really weird to me because it's like this okay children should be submissive mindset which
if the kid is right then the kids right you gotta like you know as the adult you should be a little
bit more modest and maybe be like oh i think it's that same instinct if people should know their
place in society you know like you know act like they're better than everyone else yeah and you
can send them to be you could see where it was adaptive probably you know back in the day for
kids to be submissive but not anymore not as much yeah not if they're harry potter james
evan's famous yeah i think the hard part is that like in a lot of ways most kids aren't people and
like that's one of the things that harry points out is like oh sure i'm not a person i'm just a kid
and something to that effect but like the the the parent who has to spend an hour arguing with their
you know the hunter gatherer parent arguing with their kid about like why you shouldn't go over and
play they're not near that lake that's full of alligators like that kid's just gonna get eaten
right because they're gonna either not agree and they're gonna go over and get eaten or they're
gonna burn their parent out or whatever right well even we sort of have that now with traffic right
but even the parent that has to argue with their kid in the middle of a grocery store why they can't
have another you know bag of lollipops or something is is gonna feel that same way yeah i'm really
interested in running the experiment on my niece that like just treating her like a like a human
adult the whole time because it worked on my cousin but she i think she's exceptional i think you
know we'll see where my niece is i'm sure she'll be great too but like just you know i could imagine
being at the store with some screaming kid but i guess i'd not mind because my mind wouldn't do that
whatever but i think if you have the rapport of like being a reasonable person to engage the
whole time which the hard part is like kids can't you can't reasonably engage i know we're pretty
far afield but whatever when they're kids and they they're just mad and they don't know why
like they they they can't articulate their own feelings um quick side side bar uh anaharis
sam Harris's wife teaches meditation to children as young as five and six teaches what meditation
oh um just basic like introspection but they can get children i think around the age of five
plus or minus a year to like label their emotions and just the presence of minds to be like oh yeah
i am happy or i am sad like that that reflective awareness of your emotional state a lot of adults
don't have that exactly and so if a kid can look in and be like i'm mad right now and you know if
if they're aware enough of that i think that must i imagine that that's the kind of trial
you can engage with you know in who's having a fit in the storm like you're you're upset right now
aren't you do you want to talk about it um i think i don't know well i i'm kind of the best part
about being an uncle as opposed to a parent is that like the kids not my problem so like if it
just won't shut up i take it back to its mom's house and it's it's her problem again right like
they're referring to it isn't it yeah now it's it now that it's a problem she's not a problem she
she's the person which is fine when it's making noise and it's annoying i for i don't know until
i was in my mid 20s always just treated kids like people like other adults yeah i mean not as
experienced but whatever and kids seem to really love me which i was like okay that's weird but
sure whatever and i didn't really put two together uh then i started being socialized with how adults
are supposed to treat kids and like now it's really hard for me to go back uh but yeah kids not not
nearly as fond of me anymore i think you just talked to him be like hey what are you up to you
know what do you know i don't know talk to him like he would a person right now now it's a weird
thought maybe it's harder to do now i don't know why i just i've gotten to the point where like oh you
are a fragile alien object and i like a pet or something yeah no it's it's much easier to interact
with kids on that level as if they were a pet i had to deal with a lot of kids when i worked at the
library and i had a really hard time trying to treat all the kids like people um the thing with
methods of rationality and i'm trying to form a coherent thought here there's some kids that are
you know uh prodigies i know a lot of kids that uh had been child prodigies really loved methods
of rationality because they related to harry a lot and i think um i really liked the harry
character because i could think back to being a kid and feeling frustrated with not being treated
like a person and i think a lot of kids harbor resentment around that so the reason they probably
really loved you is that they don't get that from adults in their life they don't get any kind of
validation of like oh your your feelings are valid you know this thought you had is interesting uh
so yeah i try to keep that in mind it does get difficult though with the kids that are
more frustrating to deal with you tend to have less of that kind of theory of mind going on
or are just like very impulsive or kids that have behavioral problems just act out and want to throw
things you know you can't reason with that kid as easily as you can with the kid that like is reading
nk jemisin right and like programming and python i i related to the character of harry for methods
rationality because i wished i was a child prodigy and i was like oh i wish i was that cool as a kid
but yeah i think unless you you had any desire for that sort of of outstandingness or were that
kid then you know i could see i'd be off putting some people i think we were talking about like
some of the critiques of the of the of the character before we started recording and one
thing is that like people who don't really know what to expect they get into it they're like that's
not a 11 year old this is stupid and it's it's not like the the author's unaware that's not how
11 year olds usually talk and there's an innuent universe explanation for why this kid is weird
so yeah he was also like an author mouthpiece but i think yukowski was a child prodigy he was
and and he was there are a lot of girls that do talk like that yeah i've met some um it's uncanny
i bet yeah i think uh it was it's a it's a an aside thing but yeah um
should we yeah the the last i'll read us on to the next one with the end quote from this last
post which was said i couldn't i tie i'll always run as fast as i can even if i pull ahead i'll keep
on running and someone someday it will surpass me but even though i fall behind i'll always run as
fast as i can and that's yeah that's that's sort of the same spirit you know like i don't have to be
the best in the world won't be the best me that i can be yeah i really i the way that you put it
last time resonated with me a lot is like i'm not going to compare myself to the olympic athlete i
compare myself to myself and i'm going to beat me yep i love that that it that should have been in
this that should have been in the thing that's that's why i paraphrase my head all the time now
cool um all right statistical bias statistical bias quite quotes in quotes uh so this one at
first really intimidated me because it had like a bunch of math and math isn't like an intuitive
thing to me i had to like sit down and analyze it to understand what it was saying and it took
some time and some effort but uh really it in my opinion you could have stripped out the math from
this post entirely it just seemed to be saying that when a system is biased to to not give a
correct result then running many tests will eventually it'll converge onto a result but
that may not be the correct result like for example if you roll a six-sided die you may not
necessarily know what side is going to come up but if you keep rolling it long enough eventually
you'll notice that the six comes up 16.6 percent of the time uh unless it's a weighted die and then
there's bias in the system and if you keep rolling at thousands of times you'll eventually get to
the six comes up like 21 percent of the time you'll be like oh that's interesting dies come up on
six 21 percent of the time okay which is it's just wrong but it's not because you were doing the
experiments wrong or doing the statistical analysis wrong everything you were doing was right it's just
the system has an inherent bias in it i'm with you i think the post could have been done without
math and part of me wonders if it was just like running with it with the theme of the last post
of like yeah it didn't have to be this smart when i wrote this but i am and here you go
i don't think that was an expressed goal but uh it's it made me kind of chuckle when i thought of
that um the example he gave was the emperor of china is actually 200 centimeters and if the
in the us on average people think he's 190 centimeters with a variation of like 10 centimeters
you can serve you can ask one person and he'll say he's 180 centimeters and they'll be off by 10
and someone else will say yeah he's 100 uh he's 200 centimeters and uh they'll they'll actually
be correct but if you keep serving enough people they'll all converge onto 190 and that's through
the law of large numbers you eventually got to what the system believes his height is even though
they're off by 10 statistically or in reality rather they're off by 10 centimeters do i get
that right yeah i think so i'm just noticing how many of the the variables and the equations here
are e and y which are elia eliazard kalki's initials maybe that's why you got into math
this is from to keep his attention um yeah i don't have much to add to that other than i
this is one of the posts that like i think it sets up for for other posts better than it does
stand on its own and there's not a lot to really you know gain and run with here it doesn't inspire
me i don't remember it in a way that you know anything like that sometimes systems will be biased
and give you information that does not accurately reflect the real world no matter how much you
no matter how good your methods are yeah i think this post was meant to specifically
lay groundwork for and lead into the next one the useful statistical biases
but uh in of itself it's kind of just stating a fact about statistics okay well if we thought
ahead with more than a couple hours before the podcast we would have read the third one with this
but you know it's a buying suspense for a couple of weeks that's all yeah um wasn't i gonna plug
something in a video game joke or something at some point i can't remember i was like oh that'll
go in the video game chat later and i remember you saying that and i don't remember what it was
oh well no one the world will never know yeah i've been playing through red dead redemption
two a little bit i'm not burning too much time playing games but i'm i'm being i've actually
been really busy the last month which is great um but playing that a bit and it's interesting like
uh i've i've complained about the game a lot and they're still like the clunky mechanics and stuff
and there's like there's this bullshit completionist stuff where like if you want to go through like oh
get get the hundred percent you gotta do a bunch of completely out of character stuff like somebody
who's like you know an outlaw trying to like you know do outlaw stuff to go collect like 50 of these
flowers it's like no fuck that but man it does a good job of making you actually care about the
characters like they went through a part where it's not really a spoiler some characters die
and i'm like oh shit not them and so yeah it does it does a good job going in that way in the second
half it like goes off the rails yeah oh i showed you the donkey reviews why oh okay okay yeah that's
where i got yeah i got i got past that part and that was okay that was sort of a drag yeah but then
it gets better again um kind of i'll spoil it off air um but yeah no new fun video games yet i was
plugging the movie polar with madison mickelson that wasn't that good but it was great if you like
john wick he'll love this movie um what else is new and fun i think i missed the chance to make a
joke about gd dp2 g g pt pt yes what was the joke uh which was that i started playing kingdom
hearts 3 and i'm pretty sure that that's what wrote the script for the game everything i've
read about in scene reviews of kingdom hearts 3 i totally see where you're coming from that it was
highly ambitious it seemed like a really like fun project like let's finally bring all these things
together but it was in its execution it missed a lot of the marks and had a lot of really annoying
components is that about somewhat up oh i'm particularly just talking about the story and
like the character dialogue is just so bizarre the story's gotten so convoluted over the you know
there's like then three console games and god knows how many handheld games i think it's like the
eighth one right yeah i think i can count just like gp t2 does yeah they've decided that all the
weird diversions and like all the extra characters they've added like everything is canon they're
going to completely commit to it so you'll have like mickey and then like a final fantasy looking
character walking through a world literally called the realm of darkness which is made up of black
lava with blue glowing bits talking about like the nature of consciousness and like souls and stuff
and holy shit just like what am i playing right now you keep getting like broken out of the experience
by just how like some bizarre stuff like people start talking about the fact that some characters
have like there's you the character and then you have a heartless which is your dark version then
there's a nobody which is what happens when a heartless is created and that's the extra stuff
and then there's also data versions of characters so like the main character will just be talking
about like yeah and then like that was the thing that datasaur did in the data world
dude this totally feels like the the jrpg's of like the early 2000s yeah i'm getting flashbacks
from the final fantasies around then i think final fantasy plays a big part in kingdom hearts
yeah so totally gotta pick up this kingdom hearts thing i think you gotta start from the bottom
or start from start from the early ones it's a fun game like i enjoy the game mechanics uh
some of it's kind of clunky and i don't like the number of qte's that they kept adding into it
but um the quick time events where it's like you'll be fighting a battle and it's like oh press
this button really fast yeah and now you do a cool flip thing but you're not in control of the
character you're just watching a cutscene spider-man for ps4 did that a lot well not a lot i guess it
did an okay number of those what i didn't like and i actually disabled this in the settings
where it's like you know you gotta slam the square button a bunch of times to lift this car
fast enough i'm like that's super annoying yeah it's you know my thumb clicks when i bend it too
much because i have i call it video game thumb from smashing a button too much um that's that's
not even really a game mechanic so what i do instead is in the settings you can change it to
where you just hold down the button okay and it's like i'm not gonna sit there and just you know i'm
not gonna it's not hard for me to slam this button it's just annoying so whatever um i think the
only game that did quick time events in a way that was fun and interesting was the first god of war
and the god of war for ps4 does that too okay and i like this still good with it yeah i think so
like oh my god the the game that i think really popularized them well okay the first game that
popularized them was dragon lair which was oh my god ridiculous but uh shenmu for the dreamcast had
that it was basically a movie where you like decided when you get to see the next act and when
you just want to wander around and collect toys and whenever you want to go see the next act you
have to go through another stupid quick time event thing we're like x pops up on screen gotta hit x
fast enough and then square pops up you gotta hit square and i was like this is bullshit i think
there was another good component to include those in is like telltale games where not deciding is
also a choice so like you could either you know tell your friend x or y or tell them nothing and
that also is like has its own notifications because that's that kind of adds like this feel of like
actual urgency and those are kind of fun but um man nothing else too exciting i've been watching a
show called fresh off the boat which is fairly popular i think it's been on i think it's on
its fifth season it's uh it takes place in the 90s and i guess a phob is it was a uh pejorative
term for for asian-american immigrants huh and like they're fresh off the boat people or whatever
i guess that's not a term i'm like i was married with yeah i never heard of that but they dropped the
tea so phob yeah but um the cast is fun the cast is almost exclusively asian which is a lot of fun
and to the extent that it's not they have like whatever the dad from twin peaks is like the only
actor i've ever seen in anything else who is of regular on the show you know it'd be great
if they have asians in whiteface to play the white people white people they don't have that but they
have is the best uh they have some good cameos um my favorite is they've had a ken jiang on a few
times as the main character's brother and he played uh chang or wait he played chang in community
and chow in uh hangover and so then this prompted me to watch uh ken jiang on hot ones which is
this youtube channel where they eat hot spicy uh chicken wings and then his hour-long standout
special which was not that good and he just talked about the hangover for like 30 minutes um but maybe
we want to watch the hangover again so i did that and then watch the second one which was actually
really brilliant it was exactly like the first one that we played every beat but in a way that
like wasn't recycled it was it was reused in exact i think in a very great uh recipe to make this
like an original hilarious thing while completely playing on exactly the same notes as the first
movie and then the third one which i didn't even know existed was just off the rails it didn't have
it wasn't a hangover they didn't like lose their memory and stuff but it was was like repercussions
of like the smallest bit from the first movie um you remember it doesn't matter the plot but basically
there's like this big giant mob boss that's uh john goodman because he's in everything it seems like
and he's you know go get me chow and i you know he's still on my goals it's just the dumbest plot
it was hilarious um oh but my favorite cameo on fresh off the boat was uh michael bolton
as himself oh cool and uh the main the main character i can't remember the actor's name
he was also the detective who uh or the fbi agent who kept ant-man under house arrest and ant-man too
