consumed by robots already. So this is sort of it's sort of a matter of GPT to which is an
excellent multitasker trying to edge into what are currently expert systems or expert systems with
some neural network back end a little bit. So I think we're basically there as far as was this
written by a person or or a computer because there are a lot of articles I've read where
I thought oh this is probably a computer right just because it for sports articles especially
they'll they'll just you know they have a list of statistical things that happened in the game
that were recorded by someone and they'll just spit out an article about you know what the
least likely things were or that are in a certain style but that's that's not
that's all bespoke it's not as part of a multitasker. I think I think it'll be you know in a year or two
we'll probably see something like GPT to being used in the wild as outside of like a novelty website
like Stylgan has a couple of them now like this person is not real. Yeah that was something that
probably started in Yash that's where that it amalgamated a bunch of human faces I want to say
like 10 million and then generated a bunch of human faces that don't actually belong to any
individuals they just look exactly like real people like down to the irises the eye lines and
everything and then this was this title and I saw a thing on the programming subreddit yesterday
where someone did this with anime waifus and it was like your waifu is not real or something
and then when I was reading it it was on Gwynne's website Gwynne put this together. Yeah I was gonna
bring that up because I'm an artist and there's a bunch of AIs that draw now when we were talking
about like writers being replaced by a writing robot there's already a lot of robots that do art
and they're getting better really fast and like that was one that hilarious one that just generates
anime girls it's that's the only thing it does and it does it really well so people were saying
well you could just kind of use this to you know if you have a text-based game where there's just a
static picture of a person like you could make a video game and just use this as your art engine
and not need to hire artists so that's happening that and as someone who likes to be hired as an
artist that's probably sad to hear actually I've found it really interesting so far I mean like
there is the concern about down the road or there's just going to be no artists I don't think that's
gonna happen I think humans like to make stuff too much and I think they also like to be paid to
make stuff yeah yeah there's the money thing too I just like you know I want there to be UBI and I
think eventually we're gonna have to deal with that totally like we've got robots now that can replace
humans um or the you know prototypes of that so we're gonna have to start having that conversation
but like I think that I'm happy that some of these tools exist because I find that they're
really good for option generation or for experimenting there's a lot of art that's boring
and the same thing with writing because I've written too there's there's the parts that are
really exciting the cool creative parts that you want to get into like oh what does this
character look like or you know I'm gonna draw a building that looks like this and then there's the
like now I have to draw every brick or every strand of hair and you don't want to do that part
it'd be cool if you could just get a robot to do that part yeah I think what we're gonna see first
is uh people working with robots like rather than then on their own um and a lot of that is going to
be labor saving especially the labor that people don't really want to do um I would love if there
were like an editing robot that I could just send chapters to and it could be like oh point out a
bunch of stuff and we're we're getting there's a pretty good editing tools yeah my experience
has been that they do a lot of false positives um that make the editing not really that much faster
so uh but I mean we're getting there yeah definitely but so as far as you know people making money
from art um the more labor that you can save I think you get better art out of that if you
you know one hour of human time is suddenly um if you can do in one hour what used to take two hours
you're gonna get better art out of that in theory I don't think we have a shortage of art right now
I mean there is more produced every minute than I could that I could uh consume in a month but
you know the hard part is I don't know getting not just something that's good but something that
other people are also interested in at the same time you want to appreciate art socially with
other people that's why things like we've got worm is so great yeah I I think for my my opinion is
that uh there there's so much art and media produced right now that you can choose to be picky
and it's more about um either the top like one percent of quality or um the uh what what your
particular preferences are as far as subject matter or themes or um or things like that and
that's where I think that's where I think labor saving helps a lot because you can sort of expand
your niche without um needing more people to get into it right like uh I don't know like if you have
a specific like you you want the 80s aesthetic right in your in your written work um there aren't
that many options for that and if you start piling in more stuff like if you want a sci-fi future as
imagined by the 80s um like how many people are actually writing that or like drawing that there's
not an infinite amount of that to consume so as far as either having that stuff automatically
generated you know from nothing by itself or labor saving for artists that's kind of where I think
the application is is just expanding expanding the long tail of media I guess interesting real
quick how do you um how well do you think this would work in things like debate as a debate partner
to pull up quick facts for you from the internet or to check what your opponent is saying uh
real-time fact-checking we are I do not think that it's very good right now um partly because if you
go I like it can answer questions but um let me find some of the ones that uh yeah it's not
actually concerned with facts right it's not going and looking stuff up on the internet it's
predicting what word is going to come after this word it can just make facts up wholesale so if
enough people argue that the earth is flat it can find you facts that that that's the case yeah like
what Stephen Colbert saved the elephant population by having his listeners update the wikipedia page
so this was one of the um they're in the paper they're a bunch of question and answer ones um
and it's much worse at the q and a stuff at the lower level so the public version is worse at this
but um like the answer what is the most common blood type in Sweden and says a right and that
is not correct um and it said that with 70 probability that that was correct so if it's
going to do false positives like that where it'll say oh i'm 70 certain that this is correct
and you just can't trust it all then you can't use it for fact if you hook it up to wolf from alpha
well that's the thing is like wolf from alpha is already there right i mean you you could maybe
do it for coverage of things that aren't in wolf from alpha or you could hook it up to
they excluded i think a lot of wikipedia from um from their web because most other uh texture
generative ai's use wikipedia yeah and they just didn't want it to kind of look like all the other
ones out there yeah and that was part of the point so you could hook more stuff in and it
would probably get more accurate you know to but it's that's one of the things about it is that
um it's a very good multitasker but for the specific tasks there's so many bots out there
and systems out there and programs that already are like hyper focused on those specific tasks
that you don't need a neural network for like wolf from alpha just is looking at databases of facts
which is all you really need for that kind of thing i think where i think where maybe there's
some utility is in parsing a question and like knowing what type of answer it wants because
some questions have are you know long and circuitous and um it's hard to understand
to summarize a question asking for that's funny yeah um so it might it might be helpful in that
for for questions or statements that aren't um that aren't straightforward or uh specifically
phrased for a robot did you hear the uh can an ai change your mind to debate i don't think i did
no there there was uh kind of don't remember what podcast i heard it on probably the reason
podcast now that i think of it uh or maybe no no no it was the one of the intelligent squared ones
where an actual debater and an ai who i think must have been a gpt2 derivative uh or if not gpt2
itself uh debated they were given 20 minutes before the debate started the question uh something
about oh uh free kindergarten should be extended to everyone in america or something along those lines
and the ai debated for and the human debated against and i mean the human was obviously better uh the
he was more convincing and the ai kind of repeated at same points over and over and didn't
didn't it was obvious it didn't have a deep understanding of anything it was just so repeating
some surface arguments but it was surprisingly like articulate and you could tell there was
something there it just wasn't very good and that's what made me think maybe like if it had
been combined with a human together they could do a better job well yeah they could and the the other
thing is that you know people aren't perfect thinking machines and so if you just bombard
someone with arguments and like you can you could it'd be pretty easy to get an ai like this one
to or i guess a language model like this one because i don't think they call it
an artificial intelligence um but it would be pretty easy to get one that can
like do a gish gallop right i just bombard someone with sources and citations and stuff like that
and you don't actually need to make you know cogent arguments you can just bury someone under
that may be my dim view of how good people are at separating fact from fiction or
actually evaluating an argument on its merits but um i think that's i was just gonna say i think
that's held up in like psychological studies there are people that aren't paying attention
or that have like motivated reasoning and are completely swayed by the gish gallop style of
debate right which is what could make something like gpt2 kind of concerning the other thing
that i heard a lot of people uh scare mongering is maybe the wrong word because i think it's a
legit concern but uh talking about was fake news this thing could be really good at generating
fake news yeah yeah and anything where you just don't care about the truth you just care about um
sheer amount of words generated you can you can you know it'd be it'd be so easy to set up
like a hundred different websites or um have a bunch of sock puppets that are just repeating
the same talking points with enough variation that you can't actually tell that they're sock
puppets right i mean that that sort of thing is done precisely now but you tend to have people
behind it doing it yeah and so i mean yeah you could you could do this on an order of on a scale
that is not that would make it so hard to weed past all the bullshit um yeah if you didn't actually
have to have people behind this writing all these things then yeah this wasn't the first time this
sort of thing had crossed my mind for this conversation and the level of talk text analysis
and stuff kind of brought a couple political figures to mind as well um and in the disregard for
you know basing their the assertions in facts uh rings a bell as well um yeah that's that's
disconcerting and i definitely don't see how that's going to be dodged i mean they mentioned how
they're not released in the full version but you know like you know i said that's going to come out
eventually but i do like that you know trying to pump the brakes a bit and say hold on before
this thing gets out of out of control let's let's try and get some conversations going about
how we're going to tackle this well in the debate where you could really tell it was an AI was the
the second part where they like responded to each other uh the AI didn't i mean you could
tell it didn't know what the other person was really saying it didn't respond like a human even
if a human didn't know the answer and was just trying to gishgallop you they would find a clever
way to like bring things around and dodge the question and stuff and the AI just basically
acted like there hadn't been a question asked of it it was it was interesting i think that
with things like this at least for the next year or two we could pretty quickly weed out
the human from the AI by going with follow-up questions well yeah but i think there's a couple
things with that one i'm brought to mind of a bad debate i saw between janesha susan peter
singer like 10 12 years ago oh but they just talked past each other the whole time well no
you're talking about a singer was engaging everything and didn't ask just use it was not
and he was just really he was just making this he would make the same things over and over every
time it was his turn to talk yeah politicians do that too i mean they're actually trained to do that
you don't actually engage the question you just like talk about the thing that you you know well
here's what i think about the economy it's like that's not the question at all and my my concern
isn't so much you know so that we won't be able to discern whether these authors are people or not
because i mean right now you know these russian bots are people but that doesn't really matter
like i could talk to them if they were willing to engage and discern whether or not they're
robots but the point is they're putting out enough content that's has enough clickbaity
shareable stuff to put on facebook and twitter that it it gets spread out and nobody bothers take
the time to sit there and analyze like maybe this is not a person maybe this isn't true yeah and and
on top of that uh you have selection effects in place right so if you're having bots generate
a million tweets it doesn't matter if half of them are crap or even you know 90 percent of them are
crap that are like obviously robots the the stuff that's going to get shared and then seen is going
to be the stuff that's the most human like and the most compelling yes so i don't know it's going to
be a problem it's already i mean it's an extension of the problems that we already have though which
we already can't solve so a quick question i have i've sort of gotten to the point where i don't really
believe anything anymore if i see it i'm like that's interesting i wonder if it's true and uh
are you i think this might be bad in general for human society is do you guys find yourself
reacting that way to the just overwhelming mass of disinformation out there or what strategies
do you use i do that all the time and there was that uh the most recent example was who was that
actor from not the wire i don't know that actor who paid people to beat him up and then claim he
was assaulted by trump supporters oh yeah when i heard that he was jumped by trump supporters out
leaving something uh someone told me about this i was like oh man if that's true that really sucks
is what is what i actually said and then it turns out it wasn't but it when i hear something that
sounds like it really fits a narrative especially you know and there's there's you know other other
side news too that could do the exact same thing where it's like oh that yeah that sucks if that's
true and you know it swings the other way um i i would like to think that if i cared enough
i could dig into any each any individual instance and see if there's something to it but even i mean
that could take a day you know to see if this author's real or something right like that that
could take forever yeah there's on one hand i want to say increasing the amount of skepticism out
there is a good thing for humanity like i would actually like it if people didn't believe everything
they read on the internet or saw on facebook and fact checked it first but uh there's the extent
to which like how easy is it going to be to fact check some of this stuff yeah and also yeah what
steven was just talking about it fact checking everything does get to be really exhausting and
do we have heuristics for a reason because we're trying to conserve like mental power for things
that are actually important rather than like is that news story true yeah totally i think even
just fact checking one thing can be exhausting like i said i mean if you're digging in to see if
did this really happen that could take most of a day um and since you don't have time for all that
your heuristic is what feels the most emotionally true to me right yeah but i mean like it's not even
so much just everything because you could especially like skimming through a twitter feed or
something could cross 50 things and that would take you two months but like just one thing i can't
think of anything i've read recently that i cared enough about to dig at for half a day but i think
my current strategy is like i'll see something like huh well i guess we'll see what happens in
the dust settles in a couple weeks and then usually if something happens there's follow-up and i'll
get something on it from that um i i mean i try generally not to talk about very recent things
on the podcast for that reason like baby it's entirely different from what we think and i also
do the uh my main rule is i don't share something before googling it and i mean that doesn't read
out everything but that is that is so far above and beyond but almost anybody does that's super
awesome well i mean it doesn't read out everything but it gets like the most service level obvious
crap out the door right away and you know just if i don't want to share something i
don't necessarily google it i'll be like well interesting and you'd like to say if that's
true that's a bummer but if i actually share it then i google it first yeah i tend i tend to
completely ignore uh anecdotes like things that happen to one person as being not irrelevant but
like there are so many things that happen that a single person is always such uh
you know that doesn't tell you anything about statistical distributions right you're like oh
that's one data point yeah it's it's one it's one data points you know because of the way social
media works it's the most um usually it's usually the most metraulic and biased data point that
compelled people to share right um whereas i care a lot more about the statistical trends or like
hard data i tend not to read you know news articles anymore um especially since most of
them are like a mangling of some primary source yeah like for for gtp2 you know i'm gonna there
