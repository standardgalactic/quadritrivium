there are people i trust on certain things but um i would way rather just go read the primary source
and spend my time on that and then question the biases of that author you know as a better way
even even studies are you gotta worry about p hacking you gotta worry about you know all
kinds of different stuff if you read the primary source of the study too but there's so much of
news that i just have to like push to the side as being basically irrelevant to anything because
i mean as people were very individualized and we focus on those individual things so much more
and that's always what gets the most play as far as uh outrage culture and stuff goes
i don't know it's one of those things i think about a lot um but i basically just have to
sequester myself as a coping mechanism how big is gpt2 like if i were to want to download it and
run out of my laptop would it melt my machine or nope it is uh it is 4.5 okay no that i got i don't
i just downloaded a virtual machine um for it which was four gigabytes i think um you do not need
that much if you are going to go through the work of setting up um python and the dependencies
and stuff like that but i just downloaded a virtual machine that was open at the console window
so i had to could skip all that stuff but that um and it runs on my uh netbook just fine it takes a
while like you put in your prompt and then you're just waiting there for you know 30 seconds or a
minute or something because it you know um it's a netbook and it's uh underpowered but it's it's
not very big i mean it's not it's not that much work to run so it it doesn't have the
storage of everything it read with that four gigs does it no the everything it read is 40 gigabytes
so this is just the neural network that was generated from training on that 40 gigabytes okay okay got
you got you yeah so i am the only stuff it knows is stuff that's in the neural network like it i mean
even in in its full form it's never referring back to any articles or something it's just referring
to what's to the weightings in the neural network that's so cool so you're an author have you tried
to make this thing do some work for you like write a short story or two and try to sell it
somewhere uh not yet i was thinking that i would try to do that just for the novelty of it i don't
think it could be cool for idea prompt yeah well and i said i was trying to do magic items for dnd
because i i write a um i write worth the candle which is a lit rpg and it has a bunch of dnd items
and i was like yeah i could just make new ones or at least get inspiration from it
middling success on that um because it it kind of like it kind of likes to wander off or just
it's like do nonsense in the style of item descriptions because you feed it like five
item descriptions and hope to get a sixth back and it just is like it's in the style of it but
it's not saying anything and it's not even that good for idea generation because it's just it's
just words that that like i'm trying to make sense of i don't know i so i i haven't had a lot of luck
with that so far um i'm going to be trying more short story generation tonight to see if you can
like hammer something into shape because i do think i do think the promise is in the centaur
approach but it's a question of i i think i'll probably spend more time on it than if i just wrote
a short story because like to write a short story pretty fast um trying to do it with a computer
and then editing all of its like garbage into something that makes sense on more than just a
surface level i i want to try it but i'm i'm not optimistic at all i would be fascinated for you
to get back to us like in a few days and just let us know how that went yeah i will cool
all right well i think we've been going on for a while uh we should probably wrap it up is there
anything any of you guys wanted to say ask i'm still feeling pretty bummed about how we're talking
about this is just this nightmare fake news factory is there any good news or any any
any optimism we can draw from this development hey soon humans will be obsolete um better machine
translation better question answering um better summarization of news uh which is i mean we might
run into the problem where uh you have ai generating fake news and then ai summarizing that fake news
but um we were just talking about how it is hard to uh do fact checking um that would be a lot easier
if you could do automatic summaries of of various things i don't know how i mean that kind of
somewhat defeats the purpose of a deep dive but um it would help a lot to to be able to
have automatically generated abstracts at least so that you would know going into um reading through
an article whether whether it was worth your time or not if do you if it could do like get at least
get you the central thrust again summarization one of the things that it's worst at and still
pretty good but that's interesting because like there's those like summary bots on reddit that
you know you link to a news source and it'll give you three paragraphs synopsis of it which it just
grabs direct quotes i think yeah it does uh i think the most popular one is a it does sentence
entropy so it's like picking out the most important sense sentences from the article
but that's still pretty good because there's a lot of fluff in a lot of those articles
yeah i love those summary bots it i mean if i carry enough i'll read the full thing but i've
done that where i've compared the full thing against the summary and yeah it seems to capture
mostly essential information and i think that's pretty interesting yeah so this could be even
better than those at summary and abstracts drawing and stuff so yeah i i think there's some good news
um we'll have to see what people actually end up using it for
yeah i guess we'll see right uh was there anything you wanted to say and you should also plug worth
the candle real quick and tell people where they can find that yeah uh worth the candle just google
it i guess it's on it's it's on archive of our own um it's got a long url and but i think it's the
top result and if it's not just we'll add a link in the show notes as well yeah uh but that's fine
that's that's the current thing i'm writing um i'm always writing new stuff so uh i one of the
things that i am currently working on as sort of a my second project for when that's done is um
um one that's based around this kind of thing um of like the the marriage between neural networks
and automatic generation systems and how we sort of use them and react to them so that that'll be in
like a year or two though so sounds awesome all right well thank you for joining us yeah thanks
for having me yeah it's a lot of fun and if you uh if you give any results back from your your
experiments tonight in the next couple days let us know we'll we'll include those too yep okay sounds
good cool good night all right good night okay on to our less wrong post discussion section of the
show okay uh the two well the first of the two that we're doing today is so you could not attire
versus the egalitarian instinct did i say that right you said close enough you said the first
part right you said you said egalitarian it's egalitarian so you got the English I was focusing
so much on the Japanese so you you you japaneseified the english word yeah all right yes no worries um
all right so the my my one set in summary of this is just like kind of where we've evolved impulses
as social primates to like not want to i guess showboat when we're being exceptional um but
basically this doesn't mean that we shouldn't try yeah and that you know there there might be good
reasons for humility to to i don't know not say how easy something was or you know yeah i guess
i am the best at that but you know that doesn't mean that you shouldn't actually try to be the best
yeah so i think it is just maybe i'm assuming this is some response to feedback on the tsudokunai
tie up this on post but it seemed to me i don't know it seemed like it was just a post script to
tsukunai tie and they could have almost been one post but here's the weird thing i recall the first
time i read this being like really i don't know if moved is the right word but i was like yeah
that's right exactly you know going along with it i was like i was very happy to see this and now
going back and reading it it it didn't really touch anything in me at all and i don't know if
that's because i've changed or what but you're just less humbled now yeah maybe you just totally
took it to heart and you're reading it now and you're like yeah obviously oh right but it basically
are you familiar with the the this was made all the rounds i think about a year ago it's
been going on forever though because obviously hunter-gatherers the insulting the meat thing
okay there's a there's a not a hunter-gatherer tribe anymore but like a a tribe that's still
very much in the old living sense uh and they hunt them they hunt for meat and uh if someone comes
in with like a really impressive game uh a catch that they you know they did most of the work themselves
they everyone knows they did this right uh when they bring in the meat they're like oh man this is
bad meat and like everyone in the tribe insults the meat oh i did hear something about this recently
yeah where did i hear this i you wouldn't know but right recently yeah it was but it was everyone
knows it's good meat and they're still all impressed with what he did but like they say yeah we gotta
we gotta keep people humble you know so they don't get too big heads or anything and it's it's a it's
a weird it's a weird ritual but a lot of like every society has that right yeah some more than others
i think i just saw this like in a link in the slates in the comment section of a slate star codex
post on reddit or something it was nothing obscure but i just saw something like that in the last
week where it was like don't insult the meat and it was a hyperlink and like what the fuck does that
mean so i i i just read about this okay yeah so so the goal is to keep the the the triumphant
murder of this i guess not whatever that the successful hunter of this of this food humble by
saying it's okay yeah okay yeah i've had better yeah right yeah i don't remember liar liar that was
yes classic that was that line reminds me of did you are you was that a direct reference or was that
an answer no i didn't uh i haven't seen it oh it was it's a great movie if you can't if you can stand
whatever late 90s or early 2000s jim carrey um the promise is he can't lie for a day and he's this
asshole lawyer and he first discovers this when he takes he's got some girl that he took home for
the night and then boss always was boss yes he was like that was great night huh and he's like
i've had better he's like laughing himself in the mirror he's like why would i say that
all right yeah that's my movie digression it's that time of the night i kept it together for the
podcast or for the for the guest mostly so i'm proud of you i'm all over the place thank you
but um yeah it was basically a post pushing back against that thing you know what if you
do keep trying to make yourself strong and make yourself better you will be you know
possibly better than some people you run the risk of succeeding exactly yes and that's okay
just keep trying your best there'll be other people that are better than you in most of their things
and that's fine too people are not all the same and different people can excel in different things
and stop trying to stifle everything and keep everybody at the same level of meh yeah i like
that there was um a just in the insect in the interest of everyone being egalitarian
yeah and i think it's tough because there was actually a good a good little quote in there
that i didn't pull out that was um you know you might be better than than the average person
at some things but you know the average person's better than uh people who are below average at
things by definition right and so you know somebody could charge you with like why would you try and
do better than them that's so rude of you and it's like oh well come on we're not going to buy that
you know it's like i i might suck at math that doesn't mean that you should like suck at it yeah
that you should suck at it too certainly what if anything it should mean that unless we have an
agreement like we're friends that won't be offended for better than me at it that you don't rub it in
my face right if i if i if i'm thin-skinned about it or something but that doesn't mean that just
because you know people are people in your tribe aren't uh you know i think that is if you try you
might run the risk of actually succeeding and to i just it doesn't even seem to in my reading of the
post didn't even really seem to like admonish that you ought to be do express humility it's saying
that it might be politically savvy for you to be to express humility if you absolutely must
yeah express humility then i guess go ahead and do that seem to be kind of the vibe going on there
i think yeah it was sort of a take pride in your accomplishments sort of feel and i think one of
reasons it probably talked to me more back then was because i had i was closer to high school
and in high school there's a lot of like you know you get nerd shamed or at least back in my day you
did you know nerds are totally except now in yosh you know what 19 they control the world now so now
they pick on jocks in high school is this how it works i think they get the robots to beat them up
oh sweet we didn't have robots back in my day you couldn't just like flash your iPhone at someone
and stun them i think it is i think it's partly a cultural shift too i think it's only been recently
and i guess i'm not super into the community or the cutting edge but you know i talk with people
in the rationalist community who are working on trying to find like non-asshole ways of saying
yes i'm successful and it's because of rationality like that's that's a to in edges at least to the
community that i'm i'm involved with directly that's sort of a new position like you know you
don't want to be i don't know saying yes i'm doing well or something right and you know to give it
credit to this i think that's kind of where we this post was going is like hey if you guys start
kicking ass because you go to cognitive sciences and binds it biases and stuff uh don't feel ashamed
to plug the old rationality thing i think a lot of that was just beat into i don't know us in general
but me anyway in high school the you know don't display your smartness because you'll get punished
and this is like saying you know what fuck it that's a lot of religious communities too there's
like the whole idea about how you're not supposed to take credit for things you have done because
god did it and nobody's better than anybody else because we're all children of god yeah i gotta
say that that maddens me a lot whenever i see some of that sentiment you know isn't god great
this happened and i know we've been railing on religion lately maybe we're on a kick but i i
don't like that sentiment because you never see it in reverse and it's like oh man god sucks he
just killed all those babies in new orleans because that's not god's fault but the response to it is
when people give money and time and run out there to go help that's god helping like no that's people
helping we don't make the weather we just we we help and i i love that there's a charitable
interpretation of this sentiment like look for god in the human response that sounds like a you know
almost uh mr rogers vibe right and that's super wholesome and friendly like no no look for look
for kindness in the response to tragedy and that sort of stuff i like that yeah but attributing it
to an agent rather than like taking taking it from the person um that sounds like a drag yeah there's
ways it can be um phrased in such a way like i like that mr rogers rogers e phrasing um but i'd
have like seen it really explicitly being used to rebuke young people for being too uh high and mighty
oh yeah and again like i'm thinking about like specifically uh um i don't know so there's some
religions that seems to be the more uh fundamentalist ones like i don't know if it may be because i'm
trying to figure out where this kind of egalitarian instinct maybe comes from i feel like psychologically
there might be something useful or there might have been if uh and you're in like a pretty scarce
society to tell people don't like push yourself up as being higher than the rest of the community
because they need everybody to be you know to be prioritizing the community not that i'm trying to
say that i disagree with the post either but i'm just trying to figure out where it came from
you know this is on my mind because we were literally just talking about harry potter before
the show started which uh if you are a patreon sponsor you can hear it's for our patreon it's
only in the extras bits uh but we this we were saying like how some people really hate harry
at the at the beginning of harry potter the message of rationality right and like i even knew
someone who very nerdy good friend of mine very smart started reading it and was like harry potter
is such a little asshole he's like a jerk and he's all arrogant and jumped up and when we were
talking about this just now i was like harry potter was fully embracing the tsukunari tai versus
egalitarian instinct he was like i'm you know here's some things i'm good at there's certain
kinds of smartness and i'm happy about it and proud about it and i'm not going to like hide it
and try to pretend that i'm a muggle there was a great line in the latter part of the book it was
during one of the wars when it was just him and neville versus harmonies army and the rest of
of chaos legion was fighting dragon army and he was like what am i supposed to be the last person
in the school to notice how awesome i am which is about as arrogant as he gets but this was like
i think i brought this up with um in my undergraduate uh uh psych major i had to take an abnormal
psych class which was like the whatever psychological diagnoses for disorders and stuff
and it was like one of those stadiums eating things there's like two three hundred people and
i was conscious of in the balcony because i was up there and i'd be raising my hand to ask questions
and the teacher was you know was willing to engage me shouting over the balcony and one of the
questions i asked was like narcissism or something narcissistic personality disorder and i was like
what if you really just are as awesome as you think you are like was isek newton a narcissist i mean
he'd probably been a nightmare to interact with but he he basically was as bad as maybe as he
thought he was right yeah so like is is is the grandiosity is the delusion of grandiosity
a necessary requirement for this disorder and i i think i don't remember what the answer was probably
depends like if it's ruining your life is basically when it's a problem okay or when it's
making everyone else hate you which i guess would ruin your life yeah um that that friend of mine i
think she specifically didn't like harry because he talked back to adults i've heard that from a
