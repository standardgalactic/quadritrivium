um but he has a uh steakhouse that he runs and michael bolton wanted to like be a partner in it
so that he could finally destroy kenny logins because kenny logins has a chain of restaurants
and he's super jealous and so he's like we'll do this and together we'll destroy kenny logins
i think michael bolton in everything i've seen him in he plays the guy that he is in the um
the lonely island music video yes he plays that guy i think that's who he is in real life and it
makes me really like him as a person so michael bolton seems great um that's my super rambling
stuff might maybe not all that would make the air and just that's what i have enough to
nothing too exciting i don't have any video game stuff so you guys got my random tv and movie plugs
i enjoy listening to you talk about them even though i haven't watched most of these i don't
i don't consume a lot of traditional media i don't anymore i can use a lot of mainstream media so
tv and movies yeah reading for me is an investment that i try i try to read but i'm not a i complain
about being not a fast reader i know there's ways to fix that and i could just you know power through
i don't know if there is i've been reading a lot since i was seven or younger maybe and i'm
still not a fast reader but i guess maybe the way i could actually do it is dedicate solid chunks
rather than like it took me from saturday to today to finish uh saturday's chapter of ward
i mean that's just i'm reading it like in my spare minutes if i just set aside a 45 minute
window i'm sure i could have read this whole thing which i should probably start doing because
how do you feel about podcasts i can't remember if you like them or not i mean um
hate podcasts everyone who makes them no uh audiobooks audiobooks i love um because you
can convert the text of things to speech i've tried that i did that as an experiment during the
what event 2008 maybe 2012 debates they have some pretty good voices out there now i like
inflection is always wrong though i did it with the debates for fun because i wanted just to remove
all of the emotion and enunciation and this is how you feel and just get the raw text yeah
and i thought that was kind of okay um the the debate i was talking about intelligent squared
with the ai versus the human one of the major feelings of the ai was that it sounded not like
a human it did not know what things to stress what words to stress what sentences to linger on
and that really made its argument weaker even though i i guess it shouldn't the it's the facts
or the facts regardless but the way it was delivered just made it uncompelling there was a
at one of the the james randy annual conferences i went to the the amazing meetings they were called
there was um i always wanted to go to a tam they were okay uh seth fairy child that sounds right
and he was a politician and he gave he works for like the secular and that alliance one of these
and he gave some 45 minute rousing speech and at the end people were like standing and clapping
and i'm i felt really moved and i was like wait a minute this is like a political speech this
worked perfectly and i noticed as it was happening like how weird that was and then a few years later
sam harris was talking on his podcast about how like bizarre it would be to have like martin
luther king jr like over for dinner and have him talk at the table like he does in front of a microphone
he's like that would that would be crazy unerving right that's not how human talks but that's how
you grab an audience um and so yeah i think part of that would be lost translating stuff like this
i tried that like i said as an experiment with the debates and the 2000 whatever's um i don't
know doing that with something like ward i feel like takes a lot of stuff out of it yeah i mean
like on one hand uh i have found that there's some pretty natural sounding uh readers out there that
you can find but but then like i also am thinking like yeah but i wouldn't do it with ward because
i really like ward it's like the things that i like that invested in not a story yeah what i
generally do is just at the end of the night when i'm winding down i'll read in bed before i go to
sleep and that generally gives me a good 30 to 40 minutes and then i just kind of like drift
out to sleep really easily it's it's kind of works on two levels you know it gives me more
reading time and it makes falling sleep super easy yeah if i was more disciplined i would do that
instead of browse write it for 40 minutes before bed so i deliberately looking at a backlit screen
just for bed sir this is bad it's got the blue light shift and all that stuff i know but still
and i fall asleep immediately anyway i've never had any difficulty falling asleep so i deliberately
don't read before bed or i try not to because i'll end up just continuing to read and not actually
go to sleep really good yeah oh my god the monster borrow cormorant i just read so fucking good oh
what's that it's it's the second uh novel by steve dickinson so it's you should read the first one
before you read this one but you know i'm gonna be writing up a a review on it pretty soon it's
just it's a fantastic piece about revenge and and the limits of what you can force yourself to do
before you lose humanity and even if you're like doing it for a good cause and for an important
purpose just pushing yourself into these situations you do it for long enough and you stop
being a human that that is worth to have around anymore that sounds like it's actually addressing
a cool question yeah it's i mean set dickinson is fucking amazing he's i don't think he
self identifies as rationalist i call him a rationalist he's at the very least rationalist
adjacent he this is this is a uh like flintlock setting early gunpowder has just recently been
vented right and uh the main character describes hash functions in a way that's relatable to the
audience and makes sense in that setting and and just uses it as part of the narration i was like
this is brilliant i need to read this yeah it's a way of it's a way of describing how humans are
always alone and can never fully emotionally collect with each other because our actions
are hash functions of the of our beliefs and and emotions and things inside our head and we can only
like display like i'm crying or or these are my actions but it doesn't ever fully get from inside
your head to inside the other person's head and i'm like this is brilliant i had a a very long or
very short it's hard to tell analysis of that in my own head when i was on lsd one time that's that
exact same thing that like man i can never really any like you'll think you communicate it they'll
say they understand and you think they probably do but like you you never know and they probably
don't right because they can't because it's only inside your head but you can understand
a model of it and that's you try to make that as as accurate as possible um that sounds interesting
i feel like writing like i've actually felt like writing is basically a form of telepathy i mean as
long as you're not doing the unreliable narrator thing right but i think you can get pretty close
to what people are thinking by reading particularly like their blog or their journal yeah we talked
about it that a bit when you're reading that person on i'm assuming this facebook or something
they wrote that you know three sentences in the next paragraphs where the gtp2 um yeah you had the
model and you were you know reading their mind through what you thought were their words yeah
that's kind of cool all right so that sounds good to me we've got a patron to think this week
i think i did the last one but i don't know who's keeping score but our you know what we still
haven't done a lot of this feedback that's piling up oh god we promised with this was going to be a
our next episode will be a feedback episode this time it is really good too this time we mean it
yeah well this time it worked out because the gtp2 news just kind of came out in the last couple
what few days and about a week ago and uh alexander wales was available to be our guests
tonight so yeah we'll have feedback on next time for sure this week's patron is jason musgrave
i know jason musgrave really awesome oh cool cool all right thank you jason musgrave i didn't know
you listened to the show have fun yeah maybe another jason musgrave but probably not right
right that's awesome thanks we really appreciate it and thank you to all our patrons you really
make this feel more meaningful and i don't listen to it too like we were talking about yeah you know
this this is not no work it's not a ton but it's it's a bit and you know if if we were literally
talking to nobody this wouldn't be worth doing so thanks for listening if you like what you're
listening to you can leave us a writing review on itunes it also helps spread the word definitely
you can plug this anywhere you know if something i i i enjoy seeing the occasional reference to
like our interview with kassi come up on the methods of rationality subreddit
when people are like is there a word of god on when this happened it's like oh i know that like
on the beige and conspiracy podcast you talk about this i love seeing little plugs and it's not like
just not just from my ego but that's also people find out about stuff but also helps for the ego
too yeah i think i was listening to we've got worm reward and somebody said they found out about
worm from the youtube comment section of some random video huh and so like you know you plug
you talk about what you like wherever you want you might share something that you like with
somebody who you never would have had a chance to talk to about it so that too
all right thank you everybody yeah we'll see you in a couple weeks yeah goodnight everybody thanks
we're lgbtj sometimes
you
