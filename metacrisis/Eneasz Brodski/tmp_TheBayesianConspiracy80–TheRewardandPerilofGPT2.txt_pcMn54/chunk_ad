that's been overlaid all this time, that it's hard to imagine how, like, we could take that away
from you now, we put your brain in a vat, and you'd be like, I still have stuff, I have thoughts,
whatever, because you have all that architecture still in that brain. I think a sense of self is
like having a history. If, you know, we took you and made you a brain in a vat, you'd still have
memories of your life up till now. And GPT two doesn't have memory. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's
more distinct way what I was trying to get at. Memory would absolutely have to be vital, too.
Yeah. Yeah, but you could hook it up to memory. Which might make it conscious.
My knowledge of computer science is not good enough that I could say how you would do that,
but you could you could hook it up in a way that it would have a history of its own actions.
Yeah, but you don't you'd have to alter a lot of things about how it works, because, like, it
it has a top K parameter of how many tokens it looks at in the past. And it gets kind of
bad. It gets kind of bad at text generation, if that's too big at the moment. I mean, I think
the default is like, it looks like 40, 40, like words in the past. And if you set it to, like,
look an infinite number of words in the past, and you just help to keep generating, it gets
weird pretty quickly. I've heard it likened to sort of a dream state with mines, the way it
meanders. And you said earlier, too, that it tends to lose its drift and just go things. Does it
feel at all like a dreaming mind to you? Yeah, it does. In kind of a different way
to a dream, I guess. Like, I can see sometimes, or I can, well, okay, I can think that I see
how it got from one thing to the next, right, how it how how that drift happened within it.
Because it does, I was doing the magic items thing. And it said something about a blizzard,
right. And it was describing this magical item and included the word blizzard. And then it
starts a new paragraph about Blizzard, the gaming company. So it is, it is like sort of drifting
from related words and related concepts in the way that is similar to dream.
That way, it sounds more just like a drunk person than a dreaming person. My dreams tend to be way
less coherent than that even. Like, it's just like, I'm at school, then I was at work. And then I was,
you know, there were zombies, then there weren't. And, you know, like, and there's no continuation
or like no, no reference to like, wait, weren't there zombies three minutes ago? Like, nothing
like that happens in the dreams that I can remember. Someone who was, well, I still know the person,
he's no longer going through a schizophrenic break. But I knew him when he was. And it was really
interesting, like reading some of his writings at the time, they start out, you know, coherent and
with an idea. And any time any within any span of like eight words or so, there's a coherent idea.
But by the time you get to the end of a sentence, nothing makes sense anymore. It's lost track of
itself. So you can see how like, from word to word, everything kind of makes sense and
chains along, but it gets you nowhere. It's nonsensical speak by the end.
Yeah, my experience with GPT two has been that a lot of the time it it's easy to read
humaneness into it, I guess. Scott McCloud is a comics author, and he wrote understanding
comics, and basically said that if you have two dots, and then like a curved line underneath it,
people will read that as a face, right? Because that's just how people are. We will, we'll just,
the simplest thing we'll just read as a face to us, because that's what's most important to us.
And I think that happens a lot when reading its sentences, you're like trying to find the meaning
in it. Whereas there's not always, you have to keep in mind that it's not there's not like a human
connected up to this that was expressing a thought. A lot of its sentences are grammatically correct
sentences, and then you read them and your brain is sort of trying to draw a context for what it,
what was meant by that. Trying to put intentionality there where there isn't any.
Yeah, like, I think communication is really a two person kind of thing where there's not just
the talk or there's the listener interpreting to, because a friend of mine posted on Facebook,
like, two or three lines about GPT two, and then another three paragraphs below that. And like,
I was kind of following him at first by the time I got to the third paragraph, I was like,
I guess either he's misunderstanding something or I'm misunderstanding something because I don't,
I don't get what he's saying here. But I was like, this is a pretty smart guy. I trust him on most
things. I just must not get it, you know, and I just kept going, like, interesting opinion, I will,
I will maybe look into it again some more later, ask him about it. And then the final line of his
status of Facebook update was the I wrote the first three lines, everything else was written
by GPT two. And I was like, son of a bitch. If I hadn't been like, reading into it, trying to get
intentionality and humanness out of that, I probably would have noticed. But the fact that I was just
kind of like, on autopilot and assuming he was saying something good was it did a lot of the work
for it. Well, I think they have a mental model of the person and what they usually kind of sound
like to fill in the gaps where this was sounding like not quite their style or something. Yeah.
That's pretty funny. Although I'm now imagining kind of the other side of the argument that I was
making with you before in Yash, where we're, you know, well, yes, there's words, there's no
intentionality behind it. I kind of imagine like the beginning of the first XM movie, where like
Congress, whatever that, the first one movie X men movie, where like, there's that government
committee sitting there talking about like, you know, mutant rights and stuff. And I can imagine
like, people in suits, making arguments, but like, yes, there's words, but there's no intentionality
behind these things like talking, like talking about like, well, those things as it wants rights
now. So I can imagine a lot of these things. I just, I had this picture in my head kind of above
of that. Yeah. Yeah, we should like to the post this article that Yash found humans who are not
concentrating or not general intelligences. Yeah. I think the overall gist of that was that you
can't actually tell whether GPT two is a human or not. If you're just skimming the text,
and a lot of what we do, I think it was not just us reading as humans,
but also like us communicating. Sometimes we're not actually putting like,
a large amount of intentionality into what we're doing. Some, some like speeches kind of
just there to be filler. A lot of it is like, I acknowledge you, you're human. Yeah. We don't use
those words, but that's basically it. And they're like, yeah, if you weren't really concentrating,
you're just kind of an AI running on an autopilot. I could relate to that a lot. I mean, I got a
haircut today and I explained, I explained, eh, I exchanged pleasantries with the person who was
cutting my hair. And I, you know, that wasn't a, that wasn't a real conversation. That was just,
you know, noises that made at each other just so that we could do business, you know,
that person could have been GPT two and you wouldn't have noticed. And at that moment, I was GPT
two. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When I do edit a GPT two, find that really, I find that really difficult
because like my mind will just skimp past the stuff that's not quite right. It's hard to catch
spelling errors. It's hard to catch like grammar errors because my mind will just auto correct it
to what it's supposed to be or what is the most logical thing for it to be. And then I will post
a chapter and people will be like, Oh, here, here are like 20 errors that like you read this thing
three times. I've had similar experiences. And they're the most blatant easy errors,
you know, like at one point I had a name wrong. And what the fuck? Cause I knew what was supposed
to be there. My brain was just like, Nope, that's the right name right there. Yeah, that's the fun
thing about this. We've got like a predictive machine trying to, you know, error correct another
predictive machine. It's kind of the whole like the Paris and DD springtime error where our own
brains will smooth out errors when we're reading stuff. So it's hard to catch them.
Yeah. Yeah. So I try to keep that in mind when when reading GPT two, and what it writes is that
it like I tried to use the editing mindset to sort of see what it's actually doing because
it's very easy to convince yourself that it's a person, I guess, with, you know, actual thoughts
and your mind is just smoothing out everything that it's done. And a lot of I think the examples
that people post not in the paper in the paper, they did non cherry picked examples for the most
part. But a lot of the stuff that people generate with it, they'll just pick the, you know, they'll
try to get it into a mode where it's doing exactly what they want. And then you get the cherry
picked stuff back with some smoothing from that too. So I think it can sometimes look more impressive
than it is, even if it's still really impressive. If that makes sense. Yeah, totally.
Dude, I want to, I want to feed GPT to the entire corpus of Chuck Tingles works and then see if it
can produce another one. Because that would be amazing. Yeah, I do worry about a lot of authors
being put out of jobs, not for like the filler stuff, whatever that that's, but like creative works.
There was a, there's Kurt Vonnegut novel where he talks about that for architecture,
where you just feed it in like a bunch of parameters and it will make you a new architectural work
with none of the, none of the effort required and it'll be just as original and beautiful as
what a person can do. And then the that's just like the end of architecture as a profession.
And I think about that for authorship, because I, you know, I love to write, but
I don't see how anyone would get value from it if you could just get the same quality stuff.
Like, regardless of whether it's general intelligence or not, or if it has any other
applications beyond that, if it can just generate works, you know, I don't, I mean,
certainly at this stage, there's no way it could generate any like high concept stuff,
because I think there's some things that you have to actually understand what you're speaking
about to speak about it. But on the other hand, a lot of the stuff that people read and that's
put online is, I mean, I know there's a military sci-fi that's like this. I know there's urban
fantasy like this. I, I use chuck tingle as an example, because a lot of erotica is like this.
It's really just the same thing repackaged and mixed up a little bit every single time. And
it's, it's, it's entertainment product, right? You read it, you have some fun, you enjoy yourself.
But that kind of stuff with like some more refining several million dollars and another
year of work on this. And I think the, the AI could replace all the human authors who are
right now just, you know, churning out eight, nine, 10 books a year that don't really do much
of anything except provide some cheap thrills. Or maybe some of like the easy filler stuff,
like, you know, like Robert Jordan describing landscapes and tapestries and clothes in a
wheel of time or like George R. R. Martin describing food. Like you don't have to know
anything about food to sit there and be like, okay, cool, savory, juicy, whatever. And, you know,
like, I think the wheel of time is 11,000 pages long, or wait, 11,000 pages. That sounds about
right. It could be seven if you cut out the descriptions of clothes and tapestries, right?
But even just things like, you know, basic character arcs and fun action scenes and people
like meeting friends. I mean, there's enough of it out there that's just written in mass that it
could, it could easily do something like that with some time. Is that a big loss though? If we
lose the lowest quality work? Someone who's attempting to earn their livelihood. I mean,
like, I don't want to take someone's livelihood, but I also want UBI. And I think that people
shouldn't have to be these kind of like machines that create low quality work in order to get food
on the table. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's, it's, for me, it's less the food on the table argument,
but the like creative impulse, right? Because who, if, if machines can produce serviceable
erotica, right? And, and it's customizable because you can, you can, you know, fine tune
the prompt that you're giving it. And it's unique every time. There are a lot of people who,
you know, that's what they, if they had UBI, that's what they would be doing. They would be
writing, you know, not very great stuff, you know, lowest 50% quality kind of filler stuff,
but they have fun doing it and they like sharing with people. And then that just all disappears
because machines can do it better. And I don't know, are people really going to go for like
bespoke written work? But they won't need to. I mean, if the person's doing it for fun, then
they're doing it for fun. If they're not doing it to make money, then like they're going to make
it for themselves because they think it's fun and show it to their friends. And I still don't
think anything is lost because the machine can do it better. Like,
kind of yes and no, though. Like I, I don't do this show because people listen to it,
but if I knew that nobody listened to it, I would probably wouldn't do it anymore.
Yeah. When, when you write things, having other people read it is a large part of the joy,
even if it's just your friends, you know? Any for friends are talking about how they're
treating GP two fives latest book and it was way more engaging than yours. And it's like, oh,
well, shoot. I don't know. I mean, fan fiction is still really popular and there's like, it's,
it's not maybe good in the way that like, you know, a professional novelist's work is good,
but there's still something interesting about it. And I think especially because like you do
find it circulating around communities and there's no authors and like I would read my friends
fiction, even if it wasn't very good. If my friend was like, you know, I wrote this and I'd like to
know what you think about it or whatever. I think there's like a social aspect to it that I don't
think GPT two is going to do away with because you don't really care about like, you know,
you're not going to like follow GPT two in people magazine or like, Oh, what are they doing? You
know, and we still have to listen to vinyl. So like, there'll always be that like desire for
like the old vintage stuff that people used to enjoy five years ago, right? So yeah,
it actually wouldn't be that hard to eliminate podcasts, like the lowest common.
All you would need is like some transcripts and just text to speech. I mean, the technology is not
there, but you know, five, 10 years. Yeah, we'll better the job. I think there's some YouTube
channels that are like that already. Oh, there actually are. Oh, yeah, they're there. Oh, there's
some crazy the automated. You know what? That's a whole other topic, but there's like automated
programs that make videos for kids. Oh, God. Oh, I saw a thing about this on Reddit. Yeah,
there's a great Ted talk about it. If it's what I'm thinking of for like, it's bizarrely sexual
and stuff. I mean, some can get there on accident. Yeah. I mean, a lot of it is just, it's just the
recycled crap that three year olds love, but it can go in bizarre places because the machines
have no idea what they're doing. I imagine making just like standard lather rinse repeat episodes
of like teletubbies would be remarkably easy for a computer to do it and in today's tech, right? So
yeah, it'd be hard to imagine paying people to get in puffy suits to do that shit anymore
when you could just do CGI ones for a fraction of the cost and make them every three seconds.
And they take 30 minutes to watch. So yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, wild stuff.
I realized I have some dead air going on. I'm just thinking about three year olds being entertained
by these algorithms that any adult could see are just dumb, but three year olds really like them.
And how different is a three year old from like a souped up GPT to that? Plus, I mean, like,
not to put down people who enjoy some games, but like they make a new call duty every single year
and it's exactly like the last one. We like some amount of repetition as humans. Dude, I have sex
like at a rate that is less than more than zero. And it's not that different from time to time.
You know, a few things change up, but somehow I'm just liking those same motions over and over. It's
weird. All right. Tell Tubby's first person shooter video games sex. I definitely see how we
how we seem like GPT to robots jumping from from topic to topic.
What's your schedule like? Alexander, are we I think we're over your time. We had some delays
getting started here. Oh, no, I'm fine. I don't have that much more to add. As far as
observations or yeah, like what I've seen it do, or what the paper implies that the better version
of it can do. How long do you think until we get something like really souped up that'll
that'll make people question? I guess people are already questioning was this written by
an AI or a human but like that'll make people question does this AI know what it's saying?
Yeah, well, who doesn't know what it's saying that I think we're quite a ways from a lot of a lot
of there are a lot of expert systems right now like a lot of sports articles are just written
by computer already. And a lot of a lot of business articles to which is especially concerning
because there are also robots that read these business articles and make trading decisions
based on it. At some point humans will be out of financial loop entirely. Well, I mean, we're already
we're already getting painfully close to that. There was a there was a flash crash of the market
that was pinned on high frequency trading algorithms. It was like two years ago, right?
That happened in yeah, it wasn't anything that happened in like the fundamentals of the market.
It was just robots trading back and forth and then they like started panic selling of the robots
were it's just this this emergent system that has that not that much relationship to anything
that's actually happening. But yeah, there are business articles that are written by robots and
