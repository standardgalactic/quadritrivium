You are pledging to give 10%
unless you're a student or working part-time,
in which case it scales down to 1%.
So I get away with it that past year,
but now I'm looking forward and I'm like,
well, I still need to give to these charities
that are not on the list of the most effective charities.
And that I still really care about
and I still work hard to benefit them and their causes.
I think that's why it's an effective signal,
because it is costly and hard to fake.
I am not a giving what we can pledged person
because I'm not sure of my financial situation,
but I do admire people who are,
because I realize 10% is a fair chunk of change.
Yeah, also, I don't...
Is it still...
Dude, can I still fulfill the pledge
if at the last minute somebody gives me a bunch of money
and then I give all of that to charity?
Probably.
I believe the US government does consider gifts to be income
and they tax it as such.
So if you got a bunch of income as a gift
and then you donated it, then yes.
It counts as your donation.
I must be thinking of a different scale then
because I seem to remember one,
and this was a proposal that I read about years ago,
but it was something like 1% for bottom,
for poor people in nice countries
and up to a third of people earning over a million dollars.
So I thought that was the giving what you can,
but I'm thinking of a different one that does scale with income.
The whole point was you put in how much you earned,
and it would do some back-end calculation
that they'd worked out in advance,
and it would tell you,
if you're making $5 million a year,
you can probably afford to live off of 67% of that.
Whereas if you're making $10,000 a year,
you can probably not afford to live on 67% of that.
So anyway, different things, but...
Yeah, I think the idea behind this particular pledge,
giving what you can, is that anybody can do it.
I know that when I was in middle school
and we were doing budgets,
off of just a high school education,
future budgets, you have a high school education,
you get a job as a secretary or a receptionist.
I remember I was finding one that was $12,000 a year,
and the rule was you donate,
I believe it was 12% of your income to charity,
and that's non-negotiable.
And I remember asking,
I'm having trouble buying the food
or finding an apartment that I can afford.
Can I change the charity level? No.
Why wouldn't they let you change the charity level?
Our teacher just wouldn't let us change the charity level.
Yeah, but why?
Because that was the unnecessary,
lowest charity amount was 12% of your income.
Okay.
So if more people had gone through Mr. Bunnell's class,
then they might have understood.
That strikes me as an atypical position to take
with middle school budgeting.
I can honestly say,
not only have I never given 12% of my income in one year to anyone,
I don't think I know anyone who has either,
with the possible exception of Katrina.
So now I do.
But yeah, that's a lot of money.
I always do,
but it really helps that I haven't had high paying jobs.
I don't know, I think that makes it harder because...
In terms of percentage.
Yeah, because the less you make,
the more that money means to you.
For other people.
Yeah, some people are in a situation
where they need to save for retirement.
It's like if you can put away 10% a year
so that you don't have to die the month that you quit working
when you're 75,
that's one reason to not give everything.
And that's sort of a tricky spot too, right?
So one of the other classical comebacks
to effective altruism,
or I guess to extreme giving in general,
is should I give this now,
or should I wait to give it later?
Especially if I want to put it in compound interest
for 40 years, et cetera, et cetera.
There's something to be said for that if you feel like,
yes, I will actually budget this
and I will actually commit to giving,
and I can make a big difference later.
But there's also the thing to consider
that there are people dying now that you can help.
Also, your money given now
is worth more to those charities than later.
Yeah.
Than the same amount later.
Exactly.
Well, I think the goal was
that they'd give something more later or something.
If Warren Buffett had given his first million dollars,
he couldn't give his 31 billion dollars that he's given.
This is the case that worked out.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, if you're as good of an investor
and business person as Warren Buffett, hold on to it.
Oh, it's no it is.
Even if you have to wait 30 years,
if you can give 1,000 times what you're planning on giving,
that's awesome.
But since almost no one fits in that slot there,
that's something to consider.
If you have a low-risk course already set out,
like generally going into, well,
from back when I was going to college,
this was the case.
I hear it's not quite the case anymore,
but it used to be the case that if you go into college,
that is worth your four years of time and money
to sink all of that into college
because you will make so much more for having the college degree
than using that money to donate to effective charities instead.
Because you would be doing less good overall with your life
if you don't get that college degree.
Inyash, you mentioned in a previous episode
that any moral system that requires you to really super
disadvantage yourself is not going to catch on.
That's another reason that I think that they're
capping it at 10%.
Not capping it like you can't give more than 10%,
but having the demand be no more than 10%.
As long as we're speaking about the 10% thing,
Scott Alexander wrote a post called,
Nobody is Perfect, Everything is Commensurable.
Commensurable?
Is that how you pronounce it?
Which this post was aimed at the people
who are the typical Singarian people
very concerned that they're not spending their entire lives
just helping other people.
Racked with guilt that they are not doing everything he can.
His argument is really 10% is enough, guys.
Donate 10%, call yourself a good person,
and get on with your life.
Because you can give more if you want to,
but once you've given 10%, you're good enough.
And his argument was, I'm just going to read this verbatim
because it's Scott Alexander.
He's already written it as good as can be written.
A world in which everyone gives 10% of their income to charity
is a world where about $7 trillion go to charity a year.
Solving global poverty forever is estimated cost
about $100 billion a year for the couple decade length of the project.
That's about 2% of the money that would suddenly become available.
If charity got $7 trillion a year,
the first year would give us enough to solve global poverty,
eliminate all treatable diseases,
fund research into the untreatable ones
for approximately the next forever,
educate anybody who needs educating,
feed anybody who needs feeding,
fund an unparalleled renaissance in the arts,
permanently save every rainforest in the world,
and have enough left over to launch
five or six different manned missions to Mars.
That would be the first year.
If you give 10% per year,
you have absolutely done your part in making that world a reality.
You can honestly say,
well, it's not my fault that everyone else is still dragging their feet.
And that is one of those posts that makes me want to give 10%
because I want to be part of that project.
Yeah.
Just to come to the defense of the Singarian position
and Peter Singer's arguments in general,
his arguments sort of lead you down this daisy chain to where
unless you're comp...
He uses the phrase, at least in his original 70s essay,
sacrificing something of comparable moral worth.
He says that unless you're doing that,
you're not...
You're essentially valuing whatever it is you're buying instead
over saving humans.
So that's the slippery slope that slides you
all the way down to the poorest person in the country, right?
But his practical proposals aren't that extreme.
And so the people might still be wracked with guilt
because they realize that they can't live up to the impossible
Peter Singer utilitarian standard.
But yeah, he advocates for 10% mainly because he, I think, believes that
the number of people that he can get to give 10%
is more than the number of people that he can get to give 98%.
