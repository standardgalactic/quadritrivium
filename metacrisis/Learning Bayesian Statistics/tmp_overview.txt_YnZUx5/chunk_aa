Processing Overview for Learning Bayesian Statistics
============================
Checking Learning Bayesian Statistics/#107 Amortized Bayesian Inference with Deep Neural Networks, with Marvin Schmitt.txt
1. **Marvin Zhang's Background**: Marvin is a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, working on deep learning and Bayesian optimization. He previously earned a Master's degree in machine learning from UCLA and has experience with generative AI models.

2. **Project "Very Risky Thing"**: Marvin is currently working on a project involving generative AI models to create new content or models that might be considered too risky to develop otherwise. This project requires careful consideration of ethical implications and potential impacts.

3. **Collaboration Invitation**: Marvin invited listeners to collaborate with him on his project, emphasizing the importance of a diverse team and interdisciplinary approach.

4. **Dinner with a Scientific Mind**: If given the opportunity to have dinner with any great scientific mind, Marvin would choose Ada Lovelace, the first programmer who wrote the first algorithm intended to be carried out by machinery but never saw a completed machine to run it on. He is interested in understanding what she would think about today's technology and what her next leap of creativity would be.

5. **Learning Bayesian Statistics**: Marvin emphasized the importance of understanding Bayesian statistics, not just for its mathematical aspects but also for its practical applications in machine learning and decision-making under uncertainty.

6. **Show Notes and Resources**: The show notes will contain additional resources about today's topics, and Marvin will provide more information to help listeners dive deeper into the subject matter.

7. **Support the Show**: Listeners are encouraged to support the podcast through Patreon for exclusive benefits and to rate, review, and follow the show on their favorite podcatcher.

8. **Themes of the Podcast**: The podcast aims to help listeners achieve a "true patient state of mind" by understanding Bayesian statistics and applying it to real-world scenarios.

9. **Music Credits**: The theme music for the podcast is "Good Bayesian" by Bababringtman, fit MC Lance, and Megaram.

10. **Social Media and Support**: Follow Marvin on Twitter at alexunderscoreandorra, support the show on Patreon at patreon.com, and visit LearnBasedStats.com for more resources.

In summary, Marvin Zhang shared his expertise in deep learning and Bayesian optimization, invited listeners to collaborate on a project involving generative AI models, and discussed the profound impact of having dinner with Ada Lovelace, all while emphasizing the importance of understanding Bayesian statistics for practical applications in modern decision-making processes.
