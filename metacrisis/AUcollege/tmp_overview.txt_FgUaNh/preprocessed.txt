Checking AUcollege/Session I Deep Inference with Karl J  Friston.txt
1. **Session Closure**: Carl Edwards concluded his presentation on generative models in active inference, emphasizing the importance of updating beliefs based on new data while considering prior beliefs to avoid overfitting. The discussion touched upon the balance between different sources of information and the need for sophistication in generative models to account for agents' understanding of each other's representations.

2. **Question from Bill**: Bill posed the "owl problem," which highlights the challenge of detecting deception, as owls are intelligent enough to know that prey may hide but also rely on prey revealing themselves. This ties into the concept of cooperation versus competition and the complexity of generative models needed to represent such scenarios.

3. **Carl's Response**: Carl referenced the "stag hunt paradigm" and mentioned that the sophistication of generative models must account for agents' understanding of each other's intentions, which involves a high level of recursion in modeling beliefs about others' beliefs about you, etc.

4. **Evolutionary Stable Strategies**: Carl mentioned the work of Jean-Lou Duval, who found that stable evolutionary strategies often require a mix of sophisticated and non-sophisticated agents within a population. This prevents the issue of "leapfrogging" where deceptive strategies could escalate out of control.

5. **Open Issues**: Carl pointed out that while there may not be formal work within active inference on these topics, the principles of balancing complexity and accuracy in models are relevant to understanding deception and cooperative behaviors.

6. **Further Discussion**: The session closed with thanks to Carl for his presentation and an invitation for further discussion during the break. The topic of quantum biology and how quantum models can be applied to biological systems was also mentioned as a potential area for exploration.

7. **Action Items for Carl**: To explore the concepts of deception, firefighter problems, von Neumann architecture, and other related topics that were touched upon in the discussion.

Overall, the session highlighted the complexity of modeling human behavior and decision-making, especially when considering aspects like deception and cooperation. The interplay between prior beliefs, new data, and model sophistication is crucial in understanding these behaviors within computational psychiatry and beyond.
