Welcome to the Integral Investing podcast entitled Deep Ocean Mining and Decarbonization.
Abundant clean energy is central to the decarbonization of the global economy, as we all know.
But the production of wind, solar and geothermal power as well as energy storage requires massive
amounts of natural resources such as lithium, cobalt, nickel and copper, to name a few.
Unfortunately, the best land ores have already been mined and new resources come from rainforests
and pristine landscapes where mining generates large toxic waste. So the main question remains,
how can humanity close the resource gap to achieve the transition to a decarbonized economy
by 2050? To address this question, I have invited to the podcast Jared Barron,
the CEO and founder of the Metals company that is enabling the battery power shift to clean energy
and electric vehicles with the slightest planetary touch. Jared's mission is to help transition
earth from fossil fuels toward a circular resource economy. Daniel Schmartenberger is
another brilliant thinker who is also joining us today and whom I have interviewed already before,
so please listen to that interview as well. He is the founder of the Civilization Research
Initiative and an internationally recognized strategic advisor on catastrophic risk, exponential
tech and coordination challenges. My co-interviewer today is brilliant system scientist and futurist
Dr. Anilou Smithsman. Full disclosure, I was so impressed with the positive impact of the
Metals company after the interview that I went out and wanted to put my money where my mouth is
and I purchased their stock. Daniel, I'd like to start with you. You're an integral thinker and
you saw something that I could contribute to your journey, our journey, by introducing me to
Jared Barron. I know we had this metacrisis long conversation, but I would still like to invite
you to frame a little bit this conversation from your own perspective so that we could then dive
into Gerard's contribution. Sure. In that conversation that I really enjoyed with you,
and maybe you can link that in the show notes here also, we went in some depth into
what we call the metacrisis assessment and what needs to happen. I won't redo that here,
but just very briefly, the concept of the metacrisis is that there are a lot of
catastrophic and some even existential risks facing humanity currently and in the
years and decades ahead that are novel, that are not things that were facing the world at any time
previously in human history. Obviously, the world has always been at risk of supervolcanoes and
asteroids and things like that, but we were never at risk of AI autonomous weapons issues or nuclear
winter or synthetic bio issues or planetary boundaries. Those are things that require
both, that require either exponential tech or at least very powerful tech like nuclear tech
or industrial tech multiplied by generations of cumulative effects and eight billion people
in the huge amount of resource per capita that is going into the world. Rather than just look at
there's a climate crisis, but there's a lot of other environmental crises. There's ocean
acidification from both climate, but also nitrogen denzones and phosphorus and overfishing and
microplastics and forever chemicals. There was just an article published that the PFOS and PFAS,
the fluorinated surfactants have passed planetary boundaries as defined by the EPA and other
regulatory agencies in rainwater all around the world. There's so many environmental crises.
The planetary boundary framework is a pretty overarching framework to say for the planet to
continue to function well, soil and biodiversity and temperature and many things have to stay
within certain ranges and we're getting very near as the result of industrial technology cumulative
effects over a few centuries and the increasing demand on those. The front side of the materials
economy is take stuff from nature faster than nature can replenish it, which looks like deforestation,
demineralization, soil loss, overfishing, etc., and then turn it into pollution and trash and waste
faster than nature can process it, which looks like all of the toxicity and pollution issues.
To solve that, we have to go to a closed loop of materials economy where we're not taking stuff
from nature or putting stuff into nature faster than natural process. That's a humongous thing.
That does not include all of the risks we face because you can go closed loop and that still
doesn't mean we won't have a nuclear war. It still doesn't mean that we don't create
synthetic bio catastrophes either on accident through lab leaks through gain of function
research and things like that or intentionally through bio weapons or issues associated with AI
nanotech or the more advanced exponential tech, meaning distributed catastrophe weapons for
everyone in a phase where grown weapons and cyber weapons don't take state actors and we're
because of climate change migration, which looks to displace hundreds of millions of people in the
decade ahead. You have a lot more people who will be much more disenfranchised who also have much
more access to do something about that that is catastrophic. So the world's fragile for all of
these reasons. So our basic premise is we are in a phase where and they're all the result of human
technology and the coordination systems because Stone Age people just really can't cause biological
crisis at a planetary level nor can they cause war that messes everything up nor even
externalities that mess everything up. So it really is the result of technology and coordination
failures of managing the technology. We're not going to regress to a low technology civilization.
So we have to get the coordination down where we don't cause excessive externalities in the
process of our technology and that so that's solving the kind of mistake problems and so
that we don't use our technology rivalrously i.e. exponential warfare towards each other.
You could say all of the problems are the result of harm that we cause intentionally. So conflict
theory and harm we cause accidentally. So kind of mistake theory and so but both mediated by
a degree of technological power. So at the level of coordination we have to both work on resolving
underlying sources of conflict and get better at anticipating externalities and mistakes and being
able to internalize those. Your work through Club of Rome obviously looks at things like
the limits of growth and how does a civilization that has an exponential growth requirement on
the financial system where each of those dollars are bound to a materials economy in some ways on
a finite planet keep running forever and then also your work through integral investing saying
in so far as most of the dollars that represent choices in the world are still moving through
the market. Can we think about how we allocate those dollars better? We're not just looking like
GDP by itself isn't a good metric because obviously we know why we thought GDP was a good metric but
GDP goes up during war and with addiction and health issues and lots of things. In the same way
lowering CO2 by itself isn't a good metric because I could lower CO2 by planting a bunch of plants
using more nitrogen fertilizers that cause runoff that cause dead zones and oceans faster.
We need a complex set of metrics that we look at and indices we look at in a growth framework.
So in the entire metacrisis there basically the framework we're proposing is that all of those
catastrophes are design constraints that humanity must meet to have a civilization that continues.
So if we take them all as design constraints and simultaneously we don't want the solution to
the catastrophes to be control mechanisms that are so centralized that they create dystopias.
So we want to avoid catastrophes and avoid dystopias so our focus you know the kind of
thing tank that we run our focus is how do we create a third attractor that is neither
catastrophes neither dystopias what is a necessary and sufficient set of solutions to get there
and that's a huge topic and a lot of things are involved.
And so the reason I'm interested in Gerard's work and the work of
Metalsco and we've been friends for some time now and I thought it would be an
interesting conversation for you guys to have and I was happy to join it is
the obviously climate change is one of the major environmental issues we're facing it's
it's a particularly hard one because if we look at HFCs or CFCs causing those own issues
or if we'd look at fluorinated surfactants used for
you know water proofing things whatever you can or pesticides you can potentially change that
you have to fight uphill against a multi-billion dollar vested industry but you don't have to
fight a pill against industry itself whereas when CO2 as the byproduct of burning hydrocarbons
every single industry requires energy and the transition of the energy process itself is more
fundamental and deep than any particular area so it's huge either we figure out how to transition
off hydrocarbons and produce enough energy well or we have massive problems. The transition off
of hydrocarbons is not trivial because if we make solar cells and the associated battery packs to
deal with interment and sea or whatever else it takes a lot of hydrocarbons to make those and
that thing has to run for 10 years or whatever it is to pay that off based so the energy return on
energy investment so there's a lot of deep issues there I have a series with Nate Hagen's where we
talk about those things in depth so I won't get into them too much depth there but I will say that
there is a very tight correlation between global GDP and global energy use it's been referred to
as the Garrett relation there are some critiques of that specific formulation but from 1970 till
now there's about a 99% correlation between global GDP and global energy use where all the
efficiencies in technology give you about 1% more dollar per joule per year but that 1% increase
in efficiency doesn't change the fact that you still have exponential increase in demand to deal
with the 3% global interest rate on the finance supply so there's an embedded growth obligation
on finance to just even be able to keep up with interest let alone quantitative easing or anything
else that means that there's an embedded growth obligation on the total amount of energy and
that doesn't mean we just have to be able to keep up the amount of energy we have it means we have
to be able to grow the amount of energy obviously that doesn't get a habit forever we have a finite
planets we're going to have to change the whole global financial system that's a huge topic can
be on the scope of this but the transition so either the work to transition off hydrocarbons
is hard right and we're talking about a world that has increasing energy demands if you try
to talk about lowering energy demands you also talk about lowering GDP that has been the stable
post world war two of how we avoid world war three that was a huge part of the post world
war two system the breton wood system is because we can make this global financial system and we
can um exponentiate the monetary supply all the countries can have more stuff they can all have
their own growth imperative without taking each other's stuff as soon as you start to get to a
degrowth situation you have some real hard geopolitics to deal with you have some real hard
that hitting the poor world more than the rich world or you're trying to do redistribution by force
which like all the issues suck so while we deal with some of those deeper issues of the embedded
growth obligation on finance we obviously can't keep doing the hydrocarbon thing for very long
if you have an entire world system that has been running on hydrocarbons both
oil and coal and natural gas that means you have pipelines and you have internal combustion engines
you have an entire infrastructure builds on that if you want to get off that you have to build a
whole new infrastructure you're talking about electric motors and batteries rather than
internal combustion and gas you're talking about electrification of the energy grid and storage
for intermittency so one of the issues becomes that for environmental reasons we want to get
off hydrocarbons but there are environmental things that there are things that have environmental
costs to do that like the metals needed to make all those batteries and the resources to make the
solar cells and the wind plants would ever come from somewhere not only does it take some hydrocarbon
energy to do it but you actually have to take you have to have real metals and real other resources
to do that thing and so if we look at the need to get off hydrocarbon fuels him bind with the need
the inability to lower the energy demand significantly even if we did all the efficiency measures we're
not going to lower it significantly because of all the geopolitical forcing functions then what are
the rate limiting issues that often aren't addressed one of them is that to electrify the entire
transportation fleet is a big deal the transportation fleet now doesn't only produce greenhouse
gases it also is the number one cause of particulate emissions and WHO estimates that maybe
air pollution is the number one leading cause of death as a source of partial attribution worldwide
they recently said that they anticipated that chemical pollution in the atmosphere including
particulate pollution from internal combustion would be the uh greater killer than climate change
in the decade to come so it's like when we're talking about internal combustion we're talking
about problems of oil spills and wars over oil and political destabilization it's associated with
it as well as co2 as well as um particulate emission and all these types of things so it's
not a monofocus and very much ocean health obviously both because of warming and because
of ocean acidification climate change has a massive effect on oceans so if you want the
batteries for electrifying all of the transport and then the energy storage that is needed for
the electrification of the grid from things that have intermittency where do all those minerals
come from the mining of those minerals from surface sources environmentally has real problems
because a lot of those surface sources are
areas that have some of the last remaining critical biodiversity a lot of the or sources
have a lot of unusable co-product that turns into toxic waste and is a major source of problem
for freshwater planetary boundaries which are one of the major ones to hit so when I met Gerard
and heard about their solution which I'll let him share there were a number of things about it that
even though it has some environmental cost looking at the entire life cycle of all of the
environmental costs and the trade-offs that we can't avoid because there are very hard trade-offs
that you may have to face seems like it is an important and critical topic to get a lot more
serious attention and that's why I wanted to have the conversation. Well brilliant so Gerard
you are the CEO founder you're a serial entrepreneur first of all this is where we connected to
and you are the CEO and the founder of the metals company and so tell us you know tell us why why
go the hard way. You're right Mariana it is the hard way because getting a new extractive industry
established at a time where the world is focused on the impact of all extractive industries is
well it's a little counter-intuitive and so what we did is we looked at you know accepting the fact
that the world is going to need a lot more metal and I think that is indisputable if we look at the
international energy agency you know they say by 2040 we'll need between five and six hundred
percent more of these metals to meet the energy needs for the transition so accepting that fact
then we put through the lens of where can they come from you know where is the right place to be
looking for these metals and with the lightest planetary and human touch and we came to the
conclusion that the absolute winner in that race was these like I have in my hand and this being a
polymetallic nodule and of course we know that 70% of the planet is covered in ocean and and this
is why it was so interesting to to blend your integral thinking into this because we can't
look at the ocean without looking at land impacts and we can't be looking at land impacts without
looking at the entire impact of to our planet and so what we started our work on was identifying
you know what are the impacts of collecting this resource and turning it into battery metals and
if you if you go back to our purpose which we published many years ago it came in three steps
and one was to identify where are the lowest impact supply of these battery metals to be found
and we decided that this was the resource to investigate further and and because we don't
have enough metals in the system to allow a pathway to circularity because we do believe
that circularity in the long run will reduce the demand for virginals and so that's where we need
to get to so that step one was to get the lowest impact from a planetary environmental and human
perspective of supply of these metals into the system and step two of our purpose was then to
make sure every single atom that we put into the system stayed there and Daniel coined the phase
phrase atoms as a service meaning let's put the metals in there but let's make sure we get them
back and we can recycle them and and and make sure that they can stay there for many millions of
years to come and then finally when extractive industries slowed down because stage two has
been so successful and we are in a circular economy to make sure that we can repurpose our
land-based infrastructure to recycle other materials because these nodules are abundant in nickel
which is a really important metal for our future copper cobalt and manganese but of course there
are many other metals that don't have the same well aren't the focus of recycling at the moment
but they will be as we head towards circularity so that's where we started and the beauty when
we look at this all body and the reason why it's a little bit it takes a bit of adjustment is of
course you know if you look at 70% of the planet is ocean and the abyssal zone is by far the most
common environment on our planet it's an area at about almost 4 000 meters and beyond below
seawater and this is where these nodules lie and they literally form by precipitating the metals
that are in the seawater or the sediment upon which they sit so they grow a little bit like a
pearl grows by precipitating those metals and and the beauty of that of course is that we
