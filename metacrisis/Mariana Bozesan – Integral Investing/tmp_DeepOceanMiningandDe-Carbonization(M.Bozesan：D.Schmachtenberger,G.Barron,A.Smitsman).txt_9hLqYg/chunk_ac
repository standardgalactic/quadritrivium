and the um end of the waterway where the waste would end up going are one of the most
biodiverse on-surface and land areas in the world so that's just a really critical thing to
you know think think about um we know that when we're talking about fracking or tar sands it's
because the really easy oil has already been mostly used up but nobody would go drill offshore for
oil if there was easy oil onshore nobody would do fracking or tar sands but you use up the easy
stuff and then you get into diminishing returns we're in diminishing returns in hydrocarbons
which is why we're doing that stuff which is another reason we have to switch energy sources quickly
but we're also in diminishing returns on so many sources of metals where the highest grade ores
that were closest to the surface got used up that were easiest to get to the ones that are left or
lower grade ore which means more toxicity or in much harder to get to areas which means
having to penetrate deeper into big rainforests and it's not simply the impact let's say we're
talking about going into Indonesia or into the Amazon for mining assets it's not simply how much
of the rainforest has to be destroyed for the road in and the mine I was talking to some environmental
scientists who are working on planetary boundaries and we're looking at biodiversity
writ large doing meta-analysis on all the biodiversity metrics they said that the single
most critical factor that they have found for biodiversity in terms of if there was one thing
that was going to damage biodiversity the most it's the first road that enters into an otherwise
large virgin area because there is a high initial cost to develop the first road in the initial
infrastructure once that's developed for some purpose there's a lower barrier of entry to
be able to go in for other purposes that don't have quite as high a margin so you can go in for
logging and go in for animal agriculture and other things like that once that's developed
but the initial one will usually be developed for mining or for oil or gas or something that
has a much higher price point so it's not only when you're looking at how much carbon is released
and how much carbon sink is damaged in the process of destroying that surface rainforest
and the biodiversity but how much that opens up in terms of all the other industries that's a
really critical topic and in this particular situation you don't have a similar thing because
the seabed authority is not regulating all seamining as the same thing they're all very
different and there aren't a lot of other uses for the seafloor that once you open it up now
people want to go start taking all the other stuff there's not there's silt right like there's silt
and then there happens with these nodules that's another point that I want to open up is that
the regulation being proposed in metals coast position is not pro ocean mining it's a much
more nuanced thing that says pro collection of these polymetallic modules that happen to be
not just profitable metals but key metals for the energy transition of hydrocarbons
that is a critical thing that are also relatively low impact both because they're in an area that
has low biodiversity they're in an area where the same biodiversity is indexed in areas that won't
be mined or affected and where they don't actually have to go into the crust or do any kind of
drilling or cutting there are lots of other types of ocean mining where the cost benefit
environmentally doesn't make sense make sense to do surface mining or to really avoid that
source as a whole so when you say ocean mining as a binary it doesn't make any sense right it's
like saying are you pro or anti-ai will depend on the application there's really terrible applications
or are you pro or anti-synthetic bio depends on the application so that's just another topic I wanted
to bring up it and the last one is when I was a young environmentalist and I would hear about
something like mine the oceans that term would just freak me out right or like mine the rainforest or
and I didn't have the sense that the TV that I was seeing that add on or the computer or phone now
that I'm seeing it on requires a whole bunch of fucking metals that communicate over satellites
fueled by a lot of energy that came from a supply chain that comes from somewhere and what the trade
offs associated are and so the binary of should we mine the oceans or not mine the oceans if we
could just say yes let's just not and there was no alternative you know all negative thing that
would happen of course that would be like yes let's just not but if it is selective highly
regulated mining of a certain type in a certain area for certain purposes or if not doing that
then you have one of a couple options so you don't get the metals that are needed for the
batteries and either now you have to get them from the surface sources and now you're dealing with
look at what the surface sources for the nickel cobalt manganese etc are and look at the fact that
they are largely things that produce much more toxic waste than the nodules do
that have more effects on surface biodiversity and in more biodiversity critical zones of the world
or you say well let's just not have batteries and let's keep all the particular transmission in
the co2 and so then you can make a makeup answer called let's just need less energy well that's
cute but that's just not going to happen unless you get rid of a lot of humans or want the war that
goes along with that and so if you really take the trade-offs and say until someone can present
how to radically degrow GDP and or radically decrease energy without needing to decrease
GDP neither one of which have reliable solutions in the short term then that energy has to come
from somewhere and if you want to get off hydrocarbons and where do those metals come from
those are real questions and so I want the best environmental answers for that I'm willing
for them to not be the best economic answers they just have to be viable enough that the
people motivated by the economics are not motivated to go to war otherwise because of
course or economics can mean disproportionate harm to poor people it can mean a basis for war
of resources but what I would want the environmental scientists and environmental groups and thinkers
to do is to say okay let's really look at the entire trade-off space clearly and well and let's
make sure that we if we're going to object to something that we have a comprehensively better
proposal that we actually know how to enact if our better proposal has no enactability like let's
just decrease the total amount of energy the world can spy a lot that's not actually a solution
so from what I can tell and I would change my position on this if anyone presented something
better there is no realistic way to decrease the energy demands and there is no realistic way to
get off hydrocarbon without increasing the metal amounts and given that we're looking at the trade
offs between sourcing none of which are perfect but in this particular situation seem quite clear
for some of the baseballs what a beautiful way to summarize what has been said and also from
an integral perspective so I really appreciate that particularly because we need to make sure
that we don't look in a naive way into what needs to happen next and so those blind spots have to
be addressed and thank you Gerard I mean the reason why I went into the cost and the investor
the financial support was because I truly see that that you're doing at least as far as humanly
possible in our culture and so within having said that and thank you for the summary Daniel I think
I'd like to know next from you Gerard how can we those of us who have
financial means and focus on that support your work given the fact that you are so integrally
looking at addressing those issues thank you thank you so so we're really about building
a community that supports this movement and you know I was I always enjoy any opportunity to
be on a medium with Daniel because he really does tap into a set of thinkers who are prepared to
think a little bit you know deeper into the the true issues and have a trade-off conversation and
and obviously adding integral thinking into you know this and that being able to access that
community I see is really you know important as we try and find people that want to come and put
their shoulder to the wheel because as Daniel said you know it's complex and also you know as
as he said at the moment this seems to be the best solution and something we always said to our
stakeholders you know if we we have a we have a a set of requirements that we see as need to be
met to keep going on this and one of them is making sure that we do satisfy the requirement
to not harm the environment you know there's nothing that has zero harm but but if we found
that this ecosystem you know would be damaged such that it changed the function of the oceans
then we would have some stop moments we'd be like oh sorry guys we've got new information that needs
us to to pivot to a new look for a new extractive new supply to these important metals but so far
all of the news is encouraging on that so we feel confident but what we really need
people who want to come and join us on this story and and that includes people like you
Mariana who who are prepared to access your network to help us communicate this important story
we obviously we're a public company now we're listed on the NASDAQ our ticker is TMC
for the metals company we've had a pretty rough ride I got to tell you it's been a a hellish ride
as a public company you know as a private company we'd raised money at about a two billion dollar
valuation and then we we became a three billion dollar company but today we're a we're a fraction
of that yet we have a really sticky solid register you know we just raised more money recently and
that mainly came from internal shareholders so we you know we feel confident about our financial
future and all of this the decreasing value of TMC the public company is at a time when our assets
our licenses are becoming more and more valuable you know the first area that we're developing
is nori area d and that represents about 22 percent of our defined resource because we've
we've already identified about 1.6 billion tons of these on two of our license areas and so we're
we're compliant with the canadian resource reporting standard and the resource certainty is
really high because they're two-dimensional they lie on the ocean floor so you can see them
but the the economics for that first block nori area d that's 22 percent of our defined resource
has a net present value today of more than 15 billion dollars you know and and if we were a
land-based project at the same stage of development the value of our company would be between about
0.2 and 0.7 times that nav so 0.2 or 0.7 times 15 billion dollars yet our value is not that it's
it's more like it's like 0.01 percent of the nav and so a bit more than that but 0.015 so that seems
wrong so there's a disconnect you know and about 60 percent of the register is really sticky like
people like myself and all sees and our largest shareholder from uh san francisco a family office
who've been you know so really committed people who are not looking at this as a trade to make
money they're in this for the long term and so what we really want to do is to get more people
to come and join us on this journey to buy the shares to share us into their community
such that we can you know have discussions like this so we can find people who have a willingness
to come and learn more and to come and support this new industry and it's very rare that you
can be at the beginning of a new industry but that's where we are like and this is a really
exciting time because you know it's it's one analogy is you know offshore oil and gas once
upon a time there was no offshore oil and gas and then in the blink of an eye 30 percent of
oil and gas supplies came offshore I think it could be even more aggressive when it comes to
uh these metals when it comes to nickel and cobalt and manganese that more this more supply
could come out of the ocean so I'm very encouraged by that so um so yeah that's I think there are
many many different ways and um you know I think getting people to buy the stock and getting people
to to talk about the story and to come and be inquisitive and and to want to learn more and
allow us to to talk to their networks important networks of of thinkers
is the areas that can help us most we are talking to a broad range of strategic partners now
because one of the ways companies like ours finance their future activities is by inviting
other companies to come and invest at the asset so not into our topco because obviously we think
the stock is hugely devalued so we don't want to be issuing more shares what we want to do is to
unlock some of that 15 billion dollars of net present value and so you know I mentioned that
our last earnings call that we're talking to a variety of strategic names about earning into
those assets and and that's a way that you know we can avoid dilution, invite strategic names in
who can help us with capital and expertise as needed to start developing these important assets.
Well thank you so very much Gerard and you know as an investor I know how values decrease
like that and I I can only imagine you know what you've been going through over the past
12 years but Daniel had a question that goes in that direction Daniel one or two.
Yeah just in in case it's not obvious do you want to say why you believe the stock value
went down because obviously if you're asking people to invest it's based on the idea that the
stock value is going to go up and in addition to investment what else would create a turnaround
than that? Yeah no certainly look the the main issue that people have about you know our valuation
is the fact that the final regulations have not been adopted yet so at the moment we have exploration
licenses and the that allows us to apply for an exploitation license over those same defined areas
and so so if you like we've been busy putting the cart beside the horse along the way maybe even in
front of the horse sometimes but the final exploitation code is due to be adopted later
this year and that is they are the rules that will allow us to then submit our application
and move from exploration to extraction phase and so obviously the moment that happens
that massively opens up the value of those assets we we already have our first production asset
the hidden gem so the boat that we are out on our license area with last year that was owned
and operated by All Seas will also be our first production asset when once we receive the commercial
permit to move ahead and so I think that's the main gating item now of course there were some
other things when we became a public company you know we had you know a short report came out
we had a funding short for what about the major investors who'd committed to investing
would bankrupt and so that was a problem for us we we went public via a merger with a SPAC
which in 2020 was all the rage when we announced our deal on March 4 2021 we were kind of the
last SPAC to get through the gates and the SEC really turned their focus on SPACs because there
are a lot of crazy businesses that went public through SPACs you know I would never invest in them
because they weren't underwritten by tangible assets you know there were there were pipe dreams
so that meant we went public thinking we were going to raise about $600 million but the redemption
rate of our SPAC went from you know low single digits in the year 2020 all of a sudden in 2021
redemption rates went back to normal which were very very high so a lot of the money that we thought
we were raising either redeemed or in the case of our default HIN investor defaulted so it meant we
raised $137 million instead of 600 so that meant you know that was a real you know kick in the
teeth and we had to decide well what do we do do we do we proceed and remain a private company
or do we proceed and become a public company we decided to stay on the public path we it provided
us enough money to keep the program on track and and amazingly thank you to an amazing team
we've kept the program on track so we still are committed to first production at the end of 2024
now we're the beginning of 2023 so at the end of next year we
for some reason we lost Gerard I see that
so while he was describing his challenges with with you know a startup I could only
refer to or think back to what we experienced with the energy turnaround startup and I originally
wanted to have the you know co-founder be with us because he would have brought a different
you know regulatory aspect from an industry that is just you know starting to get involved
in how the current regulators are basically doing everything and anything to prevent you from
from being successful so Gerard actually elaborated that so as a serial entrepreneur
as an investor for more than 30 years I I so can sympathize with what Gerard has been going to
through and you know I know if I remember correctly you invested several tens of millions
of your own money into this company because you believe in it and that's basically the best way
the best confirmation for investors if the founder you know puts all of his eggs into one basket
then that's the way to go and so I can only encourage everyone and anyone who is listening
to this to really join forces with us so Aniluz Daniel do you have any more questions for Gerard
I had one quick thing I was going to say is at one point Gerard said
don't think that the resources won't be collected or exploited at some point through some process
the orientation for growth and the need of the metals and growth seems and the
you know nodules having a straightforward method to collect them that has only been legally hung
up and the market demand on those continuing to increase makes it seem really crystal clear
those will become a collected asset so then the question is how environmentally well is it
regulated and let's say you know we already see people working on
geoengineering involving solar radiation aerosols in the upper atmosphere that might have
unbelievably huge environmental consequences out of a kind of like
terror associated with climate change when you start to get in really back against the wall
positions then you move forward in less conscious ways and I can see the world moving forward in
less conscious way with regard to this when it becomes you know critical that it's needed late
