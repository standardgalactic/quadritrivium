when we move them to shore to process them we kind of reverse that process and we can turn 100%
of the mass of this nodule in my hand into usable saleable material and that means we generate
no waste like zero waste and zero tailings and that's a real game changer for the mining and
metals industry because last year about 190 billion tons of waste was generated by the
mining industry globally and put that in context about two billion tons of waste was generated
municipally globally so waste is a really important problem and if you're going to increase that by
five or six x then it's an even bigger problem but Mother Nature did us an amazing thing by
where they located these nodules in the abyssal zone and they literally just lie there on the ocean
floor and so to extract them it means we have to pick them up off the surface and we've just
completed a very important set of trials our company has been around for around 12 years
but we're working towards the permit to be able to move from exploration phase to extraction phase
and so an important part of that were some trials that we completed last year where we had our first
production system on our license area so we could we could test our production means by which we
lift these nodules pump them to the production vessel and then we'll move them ashore for
processing to turn them into battery metals but what we were very encouraged by was we had two
vessels one was a 240 meter production vessel known as the hidden gem and it was it was the
one that drove the robot on the seafloor and and it was engineered by one of our big investors and
partners all seas who have for the last 37 years been very successful in the pipeline industry
for the oil and gas world and and so a lot of expertise from that industry is coming to help
us move this industry past the experimental phase into the production phase and and they did an
amazing job and it was a wildly successful campaign so we're very relieved and pleased about that
but we had a second vessel out there and it was science focused we had many scientists on the
hidden gem as well but but that second vessel was purely there for monitoring and so we were
surveying the area before we touched it during the collection phase and then post the collection phase
and you know that was an important part because the results of that work will go into our application
that we planned to submit to the regulator who is the international seabed authority
and will be an important part of the environmental impact study to look at the impact of picking these
up and and I'm pleased to say you know the things that we worry about are you know well what's the
impact of removing them on biodiversity you know will there be a loss and how do we mitigate that
what will be the impact of the the dust that we generate on the seafloor people know there's the
plume how can we mitigate that how far will it travel think of it as driving a car down a dirt
road you'll you'll kick up some dust but how far will that dust travel and then the third thing is
where to re-inject the the water that we bring up from the seafloor because we separate the
sediment from the nodules at the robot but we have to use water to as the transport mechanism
and then we have to return that water somewhere but if I was to put that into two categories you're
talking about biodiversity and you're talking about plume and you know speculation by some people
was that this plume would travel for large distances and would have a you know a negative
impact on the surroundings of the ocean is thousands of miles away but our results were
very consistent with the results that MIT published some months ago from a very extensive campaign
that they were monitoring a year earlier and that is that the plume only rose about two meters above
the seafloor and most of it like up to 98% of it stayed in the the test area and so that's good
news and it was what we always believed but of course science has to provide the evidence
to be able to make these decisions so now of course we have we've been gathering this environmental
data including baseline data for many many years and so now the job is to put all of the results
of that into a coherent study and put to extrapolate those results into more of a production type
environment as well and then to submit that as part of our application to move from exploration
into a phase that we're we're able to lift the nodules and move them to shore and process them
and and sell the results and and so you know we've always believed that we can
compress the range of impacts by very significant amounts and we've been funding a lot of
research to that point we have had many articles appear in peer-reviewed journals like the the
Journal of Cleaner Production that published our CO2 paper that said showed that you can
reduce CO2 emissions by more than 90% when you build a battery cathode using these rocks compared
to the land-based alternatives the fact that we can generate no waste you know the fact that we
we will reduce the amount of water required fresh water by 90% when we process nodules
compared to land-based ores the fact that we don't need to move indigenous communities
and that's one of the really big focuses particularly for the nickel product I mentioned
nickel is very important about half of the economics come from nickel and if you look at
the supply of nickel globally it's declining the growth in nickel is coming from Indonesia
and that's in the form of these nickel laterates and so you know you can see a green picture behind
me on the wall or it's actually a moss wall but imagine that is a very biodiverse rainforest
in Indonesia and under it lies a lot of nickel so to get to that nickel you've got to build a
heap of infrastructure you go in and tear down the rainforest and move all the topsoil all of
which of course means destroying carbon sinks you then need to dig up this nickel laterite ore
unfortunately when you expose it to weather the runoff is chromium 6 plus which of course poisons
everything in his path and then you're doing all of that looking for like one to two percent of the
material is usable the other 90 plus percent of it is waste and you have to do something with that
waste and it's not just any old waste it's toxic waste so you can't you know you have to treat it
and manage it and so you know that it's a horrible situation we find ourselves in and that's why we
have to be looking at new frontiers because turning a blind eye to the current practices is not a
viable alternative you know we have to be working with full knowledge and and you know you can't
pretend that the batteries in your electric car are made with sustainable metals you can't just think
yeah I don't have to worry about that is as citizens of our planet we do have to worry about it and we
have to be looking through the lens of you know a full life cycle analysis and say well what are
what are these set of broad impacts and how do they compare to the alternatives and then we have
some judgments to make you know and the judgments are if we want to keep destroying the most
biodiverse carbon sinks on our planet you know robbing indigenous communities pushing them out
of their home habitats also we can you know just meet the insatiable demand for the energy transition
or do we want to think a bit harder about this and and look for something that is a whole lot
you know better for our planet and for the humans living on it
wow thank you so much and you know I want to summarize some of those things and ask you some
further questions because I think what you're doing is really pioneering work and it's really
important so just first for location um if I understand it correctly this is in the in the
waters of the republic of now is that correct no no we're actually in international waters
and so our room is our public is our sponsor because right we wind our mind back 50 years
ago this industry almost got started um there were four consortiums involving blocky martin and
nitsubishi, sunatomo, BP and shell were involved and they started to put
efforts together to collect these rocks and they were successful it was really pioneering
stuff I mean we've just had a very successful trial but we've benefited from the development
of the offshore industry and all the engineering advancement in the last 50 years but 50 years
ago they built the system and the robots to go down and hoover these up and Rio Tinto built a
processing plant on shore it was all successful but but the problem is 50 years ago the world
had not agreed who owned the oceans where do my borders begin and end and so it was when
Henry Kissinger wrote a letter to all of the ambassadors of the UN saying we'd like to lay
claim over this area it'll be good for the world trust us on that of course all the ambassadors
got together and said that doesn't sound uh too equitable and and so the UN stopped it
so everyone had to pause and then that was agreed finally on where the borders begin and end when
UNCLOS which stands for the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea was put into
place in 1982 and that basically said as a sovereign you own everything within 12 miles
of your coastline and you have an economic right to everything within 200 miles but beyond that
it's not yours in fact it's everybody's it's deemed the common heritage of humankind and it
will be governed by the international seabed authority and so we are in international waters
but but to be able to claim an area you either need to be a signatory to UNCLOS and a member of
the international seabed authority which we are not or be sponsored by a member and of course
they really wanted developing countries to be involved because typically it's the wealthy
nations who have the resources and the expertise to be able to you know lead the charge yet the
poor developing countries you know are left out wondering well what happened there whereas
this is a way that a developing nation in our case Nauru we also have a similar relationship
with the kingdom of Tonga and Kiribati but this is a way that those developing countries who've had
zero contribution to climate change who've who've done nothing about helping perpetuate this
climate crisis that we're in but allows them to participate and to be able to learn new skills
to create jobs to earn royalties of course and also play an important part in in providing one
of the important solutions so we're about a thousand miles off the coast of Mexico and so
it's a long way from anything but proximity to Nauru is not one of the criteria we could have
equally had one of the African countries sponsor our application or I'm really glad you clarified
that especially because I'm calling from the Republic of Mauritius so here it's also a small
island developing state and I think what you're bringing up here is very important geopolitically
but also in terms of the socioeconomic inequalities in addressing this and so I have a few more
small questions so that everyone was listening is really getting the fuller picture here
but you addressed many of the key issues around an environmental impact assessment with the EIA
there's also the impact of sound in terms of the impact for the whales and for the dolphins
that love to hear your views on that as well and then I'd really love to hear from you whether
you took the compliance route of complying with regulations or you took the corporate
sustainability leadership route of saying look we're not just looking only to comply with what's
expected in order to get a license but we're actually advocating for higher standards and we're
really willing to use ourselves here as a case study to then educate and inform others of how
we can do this in a way that is regenerative and the least amount of impact with that bigger
planetary vision that you you know described so well. No great questions on the topic of sound
you know we've run a very extensive sound campaign with our trials that have just recently
completed and so we look forward to publishing the results early indications are that they're all
very manageable most of the sound of course happens on the surface but there is you know
there's noise generated by the transportation of nodules up the pipe and but there are there are
there are means that we can dampen that noise substantially if required but as it stands now
we're very encouraged by the results that we've seen from those recent trials and so we don't
think noise just just remember we're not breaking anything on the seafloor like these nodules
literally lie there so as long as they're we're having to drill or blast which is conventionally
what happens you know in the oil and gas or the mining industry and so you know very different scenario
so going back on to the path that we took I think it's really important for people to understand
one thing never before has an industry had so much focus before it got started by a regulator
like normally industries get started and then people try and regulate them so here we are
the international seabed authority is made up of 167 member countries plus the european union
it's been established since 1994 like if you if you were I don't know green piece and you had to
imagine had to imagine a regulatory environment I imagine you'd probably say it's something like this
now of course they'll probably say it's not quite good enough but today but but never before has an
industry had so much focus before it's got started so that's encouraging but the other thing I'd like
to make the point of is that don't think if it doesn't happen under the control of the regulator
the international seabed authority don't think these assets won't be exploited
and that's the opportunity for the world today the fact that you've got a regulator in place
and the fact that you've got a company like ourselves I'd like to say we're a really responsible
corporate citizen we've there are guidelines that have been laid down by the regulator on what
we should be looking at from an environmental management perspective because the mandate of
the international seabed authority is really clear it's to put in place exploration and exploitation
regulations a term that's adopted from the land-based mining industry while protecting the marine
environment and so we they provide very strong guidance on what should happen but we always said
we actually want to see that and up at another level and the good news there is that when you set
a standard then generally that becomes a level that people have to attain or exceed and so
I think it's really a positive thing that a we have a regulator that everyone's playing by the
rulebook at the moment and secondly that companies like us are striving towards excellence you know
when we put together our environmental plan we didn't go and hire a heap of scientists so it
could be company prepared we went and sought the very best experts from each discipline and so we
have you know if you go to our website you'll see the array of institutions and universities we have
you know MIT help us we have the University of Hawaii we have the National Oceanography
Center the Natural History Museum it's a really broad range of leading institutions who have put
their expertise and with the help of our money I mean by the time we complete this we will have
spent over a hundred million dollars I mean it's a lot of money we've invested in this it's the
largest fully integrated you know ocean research research program ever done and so you know we
did that because we we we knew that people would say oh yeah but you did it the metals company
whereas we can say hang on you know we bought expertise in from all of these very
outstanding institutions who you know have done the work independently they're free to publish their
results you know we don't put any handcuffs on anyone we now have the CSIRO and the equivalent
agency in New Zealand working with us on putting together an adaptive management plan and that's
going to be exciting too because their recently completed work on the Great Barrier Reef is there
for everyone to see it's amazing the rehabilitation that is happening because there's so many things
to worry about but what are the important things to worry about and so you know what CSIRO and and
then the equivalent agency in New Zealand are helping us with is is deciding what are the
things to measure what are the the boundaries that we need to be mindful of as we move through the
production process so so I'd like to think you know we took a set of guiding principles
and we improved on them and you know knowing that we're going to have the eyes of the world focused
on us which is something we're very very comfortable with and and you know that adaptive management
system we we we pair it with our digital twin because I sometimes hear people say well how on
earth will we know what you're doing a thousand miles offshore four thousand meters below sea level
we won't know what's going on there but but it's the exact opposite I don't know whether you've
ever tried to get near a land-based mine but it's impossible you're met with barbed wire and machine
guns depending which country you're in um whereas we want to let people including the regulator have
eyes and ears to exactly what we're doing so people can see the low level of impact that's
being generated and so it's a different approach so now that we address the the environmental
issues and you know we know what we're talking about our listeners our the target audience are
investors and so this is your floor what do you need from investors how can we support your work
moving forward thank you I see Daniel wanting to to interject but
Daniel there were a handful of environmental topics you touched on that I just think are
important to take one step further before we get into the business case you don't mind so
Gord was just recently mentioning coral and obviously the coral bleaching and
daff issues and how critical coral are to life in the oceans is a topic everyone's aware of
one of the other than very very reef one of the major centers of coral in the world is off the
coast of indonesia which is the other place that the nickel can come in when Gord was saying that
90 plus percent of the ore that gets extracted is a waste product and most of that being a toxic
waste product the waterways that that goes into if the mining tailing dams break which happens all
the time like just look into um mining pollution toxicity mining tailing uh dams breaking just
you do a bit of the study who's mentioning you know 190 billion tons of waste from mining compared
to you know municipal waste at a couple billion tons this is not just looking at that being a
generally toxic issue but specifically in indonesia where both the tropical rainforest on the surface
