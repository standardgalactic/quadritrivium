Welcome to the Integral Investing podcast entitled Deep Ocean Mining and Decarbonization.
Abundant clean energy is central to the decarbonization of the global economy, as we all know.
But the production of wind, solar and geothermal power as well as energy storage requires massive
amounts of natural resources such as lithium, cobalt, nickel and copper, to name a few.
Unfortunately, the best land ores have already been mined and new resources come from rainforests
and pristine landscapes where mining generates large toxic waste. So the main question remains,
how can humanity close the resource gap to achieve the transition to a decarbonized economy
by 2050? To address this question, I have invited to the podcast Jared Barron,
the CEO and founder of the Metals company that is enabling the battery power shift to clean energy
and electric vehicles with the slightest planetary touch. Jared's mission is to help transition
earth from fossil fuels toward a circular resource economy. Daniel Schmartenberger is
another brilliant thinker who is also joining us today and whom I have interviewed already before,
so please listen to that interview as well. He is the founder of the Civilization Research
Initiative and an internationally recognized strategic advisor on catastrophic risk, exponential
tech and coordination challenges. My co-interviewer today is brilliant system scientist and futurist
Dr. Anilou Smithsman. Full disclosure, I was so impressed with the positive impact of the
Metals company after the interview that I went out and wanted to put my money where my mouth is
and I purchased their stock. Daniel, I'd like to start with you. You're an integral thinker and
you saw something that I could contribute to your journey, our journey, by introducing me to
Jared Barron. I know we had this metacrisis long conversation, but I would still like to invite
you to frame a little bit this conversation from your own perspective so that we could then dive
into Gerard's contribution. Sure. In that conversation that I really enjoyed with you,
and maybe you can link that in the show notes here also, we went in some depth into
what we call the metacrisis assessment and what needs to happen. I won't redo that here,
but just very briefly, the concept of the metacrisis is that there are a lot of
catastrophic and some even existential risks facing humanity currently and in the
years and decades ahead that are novel, that are not things that were facing the world at any time
previously in human history. Obviously, the world has always been at risk of supervolcanoes and
asteroids and things like that, but we were never at risk of AI autonomous weapons issues or nuclear
winter or synthetic bio issues or planetary boundaries. Those are things that require
both, that require either exponential tech or at least very powerful tech like nuclear tech
or industrial tech multiplied by generations of cumulative effects and eight billion people
in the huge amount of resource per capita that is going into the world. Rather than just look at
there's a climate crisis, but there's a lot of other environmental crises. There's ocean
acidification from both climate, but also nitrogen denzones and phosphorus and overfishing and
microplastics and forever chemicals. There was just an article published that the PFOS and PFAS,
the fluorinated surfactants have passed planetary boundaries as defined by the EPA and other
regulatory agencies in rainwater all around the world. There's so many environmental crises.
The planetary boundary framework is a pretty overarching framework to say for the planet to
continue to function well, soil and biodiversity and temperature and many things have to stay
within certain ranges and we're getting very near as the result of industrial technology cumulative
effects over a few centuries and the increasing demand on those. The front side of the materials
economy is take stuff from nature faster than nature can replenish it, which looks like deforestation,
demineralization, soil loss, overfishing, etc., and then turn it into pollution and trash and waste
faster than nature can process it, which looks like all of the toxicity and pollution issues.
To solve that, we have to go to a closed loop of materials economy where we're not taking stuff
from nature or putting stuff into nature faster than natural process. That's a humongous thing.
That does not include all of the risks we face because you can go closed loop and that still
doesn't mean we won't have a nuclear war. It still doesn't mean that we don't create
synthetic bio catastrophes either on accident through lab leaks through gain of function
research and things like that or intentionally through bio weapons or issues associated with AI
nanotech or the more advanced exponential tech, meaning distributed catastrophe weapons for
everyone in a phase where grown weapons and cyber weapons don't take state actors and we're
because of climate change migration, which looks to displace hundreds of millions of people in the
decade ahead. You have a lot more people who will be much more disenfranchised who also have much
more access to do something about that that is catastrophic. So the world's fragile for all of
these reasons. So our basic premise is we are in a phase where and they're all the result of human
technology and the coordination systems because Stone Age people just really can't cause biological
crisis at a planetary level nor can they cause war that messes everything up nor even
externalities that mess everything up. So it really is the result of technology and coordination
failures of managing the technology. We're not going to regress to a low technology civilization.
So we have to get the coordination down where we don't cause excessive externalities in the
process of our technology and that so that's solving the kind of mistake problems and so
that we don't use our technology rivalrously i.e. exponential warfare towards each other.
You could say all of the problems are the result of harm that we cause intentionally. So conflict
theory and harm we cause accidentally. So kind of mistake theory and so but both mediated by
a degree of technological power. So at the level of coordination we have to both work on resolving
underlying sources of conflict and get better at anticipating externalities and mistakes and being
able to internalize those. Your work through Club of Rome obviously looks at things like
the limits of growth and how does a civilization that has an exponential growth requirement on
the financial system where each of those dollars are bound to a materials economy in some ways on
a finite planet keep running forever and then also your work through integral investing saying
in so far as most of the dollars that represent choices in the world are still moving through
the market. Can we think about how we allocate those dollars better? We're not just looking like
GDP by itself isn't a good metric because obviously we know why we thought GDP was a good metric but
GDP goes up during war and with addiction and health issues and lots of things. In the same way
lowering CO2 by itself isn't a good metric because I could lower CO2 by planting a bunch of plants
using more nitrogen fertilizers that cause runoff that cause dead zones and oceans faster.
We need a complex set of metrics that we look at and indices we look at in a growth framework.
So in the entire metacrisis there basically the framework we're proposing is that all of those
catastrophes are design constraints that humanity must meet to have a civilization that continues.
So if we take them all as design constraints and simultaneously we don't want the solution to
the catastrophes to be control mechanisms that are so centralized that they create dystopias.
So we want to avoid catastrophes and avoid dystopias so our focus you know the kind of
thing tank that we run our focus is how do we create a third attractor that is neither
catastrophes neither dystopias what is a necessary and sufficient set of solutions to get there
and that's a huge topic and a lot of things are involved.
And so the reason I'm interested in Gerard's work and the work of
Metalsco and we've been friends for some time now and I thought it would be an
interesting conversation for you guys to have and I was happy to join it is
the obviously climate change is one of the major environmental issues we're facing it's
it's a particularly hard one because if we look at HFCs or CFCs causing those own issues
or if we'd look at fluorinated surfactants used for
you know water proofing things whatever you can or pesticides you can potentially change that
you have to fight uphill against a multi-billion dollar vested industry but you don't have to
fight a pill against industry itself whereas when CO2 as the byproduct of burning hydrocarbons
every single industry requires energy and the transition of the energy process itself is more
fundamental and deep than any particular area so it's huge either we figure out how to transition
off hydrocarbons and produce enough energy well or we have massive problems. The transition off
of hydrocarbons is not trivial because if we make solar cells and the associated battery packs to
deal with interment and sea or whatever else it takes a lot of hydrocarbons to make those and
that thing has to run for 10 years or whatever it is to pay that off based so the energy return on
energy investment so there's a lot of deep issues there I have a series with Nate Hagen's where we
talk about those things in depth so I won't get into them too much depth there but I will say that
there is a very tight correlation between global GDP and global energy use it's been referred to
as the Garrett relation there are some critiques of that specific formulation but from 1970 till
now there's about a 99% correlation between global GDP and global energy use where all the
efficiencies in technology give you about 1% more dollar per joule per year but that 1% increase
in efficiency doesn't change the fact that you still have exponential increase in demand to deal
with the 3% global interest rate on the finance supply so there's an embedded growth obligation
on finance to just even be able to keep up with interest let alone quantitative easing or anything
else that means that there's an embedded growth obligation on the total amount of energy and
that doesn't mean we just have to be able to keep up the amount of energy we have it means we have
to be able to grow the amount of energy obviously that doesn't get a habit forever we have a finite
planets we're going to have to change the whole global financial system that's a huge topic can
be on the scope of this but the transition so either the work to transition off hydrocarbons
is hard right and we're talking about a world that has increasing energy demands if you try
to talk about lowering energy demands you also talk about lowering GDP that has been the stable
post world war two of how we avoid world war three that was a huge part of the post world
war two system the breton wood system is because we can make this global financial system and we
can um exponentiate the monetary supply all the countries can have more stuff they can all have
their own growth imperative without taking each other's stuff as soon as you start to get to a
degrowth situation you have some real hard geopolitics to deal with you have some real hard
that hitting the poor world more than the rich world or you're trying to do redistribution by force
which like all the issues suck so while we deal with some of those deeper issues of the embedded
growth obligation on finance we obviously can't keep doing the hydrocarbon thing for very long
if you have an entire world system that has been running on hydrocarbons both
oil and coal and natural gas that means you have pipelines and you have internal combustion engines
you have an entire infrastructure builds on that if you want to get off that you have to build a
whole new infrastructure you're talking about electric motors and batteries rather than
internal combustion and gas you're talking about electrification of the energy grid and storage
for intermittency so one of the issues becomes that for environmental reasons we want to get
off hydrocarbons but there are environmental things that there are things that have environmental
costs to do that like the metals needed to make all those batteries and the resources to make the
solar cells and the wind plants would ever come from somewhere not only does it take some hydrocarbon
energy to do it but you actually have to take you have to have real metals and real other resources
to do that thing and so if we look at the need to get off hydrocarbon fuels him bind with the need
the inability to lower the energy demand significantly even if we did all the efficiency measures we're
not going to lower it significantly because of all the geopolitical forcing functions then what are
the rate limiting issues that often aren't addressed one of them is that to electrify the entire
transportation fleet is a big deal the transportation fleet now doesn't only produce greenhouse
gases it also is the number one cause of particulate emissions and WHO estimates that maybe
air pollution is the number one leading cause of death as a source of partial attribution worldwide
they recently said that they anticipated that chemical pollution in the atmosphere including
particulate pollution from internal combustion would be the uh greater killer than climate change
in the decade to come so it's like when we're talking about internal combustion we're talking
about problems of oil spills and wars over oil and political destabilization it's associated with
it as well as co2 as well as um particulate emission and all these types of things so it's
not a monofocus and very much ocean health obviously both because of warming and because
of ocean acidification climate change has a massive effect on oceans so if you want the
batteries for electrifying all of the transport and then the energy storage that is needed for
the electrification of the grid from things that have intermittency where do all those minerals
come from the mining of those minerals from surface sources environmentally has real problems
because a lot of those surface sources are
areas that have some of the last remaining critical biodiversity a lot of the or sources
have a lot of unusable co-product that turns into toxic waste and is a major source of problem
for freshwater planetary boundaries which are one of the major ones to hit so when I met Gerard
and heard about their solution which I'll let him share there were a number of things about it that
even though it has some environmental cost looking at the entire life cycle of all of the
environmental costs and the trade-offs that we can't avoid because there are very hard trade-offs
that you may have to face seems like it is an important and critical topic to get a lot more
serious attention and that's why I wanted to have the conversation. Well brilliant so Gerard
you are the CEO founder you're a serial entrepreneur first of all this is where we connected to
and you are the CEO and the founder of the metals company and so tell us you know tell us why why
go the hard way. You're right Mariana it is the hard way because getting a new extractive industry
established at a time where the world is focused on the impact of all extractive industries is
well it's a little counter-intuitive and so what we did is we looked at you know accepting the fact
that the world is going to need a lot more metal and I think that is indisputable if we look at the
international energy agency you know they say by 2040 we'll need between five and six hundred
percent more of these metals to meet the energy needs for the transition so accepting that fact
then we put through the lens of where can they come from you know where is the right place to be
looking for these metals and with the lightest planetary and human touch and we came to the
conclusion that the absolute winner in that race was these like I have in my hand and this being a
polymetallic nodule and of course we know that 70% of the planet is covered in ocean and and this
is why it was so interesting to to blend your integral thinking into this because we can't
look at the ocean without looking at land impacts and we can't be looking at land impacts without
looking at the entire impact of to our planet and so what we started our work on was identifying
you know what are the impacts of collecting this resource and turning it into battery metals and
if you if you go back to our purpose which we published many years ago it came in three steps
and one was to identify where are the lowest impact supply of these battery metals to be found
and we decided that this was the resource to investigate further and and because we don't
have enough metals in the system to allow a pathway to circularity because we do believe
that circularity in the long run will reduce the demand for virginals and so that's where we need
to get to so that step one was to get the lowest impact from a planetary environmental and human
perspective of supply of these metals into the system and step two of our purpose was then to
make sure every single atom that we put into the system stayed there and Daniel coined the phase
phrase atoms as a service meaning let's put the metals in there but let's make sure we get them
back and we can recycle them and and and make sure that they can stay there for many millions of
years to come and then finally when extractive industries slowed down because stage two has
been so successful and we are in a circular economy to make sure that we can repurpose our
land-based infrastructure to recycle other materials because these nodules are abundant in nickel
which is a really important metal for our future copper cobalt and manganese but of course there
are many other metals that don't have the same well aren't the focus of recycling at the moment
but they will be as we head towards circularity so that's where we started and the beauty when
we look at this all body and the reason why it's a little bit it takes a bit of adjustment is of
course you know if you look at 70% of the planet is ocean and the abyssal zone is by far the most
common environment on our planet it's an area at about almost 4 000 meters and beyond below
seawater and this is where these nodules lie and they literally form by precipitating the metals
that are in the seawater or the sediment upon which they sit so they grow a little bit like a
pearl grows by precipitating those metals and and the beauty of that of course is that we
when we move them to shore to process them we kind of reverse that process and we can turn 100%
of the mass of this nodule in my hand into usable saleable material and that means we generate
no waste like zero waste and zero tailings and that's a real game changer for the mining and
metals industry because last year about 190 billion tons of waste was generated by the
mining industry globally and put that in context about two billion tons of waste was generated
municipally globally so waste is a really important problem and if you're going to increase that by
five or six x then it's an even bigger problem but Mother Nature did us an amazing thing by
where they located these nodules in the abyssal zone and they literally just lie there on the ocean
floor and so to extract them it means we have to pick them up off the surface and we've just
completed a very important set of trials our company has been around for around 12 years
but we're working towards the permit to be able to move from exploration phase to extraction phase
and so an important part of that were some trials that we completed last year where we had our first
production system on our license area so we could we could test our production means by which we
lift these nodules pump them to the production vessel and then we'll move them ashore for
processing to turn them into battery metals but what we were very encouraged by was we had two
vessels one was a 240 meter production vessel known as the hidden gem and it was it was the
one that drove the robot on the seafloor and and it was engineered by one of our big investors and
partners all seas who have for the last 37 years been very successful in the pipeline industry
for the oil and gas world and and so a lot of expertise from that industry is coming to help
us move this industry past the experimental phase into the production phase and and they did an
amazing job and it was a wildly successful campaign so we're very relieved and pleased about that
but we had a second vessel out there and it was science focused we had many scientists on the
hidden gem as well but but that second vessel was purely there for monitoring and so we were
surveying the area before we touched it during the collection phase and then post the collection phase
and you know that was an important part because the results of that work will go into our application
that we planned to submit to the regulator who is the international seabed authority
and will be an important part of the environmental impact study to look at the impact of picking these
up and and I'm pleased to say you know the things that we worry about are you know well what's the
impact of removing them on biodiversity you know will there be a loss and how do we mitigate that
what will be the impact of the the dust that we generate on the seafloor people know there's the
plume how can we mitigate that how far will it travel think of it as driving a car down a dirt
road you'll you'll kick up some dust but how far will that dust travel and then the third thing is
where to re-inject the the water that we bring up from the seafloor because we separate the
sediment from the nodules at the robot but we have to use water to as the transport mechanism
and then we have to return that water somewhere but if I was to put that into two categories you're
talking about biodiversity and you're talking about plume and you know speculation by some people
was that this plume would travel for large distances and would have a you know a negative
impact on the surroundings of the ocean is thousands of miles away but our results were
very consistent with the results that MIT published some months ago from a very extensive campaign
that they were monitoring a year earlier and that is that the plume only rose about two meters above
the seafloor and most of it like up to 98% of it stayed in the the test area and so that's good
news and it was what we always believed but of course science has to provide the evidence
to be able to make these decisions so now of course we have we've been gathering this environmental
data including baseline data for many many years and so now the job is to put all of the results
of that into a coherent study and put to extrapolate those results into more of a production type
environment as well and then to submit that as part of our application to move from exploration
into a phase that we're we're able to lift the nodules and move them to shore and process them
and and sell the results and and so you know we've always believed that we can
compress the range of impacts by very significant amounts and we've been funding a lot of
research to that point we have had many articles appear in peer-reviewed journals like the the
Journal of Cleaner Production that published our CO2 paper that said showed that you can
reduce CO2 emissions by more than 90% when you build a battery cathode using these rocks compared
to the land-based alternatives the fact that we can generate no waste you know the fact that we
we will reduce the amount of water required fresh water by 90% when we process nodules
compared to land-based ores the fact that we don't need to move indigenous communities
and that's one of the really big focuses particularly for the nickel product I mentioned
nickel is very important about half of the economics come from nickel and if you look at
the supply of nickel globally it's declining the growth in nickel is coming from Indonesia
and that's in the form of these nickel laterates and so you know you can see a green picture behind
me on the wall or it's actually a moss wall but imagine that is a very biodiverse rainforest
in Indonesia and under it lies a lot of nickel so to get to that nickel you've got to build a
heap of infrastructure you go in and tear down the rainforest and move all the topsoil all of
which of course means destroying carbon sinks you then need to dig up this nickel laterite ore
unfortunately when you expose it to weather the runoff is chromium 6 plus which of course poisons
everything in his path and then you're doing all of that looking for like one to two percent of the
material is usable the other 90 plus percent of it is waste and you have to do something with that
waste and it's not just any old waste it's toxic waste so you can't you know you have to treat it
and manage it and so you know that it's a horrible situation we find ourselves in and that's why we
have to be looking at new frontiers because turning a blind eye to the current practices is not a
viable alternative you know we have to be working with full knowledge and and you know you can't
pretend that the batteries in your electric car are made with sustainable metals you can't just think
yeah I don't have to worry about that is as citizens of our planet we do have to worry about it and we
have to be looking through the lens of you know a full life cycle analysis and say well what are
what are these set of broad impacts and how do they compare to the alternatives and then we have
some judgments to make you know and the judgments are if we want to keep destroying the most
biodiverse carbon sinks on our planet you know robbing indigenous communities pushing them out
of their home habitats also we can you know just meet the insatiable demand for the energy transition
or do we want to think a bit harder about this and and look for something that is a whole lot
you know better for our planet and for the humans living on it
wow thank you so much and you know I want to summarize some of those things and ask you some
further questions because I think what you're doing is really pioneering work and it's really
important so just first for location um if I understand it correctly this is in the in the
waters of the republic of now is that correct no no we're actually in international waters
and so our room is our public is our sponsor because right we wind our mind back 50 years
ago this industry almost got started um there were four consortiums involving blocky martin and
nitsubishi, sunatomo, BP and shell were involved and they started to put
efforts together to collect these rocks and they were successful it was really pioneering
stuff I mean we've just had a very successful trial but we've benefited from the development
of the offshore industry and all the engineering advancement in the last 50 years but 50 years
ago they built the system and the robots to go down and hoover these up and Rio Tinto built a
processing plant on shore it was all successful but but the problem is 50 years ago the world
had not agreed who owned the oceans where do my borders begin and end and so it was when
Henry Kissinger wrote a letter to all of the ambassadors of the UN saying we'd like to lay
claim over this area it'll be good for the world trust us on that of course all the ambassadors
got together and said that doesn't sound uh too equitable and and so the UN stopped it
so everyone had to pause and then that was agreed finally on where the borders begin and end when
UNCLOS which stands for the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea was put into
place in 1982 and that basically said as a sovereign you own everything within 12 miles
of your coastline and you have an economic right to everything within 200 miles but beyond that
it's not yours in fact it's everybody's it's deemed the common heritage of humankind and it
will be governed by the international seabed authority and so we are in international waters
but but to be able to claim an area you either need to be a signatory to UNCLOS and a member of
the international seabed authority which we are not or be sponsored by a member and of course
they really wanted developing countries to be involved because typically it's the wealthy
nations who have the resources and the expertise to be able to you know lead the charge yet the
poor developing countries you know are left out wondering well what happened there whereas
this is a way that a developing nation in our case Nauru we also have a similar relationship
with the kingdom of Tonga and Kiribati but this is a way that those developing countries who've had
zero contribution to climate change who've who've done nothing about helping perpetuate this
climate crisis that we're in but allows them to participate and to be able to learn new skills
to create jobs to earn royalties of course and also play an important part in in providing one
of the important solutions so we're about a thousand miles off the coast of Mexico and so
it's a long way from anything but proximity to Nauru is not one of the criteria we could have
equally had one of the African countries sponsor our application or I'm really glad you clarified
that especially because I'm calling from the Republic of Mauritius so here it's also a small
island developing state and I think what you're bringing up here is very important geopolitically
but also in terms of the socioeconomic inequalities in addressing this and so I have a few more
small questions so that everyone was listening is really getting the fuller picture here
but you addressed many of the key issues around an environmental impact assessment with the EIA
there's also the impact of sound in terms of the impact for the whales and for the dolphins
that love to hear your views on that as well and then I'd really love to hear from you whether
you took the compliance route of complying with regulations or you took the corporate
sustainability leadership route of saying look we're not just looking only to comply with what's
expected in order to get a license but we're actually advocating for higher standards and we're
really willing to use ourselves here as a case study to then educate and inform others of how
we can do this in a way that is regenerative and the least amount of impact with that bigger
planetary vision that you you know described so well. No great questions on the topic of sound
you know we've run a very extensive sound campaign with our trials that have just recently
completed and so we look forward to publishing the results early indications are that they're all
very manageable most of the sound of course happens on the surface but there is you know
there's noise generated by the transportation of nodules up the pipe and but there are there are
there are means that we can dampen that noise substantially if required but as it stands now
we're very encouraged by the results that we've seen from those recent trials and so we don't
think noise just just remember we're not breaking anything on the seafloor like these nodules
literally lie there so as long as they're we're having to drill or blast which is conventionally
what happens you know in the oil and gas or the mining industry and so you know very different scenario
so going back on to the path that we took I think it's really important for people to understand
one thing never before has an industry had so much focus before it got started by a regulator
like normally industries get started and then people try and regulate them so here we are
the international seabed authority is made up of 167 member countries plus the european union
it's been established since 1994 like if you if you were I don't know green piece and you had to
imagine had to imagine a regulatory environment I imagine you'd probably say it's something like this
now of course they'll probably say it's not quite good enough but today but but never before has an
industry had so much focus before it's got started so that's encouraging but the other thing I'd like
to make the point of is that don't think if it doesn't happen under the control of the regulator
the international seabed authority don't think these assets won't be exploited
and that's the opportunity for the world today the fact that you've got a regulator in place
and the fact that you've got a company like ourselves I'd like to say we're a really responsible
corporate citizen we've there are guidelines that have been laid down by the regulator on what
we should be looking at from an environmental management perspective because the mandate of
the international seabed authority is really clear it's to put in place exploration and exploitation
regulations a term that's adopted from the land-based mining industry while protecting the marine
environment and so we they provide very strong guidance on what should happen but we always said
we actually want to see that and up at another level and the good news there is that when you set
a standard then generally that becomes a level that people have to attain or exceed and so
I think it's really a positive thing that a we have a regulator that everyone's playing by the
rulebook at the moment and secondly that companies like us are striving towards excellence you know
when we put together our environmental plan we didn't go and hire a heap of scientists so it
could be company prepared we went and sought the very best experts from each discipline and so we
have you know if you go to our website you'll see the array of institutions and universities we have
you know MIT help us we have the University of Hawaii we have the National Oceanography
Center the Natural History Museum it's a really broad range of leading institutions who have put
their expertise and with the help of our money I mean by the time we complete this we will have
spent over a hundred million dollars I mean it's a lot of money we've invested in this it's the
largest fully integrated you know ocean research research program ever done and so you know we
did that because we we we knew that people would say oh yeah but you did it the metals company
whereas we can say hang on you know we bought expertise in from all of these very
outstanding institutions who you know have done the work independently they're free to publish their
results you know we don't put any handcuffs on anyone we now have the CSIRO and the equivalent
agency in New Zealand working with us on putting together an adaptive management plan and that's
going to be exciting too because their recently completed work on the Great Barrier Reef is there
for everyone to see it's amazing the rehabilitation that is happening because there's so many things
to worry about but what are the important things to worry about and so you know what CSIRO and and
then the equivalent agency in New Zealand are helping us with is is deciding what are the
things to measure what are the the boundaries that we need to be mindful of as we move through the
production process so so I'd like to think you know we took a set of guiding principles
and we improved on them and you know knowing that we're going to have the eyes of the world focused
on us which is something we're very very comfortable with and and you know that adaptive management
system we we we pair it with our digital twin because I sometimes hear people say well how on
earth will we know what you're doing a thousand miles offshore four thousand meters below sea level
we won't know what's going on there but but it's the exact opposite I don't know whether you've
ever tried to get near a land-based mine but it's impossible you're met with barbed wire and machine
guns depending which country you're in um whereas we want to let people including the regulator have
eyes and ears to exactly what we're doing so people can see the low level of impact that's
being generated and so it's a different approach so now that we address the the environmental
issues and you know we know what we're talking about our listeners our the target audience are
investors and so this is your floor what do you need from investors how can we support your work
moving forward thank you I see Daniel wanting to to interject but
Daniel there were a handful of environmental topics you touched on that I just think are
important to take one step further before we get into the business case you don't mind so
Gord was just recently mentioning coral and obviously the coral bleaching and
daff issues and how critical coral are to life in the oceans is a topic everyone's aware of
one of the other than very very reef one of the major centers of coral in the world is off the
coast of indonesia which is the other place that the nickel can come in when Gord was saying that
90 plus percent of the ore that gets extracted is a waste product and most of that being a toxic
waste product the waterways that that goes into if the mining tailing dams break which happens all
the time like just look into um mining pollution toxicity mining tailing uh dams breaking just
you do a bit of the study who's mentioning you know 190 billion tons of waste from mining compared
to you know municipal waste at a couple billion tons this is not just looking at that being a
generally toxic issue but specifically in indonesia where both the tropical rainforest on the surface
and the um end of the waterway where the waste would end up going are one of the most
biodiverse on-surface and land areas in the world so that's just a really critical thing to
you know think think about um we know that when we're talking about fracking or tar sands it's
because the really easy oil has already been mostly used up but nobody would go drill offshore for
oil if there was easy oil onshore nobody would do fracking or tar sands but you use up the easy
stuff and then you get into diminishing returns we're in diminishing returns in hydrocarbons
which is why we're doing that stuff which is another reason we have to switch energy sources quickly
but we're also in diminishing returns on so many sources of metals where the highest grade ores
that were closest to the surface got used up that were easiest to get to the ones that are left or
lower grade ore which means more toxicity or in much harder to get to areas which means
having to penetrate deeper into big rainforests and it's not simply the impact let's say we're
talking about going into Indonesia or into the Amazon for mining assets it's not simply how much
of the rainforest has to be destroyed for the road in and the mine I was talking to some environmental
scientists who are working on planetary boundaries and we're looking at biodiversity
writ large doing meta-analysis on all the biodiversity metrics they said that the single
most critical factor that they have found for biodiversity in terms of if there was one thing
that was going to damage biodiversity the most it's the first road that enters into an otherwise
large virgin area because there is a high initial cost to develop the first road in the initial
infrastructure once that's developed for some purpose there's a lower barrier of entry to
be able to go in for other purposes that don't have quite as high a margin so you can go in for
logging and go in for animal agriculture and other things like that once that's developed
but the initial one will usually be developed for mining or for oil or gas or something that
has a much higher price point so it's not only when you're looking at how much carbon is released
and how much carbon sink is damaged in the process of destroying that surface rainforest
and the biodiversity but how much that opens up in terms of all the other industries that's a
really critical topic and in this particular situation you don't have a similar thing because
the seabed authority is not regulating all seamining as the same thing they're all very
different and there aren't a lot of other uses for the seafloor that once you open it up now
people want to go start taking all the other stuff there's not there's silt right like there's silt
and then there happens with these nodules that's another point that I want to open up is that
the regulation being proposed in metals coast position is not pro ocean mining it's a much
more nuanced thing that says pro collection of these polymetallic modules that happen to be
not just profitable metals but key metals for the energy transition of hydrocarbons
that is a critical thing that are also relatively low impact both because they're in an area that
has low biodiversity they're in an area where the same biodiversity is indexed in areas that won't
be mined or affected and where they don't actually have to go into the crust or do any kind of
drilling or cutting there are lots of other types of ocean mining where the cost benefit
environmentally doesn't make sense make sense to do surface mining or to really avoid that
source as a whole so when you say ocean mining as a binary it doesn't make any sense right it's
like saying are you pro or anti-ai will depend on the application there's really terrible applications
or are you pro or anti-synthetic bio depends on the application so that's just another topic I wanted
to bring up it and the last one is when I was a young environmentalist and I would hear about
something like mine the oceans that term would just freak me out right or like mine the rainforest or
and I didn't have the sense that the TV that I was seeing that add on or the computer or phone now
that I'm seeing it on requires a whole bunch of fucking metals that communicate over satellites
fueled by a lot of energy that came from a supply chain that comes from somewhere and what the trade
offs associated are and so the binary of should we mine the oceans or not mine the oceans if we
could just say yes let's just not and there was no alternative you know all negative thing that
would happen of course that would be like yes let's just not but if it is selective highly
regulated mining of a certain type in a certain area for certain purposes or if not doing that
then you have one of a couple options so you don't get the metals that are needed for the
batteries and either now you have to get them from the surface sources and now you're dealing with
look at what the surface sources for the nickel cobalt manganese etc are and look at the fact that
they are largely things that produce much more toxic waste than the nodules do
that have more effects on surface biodiversity and in more biodiversity critical zones of the world
or you say well let's just not have batteries and let's keep all the particular transmission in
the co2 and so then you can make a makeup answer called let's just need less energy well that's
cute but that's just not going to happen unless you get rid of a lot of humans or want the war that
goes along with that and so if you really take the trade-offs and say until someone can present
how to radically degrow GDP and or radically decrease energy without needing to decrease
GDP neither one of which have reliable solutions in the short term then that energy has to come
from somewhere and if you want to get off hydrocarbons and where do those metals come from
those are real questions and so I want the best environmental answers for that I'm willing
for them to not be the best economic answers they just have to be viable enough that the
people motivated by the economics are not motivated to go to war otherwise because of
course or economics can mean disproportionate harm to poor people it can mean a basis for war
of resources but what I would want the environmental scientists and environmental groups and thinkers
to do is to say okay let's really look at the entire trade-off space clearly and well and let's
make sure that we if we're going to object to something that we have a comprehensively better
proposal that we actually know how to enact if our better proposal has no enactability like let's
just decrease the total amount of energy the world can spy a lot that's not actually a solution
so from what I can tell and I would change my position on this if anyone presented something
better there is no realistic way to decrease the energy demands and there is no realistic way to
get off hydrocarbon without increasing the metal amounts and given that we're looking at the trade
offs between sourcing none of which are perfect but in this particular situation seem quite clear
for some of the baseballs what a beautiful way to summarize what has been said and also from
an integral perspective so I really appreciate that particularly because we need to make sure
that we don't look in a naive way into what needs to happen next and so those blind spots have to
be addressed and thank you Gerard I mean the reason why I went into the cost and the investor
the financial support was because I truly see that that you're doing at least as far as humanly
possible in our culture and so within having said that and thank you for the summary Daniel I think
I'd like to know next from you Gerard how can we those of us who have
financial means and focus on that support your work given the fact that you are so integrally
looking at addressing those issues thank you thank you so so we're really about building
a community that supports this movement and you know I was I always enjoy any opportunity to
be on a medium with Daniel because he really does tap into a set of thinkers who are prepared to
think a little bit you know deeper into the the true issues and have a trade-off conversation and
and obviously adding integral thinking into you know this and that being able to access that
community I see is really you know important as we try and find people that want to come and put
their shoulder to the wheel because as Daniel said you know it's complex and also you know as
as he said at the moment this seems to be the best solution and something we always said to our
stakeholders you know if we we have a we have a a set of requirements that we see as need to be
met to keep going on this and one of them is making sure that we do satisfy the requirement
to not harm the environment you know there's nothing that has zero harm but but if we found
that this ecosystem you know would be damaged such that it changed the function of the oceans
then we would have some stop moments we'd be like oh sorry guys we've got new information that needs
us to to pivot to a new look for a new extractive new supply to these important metals but so far
all of the news is encouraging on that so we feel confident but what we really need
people who want to come and join us on this story and and that includes people like you
Mariana who who are prepared to access your network to help us communicate this important story
we obviously we're a public company now we're listed on the NASDAQ our ticker is TMC
for the metals company we've had a pretty rough ride I got to tell you it's been a a hellish ride
as a public company you know as a private company we'd raised money at about a two billion dollar
valuation and then we we became a three billion dollar company but today we're a we're a fraction
of that yet we have a really sticky solid register you know we just raised more money recently and
that mainly came from internal shareholders so we you know we feel confident about our financial
future and all of this the decreasing value of TMC the public company is at a time when our assets
our licenses are becoming more and more valuable you know the first area that we're developing
is nori area d and that represents about 22 percent of our defined resource because we've
we've already identified about 1.6 billion tons of these on two of our license areas and so we're
we're compliant with the canadian resource reporting standard and the resource certainty is
really high because they're two-dimensional they lie on the ocean floor so you can see them
but the the economics for that first block nori area d that's 22 percent of our defined resource
has a net present value today of more than 15 billion dollars you know and and if we were a
land-based project at the same stage of development the value of our company would be between about
0.2 and 0.7 times that nav so 0.2 or 0.7 times 15 billion dollars yet our value is not that it's
it's more like it's like 0.01 percent of the nav and so a bit more than that but 0.015 so that seems
wrong so there's a disconnect you know and about 60 percent of the register is really sticky like
people like myself and all sees and our largest shareholder from uh san francisco a family office
who've been you know so really committed people who are not looking at this as a trade to make
money they're in this for the long term and so what we really want to do is to get more people
to come and join us on this journey to buy the shares to share us into their community
such that we can you know have discussions like this so we can find people who have a willingness
to come and learn more and to come and support this new industry and it's very rare that you
can be at the beginning of a new industry but that's where we are like and this is a really
exciting time because you know it's it's one analogy is you know offshore oil and gas once
upon a time there was no offshore oil and gas and then in the blink of an eye 30 percent of
oil and gas supplies came offshore I think it could be even more aggressive when it comes to
uh these metals when it comes to nickel and cobalt and manganese that more this more supply
could come out of the ocean so I'm very encouraged by that so um so yeah that's I think there are
many many different ways and um you know I think getting people to buy the stock and getting people
to to talk about the story and to come and be inquisitive and and to want to learn more and
allow us to to talk to their networks important networks of of thinkers
is the areas that can help us most we are talking to a broad range of strategic partners now
because one of the ways companies like ours finance their future activities is by inviting
other companies to come and invest at the asset so not into our topco because obviously we think
the stock is hugely devalued so we don't want to be issuing more shares what we want to do is to
unlock some of that 15 billion dollars of net present value and so you know I mentioned that
our last earnings call that we're talking to a variety of strategic names about earning into
those assets and and that's a way that you know we can avoid dilution, invite strategic names in
who can help us with capital and expertise as needed to start developing these important assets.
Well thank you so very much Gerard and you know as an investor I know how values decrease
like that and I I can only imagine you know what you've been going through over the past
12 years but Daniel had a question that goes in that direction Daniel one or two.
Yeah just in in case it's not obvious do you want to say why you believe the stock value
went down because obviously if you're asking people to invest it's based on the idea that the
stock value is going to go up and in addition to investment what else would create a turnaround
than that? Yeah no certainly look the the main issue that people have about you know our valuation
is the fact that the final regulations have not been adopted yet so at the moment we have exploration
licenses and the that allows us to apply for an exploitation license over those same defined areas
and so so if you like we've been busy putting the cart beside the horse along the way maybe even in
front of the horse sometimes but the final exploitation code is due to be adopted later
this year and that is they are the rules that will allow us to then submit our application
and move from exploration to extraction phase and so obviously the moment that happens
that massively opens up the value of those assets we we already have our first production asset
the hidden gem so the boat that we are out on our license area with last year that was owned
and operated by All Seas will also be our first production asset when once we receive the commercial
permit to move ahead and so I think that's the main gating item now of course there were some
other things when we became a public company you know we had you know a short report came out
we had a funding short for what about the major investors who'd committed to investing
would bankrupt and so that was a problem for us we we went public via a merger with a SPAC
which in 2020 was all the rage when we announced our deal on March 4 2021 we were kind of the
last SPAC to get through the gates and the SEC really turned their focus on SPACs because there
are a lot of crazy businesses that went public through SPACs you know I would never invest in them
because they weren't underwritten by tangible assets you know there were there were pipe dreams
so that meant we went public thinking we were going to raise about $600 million but the redemption
rate of our SPAC went from you know low single digits in the year 2020 all of a sudden in 2021
redemption rates went back to normal which were very very high so a lot of the money that we thought
we were raising either redeemed or in the case of our default HIN investor defaulted so it meant we
raised $137 million instead of 600 so that meant you know that was a real you know kick in the
teeth and we had to decide well what do we do do we do we proceed and remain a private company
or do we proceed and become a public company we decided to stay on the public path we it provided
us enough money to keep the program on track and and amazingly thank you to an amazing team
we've kept the program on track so we still are committed to first production at the end of 2024
now we're the beginning of 2023 so at the end of next year we
for some reason we lost Gerard I see that
so while he was describing his challenges with with you know a startup I could only
refer to or think back to what we experienced with the energy turnaround startup and I originally
wanted to have the you know co-founder be with us because he would have brought a different
you know regulatory aspect from an industry that is just you know starting to get involved
in how the current regulators are basically doing everything and anything to prevent you from
from being successful so Gerard actually elaborated that so as a serial entrepreneur
as an investor for more than 30 years I I so can sympathize with what Gerard has been going to
through and you know I know if I remember correctly you invested several tens of millions
of your own money into this company because you believe in it and that's basically the best way
the best confirmation for investors if the founder you know puts all of his eggs into one basket
then that's the way to go and so I can only encourage everyone and anyone who is listening
to this to really join forces with us so Aniluz Daniel do you have any more questions for Gerard
I had one quick thing I was going to say is at one point Gerard said
don't think that the resources won't be collected or exploited at some point through some process
the orientation for growth and the need of the metals and growth seems and the
you know nodules having a straightforward method to collect them that has only been legally hung
up and the market demand on those continuing to increase makes it seem really crystal clear
those will become a collected asset so then the question is how environmentally well is it
regulated and let's say you know we already see people working on
geoengineering involving solar radiation aerosols in the upper atmosphere that might have
unbelievably huge environmental consequences out of a kind of like
terror associated with climate change when you start to get in really back against the wall
positions then you move forward in less conscious ways and I can see the world moving forward in
less conscious way with regard to this when it becomes you know critical that it's needed late
I would actually really rather have the regulatory pathway be quite strict like I would like very
strict environmental regulation I would like other submersibles down there that are monitoring
the ocean quality and monitoring the plumes and monitoring the biodiversity and everything is good
which means that I would like a company that is actually really invested in that helping to
open up the initial regulatory pathway that says actually we're not trying to talk you into using
lobbying efforts decreasing regulatory standards we actually want you to increase the regulatory
standards so that then whether it's the major Chinese mining companies or its Lockheed or any
of the other companies that might not have as much environmental motivation themselves they're
actually who they're now bound to do it by a regulatory process that has transparency so
there does seem to be an inevitability argument that then what is the best way to do it
it feels like an important part of this that I wanted to also mention
Thank you Daniel and I'd like to also you know give the word again to Jard who was cut off from
you know using this beautiful technology of the future from our conversation so
to finish his sentence in terms of you know the hard time that he went through and
how he would like to move forward and how we can support him. No thank you well well I was just
finishing up saying that you know despite the the headwinds you know we've kept a team very very
glued together around the mission like mission alignment is 10 out of 10 with our entire team
and you know in a very hot employment labor market you know we've been able to keep people in a
really difficult you know difficult industry that's often under attack because they're so
mission aligned with the importance of this and you know it's also very exciting being part of
a new industry and it takes a little bit of stubbornness and determination to be able to stay
the course on this one when you have so many you know you know hand grenades coming at you
from different directions but you know the prize is a big one from a planetary perspective you
know of course the fiscal stuff will work out for itself we are operating in the for-profit
environment you know one of the things I didn't mention is you know the pace at which we have
been able to complete our science you know we have been you know we've had boats on the water
approaching 900 days now you know with the focus being science and that's because we've had a
you know we know how to develop commercial projects but we've had a very integrated privately
funded science program whereas a lot of these science programs tend to be funded by grants a
lot of the other contractors you know they'll do a campaign this year another campaign a couple
of years time I mean in 2020 we had our boat on the water four times these were campaigns that
ran six to eight weeks in 2021 we had our we ran five campaigns similar time frames so we've been
really really busy and we were able to really pin our ears back during COVID as well because we'd
raise some money privately and we were well funded and we knew that it would be a challenging time
COVID but we created this bubble you know and we didn't lose a single day through COVID and we were
able to achieve amazing progress that allowed us to become you know to get through the public
company process so so look it's a it's a company that that I think you know will benefit by being
exposed to you know this community and so I really thank you for giving me the opportunity of of
talking today and to exposing the story to an important group of critical thinkers so thank you
thanks so much Gerard also Daniel for you know really mapping out that complexity
that so often gets flattened and Gerard really stood out for me in this conversation that you
said join us on the journey that is also essential for cultivating trust because there's transparency
in there's openness so perhaps in closing can you let us know some of the ways in which we can
join you on the journey I started already exploring your Vimeo channel and going through
the videos which was really informative yeah other ways that we can join you on the journey
well I think we have a really rich resource center at our website at metals.co and if you go to the
to the FAQs there you'll see us address many of the things that are probably going to cross
your mind you know the the tricky questions about why we're doing this and and impacts and so on
and you know as you mentioned we have a rich video library we've you know we had filmographers
on the boats you know we we always do because we really want to catalog this journey so people can
at least feel they're part of it and so you know come up the knowledge curve but we really need
action as well you know it's if the result of this call is that everyone's a little bit better
informed than I failed I really need people to get involved and how you can get involved is
send me an email at gerard at metals.co buy the stock think about your community that you can
tell about this important story you might have people that just you think could have their own
platform that we could do a repeat session such as we're doing today if it can reach a broader
audience and I know that when Daniel first suggested Mariana to me it was it was because
of your work with the integral thinking it was because of your work with Club of Rome and it
was because of your network you know around the world that he would really said this is a really
important session Gerard and and and you know I'm I'm grateful for that because you know sometimes
it feels like it's one conversation at a time but obviously if that can lead to a thousand to a
million then that's the journey that I really need some help from people on and and and you know
we're making tremendous progress on the project as I mentioned I think we're really well squared
away there but this the challenge of communicating this to the broader market and the investing
community is something that clearly look at our stock price we haven't done well enough at
but the business that underlies it is in great shape and we feel very confident about the
direction we're heading we don't have all the answers yet you know and that's why we're spending
the money and you know we're we're we're moving ahead I think in a very precautionary sense but
with a commercial imperative because you know this this crisis is not something to think about it's
here you know we we really need to be taking progressive steps to be dealing with it and
you know we tend to be you know we are solutions oriented and we you know we think this is going
to be one of the most important answers certainly to the metal crisis and so yeah
Daniel one of the things I actually really like about this particular situation that
I find interesting about it that almost all entrepreneurs would find infinitely frustrating
is I like that it actually has to pass through a regulatory process that is looking at environmental
and social and other forms of externality possibilities first because that's actually
something that I propose as necessary for all industries in the world moving forward to make
it the metacrisis if you look at when Jared was saying this is kind of unique in that typically
a company will move forward advance new stuff and then the problems get regulated later obviously
four out of five doctors used to choose camel cigarettes and it wasn't until you know so much
lung cancer death that finally regulation happened there and the same was true with
pesticides and DDT and whatever with leaded gasoline um you remember in the 50s people
spraying DDT on everything right it was just mosquito on themselves food and and Rachel
Carson had to work so hard and then when we finally banned it all the harm had already occurred
but the 2030 80 years that it takes afterwards with things that have faster and faster effects
like effects of synthetic bio and AI it just won't work by the time that the harm is that clear
the world will be destroyed so we actually have to move to a place where with new technologies
that can have such a rapid effect on the world we do the process to anticipate the unanticipated
end order effects and figure out the right paths for the commercialization of the technology
with a regulatory process so that is actually something that I think the world will have to
move to to make it out of the metacrisis of course that means we have to have regulation
that is both effective and competent and that we trust and there's lots of things involved in that
so I want to see super strict regulation here I want to see a company that really cares about
that with independent oversight from MIT and oceanographic institutes looking at it
and I do want to see very complex comparisons of the trade-offs between surface mining and
alternative energy storage technologies and all of those things one of the things that had me
actually make friends with Gerard and Erica who's not on the call but is brilliant
and why they kind of picked the name metalsco is that like the moment we can get these metals
from recycled sources because there are enough metals we'll switch and not do them from sea
sources if there was a better source we would move to that the key is actually how do we
create a closed loop material economy a closed loop material economy writ large takes a fuck
ton of energy the big challenges so if to survive planetary boundaries we need to make a closed
loop materials economy so we're not making anything from virgin resources and turning it
into trash and pollution and we have to make a closed materials economy with renewable energy
then being able to boot the renewable energy system to close loop everything else is one
of the first kind of big keys to that and I think one of the places where challenges occurred like
you know I know other major multinational type companies that would invest less in science and
more in lobbying the international seabed authority and other groups I'm sure will work to do that I
actually really like a group that is focused on the science to work you know the process formally
but obviously when there's a negative environmental narrative that makes it risky
for investors and I one of the things that I respect is that you know they have invested
in having some of the best ocean scientists and conservationists on their team working on how do
you in order to do this well how do you make it different and it has involved changes to the original
tech significantly based on how to really do it properly I had a conversation with Jordan
Gregory Stone around that there was like really interesting topics of how to make sure that the
thermal clients and the salient clients are protected as vertical movement is happening how
do you test all the heavy metals and the sediment to make sure how do you make sure that the
biodiversity is indexed well just all those topics in depth and they have held the position that any
environmental scientists or environmental groups that want to come talk with them and have an
earnest conversation privately or publicly can privately and they won't comment on it publicly
in front of an open debate happy to do so and I would feel very happy to see anyone do that and
do it with the frames that say not just do the thing or don't do the thing but really engage
with the complexity of the trade-offs of the space and in so far as anyone really could propose a
comprehensively better approach to meet the world's needs I know that this company would look at how
to leverage its assets to change which why I like them as people and if no one does have a
comprehensively better approach then I think being good environmentalists obligates saying wow if this
is the best inactable approach we can currently see for the environment writ large and we don't
just care about the environment of this area or this metric but comprehensively then let's be
clear on that and so the other thing I would invite is anyone who has environmental concerns to
actually engage in conversation not just you know hit pieces but like actually have a debate publicly
or reach out privately and you know whether Gerard or the scientists on the team that are
happy to have those conversations and happy to publicly you know document those conversations
absolutely brilliant well we are coming slowly but surely to the end of this
extraordinary podcast I've learned so much and I'm deeply grateful to be connected with you and
be a tiny little vehicle for taking the word out into a world that needs to get better informed
and maybe as it just is a not very small side note Anna-Luc and I are members of the resource
transition group together with the other major members of the club of Rome it's a European
initiative and which is the reason why she and I were very excited to engage in this conversation
and we're deeply grateful for this beautiful example of addressing the metacrisis by bringing
in people who have shifted already their minds and are providing solutions and are open to the
regulatory necessities that this transition require in order to create a better more integral
world for us so I would like to thank all of you for being part of this and and I couldn't be more
grateful for knowing you and I know the world is better because you exist because we all know that
on a round planet there is no choosing upsides we're all in the same boat and so please engage
with us in a positive way to create a better world thank you everybody
