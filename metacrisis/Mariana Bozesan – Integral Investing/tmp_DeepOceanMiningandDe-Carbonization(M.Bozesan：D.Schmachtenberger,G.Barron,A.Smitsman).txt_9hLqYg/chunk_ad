I would actually really rather have the regulatory pathway be quite strict like I would like very
strict environmental regulation I would like other submersibles down there that are monitoring
the ocean quality and monitoring the plumes and monitoring the biodiversity and everything is good
which means that I would like a company that is actually really invested in that helping to
open up the initial regulatory pathway that says actually we're not trying to talk you into using
lobbying efforts decreasing regulatory standards we actually want you to increase the regulatory
standards so that then whether it's the major Chinese mining companies or its Lockheed or any
of the other companies that might not have as much environmental motivation themselves they're
actually who they're now bound to do it by a regulatory process that has transparency so
there does seem to be an inevitability argument that then what is the best way to do it
it feels like an important part of this that I wanted to also mention
Thank you Daniel and I'd like to also you know give the word again to Jard who was cut off from
you know using this beautiful technology of the future from our conversation so
to finish his sentence in terms of you know the hard time that he went through and
how he would like to move forward and how we can support him. No thank you well well I was just
finishing up saying that you know despite the the headwinds you know we've kept a team very very
glued together around the mission like mission alignment is 10 out of 10 with our entire team
and you know in a very hot employment labor market you know we've been able to keep people in a
really difficult you know difficult industry that's often under attack because they're so
mission aligned with the importance of this and you know it's also very exciting being part of
a new industry and it takes a little bit of stubbornness and determination to be able to stay
the course on this one when you have so many you know you know hand grenades coming at you
from different directions but you know the prize is a big one from a planetary perspective you
know of course the fiscal stuff will work out for itself we are operating in the for-profit
environment you know one of the things I didn't mention is you know the pace at which we have
been able to complete our science you know we have been you know we've had boats on the water
approaching 900 days now you know with the focus being science and that's because we've had a
you know we know how to develop commercial projects but we've had a very integrated privately
funded science program whereas a lot of these science programs tend to be funded by grants a
lot of the other contractors you know they'll do a campaign this year another campaign a couple
of years time I mean in 2020 we had our boat on the water four times these were campaigns that
ran six to eight weeks in 2021 we had our we ran five campaigns similar time frames so we've been
really really busy and we were able to really pin our ears back during COVID as well because we'd
raise some money privately and we were well funded and we knew that it would be a challenging time
COVID but we created this bubble you know and we didn't lose a single day through COVID and we were
able to achieve amazing progress that allowed us to become you know to get through the public
company process so so look it's a it's a company that that I think you know will benefit by being
exposed to you know this community and so I really thank you for giving me the opportunity of of
talking today and to exposing the story to an important group of critical thinkers so thank you
thanks so much Gerard also Daniel for you know really mapping out that complexity
that so often gets flattened and Gerard really stood out for me in this conversation that you
said join us on the journey that is also essential for cultivating trust because there's transparency
in there's openness so perhaps in closing can you let us know some of the ways in which we can
join you on the journey I started already exploring your Vimeo channel and going through
the videos which was really informative yeah other ways that we can join you on the journey
well I think we have a really rich resource center at our website at metals.co and if you go to the
to the FAQs there you'll see us address many of the things that are probably going to cross
your mind you know the the tricky questions about why we're doing this and and impacts and so on
and you know as you mentioned we have a rich video library we've you know we had filmographers
on the boats you know we we always do because we really want to catalog this journey so people can
at least feel they're part of it and so you know come up the knowledge curve but we really need
action as well you know it's if the result of this call is that everyone's a little bit better
informed than I failed I really need people to get involved and how you can get involved is
send me an email at gerard at metals.co buy the stock think about your community that you can
tell about this important story you might have people that just you think could have their own
platform that we could do a repeat session such as we're doing today if it can reach a broader
audience and I know that when Daniel first suggested Mariana to me it was it was because
of your work with the integral thinking it was because of your work with Club of Rome and it
was because of your network you know around the world that he would really said this is a really
important session Gerard and and and you know I'm I'm grateful for that because you know sometimes
it feels like it's one conversation at a time but obviously if that can lead to a thousand to a
million then that's the journey that I really need some help from people on and and and you know
we're making tremendous progress on the project as I mentioned I think we're really well squared
away there but this the challenge of communicating this to the broader market and the investing
community is something that clearly look at our stock price we haven't done well enough at
but the business that underlies it is in great shape and we feel very confident about the
direction we're heading we don't have all the answers yet you know and that's why we're spending
the money and you know we're we're we're moving ahead I think in a very precautionary sense but
with a commercial imperative because you know this this crisis is not something to think about it's
here you know we we really need to be taking progressive steps to be dealing with it and
you know we tend to be you know we are solutions oriented and we you know we think this is going
to be one of the most important answers certainly to the metal crisis and so yeah
Daniel one of the things I actually really like about this particular situation that
I find interesting about it that almost all entrepreneurs would find infinitely frustrating
is I like that it actually has to pass through a regulatory process that is looking at environmental
and social and other forms of externality possibilities first because that's actually
something that I propose as necessary for all industries in the world moving forward to make
it the metacrisis if you look at when Jared was saying this is kind of unique in that typically
a company will move forward advance new stuff and then the problems get regulated later obviously
four out of five doctors used to choose camel cigarettes and it wasn't until you know so much
lung cancer death that finally regulation happened there and the same was true with
pesticides and DDT and whatever with leaded gasoline um you remember in the 50s people
spraying DDT on everything right it was just mosquito on themselves food and and Rachel
Carson had to work so hard and then when we finally banned it all the harm had already occurred
but the 2030 80 years that it takes afterwards with things that have faster and faster effects
like effects of synthetic bio and AI it just won't work by the time that the harm is that clear
the world will be destroyed so we actually have to move to a place where with new technologies
that can have such a rapid effect on the world we do the process to anticipate the unanticipated
end order effects and figure out the right paths for the commercialization of the technology
with a regulatory process so that is actually something that I think the world will have to
move to to make it out of the metacrisis of course that means we have to have regulation
that is both effective and competent and that we trust and there's lots of things involved in that
so I want to see super strict regulation here I want to see a company that really cares about
that with independent oversight from MIT and oceanographic institutes looking at it
and I do want to see very complex comparisons of the trade-offs between surface mining and
alternative energy storage technologies and all of those things one of the things that had me
actually make friends with Gerard and Erica who's not on the call but is brilliant
and why they kind of picked the name metalsco is that like the moment we can get these metals
from recycled sources because there are enough metals we'll switch and not do them from sea
sources if there was a better source we would move to that the key is actually how do we
create a closed loop material economy a closed loop material economy writ large takes a fuck
ton of energy the big challenges so if to survive planetary boundaries we need to make a closed
loop materials economy so we're not making anything from virgin resources and turning it
into trash and pollution and we have to make a closed materials economy with renewable energy
then being able to boot the renewable energy system to close loop everything else is one
of the first kind of big keys to that and I think one of the places where challenges occurred like
you know I know other major multinational type companies that would invest less in science and
more in lobbying the international seabed authority and other groups I'm sure will work to do that I
actually really like a group that is focused on the science to work you know the process formally
but obviously when there's a negative environmental narrative that makes it risky
for investors and I one of the things that I respect is that you know they have invested
in having some of the best ocean scientists and conservationists on their team working on how do
you in order to do this well how do you make it different and it has involved changes to the original
tech significantly based on how to really do it properly I had a conversation with Jordan
Gregory Stone around that there was like really interesting topics of how to make sure that the
thermal clients and the salient clients are protected as vertical movement is happening how
do you test all the heavy metals and the sediment to make sure how do you make sure that the
biodiversity is indexed well just all those topics in depth and they have held the position that any
environmental scientists or environmental groups that want to come talk with them and have an
earnest conversation privately or publicly can privately and they won't comment on it publicly
in front of an open debate happy to do so and I would feel very happy to see anyone do that and
do it with the frames that say not just do the thing or don't do the thing but really engage
with the complexity of the trade-offs of the space and in so far as anyone really could propose a
comprehensively better approach to meet the world's needs I know that this company would look at how
to leverage its assets to change which why I like them as people and if no one does have a
comprehensively better approach then I think being good environmentalists obligates saying wow if this
is the best inactable approach we can currently see for the environment writ large and we don't
just care about the environment of this area or this metric but comprehensively then let's be
clear on that and so the other thing I would invite is anyone who has environmental concerns to
actually engage in conversation not just you know hit pieces but like actually have a debate publicly
or reach out privately and you know whether Gerard or the scientists on the team that are
happy to have those conversations and happy to publicly you know document those conversations
absolutely brilliant well we are coming slowly but surely to the end of this
extraordinary podcast I've learned so much and I'm deeply grateful to be connected with you and
be a tiny little vehicle for taking the word out into a world that needs to get better informed
and maybe as it just is a not very small side note Anna-Luc and I are members of the resource
transition group together with the other major members of the club of Rome it's a European
initiative and which is the reason why she and I were very excited to engage in this conversation
and we're deeply grateful for this beautiful example of addressing the metacrisis by bringing
in people who have shifted already their minds and are providing solutions and are open to the
regulatory necessities that this transition require in order to create a better more integral
world for us so I would like to thank all of you for being part of this and and I couldn't be more
grateful for knowing you and I know the world is better because you exist because we all know that
on a round planet there is no choosing upsides we're all in the same boat and so please engage
with us in a positive way to create a better world thank you everybody
