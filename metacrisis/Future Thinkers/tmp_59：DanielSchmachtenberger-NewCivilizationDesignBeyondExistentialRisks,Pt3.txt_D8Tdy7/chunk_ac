else's and as soon as I do that I actually dissociate from just being my personality
and then I get some more spaciousness around it and less reactive by it.
And this also relates to not just looking through the lens of different personalities
or different modern frameworks it is also looking through the lens of pre-modern frameworks
or even animal frameworks and that can all be very useful as well because if we look
at the world through the lens of quote unquote primitive tribe then different things come
into focus and different things become very meaningful and very powerfully meaningful
like it resonates through your whole being just you know wow.
And that is not to be dismissed because there is something there.
At the very minimum for self-discovery it is super useful because you know we spent
more time as those primitive versions of ourselves than we have the modern versions
and you can kind of untie a lot of behaviors that you don't really realize you have based
off of just looking at the world from a primitive standpoint.
Well if your chair has some people decide to go visit the Amazon and live with the tribe
and experience the world through those eyes and be affected by it and then look at how
they can incorporate elements of that experience of the world and their previous experience
of the world to being able to live more fully that would be beautiful.
This is wonderful I really appreciate being here with you both and I just I really do
want to say that I love your podcast and I love what you're creating both of you together.
It's very easy to have well informed dystopian views and it's easy to not think about things
or it's easy to have poorly informed positive views but to have well informed positive views
is actually tricky because if we keep being anything like the kinds of people that we
have always been that do really wonderful and really atrocious shit with our power but
having exponentially more power they're all dystopian scenarios and so we have to be something
really different than we've ever been which requires some type of deep shifts that could
make that happen that requires some deep thinking right some deep imagination and I know that's
what you are really dedicated to doing here on the show and reminded of this quote from
the book of Romans it says the pathway to heaven is narrow and steep and the pathway
to hell is wide and many and it's kind of just like a way of thinking about thermodynamics
which is that there's just more ways to break shit than to build it there's like not that
many ways this all the cells in your body can come together that make you with the emergent
property of you there's a lot of ways that you just get like 150 pounds of goo and so
say like okay we've got a lot of power and most of those scenarios with a lot of power
suck how could we have this much power that doesn't suck how could we have this much power
not use it against each other and we start seeing Orwell and control systems when we
start seeing how that sucks too and to keep thinking through how could we have it that
doesn't suck and I can't depend on aliens or Jesus what coming back like well how do
we get us to be that kind of consciousness it's a really good way of thinking about how
to actually address these problems because if we can't know Voltaire's without vision
man perishes if we can't even see a well grounded positive future and positive use of the technological
capacity we have we are not going to make it and so I love that you all have this space
dedicated to exploring that topic incentive is always evil to Mitch so I don't want to
move from perverse incentive to positive incentive positive incentive means my sense making has
determined what I think is good and I'm going to try and extrinsically override your sense
making to make a choice aligned with my sense making I'm going to use a extrinsic reward
strategy to co-opt your sovereignty and have your choice making be based on my sense making
incentive schema rather than your own sense making and that is always the basis of evil
if I want to have a collective intelligence it's actually intelligent I need everyone
to have intrinsic sense making and choice making that is uncorruptible which means it's
not being co-opted by extrinsic reward and punishment schemas I got this wrong at first
I used to say we have to create a world where the incentive of every agent is rigorously
aligned with the well-being of every other agent and of the commons that is wrong what
is right is to say that we must rigorously remove any place where the incentive of an
agent is misaligned with the well-being of other agents in the commons but a adequate
future is one that has no system of structural incentive oh that's a mindblower the cells
in your body are actually not trying to get the other ones to do what they want them to
do they have their own internal sense making processes and they do what makes sense to
them and what makes sense to them also happens to be what's good for the ones around them
because they depend on the ones around them and vice versa and they're in a communication
process but the brain is not overriding the cells and in no way could handle the complexity
necessary of the cells not doing their own sense making and so better incentive schemas
as a transition which is happening in the blockchain is nice it's worse than more verse
incentives but it is transitional not post-transitional it actually does not address existential risk
it doesn't give us the right collective intelligence the right collective intelligence has to be
fractal sovereignty meaning at the level of an individual and every group size it has
its own intact sense making and choice making that ends up being vectoring towards omnic
consideration level of shit that we're talking about is hard to imagine yeah and what has
to be invented to even begin a transition and then be put to rest so that the next version
can come along is such a long road the reason that we incent people is because we have a
civilization that needs a lot of shit done that is not fun it's dreadful stuff so we
want to get the people to do the dreadful stuff if we created a commonwealth where everyone
had access to resources then nobody would do the dreadful stuff and so then the state
would have to force them that's why we don't like communism then you get the state imperialism
so we say okay cool we'll let the free market force them instead it's economic servitude
but at least that doesn't look like somebody did it because the market is just anonymous
thing right if you don't do the shitty job your homeless and your kids can't eat cool
but we'll tell you the story that you can work your way up and you know become wealthy
even though statistically we know that it's silly it happened to those two guys at one
time even though statistically the rest of the time having more resources makes it easier
to make more resources and having less resources makes it harder to make more resources and
so the system has a gradient that makes it actually continue in the direction of inequality
and not the you know otherwise but so that's where incentive came from right was that's
the good side the negative side is a few controlling a many want to use incentive reward and punishment
and to get people to do the shitty things we have to do that this is using choice to
create a system of causation incentive is a causal system game theory is a causal system
to control the choice of others controller co-op I want to have my theory of choice affect
causal dynamics that are only causal i.e. if I make an automated robot I haven't actually
made a sentient being a utility so I'm going to say something even deeper which is instrumental
relationships are evil can you expand that yeah I'm interacting with you to meet some
people that you know to get my network ahead or to get some knowledge from you or to gain
access to something or to whatever it is I have something that I want to do that you
are an instrument towards you are a path towards it's a utilitarian ethic then you are a ends
to a means for me so however I relate with you however to affect your own sovereign sentient
experience is a place I might externalize harm because it's not why I'm relating with
you yeah yeah and so in a healthy world world of the future other people need to have intrinsic
value independent of utilitarian value to everyone that's a part of the culture and
not just the other people and other beings all kinds of sentient beings but relationships
have intrinsic value so I'm going to invest in the integrity of our relationship independent
of me getting anything out of it because it is actually the basis of meaningfulness itself
which is why in a utilitarian and instrumental dynamic we're getting ahead while feeling
utterly fucking meaningless and destroying everything that is meaningful in the process
that is us being hooked to addiction to a stupid game where what we think we want is
not not what we actually want and what we think of as a win is actually a omnistupid thing
and this is why you know like the Hindu concept of Dharma was a virtue ethic not a utilitarian
ethic and and there was a very meaningful set of concepts of do what is inherently right
in your relationship with life independent of what the outcome might be because you really
don't know what the fucking outcome is going to be and if you try and just figure out the
outcome is going to be you're going to be wrong a lot of times and you're also going
to justify a lot of unethical stuff and utilitarianism is kind of the rampant ethics that anyone
who's paying attention to ethics pays attention to right now and it's not without any merit
but it is also problematic it is up there with democracy and capitalism you know in
the philosophy of science in terms of being a problematic thing to be the dominant system
because we cannot actually predict in complex systems well enough to do a utilitarian thing
and they intrinsic dynamics of a relationship and another being end up becoming moved to
being a means to an ends other than them and as soon as I start factoring everything meaningful
along the chain of whatever I think my outcome is to where my outcome is actually being in a way
that is an integrity with an honoring of all life now it's a virtue ethic. Yeah I was having
this conversation recently about people who are obsessed with life hacking and optimizing everything
and when they get into that mindset eventually they get to what what they call optimizing
relationships and then they start putting people on a value hierarchy where they want to interact
with high value people and they want to get a high value woman and they're using these tactics
to find and attract the most high value woman and it's funny because those people in my experience
are some of the most existentially unhappy people that I've met and they will never
demonstrate it outward in an outward way but that's what I've noticed that you know people who try to
optimize everything in this kind of utilitarian way end up really profoundly unhappy. Yeah what's
the same thing as continuously pursuing a better high it's I'm getting a hit from winning at a
particular thing so I gotta try and win at it all the time but I need the hit because my baseline
is that life feels fucking meaningless because I don't actually have any real relationships and
they're I don't even know what meaning means. I don't even know what intimacy means and so
that hyponormal environment needs a hypernormal stimuli to feel anything and then the fact that I
use people instrumentally has people end up not liking me which makes me hurt even more which
makes me want another hit even more. People like you make it super easy you just come on and it's
like we listen to audiobooks all day and then we get to actually talk to the person who is coming
up with the cutting-edge ideas themselves so it's quite interesting thank you. It's always wonderful
getting our brains blown by you thank you. Thank you both this was really fun.
