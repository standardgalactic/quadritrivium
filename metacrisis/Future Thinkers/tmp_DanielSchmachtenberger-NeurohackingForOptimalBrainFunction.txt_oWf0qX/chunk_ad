get it down until we get to huge economies of scale and we're and owning our own supply chain
without cutting quality because I run a bunch of additional steps of testing to make sure that
there's you know optimized purity and potency and that no mycotoxin or whatever got into the
supply and manufacturing and use forms that are more expensive forms of all the ingredients and
you know amounts that are actually meaningful which is expensive so part of it is when you're
working within those structures knowing what your mission is very clearly so your mission is not
delivering returns to shareholders first it's actually delivering meaningful technology to
enrich people's lives and if you don't have something that'll do that you just don't do it
that's a really key first part of it right and then being able to grow while maintaining control
of that mission is a key part of it how else we're working with those metastructures well
we open source our information so as far as IP we just don't believe in it so rather than say we
have a proprietary blend of this number of milligrams of things we just have the exact
number of milligrams of the exact sources and all the sourcing info so if anyone wants to just go
buy the raw ingredients and make it themselves they're welcome to if someone wants to try and
make a better formula they can because we just want to support the field advancing for optimized
human well-being as best as possible and so that's we have a strong open source take on everything IP
and then reinvesting our capital and developing new technologies and really focusing on
not where is the highest profit margin technology but what are the technologies that will really
make the biggest difference in addressing the things that cause most suffering that are the least
well-addressed currently all right on this bright and shiny note we're gonna end this episode we
