get in food and if you're eating a healthy diet you'll be getting more of them than not but they're
nutrients that either are very commonly deficient even in good diets for a number of reasons so certain
trace minerals that are important for brain function they're just deficient in soil even
organic soil is still very different than before the soil originally went through a bunch of uh
monocropping and plants can't make minerals right they're gonna pull up the minerals that are in
the soil similarly if the soil is deficient in microbiota it's going to affect the plant chemistry
if the plant's been hybridized so if there are common deficiencies and certain nutrients that
are necessary for cognitive capacity or sleep or something like that making sure that there's enough
of them that's just augmenting eating and that doesn't mean that you can then eat poorly right
that's why we use the word supplement right is that it is too supplement to be in addition to
because what someone takes a few grams of in pills compared to what they're taking like
pounds of in food there's no way that that's going to replace the primary effect but it can
meaningfully add to it but also just like if someone is going to be using some function a lot more
than an evolutionary environment would have had them use that function right so if athletically
someone's going to be sweating a lot more they're going to lose electrolytes faster so we give them
electrolytes and it actually makes a difference or they're going to be using branched chain amino
acids to build skeletal muscle more if they're tearing down skeletal muscle so we supplement
branched chain amino there are nutrients that get used faster when someone is in certain kinds
of cognitive process so if they want to spend a lot of time in peak cognitive process they're
going to burn through those quicker so you want to supplement those brain nutrients and that is
just the body's going to convert those so say the the amino acids that can get converted to
neurotransmitters the vitamins and minerals that are involved in the conversion process the body's
going to convert them as it needs them but you're not going to have nutrition be a rate limiting
factor so that's obviously working with endogenous pathway support there are other things where
say we are looking at the acetylcholine pathway has a lot to do with memory and learning
and sensory motor function speed of neural communication so the body's producing acetylcholine
it's moving across synapses it's getting received in the postsynaptic receptors we can give plants or
chemicals that modulate that process but that modulate the process in a much more holistic way
than say traditional psychopharmacologic approaches which is a single drug intervention
that's going to affect one part right like a Adderall being a presynaptic dopamine agonist and
then not necessarily looking at how that works within the whole dopamine cycle and how dopamine
relates to norepinephrine and epinephrine and serotonin the rest of the whole rest of neurotransmission
so we want to look at if we're going to affect a neurotransmitter we want to look at the entire
cycle of that transmitter we want to look at the cellular processes of the pre and postsynaptic
neuron and we want to look at all the other transmitters and signaling chemicals that it's in
relationship with and make sure that we're actually supporting a holistic process right and so
you've got to factor if you're wanting to be able to run more acetylcholine through the system
the body's ability to acetylate the choline so that you have enough acetyl group you have
choline certain source of choline can go to the peripheral neuron or to the central nervous system
so depending upon what you want to do you do that differently and then there are you know rate
limiting cofactors like for that one it happens to be b5 so you want to make sure that's not going
to be rate limiting but then the acetylcholine getting across the synapse you have enzymes that
are breaking it down just like you have enzymes that are breaking down dopamine or serotonin so
you know many of the pharmaceutical meds that affect transmitter levels are working by modulating
what's happening in the synaptic cleft right reuptake inhibitor so if someone has genetically
high MAO levels or COMT levels or acetylcholine esteritis levels then they're going to be
sub functional in that area and you can actually be able to you know have a
nutrigenomic override to that and if you're going to be producing more acetylcholine
and you want it to get across the synapse so you're going to you know help with acetylcholine
esterase inhibitors and then you actually want to get it up taken in the postsynaptic neuron right
so the the NMDA receptors primarily there are things that you can use it will modulate that
receptor if you support the entire cycle of how the body is actually producing it you'll get a
lot more optimum results and you'll end up getting the body learning how to do that and being able to
actually have plasticity effect right it's going to rewire to that state if it does that state a
significant amount and then when someone gets off it they'll either have little effect or lasting
positive effects because they have rewired one of the bigger ways that you get lasting effects
is by actually working to change brain structure in a positive direction so this is things like
can we help the brain develop more new neurons and increase gray matter density or in or develop
more new synapses so it's called a neurogenesis or synaptogenesis so we get more densely interconnected
brain structures and there do happen to be a lot of things that are known about specific nutrients
and specific chemicals that do support the brain's natural process of neurogenesis happening more
robustly or the brain's process of neurotophagy killing old senescent brain cells they cause problems
and allowing new ones to you know proliferate and so these are these are examples of ways you could
get lasting benefit after you know from a biochemical solution after stopping taking the
biochemical solution because it's actually seeking to one just tune the system better and two
rewire to an upregulated state and three actually support the development of new structures
this is really interesting i wanted to rewind slightly to where you're talking about neuro
transmitters that regulate mood because there's a huge industry of selling drugs that regulate mood
that actually have adverse long-term effects if you stop taking them or if you continue taking
them they kind of lose their effectiveness in a way over time and for example i have experience
taking SSRIs and i had both of those effects with withdrawal after coming off of them and
decreasing effectiveness over time but what you're talking about is that it's actually possible to
have supplements or drugs that have net positive effects over time even if you stop taking them
can you talk about that a bit specifically when it comes to mood regulation yeah so let me say
that the the ideal way to approach this is a personalized medicine or personalized well-being
approach because so say the SSRI did some good for you for a while but then it had side effects and
it had down regulation and you adapted to it did it do some good for you because you actually had a
dysbiosis issue in your gut where you just were not producing half of the serotonin that you need
that's an important question right because if so i wouldn't even want to give you
brain supplements i want to fix your gut or was there actually something where your diet was
deficient in tryptophan and so the raw amino acid necessary to make serotonin was low and we just
actually had to address your diet right or so there's so many things that can be involved and
we can say in general if someone takes 5-HTP which is 5-hydroxy tryptophan hydroxylated
tryptophan that's just one conversion step away from 5-hydroxy tryptamine to serotonin
and they take the phosphorylated version of b6 p5p that it converts the 5-HTP to serotonin
that they're much since that's just the stuff that is one step away from serotonin the body be
working with anyways that they're less likely to get dependence and down regulation from just
having enough of those things than they would from an SSRI that's true and ideally i would find
out what's going on first because you know we also see so many people who they get on an SSRI and
then they get much worse right so many of the shooting cases that we've seen were after someone
was put on an SSRI who hadn't been on it before and the suicidal homicidal tendencies are true
because if someone is more dopamine deficient in their depression and they really
needed something like well butrin instead like this is what's so crazy to me is we don't even
do any kind of testing to see that it's a neurochemical imbalance before we give them chemistry
rather than psychology and then to the degree that there even is a neurochemical amount we don't
know which one or which ones and then to the degree that we even knew which one we don't know why it's
off and the answer is just straight to a drug yeah that's just crazy it is and think about this
so your brain is as complex a system as we know of existing in universe right and you've got the
number of neurons and of glial cells and the number of synaptic connections and the number of
metabolic processes per individual one and the feedback and feedforward processes is just completely
mind-boggling so when you think about something like serotonin right that is a it's a signaling
molecule that's the end of many steps of metabolic transform so if it's low how likely is it that
other things are low or high or dysregulated or there's something else off like it's pretty high
right when we just go straight to let's give more serotonin right let's keep it from you know reuptake
and because we have to you know in the drug the drug industry has to use synthetic single molecules
to be able to get them patented which is the only way that they could ever make enough money to go
through FDA trials and that that's FDA but every country has you know some version but I think
us probably leads the way in some of both the good and bad aspects of this
what's the chance that a single synthetic molecule meaning it's not part of your natural
landscape at all and it's just one molecule could ever be an adequate solution to a complex
chemistry dysregulation in a self-organizing system like your brain like it's just doesn't even make
sense right it it doesn't make sense that that could possibly be the thing that's really going to repair
it yeah so it's usually going to be not one molecule that's off but lots of them and so
then we have to from maybe lots of different processes so how do we identify what's going on
and support the systems increasing its own internal resilience I mean the same as like
when you talk about cognitive chemistry is cognitive chemistry mediated via dopamine
or via acetylcholine or glutamate or sodium ion channels or long-term potentiation or
all those things right complex interactions and lots of those things and so one of the key
things is that when you're wanting to work with a complex system like a brain you've really got
to have a more complexity and form and approach than single molecule interventions
so you're saying we're mostly involved in this single molecule interventions because
that's what's profitable it's not just that's what's profitable that's the only thing that you
because it's profitable it's the only thing you can even afford to do research on
right you know when you hear things like well there are not so many good scientific trials
done on herbs who the fuck would pay for them I mean you'll see little trials done on herbs but
it costs a billion dollars give or take to take a drug through FDA approval well who's going to put
in a billion dollars and then when you take the drug through you're not even sure that it's going
to work in the market and then you have a class action lawsuit at the end like you've got to have
a 20 billion dollar potential on that for it to make any sense to even embark on right
so of course you've got to have a patent on it and so if you have something that's not patentable
and even in the drug space there are certain drugs that got published about in a way that
makes them unpatentable and even though they're super promising they just don't get developed
because who would develop them right because if it's not a synthetic chemical if it's already
available in nature they probably can't patent it for example in my case I've been using
peganum harmala seeds for mood regulation and I've had really excellent effects with them
much much better than I ever had with SSRIs also combined with meditation and diet adjustments
but you know if something like that was patented as a mood regulation supplement they probably
couldn't patent it well no they they definitely can't patent it but even some synthetics can't
get patented because you know the information was already released and so now it's part of the
commons or after the patent life on a drug expires and so now it's not really profitable because
the generics are all going to be really cheap then we need to for a drug company look for a new
thing in that space even if the new things are not better or even shittier than the previous
things simply because we we just can't make money doing that so what are the ways around it
supplements don't have to go through FDA approval think about from pharmaceutical industry what it
means to invest something like a billion dollars of capital before you've made your first dollar
back right like that's so far from silicon valley software tech thinking that's a lot of money to
invest before you know actually having any revenue but yeah so supplements they don't have to do that
but they can't claim that they have any medical purpose or heal anything so then that becomes
the tricky thing if they want to claim it they have to go through FDA process if they're going to go
through FDA process that's super expensive and they're going to have to have a profit stream
to be able to justify it so that's the deal basically to really fix that the entire regulatory
financial and intellectual property structures have to be changed and realistically I can say
for-profit medicine is a broken system because when you have a for-profit sick care system where
people come in ill pharmaceuticals or hospitals or insurance or anybody you know any money that's
going to be made in the multi trillion dollar complex of health care is only made when people
are sick so prevention would just obsolete that entire profit stream right and so then you start
thinking about patients as customers and every MBA first thing they learn is how do you maximize
the lifetime value of a customer and that should never apply to a patient right theory of markets
of free markets should apply to things that one can choose into choose out of you can't reasonably
choose out of health care and so it should not be structured in the for-profit way that it is
any more than for-profit prison should be yeah you're optimizing for what you don't want exactly
you know I was talking to a group that was working on peace and reconciliation the other day
and I asked them what's the chance of having a world free from war or any militarized conflict
while having a for-profit military industrial complex lastingly and they realized that supply
and demand theory says zero percent chance that those two could coexist enduringly right
because if there isn't demand for that supply it'll shut down and stop existing it won't be
a for-profit complex or it will have to do supply side economics and create demand
and so that means that you have the largest block of economics have its own survival
antithetical to global peace that's that's a fucked up structure for humanity
and for-profit prisons are the same and for-profit health care is the same and when you start going
through you see how many places the financial incentive the game theory is exactly opposite
to what the collective goal should be so like what it takes to really fix medicine and health care
and well-being care etc the IP has to change to where we're not focused on patentable things and
then separate patents that can't be combined because different IP holders have them and only
unnatural things etc the whole IP process is broken and it needs to move to maximum innovation
not ownership restriction the financial models have to change where all the financial incentive is
aligned with what we actually want which is optimized collective well-being not otherwise and
that doesn't look like any fiscal health care system we've had and the scientific model has to
change rather than a you know small number of variable reductionist approach to understanding
a complex self-organizing system we have to actually get better at complexity science
and understanding the body as a regulatory system the body mind complex regulatory system
what causes regulatory breakdown and how to support increased regulatory capacity of the system
rather than just overriding it all the time right it's a whole different set of incentives
it's a different kind of science it's different incentives and it's different legal structures
and so yes there's a lot of things that we want to evolve in diagnostic medicine and therapeutic
medicine and AI interpretation and you know but deeper than all that are these metastructures
that need to evolve so going back to the kind of specific approaches that you are taking how are
you building these metastructures in a different way than they currently exist yeah so we're obviously
within the within the confines of those metastructures to begin with so where our first
products are supplements the reason why we chose to do supplements was to be able to bring things
direct to consumer that's what it's going to be called rather than to go through FDA process and
a doctor process and specifically since we're working with some synthetics but largely you
know synthetics and natural compounds both so a lot of unpatentable things and combinations of them
and you know moving towards customizable combinations it's outside of patentability so for all those
reasons that made sense and because we wanted to be able to control the integrity of the company
we wanted to take on very little capital and only very values align capital and so we wanted to
build things that we could actually build ourselves first to then be able to grow the company and
continue so like for instance the first product we brought to market quality our cogs on it right
just our cost of goods is higher than the retail cost of most other cognitive enhancers on the market
and all the investors looked at said well you got to get the cogs down and like there is no way to
