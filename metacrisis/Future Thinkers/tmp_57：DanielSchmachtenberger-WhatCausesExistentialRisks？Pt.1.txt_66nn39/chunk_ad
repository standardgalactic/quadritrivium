it's from some very deep underlying dynamics that if we understand those and we solve them at the
dynamics level we fix all of them. So the first one is this topic we've been talking about and we
talked about previously which is that rival risk games multiplied by exponential technology
self-terminate because rival risk games cause harm with power and more power ends up being more
harm until it's more than is hand-able by the playing field. We got that. So exponential tech
whether we're looking at a scenario of everything getting fucked up by AI or by biowarfare or by
nanotech stuff or by so many different types of scenarios those are all the same types of
choices humans have been making just with those exponential powers at it. Given that we cannot
put those technologies away we cannot get the world to stop making them much as I often wish we could.
We either figure out how to move from a rival risk to an anti-rival risk environment that is
developing and deploying those technologies or we self-terminate. So this is the first design
criteria is that we have to create rigorously anti-rival risk environments. It doesn't end
up being all of it. I'll do two generator functions that's one and that is what we see in terms of
all of the either exponential tech risks or war risks or economic collapse leading to failed state
scenario risks they all come from things like that. Now all of the like environmental biosphere
collapse stuff is also related to tech getting bigger right as we're fishing out more fish as
we're putting more CO2 it also relates to that but it's a slightly different thing that we look at
which is whether we're talking about CO2 in the air or mercury in the air or the water or
microplastics in the water or a continent of plastic in the ocean or nitrogen effluent in the
river deltas or those are all toxicity dynamics those are all basically stuff that has accumulated
somewhere that it shouldn't have right we call that pollution. So we don't need to solve the dead
zones issue or the CO2 issue or that we have to solve all of those categorically that we're not
creating accumulation dynamics and on the other side of that same coin is depletion dynamics so
cutting down all the old growth forests fishing out all of the fish species extinction biodiversity
loss peak nitrogen peak oil etc those are all where we are using something in a way that depletes it
then it gets turned into trash or pollution on the other side where to accumulate somewhere
so we can define toxicity formally as depletion or accumulation because of an open loop in a
network diagram and if the loop was closed the things wouldn't accumulate they would go back
to the source of where we would get something from so it wouldn't have to deplete and we notice
that when we see any kind of natural system we go to an ecosystem whether it's a coral reef or a
forest or whatever and go to a forest there is no trash the body of something dies it's compost
there's feces it's compost something gets cut and bleeds it process it doesn't matter what it is
anything you can think about that is part of that environment from an evolutionary sense the
environment designed to be evolved to be able to process and there's also no unrenewable use of
anything right anything that is utilized is utilized in a closed loop fashion to one of the things we
see in complex systems and natural systems is comprehensive loop closure one of the things
we notice about the human design systems is open loops everywhere the materials economy itself
linear materials economy that takes virgin stuff and turns it into trash after using it for a very
short period of time is a macro open loop but there's micro open loops everywhere we have to
categorically solve that right we have to basically close all of those loops and another way of saying
what this generator function of issues is is that nature the stuff that nature makes is what we
call complex right it's self-organizing self-creating self-organizing self-repairing and the stuff we
make design tools is complicated it's rad right like the computer we're talking on is rad but
if it got broken it would not self-repair and it didn't self-organize it was made it was soldered
whatever made from design from the outside we can think about complex stuff comes about through
evolution complicated stuff comes about through design two different types of creative processes
with fundamentally different characteristics and complex stuff has comprehensive loop closure
everywhere because it couldn't externalize something and still be selected for adaptivity
right the adaptiveness factors everything whereas if i'm building something i might make it for one
reason or two or three reasons but it actually affects a lot of other stuff but the other stuff
wasn't what i was trying to optimize for so it ends up being where externalities occur so even this
computer i'm talking to you on right now was not optimized it was optimized for a bunch of things
so it's really cool but the fact that it's got a backlit screen that is 2d that's at a fixed focal
length from my eyes where i'm getting macular degeneration from spending too many hours on it
was one of the things that my eye health was not one of the things it was built to try and focus on
or the fact that it's fucking up my posture ergonomically by me looking down at the screen it
wasn't one of the things i tried to focus on or the you know a gazillion other things right what
happened to the environment and the supply chain process of getting the metals to make it or the
making of this computer affected a gazillion things that were not part of its design criteria
which means the making of it required externalizing a bunch of harm i.e a bunch of open loops
where it affected stuff that was not internalized to the process we can see that if a forest burns
it repairs itself if a house burns it does not repair itself and if my computer gets broken
it doesn't fix itself but if i cut myself it fixes so there's this fascinating difference the reason
we're bringing this up is to say if for something to be antifragile it has to be complex complexity
is the defining origin of antifragility and complicated things are all ultimately fragile
more or less fragile if we have a situation where complicated systems subsume their complex
substrate then this means continue to grow right so basically we're converting the complexity of
the natural world into the complicated built world and it's continuing to grow it will eventually
collapse because the complicated world and if you know it's just like my computer the water
infrastructure is complicated not complex the pipes don't self repair they can break easily
they're subject to being broken on purpose or accident right the same is true with the
everything right the roads the energy grid the everything now when i look at globalization
i say i've gotten increasingly interconnected complicated world that is increasingly more
complicated where the failures anywhere can trigger failures in more places because nowhere can
actually make its own stuff anymore because it should have complicated enough s to be made
across this whole thing right like this computer we're speaking on took six continents to make
and so if china died everywhere's fucked if the u.s died if there's so many places if if if mining
wasn't accessible in africa everywhere's fucked and we see an increasingly interconnectedly
complicated which also means increasingly fragile built world that we're trying to run
exponentially more energy through in terms of human activity dollars etc etc and that's happening
while decreasing the complexity of the biosphere far enough that its own anti fragility is going
away we're getting to a place where rather than climate being self-stabilizing it can go into
auto destabilizing positive feedback cycles where the biodiversity is getting low enough
that you can get catastrophic shifts in the nature of the homeostasis this made it possible to
have a biosphere like the one that we've lived in if you have a world where complicated systems are
subsuming their complex substrate and continuing to grow they will eventually collapse so these
are two different generator functions where we can say if i'm trying to solve ocean dead zones or
plastic or species extinction as one offs i will certainly fail because at most i move the curve
of collapse a year but there's so many other scenarios for fail that are over determined if
i don't solve the generator function of all of them i haven't actually got it the having a right
relationship between complex and complicated and having loop closure within the complicated
and creating anti rival risk basis it is a safe basis for exponential technology is the first
level of assessment of necessary design criteria for viable civilization
