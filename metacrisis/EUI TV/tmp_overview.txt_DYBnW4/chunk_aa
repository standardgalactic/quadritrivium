Checking EUI TV/Me and My Markov Blanket â€“ Prof. Friston (UCL) - Frontier talk series, 22 November 2021.txt
1. The conversation revolved around the concept of the "mark of a blanket" in philosophy and physics, particularly as it relates to the free energy principle.

2. In philosophy, overinterpretation can be seen as a form of spectator sport, where different interpretations are pitted against each other leading to a dynamic discourse.

3. The "mark of a blanket" in physics refers to the boundaries that define a system and distinguish it from its surroundings. This concept is crucial in thermodynamics, particularly when discussing equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems.

4. In an idealized context, such as a model with a Maxwell's demon or an idealized gas, there might be states that seem to lack a "blanket" because they are not explicitly defined. However, these states inherit their behavior from the surrounding heat bath or reservoir.

5. The free energy principle assumes the existence of boundaries (the "blanket") and seeks to understand the dynamics that maintain those boundaries.

6. There is no physical phenomenon that exists without being defined by its boundaries. Boundaries are essential for the existence and definition of any system.

7. The discussion was scheduled for two hours, but the participants found it so engaging and informative that they could have continued for much longer.

8. Giacomo added a thank you for the inspiring and useful conversation, especially for the social science community in attendance.

9. Professor Friston expressed gratitude for the opportunity to engage with the audience and left the door open for future collaborations or visits to similar communities.

10. The hosts and attendees expressed their appreciation for Professor Friston's time, insights, and the depth of thought he provided, and they look forward to potentially hosting him again in the future.
