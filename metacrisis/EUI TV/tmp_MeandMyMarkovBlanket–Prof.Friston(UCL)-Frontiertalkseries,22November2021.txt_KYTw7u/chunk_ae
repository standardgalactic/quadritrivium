that simulation of the primordial soup i chose one particular markoff blanket to illustrate the
behavior there are possibly an uncountably large number of markoff blankets in that soup because
of the sparsity of the equations and motion that i used to simulate it so that speaks to a really
important notion that there isn't um for everything at every level of description there is a markoff
blanket but of course a thing can comprise lots of sub things and sub things within them and so all
the way down so what that means is that we have um it's like the our um world is basically composed
of markoff blankets of markoff blankets of markoff blankets possibly an infant item um
um all of which are if you like compliant with the basic mechanics that i've been talking about
but at very different temple scales so the smaller you get the faster things become and the bigger
you get the slower things become um which is important from the point of view of something
i mentioned before which is a sort of renormalization group or the notion of renormalizability
which means that the the behavior the basic mechanics of a markoff blanket or something
at one level will always be in the context of being part of a markoff blanket at a higher level
but is at the higher level those dynamics are unfolding very very slowly so it always looks
at any one level as if there is a um it always looks as if there is a time in very context
and we you know one practical example that we've just talked about is is evolution
in somatic time the or the ekanish can be regarded as largely unchanging in somatic time
i can learn about this environment that's good enough but it will change slowly over um over
evolutionary time um and what that means is that you know there is no unique markoff blanket um
and in particular there is no privileged temporal scale at which these markoff blankets
self-organize and and and and exist and just knowing that's really important because you know
this coming back to why i'm here in terms of expanding horizons what that tells you is again
there is no privileged level of analysis you can always contextualize it with another basing
mechanics at a higher level of analysis so for example i could be a neuroscientist trying to
learn about behavioral scientists and social science so now i have to understand the markoff
blanket that surrounds my brain in the context of a markoff blanket that surrounds my culture or my
family or my institution and then i have to unpack the dynamics um at that level that provide
important constraints and contexts on the the basing mechanics of all the constituent markoff
blankets individuals at the lower level and if i was a molecular biologist i would have to do the
same i have to understand neuroscience at the level of neuronal populations and brain areas and
behavior and how that affords constraints on the markoff blankets that constitute a cell
and then you know beyond that the cell may create an inter-cellular environment that provides a
context that contains the markoff blankets that are an organelle or a molecular structure or RNA
so in all directions you've got a multitude of nested markoff blankets all of which are playing
the same game but at their own at their own temporal scale providing a context for things below
and then in the top a bottom-up causation providing the fluctuations and the intrinsic
or external dynamics from the point of view of the markoff blanket at a higher level so not at all
a naive question it's a very deep question and the answer i've given is that these are not
tools to understand physics or to describe physics they are there are constructs that
have to be in place before any emergent behavior can can exist
okay i was that was very good too now i see some more questions in the room we have Giovanni
and Philippe and Giacomo again Giovanni okay thank you very much for this great presentation
i'm still a bit confused very confused but let me try to and i'm very interested the
follow-up everything you said um i would like to put your question so you um used this idea
these energy models if i can call them this way to capture um what we will call the psychological
or cognitive concepts such as having a belief or um having also a goal updating a knowledge state
and can you just maybe a long answer would be required but is it possible to tell us a bit
how a change in the free energy if i understood well is related to this kind of notion of
achieving a goal and having a better belief what is the connection between these two things
right now that was an excellent question i perhaps i should have qualified
my use of certain um terms more carefully so you you're quite right to be a bit confused
because i was when i talk about a belief i mean all i mean is a conditional probability distribution
or a Bayesian probability distribution um i don't mean a propositional belief or something
that could be articulated at a personal level um so when i talk about belief updating i just mean
a physically parameterized probability distribution that changes um and mathematically
that's a nice way of looking at things because you induce information geometries and you can
start to write down the physics of belief updating but at no point do i mean to infer that there is
some propositional or intentional uh stance or or belief uh in a folk psychological sense
the the the question uh so um from that from that technical use of the word belief the belief
updating is literally um moving around in a physical space so changing the values of
say neural activity or any way of measuring the physical constitution of the system in hand
and in particular the internal states of that system or that particle and as we move the states
the physical states as you could measure them physically um then because those states encode
a probability distribution you're moving on something called a statistical manifold
and the free energy supplies the gradients that themselves describe the movement on that manifold
so when i talk about belief updating i have in mind a movement in a a belief space or in an
information geometry that minimizes the free energy at which point that makes my belief
the most likely and by but you know in the sense that it maximizes the marginal likelihood or it
minimizes the um it minimizes the variational free energy or it minimizes the prediction error
all of these are equivalent ways of of describing the quality of the belief that is defined by being
in a free energy minima in this belief space so all this is very technical it's it's a kind of
math you'd use in um the rigid five they did did use in quantum electrodynamics at no point
do you need to refer to beliefs in a folk psychology sense or to aspirations or goals
in anything but a very elemental very sub-personal sense the question then is
these systems that you know small particles for example will certainly if they have the
right kind of judging model look as if they do have personal beliefs they will look as if they
have goals they will behave in this way and that way while they're minimizing their expected free
energy and it'll look as if they they do have goals you know a simple example here would be
chemotaxis in single-celled bacteria you know bacteria that move up sugar concentration
gradients for example it looks as if they have a goal in mind which is to situate themselves in
a you know a world that is rich with nutrients and plants will look as if they are phototropic
they look as if they have the goal they want to expose themselves to sunlight and so you know
in a sense the the maths that I was talking about on the first kind which was this basically
reflexive policy would be perfectly okay to describe the goal-directed policy the goal-directed
policy selection under optimization of Bayesian or Bayesian belief updating namely optimization
of Bayesian beliefs that's scored by the variation of free energy but at no point would be imbuing
the sentence that you and I enjoy in these microbes or these plants so the question now is
what kind of genetic model what kind of Bayesian mechanics would now give rise to the more
anthropomorphic beliefs and goals that you're talking about how do I know that I have goals how
do I know that I am a thing and how do I know that I have beliefs and that I am you know I'm
committed to these beliefs these are really really high-level questions which in principle can be
addressed using the free energy principle but have not as yet been addressed there are there are
a lot of proposals out there that involve things like mental action that you have to you have to
have a representation of me being in a particular belief state paying attention to this or that
before you can be aware of being of actually inferring something having qualitative experience
and you have to have a belief state that is it is me that is doing these actions
and all you know so you start now developing a minimal sense of agency and a minimal sense
of selfhood but all of these things have to be written into the generative model
before you can apply the Bayesian mechanics that I was talking about so the connection is
you know it's not simple in the sense of what you're trying to do is to
write down a mechanics that would be appropriate to describe belief updating in a system where
the physical states of the system encoded beliefs but you can't at this stage
describe beliefs in a folk psychological sense you then have to think about what kind of system
what kind of architecture an implicit generative model would license that system or you describing
that system as having personal beliefs a sense of self a sense of agency where you can now start
to talk about these terms in you know using their normal anthropomorphic or folk psychology
meaning it does does that clarify things honestly yeah it's a great answer thank you very much
a lot of work to do thank you very much we're going to spend a ton of time in the cluster
unpacking all that Carl if you if you if I may Philip you have a question
thank you I'll try to be quick um professor there are first and thanks a lot for your talk was
really fascinating I'm an economist so I try to transfer um what you talked about a little bit
more to my domain and to find appropriate analogies um I I remember you used the example of um expected
utility theory showing the pictures of von Neumann and Morgenstern um but I was wondering if the whole
concept of the mark of blanket can perhaps serve as an analogy at a slightly larger scale or more
big picture view for the use of general equilibrium and partial equilibrium models in economics
because sometimes in economics when we look at general equilibrium we will try to understand
the whole system at once and mostly in terms of prices and allocations of goods but sometimes for
example if we want to study a specific market we would drill down and use a um
a partial equilibrium model where we would look only at a specific market interaction
and we would be content with modeling certain aspects for example certain other goods market
certain other prices and decisions as being outside of the system and I was wondering if this
wasn't actually a pretty close analogy to this distinction between the external world
and the particular state in the picture of the market mark mark of blanket that you gave us
yes no I think that would be an excellent analogy um and uh you know depending upon the level of
course graining of all the variables you have at hand that will dictate this you know the
size and the structure of the mark of blanket and of course you are you are liberty to draw the mark
of blanket um around any subset of states or any greater set of states so you know in response to
the last but one question you know there's no unique privilege mark of blanket even at once
even at one scale there are you know you can you can redraw the mark of blankets depending upon the
thing that you wanted to define so if you wanted to define um one market or one country or one
institution or your um you know then you just draw that mark of blanket around that and then and
then as you say much of the interesting dynamics is going to be in in terms of the exchange or
imprints is made upon the blanket stage which is basically what what all the variables inside the
mark of blanket what they can see um and um the converse of that which is very interesting um
is that of course if you now think of think of some abstract state space where you've got all
sorts of variables or states that you you now want to carve up into a you know a mark an
institution or mark of blanket in this corner and the rest um and now imagine carving up um the rest
into their own mark of blankets now you can ensemble of mark of blankets like packed little
circles all talking to each other the enormous simplification that ensues from that partitioning
that kind of coarse-graining follows from the fact that you've got that conditional independence
which means that you don't need to know anything about the internal mechanics of the other
institutions all you need are the blanket states and in particular the um the active states so the
only thing if you know so we're now moving into a world of the interactions between multiple mark
of blankets or multiple agencies or multiple institutions or multiple um multiple individuals
where now we're conceiving of each individual as possessing its own mark of blanket but the key
thing that the mark of blanket brings to the table is that there's a your conditional independence
between the inside of the mark of blanket and everything else so from the point of view of
another mark of blanket the only variables that matter are on the surface on the blanket states
um and therefore you can you can greatly reduce the computational complexity in the
numerics of simulating a universe if you can identify the right level of coarse-graining
and then just summarize the way in which this institution or this part of your um your your
economic universe um actually works uh so that in turn um um well sorry there are all
sorts of exciting directions you can take that um we actually use that device to uh actually
summarize um the activity of the brain we actually sort of chunk it into parcels each with its
mark of blanket and then we can work out um we can then summarize the the activity of entire
very complicated parts of brains with a very small number of variables as are the principal
components or the eigen solutions of the of of the mark of blanket states which are you know a
fantastically small number of variables in relation to the entire number of neurons that are contained
within that mark of blanket and I would imagine that you use the same kind of device when somebody
say oh I'm going to treat this very high dimensional part of my market uh um as sort of fluctuations
in your or noise in you know in a low dimensional state space and of the variables that matter
and from the point of view of the mark of blanket formulation the variables that matter are just the
eigen functions of the of the blanket states so that that can be an enormous saving if you like
and also a very principal way of accounting for sort of coupling between different institutions
and different markets and when framed as basically coupling between different uh different mark of
blankets in the social sciences in its stripped down form now you're in the game of understanding
how just two mark of blankets talk to each other so you now try to understand the coupling between
two mark of blankets there's diatic interactions and there's a nice literature now on the emergence
of generalized synchrony where the active states of one mark of blanket now become the the sensory
states of the other and vice versa so that you're now trying to infer what the other person is
inferring because the free energy minimizing solution is when you are both in generalized
synchrony which is when you both are using the same generative model and you're both seeing from
the same hot song sheet or hymn sheet um so that now you have a shared narrative for what you're
talking about and some people understand that as basically resolving the the problem hermeneutics
you're knowing what do you mean if if i can get into generalized synchrony with you so that we're
both basically pursuing the same narrative the same generative model then i can fully understand
you because basically what you're going to do next is what i would do next and it's just a question
of whose turn it is to actually do it uh so there are all sorts of really interesting issues when
you start to think about partitioning a state space into a smaller number of mark of blankets and
think about the exchange between one mark of blanket and another mark of blanket and all sorts
of other issues which you know we come back to the original questions about you know where then in
these i presume these are sort of like um i don't know but i presume there's some macroeconomic
like models is these equilibrium models i i don't forgive me i don't know but
one can then get out of the hood and start to think about well are what are the objective
functions or the ipunov functions that underwrite this kind of equilibrium which i imagine from the
from my point of view is a non-equilibrium steady state because it's an open exchange with
that you know whatever that is you know so you're not dealing with closed systems so you're talking
about open or non-equilibrium steady state um equilibrium or steady states um but then you
can get in and ask well we've just said that um the you know the right ipunov function on the right
yard say the free energy functional has this curiosity built into it where does that fit into
economic exchanges you know and then we get to things like um deceit uh regret uh reputation
all of these things now speaking to um the consequences of action beyond the immediate
monetary gain um beyond the immediate utility as it were um that have implications for resolving
uncertainty about future transactions with other markoff blankets so i don't know whether there's
any place for for deceit in uh deceit sounds horrible but it's actually an extremely high end
kind of competence to actually for me to work out what you are thinking and then act in a way
to change your beliefs which requires me to have a belief about your belief that's an extremely
extremely sort of sophisticated and i'm sure that that kind of um that manifestation of curiosity
in a dyadic or tragic or multi-agent exchange uh must feature at some point in your
recent behavior economics so i'm not sure about uh can i well can i ask you does it feature in
