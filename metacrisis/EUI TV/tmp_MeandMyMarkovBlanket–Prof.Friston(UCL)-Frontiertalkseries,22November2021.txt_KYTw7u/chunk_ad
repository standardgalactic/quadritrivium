the information seeking and the imperatives that would underwrite that sort of epistemic part
and for me and certainly for you and all of I would imagine the audience as scientists
prime for a normative reading of our behavior it's 99.9 percent the curiosity and 0.001 percent
the rewards that you know they actually drive this I think that's an excellent an excellent
question and an excellent observation there are a number of ways in which you know I'd like to
answer that question we don't have time to do all of them I should apologize I didn't see my chat
in my five-minute warning it's like a horrible feeling that I did speak for too long so my apologies
but that you're absolutely right that the the Bayesian mechanics that comes from the physics
part of this is really one of Dennett's strange inversions so instead of asking what kinds of
policies do good systems that survive and flourish possess it actually turns that on its head and say
well let's take a mathematical definition of a system that exists and survives and flourishes
just in virtue of it existing and ask what properties must it must it possess so you
know I think you're very sensitive to the or your question was very sensitive to something
quite fundamental here the physics account here it doesn't say what's the best way to behave it just
says what behaviors are evinced in systems that exist and persevere and hence the appeal to the
physics and non-equilibrium steady state and self-organization under that and all that comes
out of it is as you as we have already concluded which is an inactive or embodied or a circular
exchange between a thing and its culture its eco niche or its environment or its heat path
that has this uncertainty reducing aspect to it you know which we talked about in in terms of
curiosity you can you know you you can also read that in terms of this sort of mixture of
minimizing risk and ambiguity you know so first of all we will only make moons when the sensory
consequences of those moons are unambiguous so we can infer what's going on but at the same time
we're trying to minimize that we are the distance between what we think will happen if we do that
and what we a priori prefer prefer to do that but both in a sense have this of
epistemic aspects to that that's certainly sort of the ambiguity reducing and of course that is
just the whole point of doing that expected free energy is just to to build a probability
distribution over policies so you're saying before that much of the social sciences and certainly
in its sort of pragmatic or you know so how a behavioral scientist or economist would actually
advise institutions in terms of policymaking it's all about hypotheses so that that expected free
energy is just really you know a way of formalizing and evaluating the log probability
over a series of policies a sequence of actions into the future and of course the free energy
principle active inference all that does is this is the mechanics that you know that underwrites
policy making in the sense of selecting the most probable policy it doesn't tell you what the
most probable the best policies are but it certainly provides a calculus for understanding
the the processes that underwrite your policy decision and as you say you know it's it's
resolving uncertainty what do you need to know in terms to resolve the uncertainty about whether
to pursue that policy that policy that policy or that policy so it will be interesting to actually
drill down on the the actual message passing and belief updating and evaluation that the
institutions and organizations use in the brain it's actually probably more straightforward
you might think yeah we actually have a fairly a fairly good understanding of of the the physiology
of the message passing and the updating of what represents what in terms of neurotransmitters
and brain regions it would be very very interesting to to to retell that story in terms of a process
for a decision making at an institutional level you know that's where all the heavy lifting that's
where all the hypotheses would actually live you know you know the mechanics but you don't know
how that process is actually enacted you know what represents what what represents the expected
free energy what that is the precision this what represents the likelihood of this given given that
all of these things in principle have to be there but it now becomes I think a scientific
a process of scientific inquiry to actually work out the you know the the anatomy of the
and the structure of the of the message passing a fascinating game and you will see I'm sure
parallels in terms of in economics you know some appellation on the echelon structures of firm
management these are just recapitulations of the fact that you have to have a hierarchical
jota model in a world which has a deep causal structure you know it can be no other way in
terms of modeling and understanding what's going on out there in say the market you have to have
this hierarchical and deep structure to the internal dynamics that are doing that belief
updating and selecting the right time right kinds of policies fantastic thank you I would have
another question but I would refer myself okay Jacob maybe I have a question and I'm
I'm afraid I'm going to be very confused in the way I I phrase it so Professor Friston
please bear with my metal so it's but so when I was listening to you and you know reading
papers about you and try to read some of your papers I was thinking so I was thinking to myself
do we have do we have built-in hardwired sort of survival code and then so are we designed to
optimize that was my thought and then then other so it came so then if that's the case
what causes heterogeneity at the individual level do we have different mark of blankets amongst
species or communities or individuals then another question is what causes this is this
because we are no longer curious or it is because our sensors and actuators decay and and if
the human brain has this degrading ability to update and and optimize can a supercomputer
that has less exposition to a form of entropy maybe I'm using the word wrongly in terms of
material capability can it can it overcome the limitations of the human body and the human brain
so I was struggling with all these questions and then I was thinking about reproduction
is because you you showed these dots with the parents and the grandparents and they are different
they are the internal state and then there's the parents but isn't in a way reproduction
sort of recreation of the new internal states which which actually overcomes the limitations of
sensing it and actuating over time so I've been struggling with all these questions in my head
when you were talking does that make any sense or is this just a confused thinking no it makes
perfect sense and it's these are quite high-end theoretical issues which a lot of people are
confused about or not perhaps not so confused but certainly there are lots of really important
outstanding issues so you asked about eight questions there so I can't even remember what
they were but I'll try and address some of the more important ones from one perspective which is
in statistics it's called Bayesian model selection in radical constructivism it's called
structure learning and in theoretical biology it's called evolution on natural selection
they're all different ways of describing the same underlying process and this is again a self
evidencing or free energy minimizing process but now it's not at the level of the internal
states and dynamics of a of a particular system but it's about its structural form itself so we're
now going beyond the activity you know what if we're a brain the neuronal activity patterns in
the moment if we're an institution the beliefs held or positions held by this moment of the board
or the you know the people in say a warehouse at different levels of a hierarchical structure
we're even moving beyond what's called the parameters of a charity model which in the
brain would be the connection strengths these are the the internal state that represent lawful
relationships and contingencies so these would be things that don't change very quickly over time
they are plastic and learnable but they are the connect that they are the connectivity that the
connectome that defines the structure usually a hierarchical structure of the of the charity model
in an institution it might be you know the roles that you play or you know the communication
channels that define your influence or your message that you know where you send your messages to
in terms of the belief updating but beyond that there's a very structure of the model itself
you know how many hierarchical levels how many different representations what kind of factorization
how big is it how small is it you know all of these things themselves can be optimized with
respect to their marginal likelihood or their free energy or the or their evidence so if you're
you're a statistician your your the very structure of your model would be determined by what sort of
expound your variables do you put in it and what do you leave out and what you would actually do
is do something like an F test for example with a statistical model that didn't didn't have this
interaction in it and then if the model evidence increased or the free energy decreased when you
include the interaction you know that your model now has to be slightly more complicated and you
retain it so that would be if you like a very simple example of Bayesian model selection
getting the right structure you know is something there or not do you have that connection do you
have that kind of personnel in your institution do you have this neural population and this
mammalian mammalian brain so that structural learning manifests in in
evil in theoretical neurobiology exactly as you say through not Bayesian model selection as a
statistician would read it but natural selection so evolution that rests upon reproduction exactly
as you say now can be understood as a process a natural Bayesian model selection so what does
that mean well interesting looks as if evolution is also fantastic in the sense that is it has
hypotheses that it tests so here the hypothesis is you it's a phenotype and evolution is now
trying to select the best model or phenotype or hypothesis that is that exists or is a good
account of its of the eco niche so it's trying to find evolution is trying to find the phenotypes
that are the best fit to the environment in the sense that if they fit there will be a high
marginal likelihood that they'd be part of a population which is you know which is one way
of saying that evolution is looking for evidence that this kind of model is the best kind of model
and we'll select that model if it reproduces because this is a good fit it is good for self
evidencing in in this environment so what one has now is a picture of hierarchical free engine
minimization or inference where you've got very fast inference which is basically making sense of
the world as it stands in the moment slow inference where we're learning the parameters and the
contingencies and the connectivity and the right the laws and contingencies in our environment
and then very very slow inference over the actual models itself that could involve the
selection of a particular model and the refutation or discarding of another model i.e death you know
from the point of view of natural selection or a failure to reproduce so all of these processes
are just instances of free energy minimization at different temple scales and as you crucially note
the last scale of natural selection rests upon reproduction which is another way of if you like
another instantiation of things that exist so from the point of view of those
attracted dynamics and self-organization to attract being set we now think of the the thing
as a species so now it's the life cycle is a sort of zoa a zygote through to you know a neonate
through to an adult that reproduces produce another zygote and through to a neonate so
even though you may die the life cycle carries on for that kind of phenotype and so the you know
just having reproduction as part of the life cycle is just a biologist's way of saying
there is an attracting set here and attracting manifold and orbit that contains states at eye
as a species now keep revisiting and then the question is well if the environment is changing
then clearly that model selection that optimization process has to be an ongoing
process so evolution is not static it doesn't stand still in many senses from red queen dynamics
through to you know ashby's law of requisite variety and you know from you know genomics
perspectives sort of natural drifts and mutations and like there has to be an exploration of the
spacer models the plausible hypotheses that you can bring to the table then you select the best one
and i'm putting it like that because you know this process of continually optimizing
in a changing environment can be seen at all levels whether it's you know you are the level
of learning and your development going to school learning about you know from your mother in terms
of you know are the things like people and am i a person is my mother a person all of these things
have to be learned including you know what you can control in terms of your limbs versus not right
through to you know learning about you know which university which career to choose all of these
things have to be learned you're on the fly through this process of well through this basic
basic mechanics at every every temporal scale and the reason i'm phrasing it in that fashion is to
try and speak to your question well is it possible to build an electronic or a human in silico
and stop the aging process and yes it certainly would be possible in principle and would that
work well no it wouldn't because you don't have natural selection and so the problem with a computer
and an artifact that had generalized artificial intelligence and had exactly the right kind of
curiosity that we were talking about previously and that lived forever is just a statement that
you have lost the opportunity to base in model selection which means that it would not survive
it will become out of date within either a year or 10 years or a century it will become obsolete
and no longer fit the purpose so then you ask well okay let's have an adapting robot or your
artifact but the more you keep on qualifying it the closer you get to actually the human species
so you get back down to natural selection artificial life applied to your intelligent artifacts it
has to be that way because you have to have this dynamic image you have to keep revisiting these
states of being you have to have a life cycle so you have to have if you like death as part of your
life cycle in order to um self evidence in a changing environment and you maybe say to me well
what happens if the environment stops changing surely we can just stop evolution and populate the
world with artifacts that don't that don't change and we will find some nevadas and some sort of
status quo that you see in science fiction movies where everything is the same day after day after
day after day and that is certainly a conceivable universe but the problem is as soon as it's
populated by artifacts that learn and are curious that means from the point of view of any one
artifact or particle that means that there is an inevitable change in their external state
because their external states are now constituted by other creatures that are learning so you can't
have an unchanging um you can't have a a non itinerant kind of universe um technically this
this is um can be framed in terms of the renormalization group and you talk about itinerancy at every
scale you know you're all the way down and all the way up um so that's why i'm afraid you're
probably not going to be able to buy a a human being that's gonna last forever as opposed to
having children in the foreseeable future well thanks a lot um you've probably uh i
rose eight questions you've answered 16 of my questions uh in your reply so that's absolutely
amazing um i'm just concerned about my evening because i'm gonna keep thinking about that like
for hours now um but it was um in a way you know for us social scientists also sort of
uplifting an optimistic note what you said about superintelligence and and you know there's a lot
of talking in the ethics and law and technology literature about the risk of terminal replacements
of humans buying machines and you know life and intelligence in human form will disappear and so
that your last comment was very very um on point in terms of thinking about some of these issues
i think there was a question in the chat uh i can read it um i would send and um and you
will see what you what you think about it okay so the question is from Jonas Beckley Aida who's in
the library and um i'm going to read it Jonas okay all right so um very interesting talk even though
a lot went over my heads uh i have a very naive maybe confused question about the nature of the
boundary between internal and external are such boundaries given in the natural world
or are they projected constructed by the application of the theory for instance with
a primordial sub simulation if the internal system we saw an objective thing in the world
analyzed by use of the model or if it's in some sense constructed by the application of the model
to the simulation so here's the question that's an excellent question in fact there's there are actually
um heated debates in um the um not so much the social sciences but certainly sort of the
the philosophy of social sciences um and uh so i think there's actually a target bbs paper um
that came out about two or three weeks ago which effectively asks exactly that question so it's
an excellent question um i have a definitive argument but i'm trying to stand back up from
the debate because i'm not a philosopher so i'm just trying to treat it as a spectator sport at
the present time but the the answer from the physicist's point of view um is that the the
markoff blanket is not a construct that you would use um um in a theological or expoundary sense to
you know to make to make sense of the behavior it has to be there um definitionally before you
can define anything so everything that exists must have a markoff blanket and then the game as well
if there's a markoff blanket what kind of dynamics and physics or what mechanics must this um this
thing possess so the markoff blanket is not a constructed is not constructed by application
to us to a to something the markoff blanket defines the thing that's in a really fundamental way
having said that what you um what i think was astutely picked up was that um you know even in
