economics is it um well actually you linked it quite closely uh also to game theory which
i mean closes the circle with uh von Neumann Morgenstein example quite nicely of course yes
yes absolutely yeah yeah sophistication of agents and game fair yeah absolutely yeah
jack how
in fact i already had my my answer so my question was uh what about when we move uh from uh let's
say single agent to multiple agents after all social science is really mostly about interaction
between multiple agents now i understand that um there is a way to extend the view into multiple
blankets uh that are somehow interlinked with each other so i will uh i will find this really
fascinating but then i will probably try to dig a little bit into this saying that maybe with
multiple agents the distinction and this goes back to one of the previous questions the distinction
between the different sensor uh external and internal makes some outburst so i just have in
mind something that we have in game theory so there are so we study equilibria with strategic
interaction between multiple agents under the class of what is called in fact macro strategies
where essentially we claim that what is relevant in the decision and our actions is not really something
that is very far in the future sorry in the past but it's only what happened yesterday and we
characterized the equilibrium behavior under this assumption and we know that this is a restriction
so the equilibria the outcome that we can support when instead we think about strategies
that rely on something that happened very far in the past may be different from the equilibria
we can characterize in macro strategies so i'm just thinking whether these distinctions between
uh the externally internal parts in the macro blanket when we go to the multiple agent is
uh possibly a restriction on the way we describe the world
yeah i'm sure it is in a fundamental way i mean certainly you're just taking your last sentence
i certainly my brain certainly understands and you know describes my world in terms of
interactions amongst Markov blankets because i have this hypothesis that the world
consists of things that have a Markov blanket and indeed just seen construction in the visual
neuroscience is it is just like that there are visual objects each object has its Markov blanket
it has you know interacts with other objects to produce my sensory impressions so you know
certainly every Markov blanket will actually use a model of its world that has Markov blankets
you know both in terms of things out there but also if you just think about it you know
if you've got a hierarchy in your genetic model that hierarchy is defined by the sparsity of
connections that don't jump save between more than one level and that sparsity defines another
set of internal Markov blankets that lends your internal model a deep structure that is also
capitulated or recapitulated that sparsity of connectivity that stands in for conditional
independences in the causes out there is also evident within each level of the hierarchy in
terms of modularization or factorization that's a really important way to minimize free energy
through the minimization of complexity to get this sort of the simplest explanation for what's
going on and that factorization I repeat just sort of exploits conditional dependencies it's
taking you a little bit away from the heart of your question but I think
usefully in the sense that there are certain things out there that allow you to do this sort of
coarse graining and describing things in terms of Markov blankets and conditional independences
the simplest example that the brain exploits is the fact that knowing where something is doesn't
tell you what it is and knowing what something is doesn't tell you where it is generally
you know and so what that means is that you can very efficiently factorize what and where
in the way that you describe your world so in principle it is sufficient just to know an object
is over here in one factor and this object is this kind of thing in another factor and then you
just bring them together to explain this object in this position as opposed to having a very
a representation or explanation the joint space of everything being every whatness being everywhere
which would be a very complicated representation so this whole carving up and putting Markov
blankets into your model is really important in terms of leveraging conditional independences
and causal structure in the system you're trying to you're engaging with and because of that if
there are Markov blankets and other creatures or institutions like me out there that needs to
get into my generative model and the implications of that are fascinating but you know I'm not going
to tell you anything you don't know from the perspective of people who are trying to exploit
the Markov blanket construct and the attending basic mechanics in a multi-agent context
it tends to go in one of two directions you can either think about the coupling between two
Markov blankets in terms of communication or you can think of multiple ensembles of Markov
blankets that constitute a population then you think about the coupling of the environment
to the population and then the implicit communication between the elements or the
ensemble of that population so I'm just mentioning this as places that if you had a student who
wanted to see how this variation of free energy approach to multi-agent games and
development plays out in the literature then if you look for some things like
variational niche construction so the idea here is that ultimately you can describe any system that
endures as minimizing its free energy or making things as predictable as possible which means
that that applies both to the agent and the environment to which the agent finds itself
which means as fast as the agent is trying to learn about this environment the environment
is also learning about the agent and you see this manifest in terms of things like
desire paths or elephant paths this is sort of wearing the grass down on a shortcut from the
station to the nearest coffee shop for example and that wearing the grass down wearing a rut
in the environment that is used by conspecifics to obtain their goal is can be mathematically
construed as the environment learning about the kind of agents that it plays host to
and then you can complete the circle by saying well provided all the agents are sufficiently
similar they can now use what the environment has learned in order to optimize their goal
directive behavior or their information seeking behavior by minimizing the expected free energy
and then you get to the argument where you can explain deontic cues that the environment has
learned that provide an explanation for cultural evolution or deontic cues or things like road
signs you know why do road signs exist it's because the environment has learned that these
are the kinds of things that are used by its inhabitants which are humans that drive around in
it but why why the roads but you can also argue the road sign is only there and learnable because
it has the same meaning for all the different agents that are the you know that constitute the
population and so you get this sort of circular explanation which is all underwritten by a common
minimization of free energy or a common maximization of predictability you try to make the world as
predictable and unsurprising as it can be and if you're all doing that together then the best way
to do that is to make sure that you construct your niche or your market you know with things that are
as similar to you as possible because things that are similar to you as possible are predictable
and if everybody you're playing with in your game is really predictable you're minimizing
your free energy or maximizing you're maximizing your your your your predictability so from an
evolutionary point of view what that means is you what you'd expect to see is basically lots of
cooperation lots of agents all trying to make the world predictable by hanging out with other
phenotypes like themselves and building an environment at Econiche for that kind of agent
that is as predictable as possible so you'll get them building things that they can recognize
really easily things like for example the excite edge receptors in the retina so things are built
out of straight lines you know so you have buildings you have you know anything that our
generated models can easily register and recognize you will see written into the environment or
things that you expect to happen you know then of course you know the famous example in Econiche
constructions that how build beavers build dam because they expect to have you know have a
certain narrative in the way that they get their food so they make that come true by resolving
their prediction error that this dam is not being built so that changes the environment and and and
so forth so that's that's where the literature I think is largely at um it's not very developed
and certainly has not at this stage I think been imported or connected to economics and
finance or logistics there are people making lots of noises about this but it hasn't been done at
this stage and it would be really interesting to see uh um you know I'll go and go of now
equilibria in in economics so I don't know what that's all about now it relates to game theory
but it does sound as if you're dealing with very similar such kinds of constructs
what the free energy principle brings to the table is this sort of rather simple notion that
everything's going to try and converge on a joint free energy minimum which simply means
making things as predictable as possible okay um I was again a pretty um uh deep answer
um professor facen do you have uh maybe seven more minutes for us yes of course okay good um
I have I have three very simple questions very straightforward the first one is
if as you said I like your definition let me take you if if life is about is about curious creatures
that try to learn to keep their self-organization
um this process can only exist if uncertainty can never be resolved
there's a there's a a boundary to to and to uncertainty resolution that must exist otherwise
the process ends that's the first question so how do you bring this in it's a sort of variation
about the you know discussion between uh people in religion and and sort of Nietzsche and philosophy
where Nietzsche said you know life in uncertainty is unbearable okay the second question is um
are there physical phenomena in which mark of blankets do not exist
and the third question is more um a question from a person working from in a university to another
person working for a university institution which is are you you've produced a unifying theory it's
big big theory are you concerned about people in other fields reading too much in the theory
right i've i've tried to be very very focused
there's not there's still not very easy questions
and we have seven minutes to answer them okay and so let's one by one and so the first question was
those has to be irreducible uncertainty those has to be uncertainty to resolve us we just stop
stop evolving and stop actually moving or indeed belief updating and i think that that's an excellent
point and i would actually counter that to a certain extent in in the sense that there there are mark
of blankets that have almost attained an equilibrium steady state as opposed to non-equilibrium
steady state where they are no longer changing and so i'm thinking about here about
very elemental particles or you know perhaps even stones that have settled down so they've
got a very very simple and flat model of their eco niche which could be probably just reduced to
two variables like the temperature and so in situations where the world is not is not changing
very much so what i'm what i'm saying is that you know as there are an uncountable number of
mark of blankets there are almost an uncountable number of things in the universe some of which
will be changing very very slowly and others will be changing with a much more itinerant
aspect a peripodactic sort of moving around a lot usually with a life cycle so these are usually
biotic things but the key thing is the the cyclical nature and the the itinerancy inherent
in that which is i think what you are driving up that there's there's always some there's always
the next place to go in the drive to minimize uncertainty which means that you have you you
have you you don't attain this thermodynamic equilibrium where nothing is changing anymore
which is you know you could you could actually construe as the death of a biotic system so
when you die you dissipate you reach thermodynamic equilibrium your your molecules become the same
temperature as the ambient surrounding so this is a thermodynamic equilibrium that no longer has
this structured itinerancy this deep temporal structures wandering aspect that you now are
worried will go away if the world stops changing so the argument previously was just because you
live in a world that is constructed by things like you there has to be an itinerancy in that world
which means that you will have to be itinerant so you're not going to become like a stone or a
or you know or attain an equilibrium simply because your world
has been constructed by things like you and you know this so this appeals to the multi-agent
aspect on the that we're talking about before however there could be universes where or there
could be parts of this of this world where you know things are really really simple they have
what is something called very shallow models with no temporal depth a little little thermostats
you know little sort of single celled organisms that behave like little thermostats in extreme
conditions that are constant in their temperature and chemical constitution that do actually
survive for for for for many many years without changing you know but you're not one of those
you're a different kind of genetic model and you're unlikely to to express that that form of
quasi-equilibrium steady state just technically it's this interesting you know because I can
guarantee that the kind of economic equilibrium you were talking about is actually a non-equilibrium
steady state simply because you'll have things like deep breaking of detail balance and you
have open exchanges technically what that involves is usually the seronoidal flow that
breaks the detail balance and converts an equilibrium steady state into a non-equilibrium
steady state sort of you know one of which will a kind of which will be a far from equilibrium
steady state so I think what you're touching upon is is things that get very very close to this sort
of equilibrium equilibrium steady state when they don't have the high tendency you just fall
into the bottom of the pudding basin you're minimizing your free energy and you're going to
a fixed point of tractor and you stay there that's not the kind of attracting set that we were talking
about we actually have this very complicated itinerant orbit this manifold which we're continually
circulating on continue updating our beliefs because the world is changing why is it changing
while it comprises things like me that are always changing so imagine a world without living things
and of course that would probably be more the kind of world that would be conducive to things
that didn't have this high tendency or this that you know an ending battle to resolve uncertainty
this this which is you know I didn't know that as it needs to occur I meant the quote but certainly
life and uncertainty being unbearable is so true from the point of view of the free energy
principle simply because free energy is a proxy for surprise that means that free energy is a
proxy for expected surprise expected surprises entropy entropy is uncertainty that's all there is
to it you know it is uncertainty of course from the economics point of view that uncertainty
is reflected in the confidence in the markets that's the killer that's the big thing it's the
uncertainty which is the big thing you know when it comes to informing action you know and underwriting
our our you know our agency that is all about the uncertainty the second question was well the third
question I remember because it was last so the reasons effect am I worried that other people
on the fields were overinterpreted I think that's an academic worry I personally don't
I don't lose sleep over it if this kind of calculus and maths is useful it will be used
to effect if it's not it won't be so the proof of the pudding will be in the doing and the eating
and practically all the free energy principle does is provide a scaffold to enable you to simulate
systems so there is an argument that which I often make and it's a slightly arrogant argument
but I'll make it anyway but the free energy principle is a little bit like the principle
of natural selection it's you know a beautiful theory that explains everything and nothing at
the same time and in that sense the free energy principle itself tells you nothing it doesn't
tell you how finance works it doesn't tell you how the hippocampus works it doesn't tell you why
you've got eyes in the same way the natural selection doesn't tell you why you've got eyes
so it's quite a vacuous principle but at least it's a principle so why is it useful well it can be
quite useful when you try to simulate self-organization under the constraints that you know apply to this
particular system or you know in my world this particular Markov blanket simply because you
can derive the equations of motion or the dynamics this calculus that I was talking about you can
now put that into computer and now you can start to simulate things so really you know if the free
energy principle is applied in another domain say economics or social or behavioral neuroscience
a behavioral science thing applying through agent based stochastic models for example
you know it will provide a principle basis for the way that you code up your equations of motion
and the lipo not functions or the objective functions that give it a normative aspect
and if it works it will be useful and it will not be over interpreted it will just be interpreted
in the context in which it is being used that's fine so I don't worry about that really because
it's you know that's what in practice the free energy principle brings to the table but all the
