it's a hello everyone great to see you again it's our first frontier talk this year in
the cluster on technological change in society and to open this series of talks we have invited
today professor Carl Friston. Professor Friston is a professor of Neuroscience at University
College London and is also the scientific director of the Welcome Trust Center for neuroimaging.
Professor Friston is a leading authority on brain imaging is known for his invention of a
technique called statistical parametric mapping that's where I have
to concede that I'm a lawyer by training and I struggle with the technical language but I think
I get the insights. The technique I understand helps analyzing brain images into a consistent
shape something which was very hard to do before it was invented. Now what led us to invite Professor
Friston to talk here is his work on something called the free energy principle and I understand
the free energy principle personally as trying to provide nothing less than a unifying theory
of what's behind life and I encountered the free energy principle through sort of weekly reading
in the mainstream press there was a wired paper not long ago that talked about Professor Friston's
work on the free energy principle and my mind was blown away by this reading and I got interested
and even though this is very hard science and there's a lot of hard science behind it I was
fascinated by the very rich set of deep insights about philosophy about the ordering of the world
and about the very deep questions it throws in relation to consciousness, nature, reproduction
and a whole sort of issues which are very important. More concretely I think the free energy
principle in the paper it was described as a full of implications and ramifications for artificial
intelligence research, economics and also philosophy so I would not like to spend too
much time introducing our guests today and I would not like also that talk to drag for too
long beyond what Professor Friston has agreed to give us. Professor Friston has a very prolific
production I read in the wired paper that he could produce an academic paper in four days
and I know that if that is the case it's a huge opportunity because for science if we
take too much of his time today so I would not like to do that and I will hand over immediately
to him thanking him again for his presence with us today. Professor Friston you have the floor.
Thank you very much for that lovely introduction. It was a
splendid description of the free energy principle and the job that I have ahead of me in terms of
bringing this physics of sentience to the table as something that could be
usefully unpacked in the context of behavior and social sciences. I am very mindful that I suspect
I was invited to expand your horizons not towards the arts and humanities but in the other direction
back towards physics and hard science so I apologize in advance that many of the ideas I'm
going to talk about inherit from physics and explicitly we're going to be talking about
physics of sentience and in particular sentient behavior so my hope is to go from some basic
physics I'm going to the first part of the talk will be an introductory foundational introduction
to the physics of self-organization but then try to move us through insights and intuitions
to a formal understanding of the choices that we make and why we go around sampling our lived
worlds in the way that we do. I will also apologize for the use of equations all of this inherits
from the maths so I use equations to make sure I'm telling the right story for you though they
can be treated as iconic representations of ideas and I will try to unpack them intuitively using
things you'll be very familiar with. I can promise you though that the end point the denouement
of this analysis will be in the fields and address ideas with which you will already
be very familiar so the agenda here is to enable people to join the dots between different perspectives
on the same kind of thing that is underwritten by the physics of sentience that I want to talk
about so the talk's going to have two parts basically the first is a kind of talk that I would give
to engineers machine learning people and people in physics considering the the
fundamentals and the statistics of life with a special focus on something called Markov blankets
and what arises from the presence of Markov blankets which is a Bayesian mechanics and
mechanics are calculus of understanding sense making in sentient artifacts and organisms or
particles and I'm going to try and illustrate this basic behavior with computer simulations of a
primordial soup and then I'm going to tell exactly the same story but using words
that would I would normally use when presenting to psychologists and behavioral scientists
from a more neurobiological point of view it's the same ideas but unpacked in a different way
and then if we have time I'll end up using simulations again to illustrate the different
sorts of active sampling palpation of our world getting the right kind of data to make the best
sense of those data in terms of what's going on out there beyond our skulls and so
I start the first part of the talk with a question posed by Strodinger how can the events of space and
time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living organism be accounted for by physics
and chemistry we're not going to answer that question but we are going to focus on the notion
of a spatial boundary and just acknowledge that in order to talk about something a particle a person
the priest anything that can be distinguished from the rest of the universe or its eco niche you need
to be able to define the thing that separates the particle from the non particle and and
Strodinger will be the first person to acknowledge that that separation is itself a probabilistic
construct and what I'm going to do is assume that this boundary is a statistical boundary a
probabilistic boundary a stochastic boundary known as a Markov blanket now for those people who don't
know what a Markov blanket is it's it's very simple so I'm illustrating that just imagine
a little universe where all the states that the universe could occupy are denoted by
these little circles here and one state in this universe will influence another state
as denoted by these arrows here and what a Markov blanket comprises are the states that
effectively surround the states of a what I'll call a particle but later on it'll become a person
or a virus so let's identify the internal states of this particle with this blue color here and
that immediately defines the Markov blanket as the parents the children and the parents of the
children of the internal states so what does this blanket give us well if I wanted to know
how I evolve how I change my internal states change given the rest of the universe
then I only need to know my blanket states so in other words everything I need to know
about the state of the universe all the information is contained in the blanket states here the states
that surround me and insulate me statistically from the rest of the world and in that sense
the Markov blanket demarcates or separates me from everything else in a statistical sense
but crucially there's still exchange with the rest of the world vicariously through
these blanket states here now I'm going to make a second move here I'm going to split
the blanket states into two kinds of blanket states and I'm going to call them active and sensory
states and they're operationally defined in the following way that sensory states influence but
are not influenced by internal states whereas active states are influenced but do not influence
internal states and so together the active and the sensory states constitute the blanket states
and they surround the internal states and the whole ensemble or partition can be thought of
as describing the states of a particle or a person and you may be asking well why have I
carved all the possible states of the world in this in this particular way well if you think
about anything that any organism any creature any artifact it will always have this kind of
dependency structure now so for example your brain all the activity and the connectivity in
the states of your brain at the moment can be construed as internal states and then they send
signals or influence your muscles or your secretory organs your active states that then influence the
outside that could be your body or it could be the outside environment other people that in turn
these external states then supply different sensory signals that are registered by your sensory
epithelial vision your touch organs that cause changes in your internal states that couple back
to the external states by the active states so you've got this sort of circular causality
where there's this vicarious exchange from the inside and the outside that is mediated by these
blanket states and the sensory states the active states speak to this two-way traffic between the
inside and the outside and wherever you look you'll find this kind of architecture for example in
the single celled organism the internal states could be the intracellular states the active states
could be the active filaments that support the surface of a cell that is pushed into the external
milieu that produces sensory signals on the surface of the cell the cell receptors that change the
internal states and again you have this action perception cycle in an elemental form that
describes the coupling between the inside and the outside so having hopefully established this
crucial notion of a of a Markov blanket or blanket states what I want you to do now is to
forget about blanket states what we're going to do is a foundation in all of physics from
the point of view of how states evolve the dynamics of things like us and then what we're
going to do is to put the Markov blanket back into play and see what special kind of mechanics of
physics emerges so first of all just going to describe a very generic small universe in terms
of two states that could be say my temperature and blood sugar concentration in my blood for
example if I was a physiologist or it could be the speed and the position of some particle
whatever it doesn't really matter what you assign to these particular states the important
thing is that we can describe the evolution of anything in terms of a trajectory through this
state space so as time progresses my states change and I move through this state space to
trace out these orbits here that's the mathematical expression for this trajectory in terms of flow
and some random fluctuations on the motion of these states the creek the key thing about the
kind of systems that we're interested in is that they keep coming back to regimes or parts of state
space that define the kind of system it is so you'll always find me in one of a number of a limited
number of states so for example this could be on a very fast time scale it could be electrochemical
fluctuations in a part of my brain over a few hundred milliseconds it could be me getting up in
the morning having a cup of coffee doing my emails having lunch pursuing my data life cycle it could
be description of me in different states during the year with Christmas and Easter and the summer
holidays at every level of description at every temporal scale what this description captures
is again this notion that I keep returning to states that I once occupied or they're enabled
I revisit and I am limited to a small number of states that I could possibly occupy so mathematically
we can write down the dynamics that describe this structure crucially we can also interpret this
structure as the probability of finding me in any particular state if I was sampled at a random point
in time and that interpretation is very useful in the sense we can just go to physics and take
off the shelf equations that describe the evolution of this probability distribution here
so why is that interesting well in itself it's not but remember we've just said that I keep on
revisiting all the states that define the kind of creature particle that I am and therefore
over a sufficiently long period of time this probability distribution stops changing it
doesn't change and that means that I can now take this what's called a Fokker-Planck equation you may
have heard of this in the context of the Schrodinger wave equation it's a very generic equation which I'll
demonstrate in a couple of slides all what we need to know is that the rate of change of this
probability distribution is zero which means that I can always write down the flow of any of
any system as a function of the probability of me occupying particular states this is a particular
function here using something called a Helmholtz decomposition just to make this a little bit
more intuitive so you don't have to worry about the maths imagine when I placed a drop of ink
in a cup of water now all those random fluctuations are going to disperse and dissipate
the ink molecules throughout the solvent so that in most situations for most systems you will get a
diffusion of the ink throughout the cup that's not the kind of system that we are though because
we've seen to gather ourselves up and keep us within a small number of states as if
unlike the normal drop of ink that diffuses away we have an active kind of ink that actively
gathers itself up and looks as if it's diffusing up concentration gradients and that's precisely what
that equation on the previous slide is describing that if there is this attracting set this manifold
this set of states to which I keep on returning it must be the case that on average it will look as
if I'm trying to increase the probability by moving up these probability gradients so this
called a gradient flow denoted by the blue lines and this equation here that depends upon the
amplitude of the random fluctuations there's another component of this flow of this dynamics
which circulates on the isocontals concentrations if you like and they refer to a serinoidal flow
very important kind of flow as you'll see in the next slide you will be familiar with
this sort of mixture of gradient flows either going up the gradients or down the negative
long probability of these gradients there is accompanied by this circular serinoidal flow
just when you watch water going down a plug hole for example that the water is going down
it's falling down the gradients under the pull of gravity whilst at the same time it's circulating
around and that's the this is a fundamental kind of behavior that all systems that have these
attracting sets exhibit and just to make that absolutely to be emphatic about that
what I've done here is just write down all of physics on one slide and we don't need to go
to the into the equations in any sense because the basic message here is that all of these
equations are the same thing and they're just re were different ways of writing down this
this gradient flow or this equation of motion here there are special cases I can sort of
take away the random fluctuations and just left with this circular flow the serinoidal flow
and this would be the kind of behavior that you see with large very cool bodies that don't have
these random fluctuations such as massive such as a heavily bodies large particles that just orbit
around so this will be description of Newtonian mechanics that would be apt to describe the
motion of the planets for example classical mechanics is another word for this kind of
mechanics as physics where we can ignore the random fluctuations or we could ignore the slow
motion of the planets and focus on systems that are very hot and very small or lots of small
things and then we get statistical mechanics thermodynamics here illustrated in terms of
fluctuation dissipation theorems that will be appropriate to describe the dynamics and the
motion of gases and and fluids and they're like in in classical system mechanics I can make another
move I could simply express the this probability of finding me in a particular state x in terms of
the product of two complex numbers called wave functions and then this equation becomes a
scrolling away equation so you've got a complete canopy a complete description of nearly all the
physics we know contained in this one fundamental gradient flow so it is at this point now I want
to recall the Markov blanket because if this equation is so fundamental then there must be
another kind of mechanics that inherits from that particular partitioning of states into
internal external and active states and what we're going to see is effectively that we can
interpret this kind of mechanics which has exactly the same functional form as classical
statistical and quantum mechanics in terms of perception and action that we were talking about
before through the Markov blanket specifically what will happen is that these flows now can be read
as flows moving up concentration gradients or down potential gradients supplied by a free energy
functional that just depends upon the blanket states and the internal states in a particular
way which we'll talk about later so what about the Markov blanket well this has to be true if
something exists and we just said a thing has to have a Markov blanket before it's defined
therefore this has to be true of the internal states of something me and my active states
and therefore we can look at this as a physics that describes the dynamics that underwrite
perception and action so is this sensible and I would submit that it is very sensible and something
which you are probably all familiar with in the following sense that it will look as if I am acting
and sense making in a way that maximizes this quantity here well what is this well it's just
the log of the probability of my blanket states that are characteristic of me so it's exactly those
states or blanket states that I find attractive that I keep returning to so this is just a statement
of the states that are valuable for me and if I now read that quantity in terms of value I now
have a mathematical description of reinforcement learning in behavioral psychology optimal control
theory and engineering and in economics expected utility theory where I can read this as standing
in for utility and what we'll see later is this is mathematically the same as a negative
free energy hence the free energy principle so the free energy principle is just a statement of this
exactly this dynamic but with a twist it's taking the negative value and why well the negative value
the negative log probability of some state given me is also an information theory known
as self-information or surprise or more simply surprise it measures the the implausibility
