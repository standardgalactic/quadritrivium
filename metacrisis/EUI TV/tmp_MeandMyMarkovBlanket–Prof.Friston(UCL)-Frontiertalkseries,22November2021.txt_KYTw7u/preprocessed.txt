it's a hello everyone great to see you again it's our first frontier talk this year in
the cluster on technological change in society and to open this series of talks we have invited
today professor Carl Friston. Professor Friston is a professor of Neuroscience at University
College London and is also the scientific director of the Welcome Trust Center for neuroimaging.
Professor Friston is a leading authority on brain imaging is known for his invention of a
technique called statistical parametric mapping that's where I have
to concede that I'm a lawyer by training and I struggle with the technical language but I think
I get the insights. The technique I understand helps analyzing brain images into a consistent
shape something which was very hard to do before it was invented. Now what led us to invite Professor
Friston to talk here is his work on something called the free energy principle and I understand
the free energy principle personally as trying to provide nothing less than a unifying theory
of what's behind life and I encountered the free energy principle through sort of weekly reading
in the mainstream press there was a wired paper not long ago that talked about Professor Friston's
work on the free energy principle and my mind was blown away by this reading and I got interested
and even though this is very hard science and there's a lot of hard science behind it I was
fascinated by the very rich set of deep insights about philosophy about the ordering of the world
and about the very deep questions it throws in relation to consciousness, nature, reproduction
and a whole sort of issues which are very important. More concretely I think the free energy
principle in the paper it was described as a full of implications and ramifications for artificial
intelligence research, economics and also philosophy so I would not like to spend too
much time introducing our guests today and I would not like also that talk to drag for too
long beyond what Professor Friston has agreed to give us. Professor Friston has a very prolific
production I read in the wired paper that he could produce an academic paper in four days
and I know that if that is the case it's a huge opportunity because for science if we
take too much of his time today so I would not like to do that and I will hand over immediately
to him thanking him again for his presence with us today. Professor Friston you have the floor.
Thank you very much for that lovely introduction. It was a
splendid description of the free energy principle and the job that I have ahead of me in terms of
bringing this physics of sentience to the table as something that could be
usefully unpacked in the context of behavior and social sciences. I am very mindful that I suspect
I was invited to expand your horizons not towards the arts and humanities but in the other direction
back towards physics and hard science so I apologize in advance that many of the ideas I'm
going to talk about inherit from physics and explicitly we're going to be talking about
physics of sentience and in particular sentient behavior so my hope is to go from some basic
physics I'm going to the first part of the talk will be an introductory foundational introduction
to the physics of self-organization but then try to move us through insights and intuitions
to a formal understanding of the choices that we make and why we go around sampling our lived
worlds in the way that we do. I will also apologize for the use of equations all of this inherits
from the maths so I use equations to make sure I'm telling the right story for you though they
can be treated as iconic representations of ideas and I will try to unpack them intuitively using
things you'll be very familiar with. I can promise you though that the end point the denouement
of this analysis will be in the fields and address ideas with which you will already
be very familiar so the agenda here is to enable people to join the dots between different perspectives
on the same kind of thing that is underwritten by the physics of sentience that I want to talk
about so the talk's going to have two parts basically the first is a kind of talk that I would give
to engineers machine learning people and people in physics considering the the
fundamentals and the statistics of life with a special focus on something called Markov blankets
and what arises from the presence of Markov blankets which is a Bayesian mechanics and
mechanics are calculus of understanding sense making in sentient artifacts and organisms or
particles and I'm going to try and illustrate this basic behavior with computer simulations of a
primordial soup and then I'm going to tell exactly the same story but using words
that would I would normally use when presenting to psychologists and behavioral scientists
from a more neurobiological point of view it's the same ideas but unpacked in a different way
and then if we have time I'll end up using simulations again to illustrate the different
sorts of active sampling palpation of our world getting the right kind of data to make the best
sense of those data in terms of what's going on out there beyond our skulls and so
I start the first part of the talk with a question posed by Strodinger how can the events of space and
time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living organism be accounted for by physics
and chemistry we're not going to answer that question but we are going to focus on the notion
of a spatial boundary and just acknowledge that in order to talk about something a particle a person
the priest anything that can be distinguished from the rest of the universe or its eco niche you need
to be able to define the thing that separates the particle from the non particle and and
Strodinger will be the first person to acknowledge that that separation is itself a probabilistic
construct and what I'm going to do is assume that this boundary is a statistical boundary a
probabilistic boundary a stochastic boundary known as a Markov blanket now for those people who don't
know what a Markov blanket is it's it's very simple so I'm illustrating that just imagine
a little universe where all the states that the universe could occupy are denoted by
these little circles here and one state in this universe will influence another state
as denoted by these arrows here and what a Markov blanket comprises are the states that
effectively surround the states of a what I'll call a particle but later on it'll become a person
or a virus so let's identify the internal states of this particle with this blue color here and
that immediately defines the Markov blanket as the parents the children and the parents of the
children of the internal states so what does this blanket give us well if I wanted to know
how I evolve how I change my internal states change given the rest of the universe
then I only need to know my blanket states so in other words everything I need to know
about the state of the universe all the information is contained in the blanket states here the states
that surround me and insulate me statistically from the rest of the world and in that sense
the Markov blanket demarcates or separates me from everything else in a statistical sense
but crucially there's still exchange with the rest of the world vicariously through
these blanket states here now I'm going to make a second move here I'm going to split
the blanket states into two kinds of blanket states and I'm going to call them active and sensory
states and they're operationally defined in the following way that sensory states influence but
are not influenced by internal states whereas active states are influenced but do not influence
internal states and so together the active and the sensory states constitute the blanket states
and they surround the internal states and the whole ensemble or partition can be thought of
as describing the states of a particle or a person and you may be asking well why have I
carved all the possible states of the world in this in this particular way well if you think
about anything that any organism any creature any artifact it will always have this kind of
dependency structure now so for example your brain all the activity and the connectivity in
the states of your brain at the moment can be construed as internal states and then they send
signals or influence your muscles or your secretory organs your active states that then influence the
outside that could be your body or it could be the outside environment other people that in turn
these external states then supply different sensory signals that are registered by your sensory
epithelial vision your touch organs that cause changes in your internal states that couple back
to the external states by the active states so you've got this sort of circular causality
where there's this vicarious exchange from the inside and the outside that is mediated by these
blanket states and the sensory states the active states speak to this two-way traffic between the
inside and the outside and wherever you look you'll find this kind of architecture for example in
the single celled organism the internal states could be the intracellular states the active states
could be the active filaments that support the surface of a cell that is pushed into the external
milieu that produces sensory signals on the surface of the cell the cell receptors that change the
internal states and again you have this action perception cycle in an elemental form that
describes the coupling between the inside and the outside so having hopefully established this
crucial notion of a of a Markov blanket or blanket states what I want you to do now is to
forget about blanket states what we're going to do is a foundation in all of physics from
the point of view of how states evolve the dynamics of things like us and then what we're
going to do is to put the Markov blanket back into play and see what special kind of mechanics of
physics emerges so first of all just going to describe a very generic small universe in terms
of two states that could be say my temperature and blood sugar concentration in my blood for
example if I was a physiologist or it could be the speed and the position of some particle
whatever it doesn't really matter what you assign to these particular states the important
thing is that we can describe the evolution of anything in terms of a trajectory through this
state space so as time progresses my states change and I move through this state space to
trace out these orbits here that's the mathematical expression for this trajectory in terms of flow
and some random fluctuations on the motion of these states the creek the key thing about the
kind of systems that we're interested in is that they keep coming back to regimes or parts of state
space that define the kind of system it is so you'll always find me in one of a number of a limited
number of states so for example this could be on a very fast time scale it could be electrochemical
fluctuations in a part of my brain over a few hundred milliseconds it could be me getting up in
the morning having a cup of coffee doing my emails having lunch pursuing my data life cycle it could
be description of me in different states during the year with Christmas and Easter and the summer
holidays at every level of description at every temporal scale what this description captures
is again this notion that I keep returning to states that I once occupied or they're enabled
I revisit and I am limited to a small number of states that I could possibly occupy so mathematically
we can write down the dynamics that describe this structure crucially we can also interpret this
structure as the probability of finding me in any particular state if I was sampled at a random point
in time and that interpretation is very useful in the sense we can just go to physics and take
off the shelf equations that describe the evolution of this probability distribution here
so why is that interesting well in itself it's not but remember we've just said that I keep on
revisiting all the states that define the kind of creature particle that I am and therefore
over a sufficiently long period of time this probability distribution stops changing it
doesn't change and that means that I can now take this what's called a Fokker-Planck equation you may
have heard of this in the context of the Schrodinger wave equation it's a very generic equation which I'll
demonstrate in a couple of slides all what we need to know is that the rate of change of this
probability distribution is zero which means that I can always write down the flow of any of
any system as a function of the probability of me occupying particular states this is a particular
function here using something called a Helmholtz decomposition just to make this a little bit
more intuitive so you don't have to worry about the maths imagine when I placed a drop of ink
in a cup of water now all those random fluctuations are going to disperse and dissipate
the ink molecules throughout the solvent so that in most situations for most systems you will get a
diffusion of the ink throughout the cup that's not the kind of system that we are though because
we've seen to gather ourselves up and keep us within a small number of states as if
unlike the normal drop of ink that diffuses away we have an active kind of ink that actively
gathers itself up and looks as if it's diffusing up concentration gradients and that's precisely what
that equation on the previous slide is describing that if there is this attracting set this manifold
this set of states to which I keep on returning it must be the case that on average it will look as
if I'm trying to increase the probability by moving up these probability gradients so this
called a gradient flow denoted by the blue lines and this equation here that depends upon the
amplitude of the random fluctuations there's another component of this flow of this dynamics
which circulates on the isocontals concentrations if you like and they refer to a serinoidal flow
very important kind of flow as you'll see in the next slide you will be familiar with
this sort of mixture of gradient flows either going up the gradients or down the negative
long probability of these gradients there is accompanied by this circular serinoidal flow
just when you watch water going down a plug hole for example that the water is going down
it's falling down the gradients under the pull of gravity whilst at the same time it's circulating
around and that's the this is a fundamental kind of behavior that all systems that have these
attracting sets exhibit and just to make that absolutely to be emphatic about that
what I've done here is just write down all of physics on one slide and we don't need to go
to the into the equations in any sense because the basic message here is that all of these
equations are the same thing and they're just re were different ways of writing down this
this gradient flow or this equation of motion here there are special cases I can sort of
take away the random fluctuations and just left with this circular flow the serinoidal flow
and this would be the kind of behavior that you see with large very cool bodies that don't have
these random fluctuations such as massive such as a heavily bodies large particles that just orbit
around so this will be description of Newtonian mechanics that would be apt to describe the
motion of the planets for example classical mechanics is another word for this kind of
mechanics as physics where we can ignore the random fluctuations or we could ignore the slow
motion of the planets and focus on systems that are very hot and very small or lots of small
things and then we get statistical mechanics thermodynamics here illustrated in terms of
fluctuation dissipation theorems that will be appropriate to describe the dynamics and the
motion of gases and and fluids and they're like in in classical system mechanics I can make another
move I could simply express the this probability of finding me in a particular state x in terms of
the product of two complex numbers called wave functions and then this equation becomes a
scrolling away equation so you've got a complete canopy a complete description of nearly all the
physics we know contained in this one fundamental gradient flow so it is at this point now I want
to recall the Markov blanket because if this equation is so fundamental then there must be
another kind of mechanics that inherits from that particular partitioning of states into
internal external and active states and what we're going to see is effectively that we can
interpret this kind of mechanics which has exactly the same functional form as classical
statistical and quantum mechanics in terms of perception and action that we were talking about
before through the Markov blanket specifically what will happen is that these flows now can be read
as flows moving up concentration gradients or down potential gradients supplied by a free energy
functional that just depends upon the blanket states and the internal states in a particular
way which we'll talk about later so what about the Markov blanket well this has to be true if
something exists and we just said a thing has to have a Markov blanket before it's defined
therefore this has to be true of the internal states of something me and my active states
and therefore we can look at this as a physics that describes the dynamics that underwrite
perception and action so is this sensible and I would submit that it is very sensible and something
which you are probably all familiar with in the following sense that it will look as if I am acting
and sense making in a way that maximizes this quantity here well what is this well it's just
the log of the probability of my blanket states that are characteristic of me so it's exactly those
states or blanket states that I find attractive that I keep returning to so this is just a statement
of the states that are valuable for me and if I now read that quantity in terms of value I now
have a mathematical description of reinforcement learning in behavioral psychology optimal control
theory and engineering and in economics expected utility theory where I can read this as standing
in for utility and what we'll see later is this is mathematically the same as a negative
free energy hence the free energy principle so the free energy principle is just a statement of this
exactly this dynamic but with a twist it's taking the negative value and why well the negative value
the negative log probability of some state given me is also an information theory known
as self-information or surprise or more simply surprise it measures the the implausibility
or the surprise that I might on an anthropomorphic reading experience if I was in this particular
state and by minimizing this surprise I'm implicitly maximizing the efficiency the
mutual information between my my internal states my external states and according to the informants
principle the principles of minimum redundancy or maximum efficiency of Horace Barlow and indeed
the free energy principle is there another way of understanding this well yes because the the
average surprise or self-information in thermodynamics and physics is known as entropy
which means that it looks as if anything that exists will be trying to resist the increase
in entropy and of course that's the holy grail of self-organization in physics synergetics and if
I was a physiologist it's just a statement of homeostasis it's just keeping things within viable
bounds that characterize those physiological states that you will typically find me in and I have
always look as if I have to conform to those imperatives in order to exist or put it another
way to exist means that I will advance this kind of dynamics there's a final interpretation which I
want to leverage which is the interpretation of statistician would bring to the table and so
hitherto we've been talking about given me a model a thing with my blanket states it looks as if
action and perception are maximizing the probability of the blanket states that characterize me but I
can also read me as a model of what caused my blanket state and that's known as the marginal
likelihood or the model evidence statistics so what this means is that we can understand
perception action as in the service of maximizing model evidence heuristically some people like to
think of this as gathering evidence that I exist in the sense that I am a model of my world also
called self-evidencing in philosophy and in the computational neurosciences this leads to notions
of the Bayesian brain because this is also known as Bayesian model evidence evidence accumulation
something that's become very popular in the neurosciences recently predictive processing
generically and the particular instance of that called predictive coding where the emphasis is
on prediction and we'll turn to that interpretation in the second half but before we do that let me
just demystify and make intuitive the kind of behavior that we're trying to describe here
we're going to do that by creating a small universe and asking can we use this notion of a Markov
blanket to define a little virus or a little particle that lives in this universe a primordial
soup and if I can does it show the sort of behavior that can be understood as predicting
or inferring the causes of my sensory impressions on this Markov blanket so here's the results in
video format of a simulation of those equations of motion where we've simulated lots of little
molecules all of which have the intrinsic activity and they're all coupled to each other with some
arbitrary electromagnetic and other kinds of forces so they're bubbling away quite happily
together here and you maybe ask me well why have I done this well I've done this because
I've written down the equations of motion I know what influence is what and therefore I can identify
a set of molecules here and ask what are their Markov blanket and ask what is the behavior of
that particle defined by the Markov blanket that surrounds its internal states so here's
the exactly the same simulation what I've done here is color code all the molecules according to
whether they're internal states in blue active states that lie beneath the surface of the sensory
states that are exposed to the external states in cyan here and what we see is indeed there is a
little virus like particle with a little celium or tail here wiggling around sitting happily
at the heart of this synthetic primordial soup so the question now is do these internal blue
states appear to infer or self-evidence infer the causes of their sensory states and one can do
that just by looking at the fluctuations the internal dynamics so the activity in your brain
and see whether it correlates with something going on out there so for example does your brain
respond to visual motion do you get visually evoked responses if you see something or you
recognize it's a particular face are there any lawful dynamical coupling or is there a lawful
dynamical coupling between fluctuations out there and what's going on on the inside and indeed there
is it's inevitable and you can actually see with the naked eye these these the synchronization
between the inside and the outside this particular example has taken a time lagged record over time
and the fluctuations in these internal states here and this shows here the the mixture that best
predicts the movement of these external states movement of things in the outside world or in
the environment so the prediction of the actual velocity are shown in dotted and solid lines here
you can see a remarkable correlation and indeed this catastrophic event where this molecule in the
soup was spit was evicted from the soup and then fell back in again but like a solar flare
is registered with these internal fluctuations and the reason I'm showing you this example
is it begs an interesting question if you look closely you can see that these internal fluctuations
appear to predate this event on the outside and yet endure after this outside event has occurred
so the question now is did the internal states cause the outside states or did the external
states cause fluctuations in the inside states and if I was there in person I would ask the
audience to vote on this and they all look at me as if I'm stupid because you all know the answer
is both and of course you'd be absolutely right and so this is nothing more than something called
generalized synchrony famously observed many centuries ago by Christian Huygens when he
observed that clocks when suspended from the same wall or the same beam would ultimately come
to swing in synchrony that was the only if you like attracting set the viable solution
that they kept revisiting by swinging in synchrony and this is in fact a drawing from
Huygens here of two clocks with the with one pendulum here and another there suspended from
the same beam and from our point of view we can regard one clock as the internal states the
other clock as the external states and the beam supplies the blanket states that couple the inside
to the outside so that's the fundamental dynamic we're talking about a synchronization
that has to be there simply because systems have attracting sets and mark off blankets
which means that there's some coupling between the inside and the outside that is can be formalized
in terms of this gradient flow this gathering up of states up probability gradients or down
free energy gradients and I like this sketch because it highlights the complete symmetry
of the argument so if you subscribe to this Bayesian reading of generalized synchrony namely that
I'm trying to infer what's going on out there that it is also in the case that the environment
and everything out there is trying to learn about you and infer what kind of thing and what's going
on on the inside that may sound a rather magical interpretation but it's not so silly when you
think about things like eco niche construction and the like and the emergence of culture
but that's another story at the moment we just need to celebrate we've done all the equations we've
done all the the physics in part and that can be summarized with the following that the existence
of a particle in a very general sense implies a partition of a systems states the systemic
states into internal and blanket states that comprise sensory and active states and external
states that are hidden behind the mark off blanket from the point of view of the internal
states they're sometimes also called latent states they can't be observed directly but only through
the mark off blanket and because active states change but are not changed by external states
they reduce the entropy of the blanket states and this means that action will appear to maintain
the structural functional integrity of the mark off blanket and in the life sciences or the biological
sciences um this has been uh called self um uh creation or self construction uh auto poesis
um in chemistry computational chemistry we know the self assembly your molecules that assemble
themselves uh and maintain their form finally internal states will appear look as if they're
inferring or predicting the hidden causes of sensory states namely the hidden states um by
increasing Bayesian model evidence or marginal likelihood and will actively influence those
causes by acting on through their active states the external states and we refer to that in my
world at least as active inference um so here's a a little break to demarcate the two parts of the
mature we we used to have a postdoctoral student uh Franz who went to America and shortly after
arriving um had a baby little Kira with with his wife and his wife bought uh Kira um her own mark
off blanket so this is mark off and this is Kira's mark off blanket so if you want a mark off
blanket you can get them in America uh and here's Kira making her inferences about her world through
her particular mark off blanket anyway um we're now going to rehearse exactly the same narrative
but from the point of view of psychology and understanding this Bayesian mechanics in terms
of you know uh what it means for sentient behavior what you know what must systems that conform to
the Bayesian mechanics physics of sentience what would they look like and how would you understand
their functional anatomy their structure and um and and behavior so the story here probably
starts with the students of Plato and can certainly be tracked uh in philosophy through
people like Kant and then through um into the life sciences uh to the work of people like Helmholtz
I think beautifully summarized by by this illustration here um in the sense that to
perceive something to make sense of something means that you have to have it on the inside
that the um the the brain is your brain and my brain is literally a fantastic organ in the
sense that it has these hypotheses these fantasies these potential explanations of what caused all of
its sensory inputs and on this view the sensory information and indeed any information that we
gather or forage for um in our lived world is just in the service of refuting or confirming
your hypothesis that this is the state of the world out there that is generating sensory data
um so nicely illustrated by this 16th century oil painter famed for painting still lives
but when viewed from a different perspective create a very different explanation a very different
impression so if previously you saw a bowl of fruit but now you see a face the point here is
that you made that face this face is what you have brought to the table in order to provide
the most parsimonious explanation for this particular pattern of sensory impressions
and this is um I think most beautifully articulated by the writings of Herman Helmholtz
so for example objects are always imagined as being present in the field of vision as would
have to be there in order to produce the same impression on the nervous mechanism so you have
this hypothesis and something out there that if it was there it would produce this impression
these sensory inputs and therefore I have explained these sensory impressions and that sensory
evidence has confirmed my hypothesis this is what's going on outside my skull bound brain
and this idea is very closely related to ideas in psychology here by Richard Gregory that
perception simply is hypothesis testing um the maths that underwrites this which we've already
done the physics part of the talk um has been leveraged to great effect in machine learning
by people like Jeffrey Hinton and Peter Diane who indeed created a machine learning um metaphor
for the Bayesian brain that was called the Helmholtz machine by borrowing from Bayesian probability
theory and in particular the work of Richard Feynman on this variational free energy bound on
or approximation to this model evidence or marginal likelihood um so let's just look at
this notion of producing this the same impression on the nervous mechanism so from our point of
view what this can be thought of is the impressions of the external states out there on the sensory
part of my Markov blanket or my Markovian veil my sensory veil that separates me from the outside
very much like shadows on Plato's cave or in this instance shadows projected onto the sensory veil
here and if it's the case that we are have to be in synchrony with the outside and that will
look as if I am predicting and representing and inferring what's uh going on out there I am compelled
to make sense of these sensory impressions by inferring what could have caused these shadows
here so how might a brain do that how might your brain do that well the answer is probably much
simpler than you might imagine we already know the functional form of the bifysical dynamics
of our brains that does this kind of sense making um we know that it has to be a gradient flow on
on this value or negative value function or surprise of this free energy function of the
sensory states that depends upon the internal state which I'm now going to read as an expectation
about what caused my sensory inputs um and I've just rewritten this equation in a slightly
different way which if you were an engineer you would recognize as something called a Kalman filter
which is a very generic way of making sense of data using sensors in engineering and physics
and it basically just separates these solenoidal circular and the gradient flow parts into a
prediction which is a solenoidal part of what's going to happen next given I believe this is the
state of the world I expect this to be the state of the world out there and then a correction term
which is the the hill climbing or the gradient part in the sense that I can always write down a
gradient of the free energy as a prediction error so it's a correction term based upon a prediction
error here denoted by epsilon so what's the prediction error well imagine we have this
sensory shadow on our retina and imagine that we had this internal expectation that it was a
dog that was causing this sensory input and if I had a generative model that could generate
the sensations that I would experience if I was right my expectation was that this was a dog
and I can take the prediction of those sensory samples generated by the generative model and
subtract them or compare them with the actual sensory input and the mismatch of the difference
is simply the prediction but this equation says that the prediction error is going to drive my
expectations until the free energy is minimized or the prediction error is resolved and I've got
the best account possible of my sensory input so this prediction error is then sent back up
to change my mind to change my expectations until the prediction matches the sensory input
and the prediction error is eliminated and resolved and explained away and if I can do that
then I have if you like complied with this fundamental dynamics that comes from this
physics of sentience and I've got a good enough explanation for my world and I say good enough
because I'll never actually know what caused my sensations and this instance it was not a dog it
was a cat but that doesn't matter as long as I can keep my prediction errors to a minimum throughout
my existence job done so that reading of this Bayesian mechanics is nice in the sense that it
just resolves or reduces to a minimization of prediction error and in turn you can minimize
prediction error in two ways that speak to action and perception so you can reduce prediction error
either by making the predictions more like the sensations by literally changing my mind or by
neural activity encoding those expectations so that I generate predictions of my sensations
that are more similar to the actual sensory samples so this would be perception or I can
make my sensations more like the predictions so how would I do that well I just change the data
or the way that I am sampling the world I literally reach out and I touch or I google this page or
I move my eyes to look over there as opposed to look over there I actively re-sample the world
to solicit those kinds of sensations that I predict I given the kind of creature I am
would expect to sample so the action now tries to fulfill the predictions of perception
and that explanation is certainly a coarse grained level of analysis to describe the
functional architectures and message passing the anatomy and physiology of our brains I have
just cartooned this here for those people interested in the neurobiology that accompanies this
formulation of sentient behavior by showing a hierarchical wiring diagram for your brain
which is the visual area here where your visual sensations come in right up to
frontal eye fields in the front part of your brain determining where you look next but if you now
read this architecture as a very complicated hierarchical namely deep generative model generating
sensory predictions from the causes with their random fluctuations in the cascading way here
illustrated by a combination of what I'm looking at and where I'm looking at it to actually generate
sensory samples that your eyes might sample in their central representation of their phobia
as you palpate your visual world then you now have the structural form for this gradient flow
so here written down in terms of the Kalman filter which just involves switching out the
random fluctuations for these prediction errors and immediately tells one this is the kind of
reciprocal message passing that your brains must be engaged in where you take these sensations you
compare them with top-down predictions to form a prediction error and then the prediction error
is used to drive these expectations to provide better predictions and so on to increasingly
hierarchical levels of abstraction all mediated by this very simple gradient flow that is unpacked
here in terms of ascending prediction errors from the sensory parts of your brain to the deeper
parts of your brain that is complemented by an inside out on descending down the hierarchy stream
of predictions that are required to form the prediction errors and this is an example which
I won't go into in any detail because I just want to if you like
tell a story or paint a picture of the way that neurobiologists would think about neuroanatomy
and neurophysiology under this kind of construction the only important thing that this
particular example brings to the table is that we have to make sense of all different kinds of
data you know visual data that is caused by things out there people words cars visual objects
you have to make sense of that visual data through this hierarchical message passing usually in the
posterior part of your brain initially but there's another kind of data we also have to make sense of
and that's the data that reports the states of our actuators the levers that we can pull
to influence the outside the emails that we send the instructions that we give to those people who
have to interface with things beyond our mark off blanket either institutionally or in terms of our
embodied brains and these kinds of data come in and we could have we could form a prediction
error we could use that prediction error to update our beliefs about the deployment of our
actuators our our secretion organs our muscles or indeed the people that we we send out to
deliver our goods for an institution but there's another a much simpler way to eliminate those
prediction errors and that's the the action part I can simply send these prediction errors back into
the outside world to cause movement until the signals from my organs of movement by organs of
my actuators are reporting yes they're in the predicted position so this is how our bodies
work these are known as motor reflex arcs in our bodies but also I would I know in robotics this
is how robots work you predict what the robot should feel in terms of its senses that are attached to
its activators actuators and I would contend this is basically how anything works that basically
is fulfilling the predictions where you set targets for what you'd expect to get feedback
from what's out there in terms of things you can influence and all of this is just another way of
leveraging the other way of minimizing prediction errors which is this active
acting upon the world to produce the right kind of sensory input
so I've got to conclude now just by drilling down a little bit more on that sort of free
energy functional because I want to connect it to economics and choice and the way that we
forage in the world for particular outcomes and the emphasis I want to place now on the
the final few slides is it's not just about minimizing surprise in terms of maximizing
the probability of encountering the outcomes that characterize me it's also about minimizing
expected surprise namely uncertainty it's also about exploring to resolve your uncertainty
about the world in which you operate so the first example is just to illustrate a very fundamental
way of eliminating surprise which is the surprise that my sense organs and my actuator organs are
not actually in the position that I predicted and you can use this very simple kind of active
inference prediction error minimization both in the perceptual and the active domain to simulate
a lot of quite high end behaviors and neurophysiological phenomena that we see in the in the brain
sciences or the neurosciences this example is just to simulate handwriting so all we've done here is
equip this little synthetic brain with a central pattern generator that is generating predictions
of both proprioceptive or motion sensations and sensory and visual sensations so
specifically here the synthetic agent has a particular belief that there is some motion
in the outside visual world that controls the position of an invisible point
and that invisible point is connected by a spring to the tip of her finger so what she expects to
see and feel is her finger being pulled around in a particular orbit that is prescribed by this
central pattern generator so that she will reflexively fulfill the expected proprioceptive
or motor signals by reflexively moving to produce exactly the predicted movement sensations whilst
at the same time generating the predicted visual sensations so what one has done here she can
author her own sensations and do that actively so it looks as if she's writing and here's a very
simple bit of writing here I won't go into the physiology that or the synthetic or simulated
physiology this color simulation offers other than to say there are some cardinal features in
terms of place selectivity in terms of direction selectivity in terms of a dual role of these
internal dynamics these internal states in generating the consequences of action whether
it's you or not you so you can use the same brain machine with the same genetic models
to explain the action not only of yourself and to actually emit those actions reflexively
but also to explain the action of other people and for what their intentions were and what they
what they are actually doing that's known as the mirror neuron system so mathematically the
architecture that we've just used to produce this very simple demonstration of active inference
is summarized in in this slide here where we have the outside world supplying these sensory
signals that are used to minimize to optimize our expectations and beliefs about the state of
the world the external states here by minimizing this prediction error or technically by doing a
gradient descent on the prediction error or the gradients of the free energy minimizing the free
energy and then when we got the right expectations the best expectations at hand given our sensory
input we then can generate predictions about what we would feel and sense in terms of our actions
and our actuators and then we minimize those prediction errors by acting upon the world
and we get this reflexive kind of behavior engagement and synchrony with the outside world
but there's a much more sophisticated and I think plausible way of prescribing action
that involves equipping these narrative models with a model of the consequences of my behavior
and I think it's these kinds of model which are much better for explaining the way that we
decide what to do next through planning so this is a more sophisticated generative model
it relies upon exactly the same Bayesian mechanics but the difference now is we're talking about
generative models that have acquired a temporal depth in the sense that they can see or predict
into the future and in particular the consequences of action on the world and as soon as you do that
you now basically have machinery to plan and what does that mean well it simply moves as before
we are taking sensory inputs where building through this minimization of prediction error
of free energy a leafs about states of the world then we're going to roll out into the future
under different courses of action and evaluate the free energy that we would expect if we committed
to this course of action and then we're going to use that free energy to score the quality or the
goodness of any particular action and then take the best action that has the minimum expected
free energy and we then prosecute that action as part of a plan so this is much more a long term
intentional kind of action in the sense that I have to select amongst a number of different
actions each of which is scored by the expected free energy so again forgive me for the equations
this is the last slide with heavy equations and again that you don't have to know what they mean
all I want you to know what this slide is meant to convey is a beautiful symmetry between the free
energy that's that if you like underwrites our sense making and our perception and the free energy
we expect under a given action aid here in the future so they have exactly the same functional
form but these are just expected versions of these so what are these well it just allows me to
qualify why you know the why this is called a free energy it basically comprises an entropy
term and an energy term that can be rearranged and understood from a number of different perspectives
if if I was in machine learning I would read it as a mixture of this thing that we want to
maximize which is the probability of sensory outcomes given my majority of model or me
that is equipped with something that can never be less than zero which means that this thing
is always a bound on the thing that I want to optimize I phrase it like that because if you
did we went to machine learning then this would be the objective function used in things like variation
autoencoders or deep learning it's a very it's an evidence bound you know and if the free energy is
a negative this free energy it's an evidence lower bound known as an elbow in machine learning
if it was a statistician I'd have a different reading of this just by switching around these
terms I would interpret this as trying to find the most accurate account of my sensory information
in the simplest way possible by minimizing the complexity and what is the complexity
well it's just the the degree to which I change my mind the degrees of freedom I use up we're
moving from my prior beliefs to my posterior beliefs after observing the sensory data so
it's the complexity scores the literally the degree to which I change my mind and that has
a computational cost and an energetic energetic cost so these are just two ways of carving up
this fundamental objective function here that survive when you take the expectation of it
and they basically survive in the sense that the expected complexity of any move on the world
becomes risk and the expected inaccuracy becomes ambiguity in the same way the expected bang
becomes an intrinsic value and the expected log evidence becomes an extrinsic value so at this
point I'm hoping that many of you will recognize what these things are when formulated in the language
of of your field so if you were well let's just look at intrinsic points ignore extrinsic value
for the moment and ask well what is this intrinsic value and what it is mathematically is a measure
of the change in my beliefs my expectations afforded by the sensory consequences of action
so it's the information game that I get if I did that and in the visual search in the
neuroscience this is known as a Bayesian surprise more generally it is also known as a mutual
information between cause and consequence between the external states the causes and the sensory
consequences that would ensue if I made this action so I'm always acting in a way to maximise
the information transfer between me and what's going on out there also known as intrinsic
motivation in robotics it's the part of this free energy minimisation that expels artificial
curiosity and base optimal design and in statistics and another way of looking at this as well let's
make life a little bit simpler let's assume that I can see everything in the sense that my sensory
impressions just are the causes so there's no ambiguity there's no uncertainty about the
states of the world the sense states of the world and the actual external states so this
term here just disappears the accuracy becomes unimportant and I'm just left with the expected
complexity and the risk so what's that well it's another what's known as K. L. Kolbakliber
divergence between two beliefs beliefs about the outcomes of action and my prior preferences
the the states that I prefer the attracting states a priori I would expect to encounter
so it's just a qualitative measure of the difference between what I think will happen if I do this
and what I want or expect to happen or prefer to happen a priori and in engineering this is known
as KL control in economics you might recognise this as risk sensitive control that includes
the kind of uncertainty that attends taking this action or this investment with respect to
another one I can make a final move here and come take all uncertainty off the table other than
that which is bound up in terms of the the extrinsic value so I assume that I I know everything
that I need to know all the reduced blood certainty about the world has been resolved
through epistemic foraging or responding to epistemic affordances I've watched the right
news channels I've read the right books I've checked out the right Wikipedia pages I know
everything I need to know no more active information seeking behaviour is required
then what am I left with but I'm just left with this in extrinsic value what is this
it's just what where we started it's the expected utility or value of an outcomes under a particular
action and that again in economics could be read as basically expected utility theory
that inherits simply from this generic form and this perspective on planning as inference
under deep generative models trying to minimise this expected variational free energy
a final simulation to show you how this works in practice in neurobiology
this is the visual search if you like illustration of this this kind of epistemic foraging
that acknowledges that when we actually look around the visual scene we can actually sample a
very very small part of it we think we see everything because we've done an internal
scene construction through this active inference but in fact we actually see tiny little points
or little circles here of information at any one time we have to build a picture by deploying
our visual palpation to the right parts of the visual scene to build up a confident
belief or expectation that I am actually looking at this kind of thing and you can score that in
terms of the expected free energy on the salience if you like of centering my visual sampling here
or here or here or here build up a map that in the visual neuroscience is known as a salience map
that empirically does seem to attract our actions and our eye movements in the sense that we always
look and deploy our active vision in a way that resolves the most amount of uncertainty
or has the greatest information gain and we can simulate that this is the generative model
that we use it's very simple little hierarchical model that just uses that
Kalman filter or that gradient flow that inherits from the the Bayesian mechanics
and we can simulate visual origin so this agent had a very simple universe that could either
be in three states with an upright face a sideways face or an inverted face and yet the
agent she can only look at little parts of this visual scene and has to decide where to move and
look and she does so sequentially every 250 milliseconds or so looking here then here then here
then here and at each point changing her beliefs about what would happen in terms of the salience
of the expected free energy namely changing the salience map as she resolves uncertainty and
exhausts various parts of the the visual scene in terms of what information is available as scored
by these progressive salience maps here that's driving the eye movements that are soliciting
these inputs here and dynamically down here and here is the belief updating this the evolution
of the internal states that are enjoying informative information that minimizes the
expected prediction error the uncertainty building up confident beliefs about the
the state of the outside world which was indeed an upright face so we see that here with confidence
intervals and about the blue hypothesis as she rejects the the other two hypotheses so to my
mind a really nice example of the importance of epistemics and getting information result being
being curious creatures and that kind of behavior being prescribed from the basic
physics of self-organization under these attracting sets given I can be separated from my world
with a Markov blanket but put much more simply by Helmholtz in the following description every
movement we make by which we alter the appearance of objects should be thought of as an experiment
designed to test whether we've understood correctly the invariant relations of the
phenomenon before us that is their existence in definite spatial relations and with that
I'll close it only remains for me to thank most people whose ideas I've been talking about
and of course to thank you for your attention thank you very much indeed
Thank you very much Professor Fiston that was amazing and if we were with a live audience
physical audience we would probably have a big round of applause for a very insightful
and deep presentation so I myself didn't follow everything and certainly not the technicalities
but I took a ton of notes and I have questions but I would like to hand over to the audience
in the room to ask you some questions or make comments so is there anyone willing to to take
the first the first question
Check over
Yes Nicola and so many people say that rather than a round of applause at least on my side
would we really stand up and thank you for you for this amazing presentation that really
for me as an economist has been a really a discovery of many things that
somehow were disconnected in my knowledge and that you were really able to bring together
to unexpectedly to bring together so thanks a lot it's I can really say it's a mind-blowing
presentation thank you I really have many probably too many questions and so I would
like just to start to break the ice and certainly give the floor also to my colleagues and friends
so I really don't know where to start so let me start with something that probably
in the audience is maybe of some interest to some extent I would say that you base the
a substantial part of your presentation in terms of focusing on descriptions
of the systems now as political as social scientists we are often
involved into policymaking we are asked to suggest
in policy improvements or new policies just thinking about for example the
European Commission draft on regulation of artificial intelligence
and so and the first question I would ask I would have for you is
what would you suggest if you were to move more into the prescriptive
implications of what you presented us or as economists would say the normative part
of what you presented us so the little answer I would say myself is that curiosity
is of the essence here right but I really would like to hear from you
well you've you've just answered your own question I think that's absolutely right it's
curiosity and interestingly that one thing that curiosity is really what is missing in
much of artificial intelligence research and machine learning generally you know because
people have committed to a focus on utility and reward functions that do not come along with
the information seeking and the imperatives that would underwrite that sort of epistemic part
and for me and certainly for you and all of I would imagine the audience as scientists
prime for a normative reading of our behavior it's 99.9 percent the curiosity and 0.001 percent
the rewards that you know they actually drive this I think that's an excellent an excellent
question and an excellent observation there are a number of ways in which you know I'd like to
answer that question we don't have time to do all of them I should apologize I didn't see my chat
in my five-minute warning it's like a horrible feeling that I did speak for too long so my apologies
but that you're absolutely right that the the Bayesian mechanics that comes from the physics
part of this is really one of Dennett's strange inversions so instead of asking what kinds of
policies do good systems that survive and flourish possess it actually turns that on its head and say
well let's take a mathematical definition of a system that exists and survives and flourishes
just in virtue of it existing and ask what properties must it must it possess so you
know I think you're very sensitive to the or your question was very sensitive to something
quite fundamental here the physics account here it doesn't say what's the best way to behave it just
says what behaviors are evinced in systems that exist and persevere and hence the appeal to the
physics and non-equilibrium steady state and self-organization under that and all that comes
out of it is as you as we have already concluded which is an inactive or embodied or a circular
exchange between a thing and its culture its eco niche or its environment or its heat path
that has this uncertainty reducing aspect to it you know which we talked about in in terms of
curiosity you can you know you you can also read that in terms of this sort of mixture of
minimizing risk and ambiguity you know so first of all we will only make moons when the sensory
consequences of those moons are unambiguous so we can infer what's going on but at the same time
we're trying to minimize that we are the distance between what we think will happen if we do that
and what we a priori prefer prefer to do that but both in a sense have this of
epistemic aspects to that that's certainly sort of the ambiguity reducing and of course that is
just the whole point of doing that expected free energy is just to to build a probability
distribution over policies so you're saying before that much of the social sciences and certainly
in its sort of pragmatic or you know so how a behavioral scientist or economist would actually
advise institutions in terms of policymaking it's all about hypotheses so that that expected free
energy is just really you know a way of formalizing and evaluating the log probability
over a series of policies a sequence of actions into the future and of course the free energy
principle active inference all that does is this is the mechanics that you know that underwrites
policy making in the sense of selecting the most probable policy it doesn't tell you what the
most probable the best policies are but it certainly provides a calculus for understanding
the the processes that underwrite your policy decision and as you say you know it's it's
resolving uncertainty what do you need to know in terms to resolve the uncertainty about whether
to pursue that policy that policy that policy or that policy so it will be interesting to actually
drill down on the the actual message passing and belief updating and evaluation that the
institutions and organizations use in the brain it's actually probably more straightforward
you might think yeah we actually have a fairly a fairly good understanding of of the the physiology
of the message passing and the updating of what represents what in terms of neurotransmitters
and brain regions it would be very very interesting to to to retell that story in terms of a process
for a decision making at an institutional level you know that's where all the heavy lifting that's
where all the hypotheses would actually live you know you know the mechanics but you don't know
how that process is actually enacted you know what represents what what represents the expected
free energy what that is the precision this what represents the likelihood of this given given that
all of these things in principle have to be there but it now becomes I think a scientific
a process of scientific inquiry to actually work out the you know the the anatomy of the
and the structure of the of the message passing a fascinating game and you will see I'm sure
parallels in terms of in economics you know some appellation on the echelon structures of firm
management these are just recapitulations of the fact that you have to have a hierarchical
jota model in a world which has a deep causal structure you know it can be no other way in
terms of modeling and understanding what's going on out there in say the market you have to have
this hierarchical and deep structure to the internal dynamics that are doing that belief
updating and selecting the right time right kinds of policies fantastic thank you I would have
another question but I would refer myself okay Jacob maybe I have a question and I'm
I'm afraid I'm going to be very confused in the way I I phrase it so Professor Friston
please bear with my metal so it's but so when I was listening to you and you know reading
papers about you and try to read some of your papers I was thinking so I was thinking to myself
do we have do we have built-in hardwired sort of survival code and then so are we designed to
optimize that was my thought and then then other so it came so then if that's the case
what causes heterogeneity at the individual level do we have different mark of blankets amongst
species or communities or individuals then another question is what causes this is this
because we are no longer curious or it is because our sensors and actuators decay and and if
the human brain has this degrading ability to update and and optimize can a supercomputer
that has less exposition to a form of entropy maybe I'm using the word wrongly in terms of
material capability can it can it overcome the limitations of the human body and the human brain
so I was struggling with all these questions and then I was thinking about reproduction
is because you you showed these dots with the parents and the grandparents and they are different
they are the internal state and then there's the parents but isn't in a way reproduction
sort of recreation of the new internal states which which actually overcomes the limitations of
sensing it and actuating over time so I've been struggling with all these questions in my head
when you were talking does that make any sense or is this just a confused thinking no it makes
perfect sense and it's these are quite high-end theoretical issues which a lot of people are
confused about or not perhaps not so confused but certainly there are lots of really important
outstanding issues so you asked about eight questions there so I can't even remember what
they were but I'll try and address some of the more important ones from one perspective which is
in statistics it's called Bayesian model selection in radical constructivism it's called
structure learning and in theoretical biology it's called evolution on natural selection
they're all different ways of describing the same underlying process and this is again a self
evidencing or free energy minimizing process but now it's not at the level of the internal
states and dynamics of a of a particular system but it's about its structural form itself so we're
now going beyond the activity you know what if we're a brain the neuronal activity patterns in
the moment if we're an institution the beliefs held or positions held by this moment of the board
or the you know the people in say a warehouse at different levels of a hierarchical structure
we're even moving beyond what's called the parameters of a charity model which in the
brain would be the connection strengths these are the the internal state that represent lawful
relationships and contingencies so these would be things that don't change very quickly over time
they are plastic and learnable but they are the connect that they are the connectivity that the
connectome that defines the structure usually a hierarchical structure of the of the charity model
in an institution it might be you know the roles that you play or you know the communication
channels that define your influence or your message that you know where you send your messages to
in terms of the belief updating but beyond that there's a very structure of the model itself
you know how many hierarchical levels how many different representations what kind of factorization
how big is it how small is it you know all of these things themselves can be optimized with
respect to their marginal likelihood or their free energy or the or their evidence so if you're
you're a statistician your your the very structure of your model would be determined by what sort of
expound your variables do you put in it and what do you leave out and what you would actually do
is do something like an F test for example with a statistical model that didn't didn't have this
interaction in it and then if the model evidence increased or the free energy decreased when you
include the interaction you know that your model now has to be slightly more complicated and you
retain it so that would be if you like a very simple example of Bayesian model selection
getting the right structure you know is something there or not do you have that connection do you
have that kind of personnel in your institution do you have this neural population and this
mammalian mammalian brain so that structural learning manifests in in
evil in theoretical neurobiology exactly as you say through not Bayesian model selection as a
statistician would read it but natural selection so evolution that rests upon reproduction exactly
as you say now can be understood as a process a natural Bayesian model selection so what does
that mean well interesting looks as if evolution is also fantastic in the sense that is it has
hypotheses that it tests so here the hypothesis is you it's a phenotype and evolution is now
trying to select the best model or phenotype or hypothesis that is that exists or is a good
account of its of the eco niche so it's trying to find evolution is trying to find the phenotypes
that are the best fit to the environment in the sense that if they fit there will be a high
marginal likelihood that they'd be part of a population which is you know which is one way
of saying that evolution is looking for evidence that this kind of model is the best kind of model
and we'll select that model if it reproduces because this is a good fit it is good for self
evidencing in in this environment so what one has now is a picture of hierarchical free engine
minimization or inference where you've got very fast inference which is basically making sense of
the world as it stands in the moment slow inference where we're learning the parameters and the
contingencies and the connectivity and the right the laws and contingencies in our environment
and then very very slow inference over the actual models itself that could involve the
selection of a particular model and the refutation or discarding of another model i.e death you know
from the point of view of natural selection or a failure to reproduce so all of these processes
are just instances of free energy minimization at different temple scales and as you crucially note
the last scale of natural selection rests upon reproduction which is another way of if you like
another instantiation of things that exist so from the point of view of those
attracted dynamics and self-organization to attract being set we now think of the the thing
as a species so now it's the life cycle is a sort of zoa a zygote through to you know a neonate
through to an adult that reproduces produce another zygote and through to a neonate so
even though you may die the life cycle carries on for that kind of phenotype and so the you know
just having reproduction as part of the life cycle is just a biologist's way of saying
there is an attracting set here and attracting manifold and orbit that contains states at eye
as a species now keep revisiting and then the question is well if the environment is changing
then clearly that model selection that optimization process has to be an ongoing
process so evolution is not static it doesn't stand still in many senses from red queen dynamics
through to you know ashby's law of requisite variety and you know from you know genomics
perspectives sort of natural drifts and mutations and like there has to be an exploration of the
spacer models the plausible hypotheses that you can bring to the table then you select the best one
and i'm putting it like that because you know this process of continually optimizing
in a changing environment can be seen at all levels whether it's you know you are the level
of learning and your development going to school learning about you know from your mother in terms
of you know are the things like people and am i a person is my mother a person all of these things
have to be learned including you know what you can control in terms of your limbs versus not right
through to you know learning about you know which university which career to choose all of these
things have to be learned you're on the fly through this process of well through this basic
basic mechanics at every every temporal scale and the reason i'm phrasing it in that fashion is to
try and speak to your question well is it possible to build an electronic or a human in silico
and stop the aging process and yes it certainly would be possible in principle and would that
work well no it wouldn't because you don't have natural selection and so the problem with a computer
and an artifact that had generalized artificial intelligence and had exactly the right kind of
curiosity that we were talking about previously and that lived forever is just a statement that
you have lost the opportunity to base in model selection which means that it would not survive
it will become out of date within either a year or 10 years or a century it will become obsolete
and no longer fit the purpose so then you ask well okay let's have an adapting robot or your
artifact but the more you keep on qualifying it the closer you get to actually the human species
so you get back down to natural selection artificial life applied to your intelligent artifacts it
has to be that way because you have to have this dynamic image you have to keep revisiting these
states of being you have to have a life cycle so you have to have if you like death as part of your
life cycle in order to um self evidence in a changing environment and you maybe say to me well
what happens if the environment stops changing surely we can just stop evolution and populate the
world with artifacts that don't that don't change and we will find some nevadas and some sort of
status quo that you see in science fiction movies where everything is the same day after day after
day after day and that is certainly a conceivable universe but the problem is as soon as it's
populated by artifacts that learn and are curious that means from the point of view of any one
artifact or particle that means that there is an inevitable change in their external state
because their external states are now constituted by other creatures that are learning so you can't
have an unchanging um you can't have a a non itinerant kind of universe um technically this
this is um can be framed in terms of the renormalization group and you talk about itinerancy at every
scale you know you're all the way down and all the way up um so that's why i'm afraid you're
probably not going to be able to buy a a human being that's gonna last forever as opposed to
having children in the foreseeable future well thanks a lot um you've probably uh i
rose eight questions you've answered 16 of my questions uh in your reply so that's absolutely
amazing um i'm just concerned about my evening because i'm gonna keep thinking about that like
for hours now um but it was um in a way you know for us social scientists also sort of
uplifting an optimistic note what you said about superintelligence and and you know there's a lot
of talking in the ethics and law and technology literature about the risk of terminal replacements
of humans buying machines and you know life and intelligence in human form will disappear and so
that your last comment was very very um on point in terms of thinking about some of these issues
i think there was a question in the chat uh i can read it um i would send and um and you
will see what you what you think about it okay so the question is from Jonas Beckley Aida who's in
the library and um i'm going to read it Jonas okay all right so um very interesting talk even though
a lot went over my heads uh i have a very naive maybe confused question about the nature of the
boundary between internal and external are such boundaries given in the natural world
or are they projected constructed by the application of the theory for instance with
a primordial sub simulation if the internal system we saw an objective thing in the world
analyzed by use of the model or if it's in some sense constructed by the application of the model
to the simulation so here's the question that's an excellent question in fact there's there are actually
um heated debates in um the um not so much the social sciences but certainly sort of the
the philosophy of social sciences um and uh so i think there's actually a target bbs paper um
that came out about two or three weeks ago which effectively asks exactly that question so it's
an excellent question um i have a definitive argument but i'm trying to stand back up from
the debate because i'm not a philosopher so i'm just trying to treat it as a spectator sport at
the present time but the the answer from the physicist's point of view um is that the the
markoff blanket is not a construct that you would use um um in a theological or expoundary sense to
you know to make to make sense of the behavior it has to be there um definitionally before you
can define anything so everything that exists must have a markoff blanket and then the game as well
if there's a markoff blanket what kind of dynamics and physics or what mechanics must this um this
thing possess so the markoff blanket is not a constructed is not constructed by application
to us to a to something the markoff blanket defines the thing that's in a really fundamental way
having said that what you um what i think was astutely picked up was that um you know even in
that simulation of the primordial soup i chose one particular markoff blanket to illustrate the
behavior there are possibly an uncountably large number of markoff blankets in that soup because
of the sparsity of the equations and motion that i used to simulate it so that speaks to a really
important notion that there isn't um for everything at every level of description there is a markoff
blanket but of course a thing can comprise lots of sub things and sub things within them and so all
the way down so what that means is that we have um it's like the our um world is basically composed
of markoff blankets of markoff blankets of markoff blankets possibly an infant item um
um all of which are if you like compliant with the basic mechanics that i've been talking about
but at very different temple scales so the smaller you get the faster things become and the bigger
you get the slower things become um which is important from the point of view of something
i mentioned before which is a sort of renormalization group or the notion of renormalizability
which means that the the behavior the basic mechanics of a markoff blanket or something
at one level will always be in the context of being part of a markoff blanket at a higher level
but is at the higher level those dynamics are unfolding very very slowly so it always looks
at any one level as if there is a um it always looks as if there is a time in very context
and we you know one practical example that we've just talked about is is evolution
in somatic time the or the ekanish can be regarded as largely unchanging in somatic time
i can learn about this environment that's good enough but it will change slowly over um over
evolutionary time um and what that means is that you know there is no unique markoff blanket um
and in particular there is no privileged temporal scale at which these markoff blankets
self-organize and and and and exist and just knowing that's really important because you know
this coming back to why i'm here in terms of expanding horizons what that tells you is again
there is no privileged level of analysis you can always contextualize it with another basing
mechanics at a higher level of analysis so for example i could be a neuroscientist trying to
learn about behavioral scientists and social science so now i have to understand the markoff
blanket that surrounds my brain in the context of a markoff blanket that surrounds my culture or my
family or my institution and then i have to unpack the dynamics um at that level that provide
important constraints and contexts on the the basing mechanics of all the constituent markoff
blankets individuals at the lower level and if i was a molecular biologist i would have to do the
same i have to understand neuroscience at the level of neuronal populations and brain areas and
behavior and how that affords constraints on the markoff blankets that constitute a cell
and then you know beyond that the cell may create an inter-cellular environment that provides a
context that contains the markoff blankets that are an organelle or a molecular structure or RNA
so in all directions you've got a multitude of nested markoff blankets all of which are playing
the same game but at their own at their own temporal scale providing a context for things below
and then in the top a bottom-up causation providing the fluctuations and the intrinsic
or external dynamics from the point of view of the markoff blanket at a higher level so not at all
a naive question it's a very deep question and the answer i've given is that these are not
tools to understand physics or to describe physics they are there are constructs that
have to be in place before any emergent behavior can can exist
okay i was that was very good too now i see some more questions in the room we have Giovanni
and Philippe and Giacomo again Giovanni okay thank you very much for this great presentation
i'm still a bit confused very confused but let me try to and i'm very interested the
follow-up everything you said um i would like to put your question so you um used this idea
these energy models if i can call them this way to capture um what we will call the psychological
or cognitive concepts such as having a belief or um having also a goal updating a knowledge state
and can you just maybe a long answer would be required but is it possible to tell us a bit
how a change in the free energy if i understood well is related to this kind of notion of
achieving a goal and having a better belief what is the connection between these two things
right now that was an excellent question i perhaps i should have qualified
my use of certain um terms more carefully so you you're quite right to be a bit confused
because i was when i talk about a belief i mean all i mean is a conditional probability distribution
or a Bayesian probability distribution um i don't mean a propositional belief or something
that could be articulated at a personal level um so when i talk about belief updating i just mean
a physically parameterized probability distribution that changes um and mathematically
that's a nice way of looking at things because you induce information geometries and you can
start to write down the physics of belief updating but at no point do i mean to infer that there is
some propositional or intentional uh stance or or belief uh in a folk psychological sense
the the the question uh so um from that from that technical use of the word belief the belief
updating is literally um moving around in a physical space so changing the values of
say neural activity or any way of measuring the physical constitution of the system in hand
and in particular the internal states of that system or that particle and as we move the states
the physical states as you could measure them physically um then because those states encode
a probability distribution you're moving on something called a statistical manifold
and the free energy supplies the gradients that themselves describe the movement on that manifold
so when i talk about belief updating i have in mind a movement in a a belief space or in an
information geometry that minimizes the free energy at which point that makes my belief
the most likely and by but you know in the sense that it maximizes the marginal likelihood or it
minimizes the um it minimizes the variational free energy or it minimizes the prediction error
all of these are equivalent ways of of describing the quality of the belief that is defined by being
in a free energy minima in this belief space so all this is very technical it's it's a kind of
math you'd use in um the rigid five they did did use in quantum electrodynamics at no point
do you need to refer to beliefs in a folk psychology sense or to aspirations or goals
in anything but a very elemental very sub-personal sense the question then is
these systems that you know small particles for example will certainly if they have the
right kind of judging model look as if they do have personal beliefs they will look as if they
have goals they will behave in this way and that way while they're minimizing their expected free
energy and it'll look as if they they do have goals you know a simple example here would be
chemotaxis in single-celled bacteria you know bacteria that move up sugar concentration
gradients for example it looks as if they have a goal in mind which is to situate themselves in
a you know a world that is rich with nutrients and plants will look as if they are phototropic
they look as if they have the goal they want to expose themselves to sunlight and so you know
in a sense the the maths that I was talking about on the first kind which was this basically
reflexive policy would be perfectly okay to describe the goal-directed policy the goal-directed
policy selection under optimization of Bayesian or Bayesian belief updating namely optimization
of Bayesian beliefs that's scored by the variation of free energy but at no point would be imbuing
the sentence that you and I enjoy in these microbes or these plants so the question now is
what kind of genetic model what kind of Bayesian mechanics would now give rise to the more
anthropomorphic beliefs and goals that you're talking about how do I know that I have goals how
do I know that I am a thing and how do I know that I have beliefs and that I am you know I'm
committed to these beliefs these are really really high-level questions which in principle can be
addressed using the free energy principle but have not as yet been addressed there are there are
a lot of proposals out there that involve things like mental action that you have to you have to
have a representation of me being in a particular belief state paying attention to this or that
before you can be aware of being of actually inferring something having qualitative experience
and you have to have a belief state that is it is me that is doing these actions
and all you know so you start now developing a minimal sense of agency and a minimal sense
of selfhood but all of these things have to be written into the generative model
before you can apply the Bayesian mechanics that I was talking about so the connection is
you know it's not simple in the sense of what you're trying to do is to
write down a mechanics that would be appropriate to describe belief updating in a system where
the physical states of the system encoded beliefs but you can't at this stage
describe beliefs in a folk psychological sense you then have to think about what kind of system
what kind of architecture an implicit generative model would license that system or you describing
that system as having personal beliefs a sense of self a sense of agency where you can now start
to talk about these terms in you know using their normal anthropomorphic or folk psychology
meaning it does does that clarify things honestly yeah it's a great answer thank you very much
a lot of work to do thank you very much we're going to spend a ton of time in the cluster
unpacking all that Carl if you if you if I may Philip you have a question
thank you I'll try to be quick um professor there are first and thanks a lot for your talk was
really fascinating I'm an economist so I try to transfer um what you talked about a little bit
more to my domain and to find appropriate analogies um I I remember you used the example of um expected
utility theory showing the pictures of von Neumann and Morgenstern um but I was wondering if the whole
concept of the mark of blanket can perhaps serve as an analogy at a slightly larger scale or more
big picture view for the use of general equilibrium and partial equilibrium models in economics
because sometimes in economics when we look at general equilibrium we will try to understand
the whole system at once and mostly in terms of prices and allocations of goods but sometimes for
example if we want to study a specific market we would drill down and use a um
a partial equilibrium model where we would look only at a specific market interaction
and we would be content with modeling certain aspects for example certain other goods market
certain other prices and decisions as being outside of the system and I was wondering if this
wasn't actually a pretty close analogy to this distinction between the external world
and the particular state in the picture of the market mark mark of blanket that you gave us
yes no I think that would be an excellent analogy um and uh you know depending upon the level of
course graining of all the variables you have at hand that will dictate this you know the
size and the structure of the mark of blanket and of course you are you are liberty to draw the mark
of blanket um around any subset of states or any greater set of states so you know in response to
the last but one question you know there's no unique privilege mark of blanket even at once
even at one scale there are you know you can you can redraw the mark of blankets depending upon the
thing that you wanted to define so if you wanted to define um one market or one country or one
institution or your um you know then you just draw that mark of blanket around that and then and
then as you say much of the interesting dynamics is going to be in in terms of the exchange or
imprints is made upon the blanket stage which is basically what what all the variables inside the
mark of blanket what they can see um and um the converse of that which is very interesting um
is that of course if you now think of think of some abstract state space where you've got all
sorts of variables or states that you you now want to carve up into a you know a mark an
institution or mark of blanket in this corner and the rest um and now imagine carving up um the rest
into their own mark of blankets now you can ensemble of mark of blankets like packed little
circles all talking to each other the enormous simplification that ensues from that partitioning
that kind of coarse-graining follows from the fact that you've got that conditional independence
which means that you don't need to know anything about the internal mechanics of the other
institutions all you need are the blanket states and in particular the um the active states so the
only thing if you know so we're now moving into a world of the interactions between multiple mark
of blankets or multiple agencies or multiple institutions or multiple um multiple individuals
where now we're conceiving of each individual as possessing its own mark of blanket but the key
thing that the mark of blanket brings to the table is that there's a your conditional independence
between the inside of the mark of blanket and everything else so from the point of view of
another mark of blanket the only variables that matter are on the surface on the blanket states
um and therefore you can you can greatly reduce the computational complexity in the
numerics of simulating a universe if you can identify the right level of coarse-graining
and then just summarize the way in which this institution or this part of your um your your
economic universe um actually works uh so that in turn um um well sorry there are all
sorts of exciting directions you can take that um we actually use that device to uh actually
summarize um the activity of the brain we actually sort of chunk it into parcels each with its
mark of blanket and then we can work out um we can then summarize the the activity of entire
very complicated parts of brains with a very small number of variables as are the principal
components or the eigen solutions of the of of the mark of blanket states which are you know a
fantastically small number of variables in relation to the entire number of neurons that are contained
within that mark of blanket and I would imagine that you use the same kind of device when somebody
say oh I'm going to treat this very high dimensional part of my market uh um as sort of fluctuations
in your or noise in you know in a low dimensional state space and of the variables that matter
and from the point of view of the mark of blanket formulation the variables that matter are just the
eigen functions of the of the blanket states so that that can be an enormous saving if you like
and also a very principal way of accounting for sort of coupling between different institutions
and different markets and when framed as basically coupling between different uh different mark of
blankets in the social sciences in its stripped down form now you're in the game of understanding
how just two mark of blankets talk to each other so you now try to understand the coupling between
two mark of blankets there's diatic interactions and there's a nice literature now on the emergence
of generalized synchrony where the active states of one mark of blanket now become the the sensory
states of the other and vice versa so that you're now trying to infer what the other person is
inferring because the free energy minimizing solution is when you are both in generalized
synchrony which is when you both are using the same generative model and you're both seeing from
the same hot song sheet or hymn sheet um so that now you have a shared narrative for what you're
talking about and some people understand that as basically resolving the the problem hermeneutics
you're knowing what do you mean if if i can get into generalized synchrony with you so that we're
both basically pursuing the same narrative the same generative model then i can fully understand
you because basically what you're going to do next is what i would do next and it's just a question
of whose turn it is to actually do it uh so there are all sorts of really interesting issues when
you start to think about partitioning a state space into a smaller number of mark of blankets and
think about the exchange between one mark of blanket and another mark of blanket and all sorts
of other issues which you know we come back to the original questions about you know where then in
these i presume these are sort of like um i don't know but i presume there's some macroeconomic
like models is these equilibrium models i i don't forgive me i don't know but
one can then get out of the hood and start to think about well are what are the objective
functions or the ipunov functions that underwrite this kind of equilibrium which i imagine from the
from my point of view is a non-equilibrium steady state because it's an open exchange with
that you know whatever that is you know so you're not dealing with closed systems so you're talking
about open or non-equilibrium steady state um equilibrium or steady states um but then you
can get in and ask well we've just said that um the you know the right ipunov function on the right
yard say the free energy functional has this curiosity built into it where does that fit into
economic exchanges you know and then we get to things like um deceit uh regret uh reputation
all of these things now speaking to um the consequences of action beyond the immediate
monetary gain um beyond the immediate utility as it were um that have implications for resolving
uncertainty about future transactions with other markoff blankets so i don't know whether there's
any place for for deceit in uh deceit sounds horrible but it's actually an extremely high end
kind of competence to actually for me to work out what you are thinking and then act in a way
to change your beliefs which requires me to have a belief about your belief that's an extremely
extremely sort of sophisticated and i'm sure that that kind of um that manifestation of curiosity
in a dyadic or tragic or multi-agent exchange uh must feature at some point in your
recent behavior economics so i'm not sure about uh can i well can i ask you does it feature in
economics is it um well actually you linked it quite closely uh also to game theory which
i mean closes the circle with uh von Neumann Morgenstein example quite nicely of course yes
yes absolutely yeah yeah sophistication of agents and game fair yeah absolutely yeah
jack how
in fact i already had my my answer so my question was uh what about when we move uh from uh let's
say single agent to multiple agents after all social science is really mostly about interaction
between multiple agents now i understand that um there is a way to extend the view into multiple
blankets uh that are somehow interlinked with each other so i will uh i will find this really
fascinating but then i will probably try to dig a little bit into this saying that maybe with
multiple agents the distinction and this goes back to one of the previous questions the distinction
between the different sensor uh external and internal makes some outburst so i just have in
mind something that we have in game theory so there are so we study equilibria with strategic
interaction between multiple agents under the class of what is called in fact macro strategies
where essentially we claim that what is relevant in the decision and our actions is not really something
that is very far in the future sorry in the past but it's only what happened yesterday and we
characterized the equilibrium behavior under this assumption and we know that this is a restriction
so the equilibria the outcome that we can support when instead we think about strategies
that rely on something that happened very far in the past may be different from the equilibria
we can characterize in macro strategies so i'm just thinking whether these distinctions between
uh the externally internal parts in the macro blanket when we go to the multiple agent is
uh possibly a restriction on the way we describe the world
yeah i'm sure it is in a fundamental way i mean certainly you're just taking your last sentence
i certainly my brain certainly understands and you know describes my world in terms of
interactions amongst Markov blankets because i have this hypothesis that the world
consists of things that have a Markov blanket and indeed just seen construction in the visual
neuroscience is it is just like that there are visual objects each object has its Markov blanket
it has you know interacts with other objects to produce my sensory impressions so you know
certainly every Markov blanket will actually use a model of its world that has Markov blankets
you know both in terms of things out there but also if you just think about it you know
if you've got a hierarchy in your genetic model that hierarchy is defined by the sparsity of
connections that don't jump save between more than one level and that sparsity defines another
set of internal Markov blankets that lends your internal model a deep structure that is also
capitulated or recapitulated that sparsity of connectivity that stands in for conditional
independences in the causes out there is also evident within each level of the hierarchy in
terms of modularization or factorization that's a really important way to minimize free energy
through the minimization of complexity to get this sort of the simplest explanation for what's
going on and that factorization I repeat just sort of exploits conditional dependencies it's
taking you a little bit away from the heart of your question but I think
usefully in the sense that there are certain things out there that allow you to do this sort of
coarse graining and describing things in terms of Markov blankets and conditional independences
the simplest example that the brain exploits is the fact that knowing where something is doesn't
tell you what it is and knowing what something is doesn't tell you where it is generally
you know and so what that means is that you can very efficiently factorize what and where
in the way that you describe your world so in principle it is sufficient just to know an object
is over here in one factor and this object is this kind of thing in another factor and then you
just bring them together to explain this object in this position as opposed to having a very
a representation or explanation the joint space of everything being every whatness being everywhere
which would be a very complicated representation so this whole carving up and putting Markov
blankets into your model is really important in terms of leveraging conditional independences
and causal structure in the system you're trying to you're engaging with and because of that if
there are Markov blankets and other creatures or institutions like me out there that needs to
get into my generative model and the implications of that are fascinating but you know I'm not going
to tell you anything you don't know from the perspective of people who are trying to exploit
the Markov blanket construct and the attending basic mechanics in a multi-agent context
it tends to go in one of two directions you can either think about the coupling between two
Markov blankets in terms of communication or you can think of multiple ensembles of Markov
blankets that constitute a population then you think about the coupling of the environment
to the population and then the implicit communication between the elements or the
ensemble of that population so I'm just mentioning this as places that if you had a student who
wanted to see how this variation of free energy approach to multi-agent games and
development plays out in the literature then if you look for some things like
variational niche construction so the idea here is that ultimately you can describe any system that
endures as minimizing its free energy or making things as predictable as possible which means
that that applies both to the agent and the environment to which the agent finds itself
which means as fast as the agent is trying to learn about this environment the environment
is also learning about the agent and you see this manifest in terms of things like
desire paths or elephant paths this is sort of wearing the grass down on a shortcut from the
station to the nearest coffee shop for example and that wearing the grass down wearing a rut
in the environment that is used by conspecifics to obtain their goal is can be mathematically
construed as the environment learning about the kind of agents that it plays host to
and then you can complete the circle by saying well provided all the agents are sufficiently
similar they can now use what the environment has learned in order to optimize their goal
directive behavior or their information seeking behavior by minimizing the expected free energy
and then you get to the argument where you can explain deontic cues that the environment has
learned that provide an explanation for cultural evolution or deontic cues or things like road
signs you know why do road signs exist it's because the environment has learned that these
are the kinds of things that are used by its inhabitants which are humans that drive around in
it but why why the roads but you can also argue the road sign is only there and learnable because
it has the same meaning for all the different agents that are the you know that constitute the
population and so you get this sort of circular explanation which is all underwritten by a common
minimization of free energy or a common maximization of predictability you try to make the world as
predictable and unsurprising as it can be and if you're all doing that together then the best way
to do that is to make sure that you construct your niche or your market you know with things that are
as similar to you as possible because things that are similar to you as possible are predictable
and if everybody you're playing with in your game is really predictable you're minimizing
your free energy or maximizing you're maximizing your your your your predictability so from an
evolutionary point of view what that means is you what you'd expect to see is basically lots of
cooperation lots of agents all trying to make the world predictable by hanging out with other
phenotypes like themselves and building an environment at Econiche for that kind of agent
that is as predictable as possible so you'll get them building things that they can recognize
really easily things like for example the excite edge receptors in the retina so things are built
out of straight lines you know so you have buildings you have you know anything that our
generated models can easily register and recognize you will see written into the environment or
things that you expect to happen you know then of course you know the famous example in Econiche
constructions that how build beavers build dam because they expect to have you know have a
certain narrative in the way that they get their food so they make that come true by resolving
their prediction error that this dam is not being built so that changes the environment and and and
so forth so that's that's where the literature I think is largely at um it's not very developed
and certainly has not at this stage I think been imported or connected to economics and
finance or logistics there are people making lots of noises about this but it hasn't been done at
this stage and it would be really interesting to see uh um you know I'll go and go of now
equilibria in in economics so I don't know what that's all about now it relates to game theory
but it does sound as if you're dealing with very similar such kinds of constructs
what the free energy principle brings to the table is this sort of rather simple notion that
everything's going to try and converge on a joint free energy minimum which simply means
making things as predictable as possible okay um I was again a pretty um uh deep answer
um professor facen do you have uh maybe seven more minutes for us yes of course okay good um
I have I have three very simple questions very straightforward the first one is
if as you said I like your definition let me take you if if life is about is about curious creatures
that try to learn to keep their self-organization
um this process can only exist if uncertainty can never be resolved
there's a there's a a boundary to to and to uncertainty resolution that must exist otherwise
the process ends that's the first question so how do you bring this in it's a sort of variation
about the you know discussion between uh people in religion and and sort of Nietzsche and philosophy
where Nietzsche said you know life in uncertainty is unbearable okay the second question is um
are there physical phenomena in which mark of blankets do not exist
and the third question is more um a question from a person working from in a university to another
person working for a university institution which is are you you've produced a unifying theory it's
big big theory are you concerned about people in other fields reading too much in the theory
right i've i've tried to be very very focused
there's not there's still not very easy questions
and we have seven minutes to answer them okay and so let's one by one and so the first question was
those has to be irreducible uncertainty those has to be uncertainty to resolve us we just stop
stop evolving and stop actually moving or indeed belief updating and i think that that's an excellent
point and i would actually counter that to a certain extent in in the sense that there there are mark
of blankets that have almost attained an equilibrium steady state as opposed to non-equilibrium
steady state where they are no longer changing and so i'm thinking about here about
very elemental particles or you know perhaps even stones that have settled down so they've
got a very very simple and flat model of their eco niche which could be probably just reduced to
two variables like the temperature and so in situations where the world is not is not changing
very much so what i'm what i'm saying is that you know as there are an uncountable number of
mark of blankets there are almost an uncountable number of things in the universe some of which
will be changing very very slowly and others will be changing with a much more itinerant
aspect a peripodactic sort of moving around a lot usually with a life cycle so these are usually
biotic things but the key thing is the the cyclical nature and the the itinerancy inherent
in that which is i think what you are driving up that there's there's always some there's always
the next place to go in the drive to minimize uncertainty which means that you have you you
have you you don't attain this thermodynamic equilibrium where nothing is changing anymore
which is you know you could you could actually construe as the death of a biotic system so
when you die you dissipate you reach thermodynamic equilibrium your your molecules become the same
temperature as the ambient surrounding so this is a thermodynamic equilibrium that no longer has
this structured itinerancy this deep temporal structures wandering aspect that you now are
worried will go away if the world stops changing so the argument previously was just because you
live in a world that is constructed by things like you there has to be an itinerancy in that world
which means that you will have to be itinerant so you're not going to become like a stone or a
or you know or attain an equilibrium simply because your world
has been constructed by things like you and you know this so this appeals to the multi-agent
aspect on the that we're talking about before however there could be universes where or there
could be parts of this of this world where you know things are really really simple they have
what is something called very shallow models with no temporal depth a little little thermostats
you know little sort of single celled organisms that behave like little thermostats in extreme
conditions that are constant in their temperature and chemical constitution that do actually
survive for for for for many many years without changing you know but you're not one of those
you're a different kind of genetic model and you're unlikely to to express that that form of
quasi-equilibrium steady state just technically it's this interesting you know because I can
guarantee that the kind of economic equilibrium you were talking about is actually a non-equilibrium
steady state simply because you'll have things like deep breaking of detail balance and you
have open exchanges technically what that involves is usually the seronoidal flow that
breaks the detail balance and converts an equilibrium steady state into a non-equilibrium
steady state sort of you know one of which will a kind of which will be a far from equilibrium
steady state so I think what you're touching upon is is things that get very very close to this sort
of equilibrium equilibrium steady state when they don't have the high tendency you just fall
into the bottom of the pudding basin you're minimizing your free energy and you're going to
a fixed point of tractor and you stay there that's not the kind of attracting set that we were talking
about we actually have this very complicated itinerant orbit this manifold which we're continually
circulating on continue updating our beliefs because the world is changing why is it changing
while it comprises things like me that are always changing so imagine a world without living things
and of course that would probably be more the kind of world that would be conducive to things
that didn't have this high tendency or this that you know an ending battle to resolve uncertainty
this this which is you know I didn't know that as it needs to occur I meant the quote but certainly
life and uncertainty being unbearable is so true from the point of view of the free energy
principle simply because free energy is a proxy for surprise that means that free energy is a
proxy for expected surprise expected surprises entropy entropy is uncertainty that's all there is
to it you know it is uncertainty of course from the economics point of view that uncertainty
is reflected in the confidence in the markets that's the killer that's the big thing it's the
uncertainty which is the big thing you know when it comes to informing action you know and underwriting
our our you know our agency that is all about the uncertainty the second question was well the third
question I remember because it was last so the reasons effect am I worried that other people
on the fields were overinterpreted I think that's an academic worry I personally don't
I don't lose sleep over it if this kind of calculus and maths is useful it will be used
to effect if it's not it won't be so the proof of the pudding will be in the doing and the eating
and practically all the free energy principle does is provide a scaffold to enable you to simulate
systems so there is an argument that which I often make and it's a slightly arrogant argument
but I'll make it anyway but the free energy principle is a little bit like the principle
of natural selection it's you know a beautiful theory that explains everything and nothing at
the same time and in that sense the free energy principle itself tells you nothing it doesn't
tell you how finance works it doesn't tell you how the hippocampus works it doesn't tell you why
you've got eyes in the same way the natural selection doesn't tell you why you've got eyes
so it's quite a vacuous principle but at least it's a principle so why is it useful well it can be
quite useful when you try to simulate self-organization under the constraints that you know apply to this
particular system or you know in my world this particular Markov blanket simply because you
can derive the equations of motion or the dynamics this calculus that I was talking about you can
now put that into computer and now you can start to simulate things so really you know if the free
energy principle is applied in another domain say economics or social or behavioral neuroscience
a behavioral science thing applying through agent based stochastic models for example
you know it will provide a principle basis for the way that you code up your equations of motion
and the lipo not functions or the objective functions that give it a normative aspect
and if it works it will be useful and it will not be over interpreted it will just be interpreted
in the context in which it is being used that's fine so I don't worry about that really because
it's you know that's what in practice the free energy principle brings to the table but all the
hard work has to be done by the person writing the equations of motion for their particular
domain of explanation or sorry domain of inquiry that they want to test a particular hypothesis
about the mechanisms and the imperatives that underwrite the behavior of this system using
the principles of the free energy principle or the free energy principle when it comes to philosophy
I suspect you're right but you know I don't know if you can do damage by over interpreting
in philosophy yeah so I look at philosophy as more fun and the spectator's sport than science
so yeah it's certainly been over interpreted wildly in philosophy but I'm not sure that's a
bad thing because philosophers seem to like that they seem to like something this adversarial
approach where that you have one over interpretation that's pitted against another over interpretation
and then you resolve that and move move move to the next one so I'm not sure whether that's a good
or a bad thing or whether that's what you were you were you were speaking to and the the second
question was another important one what can you remember what it was yeah I was asking if
there are physical phenomena in which the oh yeah mark of blankets don't exist well you can
certainly consider if you if you went to sort of a physicist teaching students about
equilibrium physics then you would start off with notions of
Einstein solid models or idealized gases you know idealized gases into you know into a partition
with a Maxwell's demon in this context of these if you like sort of models that physicists use
to try and teach classical thermodynamics you can imagine that there is a subset of the
states of an idealized crystal or subsets of an idealized gas atoms that don't have a mark
of blanket so this would be like the you know the the third quadrant of a box of an idealized gas
you know so but of course you wouldn't be able to write anything you would that sort of thing
the third quadrant of a box of idealized gas is not a thing in itself it doesn't have its own
behavior doesn't have its own thermodynamics the thermodynamics inherit from the heat bath of
the reservoir or the box so these are all the b words that are the the mark of blanket so the
heat bath the box is the blanket it's all about the blanket and so as soon as you have the blanket
the heat bath in place sometimes there's a heat reservoir for example in statistical thermodynamics
as soon as you've got the boundary there the blanket there you can start to talk about the
behavior of what's in the blanket so the ensemble of internal states or you can talk about the
exchange when you move from equilibrium physics to non-equilibrium physics you can start to talk
about how the how the box or the blanket or the bath or the boundary self-organizes and why does
that maintain itself and that's of course what the free energy principle is in a sense trying
to explain although it uses a strange inversion it assumes that the the blanket exists and then
says well what dynamics must be in play so I I think I think perhaps a simpler answer is no
there can be no physical thing that is not defined by its boundaries that separate it from nothing
or everything else so that's a pretty simple answer thanks for the for the yes no answer
at the end but also for the reasoning before that's um that was very helpful um okay it's uh
522 here and I think we had scheduled two hours I think we could go on for for a long time um
maybe we invite you again Professor Friston um to continue the conversation uh because there are
so much uh in what you gave us today I'm sure I'm gonna talk about it uh together and um if there
is no remark um from my colleagues here Giacomo you want to add something
no just a thank thank you really that was super inspiring and extremely useful for our community
thank you so Professor Professor Friston we'll keep um we'll keep following you and your work
and um we're not too far um if you like to travel if you want to travel if you want to
meet people like us social scientists and talk to a broader community in the future
this is uh this is indeed a place to consider and we'll be very happy to to welcome you here
so thanks a lot for your time and for the the thoughts um the deep so you gave us to to think
about then in the next weeks and months thanks a lot oh thank you thank you for your gracious
hosting and excellent and excellent questions thank you bye bye thank you bye bye bye bye
