hard work has to be done by the person writing the equations of motion for their particular
domain of explanation or sorry domain of inquiry that they want to test a particular hypothesis
about the mechanisms and the imperatives that underwrite the behavior of this system using
the principles of the free energy principle or the free energy principle when it comes to philosophy
I suspect you're right but you know I don't know if you can do damage by over interpreting
in philosophy yeah so I look at philosophy as more fun and the spectator's sport than science
so yeah it's certainly been over interpreted wildly in philosophy but I'm not sure that's a
bad thing because philosophers seem to like that they seem to like something this adversarial
approach where that you have one over interpretation that's pitted against another over interpretation
and then you resolve that and move move move to the next one so I'm not sure whether that's a good
or a bad thing or whether that's what you were you were you were speaking to and the the second
question was another important one what can you remember what it was yeah I was asking if
there are physical phenomena in which the oh yeah mark of blankets don't exist well you can
certainly consider if you if you went to sort of a physicist teaching students about
equilibrium physics then you would start off with notions of
Einstein solid models or idealized gases you know idealized gases into you know into a partition
with a Maxwell's demon in this context of these if you like sort of models that physicists use
to try and teach classical thermodynamics you can imagine that there is a subset of the
states of an idealized crystal or subsets of an idealized gas atoms that don't have a mark
of blanket so this would be like the you know the the third quadrant of a box of an idealized gas
you know so but of course you wouldn't be able to write anything you would that sort of thing
the third quadrant of a box of idealized gas is not a thing in itself it doesn't have its own
behavior doesn't have its own thermodynamics the thermodynamics inherit from the heat bath of
the reservoir or the box so these are all the b words that are the the mark of blanket so the
heat bath the box is the blanket it's all about the blanket and so as soon as you have the blanket
the heat bath in place sometimes there's a heat reservoir for example in statistical thermodynamics
as soon as you've got the boundary there the blanket there you can start to talk about the
behavior of what's in the blanket so the ensemble of internal states or you can talk about the
exchange when you move from equilibrium physics to non-equilibrium physics you can start to talk
about how the how the box or the blanket or the bath or the boundary self-organizes and why does
that maintain itself and that's of course what the free energy principle is in a sense trying
to explain although it uses a strange inversion it assumes that the the blanket exists and then
says well what dynamics must be in play so I I think I think perhaps a simpler answer is no
there can be no physical thing that is not defined by its boundaries that separate it from nothing
or everything else so that's a pretty simple answer thanks for the for the yes no answer
at the end but also for the reasoning before that's um that was very helpful um okay it's uh
522 here and I think we had scheduled two hours I think we could go on for for a long time um
maybe we invite you again Professor Friston um to continue the conversation uh because there are
so much uh in what you gave us today I'm sure I'm gonna talk about it uh together and um if there
is no remark um from my colleagues here Giacomo you want to add something
no just a thank thank you really that was super inspiring and extremely useful for our community
thank you so Professor Professor Friston we'll keep um we'll keep following you and your work
and um we're not too far um if you like to travel if you want to travel if you want to
meet people like us social scientists and talk to a broader community in the future
this is uh this is indeed a place to consider and we'll be very happy to to welcome you here
so thanks a lot for your time and for the the thoughts um the deep so you gave us to to think
about then in the next weeks and months thanks a lot oh thank you thank you for your gracious
hosting and excellent and excellent questions thank you bye bye thank you bye bye bye bye
