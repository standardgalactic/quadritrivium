or the surprise that I might on an anthropomorphic reading experience if I was in this particular
state and by minimizing this surprise I'm implicitly maximizing the efficiency the
mutual information between my my internal states my external states and according to the informants
principle the principles of minimum redundancy or maximum efficiency of Horace Barlow and indeed
the free energy principle is there another way of understanding this well yes because the the
average surprise or self-information in thermodynamics and physics is known as entropy
which means that it looks as if anything that exists will be trying to resist the increase
in entropy and of course that's the holy grail of self-organization in physics synergetics and if
I was a physiologist it's just a statement of homeostasis it's just keeping things within viable
bounds that characterize those physiological states that you will typically find me in and I have
always look as if I have to conform to those imperatives in order to exist or put it another
way to exist means that I will advance this kind of dynamics there's a final interpretation which I
want to leverage which is the interpretation of statistician would bring to the table and so
hitherto we've been talking about given me a model a thing with my blanket states it looks as if
action and perception are maximizing the probability of the blanket states that characterize me but I
can also read me as a model of what caused my blanket state and that's known as the marginal
likelihood or the model evidence statistics so what this means is that we can understand
perception action as in the service of maximizing model evidence heuristically some people like to
think of this as gathering evidence that I exist in the sense that I am a model of my world also
called self-evidencing in philosophy and in the computational neurosciences this leads to notions
of the Bayesian brain because this is also known as Bayesian model evidence evidence accumulation
something that's become very popular in the neurosciences recently predictive processing
generically and the particular instance of that called predictive coding where the emphasis is
on prediction and we'll turn to that interpretation in the second half but before we do that let me
just demystify and make intuitive the kind of behavior that we're trying to describe here
we're going to do that by creating a small universe and asking can we use this notion of a Markov
blanket to define a little virus or a little particle that lives in this universe a primordial
soup and if I can does it show the sort of behavior that can be understood as predicting
or inferring the causes of my sensory impressions on this Markov blanket so here's the results in
video format of a simulation of those equations of motion where we've simulated lots of little
molecules all of which have the intrinsic activity and they're all coupled to each other with some
arbitrary electromagnetic and other kinds of forces so they're bubbling away quite happily
together here and you maybe ask me well why have I done this well I've done this because
I've written down the equations of motion I know what influence is what and therefore I can identify
a set of molecules here and ask what are their Markov blanket and ask what is the behavior of
that particle defined by the Markov blanket that surrounds its internal states so here's
the exactly the same simulation what I've done here is color code all the molecules according to
whether they're internal states in blue active states that lie beneath the surface of the sensory
states that are exposed to the external states in cyan here and what we see is indeed there is a
little virus like particle with a little celium or tail here wiggling around sitting happily
at the heart of this synthetic primordial soup so the question now is do these internal blue
states appear to infer or self-evidence infer the causes of their sensory states and one can do
that just by looking at the fluctuations the internal dynamics so the activity in your brain
and see whether it correlates with something going on out there so for example does your brain
respond to visual motion do you get visually evoked responses if you see something or you
recognize it's a particular face are there any lawful dynamical coupling or is there a lawful
dynamical coupling between fluctuations out there and what's going on on the inside and indeed there
is it's inevitable and you can actually see with the naked eye these these the synchronization
between the inside and the outside this particular example has taken a time lagged record over time
and the fluctuations in these internal states here and this shows here the the mixture that best
predicts the movement of these external states movement of things in the outside world or in
the environment so the prediction of the actual velocity are shown in dotted and solid lines here
you can see a remarkable correlation and indeed this catastrophic event where this molecule in the
soup was spit was evicted from the soup and then fell back in again but like a solar flare
is registered with these internal fluctuations and the reason I'm showing you this example
is it begs an interesting question if you look closely you can see that these internal fluctuations
appear to predate this event on the outside and yet endure after this outside event has occurred
so the question now is did the internal states cause the outside states or did the external
states cause fluctuations in the inside states and if I was there in person I would ask the
audience to vote on this and they all look at me as if I'm stupid because you all know the answer
is both and of course you'd be absolutely right and so this is nothing more than something called
generalized synchrony famously observed many centuries ago by Christian Huygens when he
observed that clocks when suspended from the same wall or the same beam would ultimately come
to swing in synchrony that was the only if you like attracting set the viable solution
that they kept revisiting by swinging in synchrony and this is in fact a drawing from
Huygens here of two clocks with the with one pendulum here and another there suspended from
the same beam and from our point of view we can regard one clock as the internal states the
other clock as the external states and the beam supplies the blanket states that couple the inside
to the outside so that's the fundamental dynamic we're talking about a synchronization
that has to be there simply because systems have attracting sets and mark off blankets
which means that there's some coupling between the inside and the outside that is can be formalized
in terms of this gradient flow this gathering up of states up probability gradients or down
free energy gradients and I like this sketch because it highlights the complete symmetry
of the argument so if you subscribe to this Bayesian reading of generalized synchrony namely that
I'm trying to infer what's going on out there that it is also in the case that the environment
and everything out there is trying to learn about you and infer what kind of thing and what's going
on on the inside that may sound a rather magical interpretation but it's not so silly when you
think about things like eco niche construction and the like and the emergence of culture
but that's another story at the moment we just need to celebrate we've done all the equations we've
done all the the physics in part and that can be summarized with the following that the existence
of a particle in a very general sense implies a partition of a systems states the systemic
states into internal and blanket states that comprise sensory and active states and external
states that are hidden behind the mark off blanket from the point of view of the internal
states they're sometimes also called latent states they can't be observed directly but only through
the mark off blanket and because active states change but are not changed by external states
they reduce the entropy of the blanket states and this means that action will appear to maintain
the structural functional integrity of the mark off blanket and in the life sciences or the biological
sciences um this has been uh called self um uh creation or self construction uh auto poesis
um in chemistry computational chemistry we know the self assembly your molecules that assemble
themselves uh and maintain their form finally internal states will appear look as if they're
inferring or predicting the hidden causes of sensory states namely the hidden states um by
increasing Bayesian model evidence or marginal likelihood and will actively influence those
causes by acting on through their active states the external states and we refer to that in my
world at least as active inference um so here's a a little break to demarcate the two parts of the
mature we we used to have a postdoctoral student uh Franz who went to America and shortly after
arriving um had a baby little Kira with with his wife and his wife bought uh Kira um her own mark
off blanket so this is mark off and this is Kira's mark off blanket so if you want a mark off
blanket you can get them in America uh and here's Kira making her inferences about her world through
her particular mark off blanket anyway um we're now going to rehearse exactly the same narrative
but from the point of view of psychology and understanding this Bayesian mechanics in terms
of you know uh what it means for sentient behavior what you know what must systems that conform to
the Bayesian mechanics physics of sentience what would they look like and how would you understand
their functional anatomy their structure and um and and behavior so the story here probably
starts with the students of Plato and can certainly be tracked uh in philosophy through
people like Kant and then through um into the life sciences uh to the work of people like Helmholtz
I think beautifully summarized by by this illustration here um in the sense that to
perceive something to make sense of something means that you have to have it on the inside
that the um the the brain is your brain and my brain is literally a fantastic organ in the
sense that it has these hypotheses these fantasies these potential explanations of what caused all of
its sensory inputs and on this view the sensory information and indeed any information that we
gather or forage for um in our lived world is just in the service of refuting or confirming
your hypothesis that this is the state of the world out there that is generating sensory data
um so nicely illustrated by this 16th century oil painter famed for painting still lives
but when viewed from a different perspective create a very different explanation a very different
impression so if previously you saw a bowl of fruit but now you see a face the point here is
that you made that face this face is what you have brought to the table in order to provide
the most parsimonious explanation for this particular pattern of sensory impressions
and this is um I think most beautifully articulated by the writings of Herman Helmholtz
so for example objects are always imagined as being present in the field of vision as would
have to be there in order to produce the same impression on the nervous mechanism so you have
this hypothesis and something out there that if it was there it would produce this impression
these sensory inputs and therefore I have explained these sensory impressions and that sensory
evidence has confirmed my hypothesis this is what's going on outside my skull bound brain
and this idea is very closely related to ideas in psychology here by Richard Gregory that
perception simply is hypothesis testing um the maths that underwrites this which we've already
done the physics part of the talk um has been leveraged to great effect in machine learning
by people like Jeffrey Hinton and Peter Diane who indeed created a machine learning um metaphor
for the Bayesian brain that was called the Helmholtz machine by borrowing from Bayesian probability
theory and in particular the work of Richard Feynman on this variational free energy bound on
or approximation to this model evidence or marginal likelihood um so let's just look at
this notion of producing this the same impression on the nervous mechanism so from our point of
view what this can be thought of is the impressions of the external states out there on the sensory
part of my Markov blanket or my Markovian veil my sensory veil that separates me from the outside
very much like shadows on Plato's cave or in this instance shadows projected onto the sensory veil
here and if it's the case that we are have to be in synchrony with the outside and that will
look as if I am predicting and representing and inferring what's uh going on out there I am compelled
to make sense of these sensory impressions by inferring what could have caused these shadows
here so how might a brain do that how might your brain do that well the answer is probably much
simpler than you might imagine we already know the functional form of the bifysical dynamics
of our brains that does this kind of sense making um we know that it has to be a gradient flow on
on this value or negative value function or surprise of this free energy function of the
sensory states that depends upon the internal state which I'm now going to read as an expectation
about what caused my sensory inputs um and I've just rewritten this equation in a slightly
different way which if you were an engineer you would recognize as something called a Kalman filter
which is a very generic way of making sense of data using sensors in engineering and physics
and it basically just separates these solenoidal circular and the gradient flow parts into a
prediction which is a solenoidal part of what's going to happen next given I believe this is the
state of the world I expect this to be the state of the world out there and then a correction term
which is the the hill climbing or the gradient part in the sense that I can always write down a
gradient of the free energy as a prediction error so it's a correction term based upon a prediction
error here denoted by epsilon so what's the prediction error well imagine we have this
sensory shadow on our retina and imagine that we had this internal expectation that it was a
dog that was causing this sensory input and if I had a generative model that could generate
the sensations that I would experience if I was right my expectation was that this was a dog
and I can take the prediction of those sensory samples generated by the generative model and
subtract them or compare them with the actual sensory input and the mismatch of the difference
is simply the prediction but this equation says that the prediction error is going to drive my
expectations until the free energy is minimized or the prediction error is resolved and I've got
the best account possible of my sensory input so this prediction error is then sent back up
to change my mind to change my expectations until the prediction matches the sensory input
and the prediction error is eliminated and resolved and explained away and if I can do that
then I have if you like complied with this fundamental dynamics that comes from this
physics of sentience and I've got a good enough explanation for my world and I say good enough
because I'll never actually know what caused my sensations and this instance it was not a dog it
was a cat but that doesn't matter as long as I can keep my prediction errors to a minimum throughout
my existence job done so that reading of this Bayesian mechanics is nice in the sense that it
just resolves or reduces to a minimization of prediction error and in turn you can minimize
prediction error in two ways that speak to action and perception so you can reduce prediction error
either by making the predictions more like the sensations by literally changing my mind or by
neural activity encoding those expectations so that I generate predictions of my sensations
that are more similar to the actual sensory samples so this would be perception or I can
make my sensations more like the predictions so how would I do that well I just change the data
or the way that I am sampling the world I literally reach out and I touch or I google this page or
I move my eyes to look over there as opposed to look over there I actively re-sample the world
to solicit those kinds of sensations that I predict I given the kind of creature I am
would expect to sample so the action now tries to fulfill the predictions of perception
and that explanation is certainly a coarse grained level of analysis to describe the
functional architectures and message passing the anatomy and physiology of our brains I have
just cartooned this here for those people interested in the neurobiology that accompanies this
formulation of sentient behavior by showing a hierarchical wiring diagram for your brain
which is the visual area here where your visual sensations come in right up to
frontal eye fields in the front part of your brain determining where you look next but if you now
read this architecture as a very complicated hierarchical namely deep generative model generating
sensory predictions from the causes with their random fluctuations in the cascading way here
illustrated by a combination of what I'm looking at and where I'm looking at it to actually generate
sensory samples that your eyes might sample in their central representation of their phobia
as you palpate your visual world then you now have the structural form for this gradient flow
so here written down in terms of the Kalman filter which just involves switching out the
random fluctuations for these prediction errors and immediately tells one this is the kind of
reciprocal message passing that your brains must be engaged in where you take these sensations you
compare them with top-down predictions to form a prediction error and then the prediction error
is used to drive these expectations to provide better predictions and so on to increasingly
hierarchical levels of abstraction all mediated by this very simple gradient flow that is unpacked
here in terms of ascending prediction errors from the sensory parts of your brain to the deeper
parts of your brain that is complemented by an inside out on descending down the hierarchy stream
of predictions that are required to form the prediction errors and this is an example which
I won't go into in any detail because I just want to if you like
tell a story or paint a picture of the way that neurobiologists would think about neuroanatomy
and neurophysiology under this kind of construction the only important thing that this
particular example brings to the table is that we have to make sense of all different kinds of
