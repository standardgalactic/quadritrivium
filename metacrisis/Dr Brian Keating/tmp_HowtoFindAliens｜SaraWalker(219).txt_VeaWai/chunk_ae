that corroborates why there's a threshold value um that we're working on now in the current paper
so the theory would predict there should be a crossover point where you where you wouldn't
expect this um by by um a non biological process basically or a process that didn't undergo selection
um or didn't have any kind of information or causation in the system um so so if you you buy
that sort of argument basically what it's saying is above 15 it's exponentially unlikely to ever
observe those molecules and there's a two-part argument to it it's not just it's 15 steps but
when you see a molecule and you observe it with your instrument like a mass spec you have to have
multiple copies of it um and so you might argue say based on the Boltzmann brain argument and
people do this they're like well geochemistry can make anything and i'm always like well geochemistry
can't make a cell phone where you draw the line but i mean the line has to be somewhere otherwise
you're arguing for intelligent design and i think people really don't understand this it's either
biological agents or the designers or the universe has some kind of intrinsic design based laws um
and since i i i'm looking for the situation where we can explain that physics internal to the universe
and don't have to appeal external then it's not that you can get certain objects for free it's
that there has to be specific pathways constructed to make those objects um and so with that argument
means that when you find one cell phone you don't find just one cell phone you find that everybody
on the planet has a cell phone it's not an isolated occurrence like people you know you never expect
a single person to appear in the universe you would expect a population of people um you would
never expect a single copy of a molecule to appear in the universe it needs to be in a population
of molecules if it's part of a process that's reliable to produce that molecule and it's not
a statistical fluke and it's actually part of an evolutionary product now there might be some
smearing of the distribution not all people are identical not all molecules need to buy
identical but they need to be somewhere related in the assembly space um and we have ways of
accounting for that so then um then the idea is if you find these molecules that are past that
threshold then you've found evidence that there had to be some kind of causal mechanisms producing
them or some kind of selection or what or information or what all these words emergence
complexity you know whatever word you want to associate to life but it's evidence of life so
it's agnostic as to you know what what um type of chemistry could produce it you know could you
have silicon based life could you have you know in other words are you are are there biases or
you know confirmation errors that might be imposed there are so one of the things that I I think
is of interest is trying to understand the assembly structure of different kinds of physical
systems so it might be that silicon doesn't you would never expect to see high assembly things
in silicon just because of the way the assembly looks in silicon chemistry um but my anticipation
is that probably yes you would still expect it now one thing is that depending on the structure
of the system that you're looking at you might expect the threshold value to be different
so we can predict features based on the causal structure of the assembly space of where that
transition should be where it's necessary to have some kind of informational system produce that
object but we expect that transition to happen in any kind of assembly space and that transition
happens just because we're talking about a system that is combinatorially huge so the number of
ways of making that object um grows exponentially with the the the size of the object um and so
there's this kind of transition where the path the number of pathways for assembling it is too large
for you to expect it to form by chance um and that's a fundamental feature of any combinatorial
system where you impose a causal structure on it um so so that's sort of the the underlying
premise of assembly theory is basically saying when you see things pass that boundary for that
particular assembly that particular kind of causal structure combinatorial space that's
evidence of life or that's evidence of the physics underlying life. I see um and then
one one thing that we've talked about um maybe on clubhouse a you know longer time ago uh you know
it's kind of this this notion that I again was brought up with Lee and and and I and Kurt which
was you know that are the properties of life encoded in the big bang in some sense and before
I get to that I want to ask you know can assembly theory discard like irrelevant or low value
information for example people talk about water you know oh we found water you know uh and and on
mars and there's evidence of what I'm like of course you know hydrogen's the most common element
oxygen's like the fourth most common of course you're going to find a lot of water um you know
so in other words is that you know finding water is that is that this positive is that in any way
or is it can you just exclude it because it's so abundant it's it's it's almost like a nuisance
parameter yeah so um so assembly theory is falsifiable like if you found a high assembly
thing you couldn't associate to life you can falsify the theory but I think one of the things
is it's trying to get rid of all those kind of details um and the water argument is more of one
of habitability than life right so so there has been traditionally also in astrobiology this confusion
between talking about the components of life as life right so that's like you know these single
molecules become reference like oxygen oxygen is not life oxygen could be a signature of life with
a whole set of other assumptions and DNA is not life either DNA is evidence of life because it's
high assembly object it requires a lot of design and evolution oxygen is kind of so you can see
where those fall on and sort of an assembly structure but things like water are preconditions
for life right assumed preconditions based on what we know of life on earth so life on earth requires
water therefore we go look for environments with water because we assume that life couldn't exist
in the environments that don't have water so it's kind of like we're trying to screen out the search
space um and focus it in but um but assembly theory is kind of agnostic to that because it just says
you need to have an environment that life could emerge whatever environment that is and and that um
and life could build complex things and then you would look for those complex things now it might
do that some environments life doesn't build complex things and they're globally assembly threshold
um but there are also ways that we can detect features of selection or light of information
processing below that that we're still developing so interesting um and then what did we make of this
this conjecture by uh by avi lobe that you know the universe was once you know at that age you
know at the red at a redshift of 100 the universe was approximately room temperature
meaning that you could have a liquid water um and actually a wide variety of timescales
and uh so liquid water was was perhaps abundant in the you know just ambient universe uh does this
does that play a role you know cosmic connect i'm trying to push back the last what i want to do is
push the last common luca back to the last scattering surface so i want to get it quiet and um
i just don't see the utility i mean what what does that give you it just it gives you an interesting
thing to say i think it's curious i think there could be something there but do i follow the
chain of logic to say oh i have observational signatures of life living in the period of
the universe and i haven't seen anybody actually go that far so i mean i can spend all day making
wild conjectures about what life what could be life and where it could be in the universe i have
a million ideas a day about it but i think the thing is like if you really want to discover aliens
and some of us really do i mean a lot of us do avi included right like then we have to sit down
and we have to really think rigorously about the problem and develop theories that we can test
and things that we can do in the lab observations we can make with telescopes and theory that we
can build and those three things have to work together just like they do in in physics but
astrobiology hasn't transitioned because it's not a mature science yet it's a really new field
and it's bringing together a lot of areas of science that haven't worked together before
we don't know how to ask the question of life we we make a lot of assumptions that we know what we
are and um and you know the we i'll know it when i see it is so pervasive i'm glad that you brought
that up earlier it's funny but it's true because people assume we're life we know it when we see
it but yeah so so i think i think yes it's fun yeah yeah so i think it's fun to talk about
the water in the early universe and and could it have been the case that life could have emerged
really early in the universe but i don't think it's helpful to any discussion about actually
solving any of the problems that we're dealing with well remaining on the avilobe uh bandwagon
for a second uh so he's had uh you know kind of a lot of um maybe dissonant conflicts with the
astro astronomy community but primarily you know what he's advocating for is that we spend all this
money on on you know kind of wasteful science string theory and and you know bigger and bigger
accelerators and so forth but we really should be studying is not even spending it on sedi which is
like information um looking for uh techno signatures in the radio wave or light waves
and as i mentioned before they've really pivoted from you know the pure core mission that they had
from drake's time and told you know and morrison till today which is looking for extremophiles and
all sorts of other you know life on earth at redshift zero um but what do you make of his
claims that sort of you know we should be looking for physical you know techno signatures like like
this little chunk of a mua mua that i captured uh not too long ago going across my my uh but but
tell me what are your thoughts about this i have been actually i did get approached by somebody
who does is making nft meteorites and i'm just like all right well don't look down don't look
tell me what do you think about a mua mua you don't think i've got to see this before
yeah so i think some of the features of being open-minded and realizing that aliens could be
right in front of us and and it might just pass us by are really um good about the way that avi
is approaching some of these questions um but i think in the case of i'm i'm i can never pronounce
this one either i'm a mua mua mua it's not i thought marinara i was gonna this is one like you
could run the whole bayesian thing we just talked about and there are really good models actually
including developed by one of my colleagues here steve dasha asu that explain a mua mua in terms of
completely natural um explanation including some of the anomalies that avi talked about in his book
like they've been basically like all of these sort of features um so i think there's a lot of
evidence that you know suggests it could have a natural origin and it's not an anomaly um now
the real issue i think is not a mua mua mua and the debate around that but the whole issue of our
anomalies adequate to assign alien as the explanation when we do this everywhere we do it in ufo
science we can't explain it as aliens a mua mua we can't explain it as aliens uh biosignature science
phosphine on venus we can't explain it abiotically it's aliens saucers yeah saucers yeah so i i think
culturally culturally and this is ubiquitous a kind of scientist members of the public everyone
aliens right now are the other they're the explanation for things we can't explain
and i just don't feel like that's adequate i don't i think if we don't understand what something is
we should say it's an anomaly if we have a mechanism and we can explain it and that mechanism happens
to be associated to the phenomena we call life and we can see this is an example of life that's not us
then we use the alien hypothesis right it's not science if i'm just saying everything that i don't
understand is alien uh what about by your former colleague and uh you know paul davies and current
colleague also uh you know talks about the shadow biosphere and the other side of that right yeah i
could knock on the door yeah um the shadow biosphere and these lurkers in our solar system and as he
wrote about i pointed out to him you know we've done multiple interviews one was on the eerie silence
on the on the 10th anniversary of its publication which was itself on the 50th anniversary of the
steady program kicking off yeah the silence has only grown more deafening in that realm so his
his theory of you know shadow biospheres and so forth what do you make of that isn't that just kind
of saucers by another by another name um other by another name um well i think the shadow biosphere
was intended to be a hypothesis to be tested right so the idea was um if life is not a singular event
in the universe and it's common um and it's common on earth like planets the most earth
like planet is earth and we know the old life happened once here so maybe it happened twice
and we just haven't actually recognized that yet um and actually there's a lot of historical precedent
for this because we have discovered alien life on earth that we didn't know about just happened
that we found out later it was related to us so for example you know for most of human history
we didn't know microbes existed we had to develop the technology of microscopes to actually literally
see that there were these organisms basically living in our bread and you know on the tabletop
and pretty much everywhere around us but that was a completely hidden quote unquote shadow biosphere
for most of human history and so the argument is um if it's not dna based life and we're only
combing the seas like in craig ventures things you know going through the ocean combing up life and
detecting it based on the dna sequences what are we missing um so so paul's very adamant that you
know it's cheaper to look for life on earth than it is to go look for life on mars so why don't we
just have a concerted effort to look for an alien example of life on earth that isn't actually alien
to earth it's just alien to us because it's also originating on earth um and my personal perspective
on it is that's a well posed scientific question and we should be doing that i think from the
philosophical side of how i approach the science and what's consistent with the kind of theories i
do and the kind of work that my group has been doing uh thinking about the global organization
of biochemistry and patterns in biochemistry i don't think that you can have more than one example
of life for planet um and um because i think life becomes a globally integrated system pretty quickly
and it's actually like a planetary scale process and you can think about that even with modern
technology and the global internet and how we're all increasingly connected i just i don't see you
think about life as is information propagating and the kind of structure of it i don't see the
possibility of having more than one life on the planet but from the perspective of is it a well
posed scientific question yes it absolutely is and it's and and i and just i didn't mean to imply
that like the whole set of biosignatures from UFOs to phosphine are not well posed i just don't
want like you need to have a conjecture there like about why is this life and actual like a
theoretical support um otherwise like i i just i don't understand the mentality and maybe i'm
just missing something but i i feel like there's more rigorous ways of approaching the problem
that people have just shied away from historically because the life problem is so hard yeah absolutely
so if you'll indulge me for another 10 minutes maybe we have some audience questions that can
work okay good so first question um comes from uh dylan graham a husband on my youtube channel
comment community section it's dr brian keating on youtube uh dylan asked given the non-urgotic
nature of life and the vastness of genetic search space do you think mutation and thus evolution is
purely random or do you think there's a set of principles that constrain the space of mutations
to places more likely to produce adaptive change so is this kind of uh evolution being
pre-pattern for certain adaptations yeah is it purely random or is it or is it you know traceable
to some sort of you know set goals maybe design um yeah i mean i i don't know where i stand on that
like so some days i think that there's some intrinsic randomness in the universe and other
days i think it's totally deterministic um so so i'm personally deeply intrigued by this i think
that there definitely is some contingency in um you know what mutations happen in which and the
ways they're adaptive and certainly there's been experiments done to show certain features of that
kind of contingency so it doesn't seem that they're all totally random like certain parts of the
genome are more biased toward mutation than others is a simple example um and then you can ask questions
about why and there's tons of people that are way more qualified to talk about those kind of you
know specific genomic questions than i i am but i think i think the question of whether um whether
the universe requires some kind of underlying stochasticity or randomness or for life to exist
is a really deeply intriguing one um yeah uh next question comes from a guest audience member named
rustin peace which was coincidentally the name for my first daughter not um which was good um
and he or she asked could it be uh that a living organism doesn't require a cell wall or you know
some kind of container um i think there's certainly so i don't i don't think life has boundaries in the
traditional sense um i do think that you need bounded uh bounded structures but i don't think
like you know the container is the thing that's important so as i mentioned before like a cell
reconstructs itself and is part of a lineage and the lineage is really what we need to think about
with life so the boundary plays a role in terms of saying this is a packet of information that's
reproducing itself in a in a particular structure but then you know organisms can exchange genes
with each other or even now like we're exchanging knowledge so the boundaries are not as important
as sort of the flow of information in the system so i think it's kind of a secondary feature
and in fact there's some things that you know individuality the idea of like bounded individuals
might have emerged late in the original life and that you might have just had much more
collective or like system level properties early on and i i i resonate with those kind of ideas i
think they're they're really intriguing so maybe you know really primitive life is not bounded but
