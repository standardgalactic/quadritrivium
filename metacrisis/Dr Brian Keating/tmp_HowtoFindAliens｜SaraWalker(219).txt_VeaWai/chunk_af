maybe once you get into this kind of Darwinian well-defined information a lineage as it becomes
bounded uh next question from vorador what is your opinion regarding the chances to find life on
let's say he or she asks about Europa specifically but what about other places in our solar system
i think it's possible for for life to be a lot of places in our solar system and that we just
really haven't figured out how to identify it yeah i think your rope is hard mission wise because
you have to drill through the ice shell um and so getting a sample is really challenging but i so
for that reason i'm much more on team enceladus so to say like i'm very enthusiastic about sending
missions to enceladus because enceladus is very similar to Europa another icy moon um you know
has a liquid ocean under its shell but it actually has active jets of um material being spewed into
space you can imagine flying a you know a robot through the plume and taking samples um so you
don't have to worry about the drilling problem and from a habitability perspective of like you know
are the ingredients for life present on these icy moons i think enceladus is just as strong a
candidate as Europa so that just becomes an accessibility issue great uh another frequent
guest on my channel the means of destruction our audience member that's another good name yeah
these are all great band names i know there's another one chimbrazo we'll get to that uh he
asked our stars alive i'm gonna change that to um you know what's the minimum you know kind of
astrophysical entity that you could say uh is alive or or features life uh could you have a
dark cloud like arthur c clark or uh you know what what's the minimum uh common ancestor you know
stellar astrophysical uh prerequisite yeah so so this is not the way i would ask that question um so
i'm gonna answer yeah so because it's kind of like the what is life question and then what are
other examples of life this is what we would canonically think and i just don't think that's
the right way of framing it what i i would think is clearly we exist in the universe as life which
means that the laws of physics are structured for life to exist and i'm interested in those laws that
specifically explain life which my claim is are not the laws of physics as we know them now they're
different kind of law of physics and they have very different the laws of physics that explain
life have very different properties for example they're not cast in this kind of initial state
fixed law of motion kind of framework uh which we need to talk about but like that's an aside but
anyway just imagine you know there there is some structure to the universe causal structure the
universe is a causal graph so to speak and assemble the space um then everything has that property
just like everything um it has the property of existing in space and time in in gravity right
like there's a space time manifold that defines the properties of the universe and then some
physical systems like us are very high assembly and you can think of them like in the gravitational
analogy as being objects that have very strong gravitational potential wells like planetary
systems galaxies or black holes are good examples to study gravitational physics things that are
good examples to study causal structure in the universe or this kind of feature of information
being causal or whatever you want to call it or living things now is that apparent and in other
examples like stars or other kinds of systems we could study of course it should be because it's a
sure of our universe but the question is to what degree and so I wouldn't really call things alive
unless they're very high assembly objects like the kind that we talk about in terms of molecular
assembly theory but assembly is supposed to be general applied anything um and so I don't think
stars have crossed that threshold but I think that stars have uh you know like you can think
about the contingency in stellar generations and the kind of elemental distributions they have they
do have a clear this population of stars had to come before this population of stars otherwise
there's no reason for this elemental distribution so they have a causal structure associated to them
right okay next question comes uh from chim brazo he has a bunch of questions one is about humans
and aliens interacting how would we communicate with them you could ask answer that question he
also asked why does a grand unified theory have to be beautiful I guess my question to you would be
you know what what about these um you know that your love of physics your love of cosmology your
your kind of og historical legacy what interests you most and what do you find most interesting
about um the searches that are kind of layered upon them as this question of beauty and and
propriety if you will in the laws of nature we talked about symmetry earlier what do you make
of that is that is a baggage is that a shibboleth what's going on with that now um so so on the
question of beauty I think um you know a lot of people think that's problematic for physics and I
think it can because I think you know there are obvious areas where maybe we get romanticized by
certain ideas and then we lose track of you know where's where's the scientific rigor but I also
think um that our attraction to beauty and the way we explain the world is probably a signature
also of the physics of what we are and is not just like an ad hoc feature added onto it um but I
think um I think it just depends on what your aesthetic is um and for me I think the aesthetic
is is it explanatory I don't I don't um and how much does it explain and I'm also deeply interested
in and I in theories that are empowering so I think um and what I mean by that is because I
think theories actually are causal and they matter to how the world we live in locally on our planet
works because the theories become the reality we live in um it is important to try to pick
ones that maximize kind of potential for humanity so it's not like an aesthetic choice but it's more
of a well it is an aesthetic choice but it's an aesthetic choice informed by thinking about
theories as physical objects and like what they do so um so I guess I don't have any problem with
people choosing aesthetic choices but I think that I guess my point is we need to be very cognizant
about why we're making those choices how it's related to the physics that we're developing
and where the biases are coming in and so one thing I always try to do is is try to understand
what my own biases are and my my biggest biases I'm trained as a theoretical physicist so I tend
to think like one and we have a lot of baggage that we go with um and I'm okay with that but it
might not be the right way of even asking the life problem right it could be like you know if
this is completely irrelevant but I don't think that's true but but it's entirely possible good so
now move to Twitter to the Twitter space where you maybe have seen some of the questions posed to
you the first one uh we'll choose from Caitlin McShay um Santa Fe McShay and by the way you
should all follow uh Sarah at uh Sarah underscore and Mari I am follow Caitlyn too she's amazing
follow Caitlyn you just gotta shout out Caitlyn hope you're watching listening
yeah I see you what's your favorite philosophical textbook or book uh that's a hard one I think um
I should have looked at these ahead it would have um I think um I think it's always nice to kind of
know like the like early like ideas of how people think so I'm not a philosopher by training I took
one philosophy class and it happened to be when I was at community college um and I've always had
an interest in philosophy but it's kind of like one of these things that now that I'm a middle
aged physicist I'm starting to read more philosophy because I need help um but um but when I was a
student um I think I really like was I was so struck by two things one was in my physics class the
fact that we could predict magnetic monopoles and we we couldn't know we could look for them
sorry I don't know where my lights went and they're not coming but out there they are and the other
one was um uh Thomas Aquinas's arguments for the existence of God which I thought were so clever
um and so I really enjoyed reading that I don't I don't know really I think um I think both of
those together really gave me some insight into the power of human thought and how far we could push
it and since I became a physicist that was always the thing I was romanticized by is the fact
again it goes back to like why is reality comprehensible and why are brain structure to
even reason about these kind of problems and look how far we can actually push that reasoning both
in the sort of abstract philosophical arguments um that we might want to run through or in the sense
that we can predict future of the universe and actually go and look and verify if they're true
or not um and I think those those two things are are are just really important futures and so
so I guess that's kind of a half-assed answer but an answer I like it very much uh next question
also coming from Twitter there's about 50 from uh one person uh Sandy Pichaldi uh but I'll just ask
one of it he says basically what does it even mean that time can flow in any other direction
than before to after i.e. what we call forward I don't know because I think time only flows forward
I don't know why people think I could go backward um so so I'm with you on that question please
someone explain to me why it could go backward yeah all right well you could uh yeah I I I think
sort of just like I I think you know yeah never mind we'll just leave it at that that's good
and uh Bryant Woe times asks what does fine-tuning of initial conditions have to do with free will
okay um I think I might have made this argument on Twitter at one point um
which you should all follow because she's hilarious prolific philosophical brilliant on Twitter
masterful um so what uh what so the so there's this whole sort of conception in current physics
that in order to explain the complexity now like you know the fact that we're sitting here on this
podcast talking and you guys are listening um was a feature then like like can be traced back
deterministically to like the initial state of the universe so so then this becomes a fine-tuning
argument because in order to explain all the variation and all the structure we have in the
universe it had to be some minor fluctuations in the initial condition of the universe and the
initial condition had to be fairly ordered to explain why disorder hasn't ranged so there's all
these kind of criteria on the initial state of the universe um that are imposed by the features
that we observe now um and if you trace that chain of logic um basically it means that it sort of
every action that you're doing now was already pre imprinted in the initial state of the universe
so there's sort of a conflict between current physics and free will at a cosmological scale
because it's not really it goes back to the intelligent design versus creativity discussion
we were having earlier um that these questions are actually deeply buried in the logic of how we
talk about physics um and it goes back to this idea that sort of the laws exist outside the universe
and and the only thing you need to specify what happens in the universe is basically the initial
condition so once you set that in motion everything is is predetermined um and i don't think that's
the right paradigm for talking about life mind free will or any of the problems that you know
you hit up against when you're talking about what happens in biology versus what happens
in physics and it's not that physics as we know it is wrong it's just that the kind of structure of
the equations that we study in physics are not the right kind of structure of the equations for those
kind of problems i got it and then the last question before we wrap up with closing arguments uh is
from stir devant who asks how often are my cells created in origins experiments and in nature um
how important is a lipid bilayer to first life uh it's interesting that my cell is used to protect
plasmids in gmo's as well as m r and a vaccines uh is that essential uh do you know what these
my cells are can you define them um i so a lot of people talk in origins of life about um forming
vesicles so like if you have fatty acids they basically self-organize into spherical spherical
structures so you can have so there's some hypotheses about cells before life that you had
you know these my cells are vesicles forming and then some molecules got in them and they
they learned to co replicate and then that was sort of the way you jump started life so those
are usually considered to be proto cell models um i don't know how frequently they occur my
understanding is you just have some fatty acids they just self-assemble this way so then the question
becomes how do you synthesize enough fatty acids to be able to do this um and uh and i'm i'm by no
means a a membrane expert um or knowing those things um so i would not be the person to ask
about sort of the details of the chemistry on that but i always find those things deeply intriguing too
well sarah is there anything that we haven't covered today that you'd be interested in
touching on in this uh we've had a nice over two hour and a half conversation but is there
anything else that i forgot or didn't i neglected to ask you i i don't think so what's next for you
do you have any big cocks coming any any thoughts of a book anything fun well i am actually writing a
book yeah a popular book or text yeah yeah it's a popular book and it's on it's on life and what
life is um yeah it's an exclusive and into the impossible exclusive yeah i haven't talked about
it much because i'm like it's mostly written but i something to do and also it's it's hard to write
a book about a theory that's a work in progress so there's a lot of like what is it i'm not
don't ask the strength theorist that they would disagree with that yeah i know right but but i i
think part of the thing that i'm interested in is um is how hard it is to work at the frontier
and and the fact that we're not doing that alone right you you can't especially nowadays you can't
really work on the frontier of knowledge without interacting with other people and i think the
alien conversation is particularly interesting because it's one that i since all of us are the
phenomenon of life all of us should be able to engage in in this problem right like all of us
have an intimate connection to the physics we're trying to understand and everyone has a clue
it's just like how do we stitch all those clues together to figure out what we are right right
exactly well sarah this has been uh so much fun i can't wait for that book to come out you'll have
to come back on the show when it is out this has been just a fascinating conversation with a deep
thinker and i'm so glad that you share your ideas with with not only with me but with the
universe the multiverse of minds that you've connected to and especially with me and my
audience today thank you sarah so much yeah thanks thanks for having me any sufficiently
advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic
you
