and that action we can think of this in terms of action but also action observations so by
replaying this in the absence of any proprioceptive predictions we can start to simulate
action observation and mirror neuron like behaviors in silico i won't go into any details
all i wanted to do with this slide is say that just with these very fast gradient flows of a
predictive processing predictive coding like flavor you can get quite a long way in terms
of simulating autonomous behavior both in terms of inferring and acting and indeed inferring
what you see being enacted but there's a different kind of autonomous behavior that may be important
for understanding the way that we actually operate as opposed to say an insect or a virus
or a thermostat might might operate and that's in terms of action as a path integral into the
future so there's a whole other bunch of physics you can bring to the table here again leveraging
the contributions of Richard Feynman in terms of the path integral formulation of quantum
electrodynamics we can tell this same story but not in terms directly of the Fokker-Pank equation
but it's equivalent in terms of a path integral formulation where now we're talking not about
variation free energies but variational actions that are integrals of this free energy functional
or its basis which is the suprisal over time and this can be decomposed into all sorts of
interesting components of kinetic energy path independent path dependent terms that's from
our point of view not so interesting it's the homologue that ensues when we adopt the Markov
blanket and what comes out of that now is a slightly different perspective on the way that we can
look as if we are minimizing the path integral of variational free energy and this leads us to
the notion of planning as inference it leads us to choosing actions now that we think will in the
future have a trajectory or path through state space that is the least surprising on average
or conforms to our prior beliefs about the sorts of states that I will encounter in the future
so now put simply we have a statistical physics explanation or calculus for planning and this
is the last one the last slide now this is just an illustration when you put that kind of mechanics
in silico and simulate action now not simply doing the gradient percent on
variational free energy but actually choosing paths of action into the future planning
to minimize on average the expected variational free energy in the future you can start to simulate
things like um saccadic searches hunting for information it's going to reduce the expected
surprise uncertainty by looking over there as opposed to looking over there in brief this
simulation is this showing the the evidence accumulation through an epistemic foraging
of the visual field that is mediated by little saccadic eye movements gathering information
to resolve uncertainty about these conditional beliefs about the causes the external states of
the sensory input here disambiguating between upright sideways and an inverted face so this
slide summarizes the if you like the endpoint of this most elaborated form of free energy
minimization um what it says is you can think of this as sort of senses sensory information
coming in you evaluate your or you change your internal states to optimize your beliefs about
external states through this variational or approximate posterior conditional
belief distribution here simply by minimizing free energy that can be broken down into
inaccuracy and complexity and then you use that to work out what would happen in the future if I
did this or that and that entails a minimization or that selection entails a minimization of the
expected free energy and interesting the expected inaccuracy becomes ambiguity the expected complexity
becomes risk so now what we have is a calculus from first principles that gives you a description
of agents that are risk minimizing and information seeking in the sense that they want to minimize
their ambiguity and indulge in that kind of visual palpation that does this epistemic
foraging or responding to epistemic affordances that we saw in the previous slide so in summary
well this is not a summary this is levels of conversation that we can now have hopefully if
we have time about how far you can take this and what different levels of generative models
would be required to support different kinds of active engagement with your world via sensations
that could be a sensorium could have sentience what does what what's the difference between
unconscious inference in the sense of Helmholtz and literally thinking and planning about the
future does that require deep generative models and the consequences of action what does that mean
for autonomy and agency how do things become how do we lose phenomenal transparency we haven't
talked about precision but that may be an important aspect this encoded of uncertainty
in these belief distributions of external states and what does it mean to have the hypothesis
the fantasy that I am a self and does this underwrite subjective consciousness and
self-awareness so these are questions that I don't have answers to but I thought might
be the kinds of questions that at least some people in the audience might want to might want to
speak to so I'll give the last word to Helmholtz again objects are always imagined as being present
in the field of vision as would have to be there in order to produce the same
impression on the nervous mechanism so with that I just wanted to thank those people
whose ideas that I've been talking about and of course thank you for your attention thank you very
much indeed
