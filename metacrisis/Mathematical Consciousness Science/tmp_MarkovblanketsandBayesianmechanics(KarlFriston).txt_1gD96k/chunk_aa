Welcome. You are about to view a recorded talk of the Mathematical Consciousness Science
online seminar series held in 2020. This seminar series aims to explore the role of mathematics
in the scientific study of consciousness and hopes to connect researchers who have an
interest in this topic. While every session of the seminar consists of a talk and discussions,
the latter are not recorded and the following will only contain the talk. We hope you will
enjoy it. For further information please visit our website seminar.math-consciousness.org.
I'm going to go through the basic idea from or approach the basic ideas from a couple of
perspectives just to put everything into context. I want to in particular end up at this notion of
a dual aspect information geometry and how that emerges and how it inherits from predictive
processing or constructivist views of the brain. The second agenda is just to start to fine grain
or drill down on different kinds of inference that may map to different aspects of sentience
and consciousness. So that's where I'm trying to go. Let me start by a nod to where much of these
ideas come from. So I came into this really from the point of view of predictive coding and
predictive processing as it's now currently known. The idea of being here that we actively
construct explanations for our sensorium. So this is nicely illustrated by this oil painter
in the 16th century famed for doing still lives that when viewed from another perspective have
a very different interpretation. So before you saw a bowl of vegetables and now you see a face the
point being made over the point that he was making is that this face this explanation this
hypothesis this fantasy for what caused the sensory impressions is coming from the inside out. So
this turns on its head the 20th century view of information processing where the information comes
from the outside in impresses itself on to use Helmholtz as a nervous mechanism and somehow
information is extracted to conclude there is a face and more looks at it from an active or
constructive point of view where you're checking or using the sensory information to check revise
update your beliefs that you already have in mind about what could have caused those sensory
inputs and indeed this is exactly the view championed by Helmholtz objects are always imagined
as being present in the field of vision as would have to be there in order to produce the same
impression on the nervous mechanism. That idea I think has had quiet traction since its introduction
for example the ideas of Richard Gregory about perception as hypothesis testing
the notion formally has been taken up to great effect by people in machine learning like Jeffrey
Hinton and Peter Diane boring ideas from Richard Feynman specifically variational free energy
formulations in quantum electrodynamics and making that work or unpacking that in the context of the
Bayesian brain or more generally an inference gloss on this ability to confirm your hypotheses
about what caused your sensory data at this point in time. So just taking that notion of sensory
impressions what we have at hand is the challenge of understanding how you and I make sense of the
shadows on our sensory epithelia so what are causing those shadows that we are witness to
impinging upon our eyes and our ears and indeed our interceptors. The solution to that problem
that inference problem you can just lift from standard Bayesian statistics or machine learning
in the latter days and one ends up with a relatively simple scheme which can be construed
in terms of something called Bayesian filtering in the neurosciences it's now become known as
predictive coding but it is the same thing and all it's saying is that if I want to optimize
my expectations the the belief I have about the causes of some sensory impression let's say this
was our sensory input and all I have to do is to minimize a quantity that we can write out as
essentially a precision weighted prediction error so this equation here is a differential
equation that dot means rate of change this means that this is an equation of motion or a flow
so flow on a functional a free energy potential here there is a function of the expectation
and the sensory impressions here and this is a form of a Kalman filter or
predictive coding scheme so this is the prediction and these are the prediction weighted prediction
errors so what are the prediction the prediction errors well let's say we had this sensory input
and we had this expectation about what could have caused this sensory impression here and the idea
is that we can generate through a generative model what we would have seen if this was correct
and this provides a prediction that is subtracted from the sensation to form a prediction error
such that if you were able to minimize the prediction error so that these two things were
the same you have effectively found an explanation or a hypothesis that is a sufficient explanation
to explain your sensorium so the crucial point here is that it is a sufficient explanation it's
not necessarily the veridical explanation you will never know what's out there but if you can get
through like minimizing your prediction errors then you've got a sufficiently good model to
navigate and survive so that perspective provides a nice formal intuitive way of understanding
perception it also enables you to accommodate action in the in the service of minimizing
prediction error because if the only imperative is say to minimize prediction error which will
later become this free energy functional then there are two ways we can do that so if prediction
error is sensations minus predictions we can either change the predictions in our head to make them
more like the sensations or we can change the sensations by acting upon the world to resample
to palpate in a different way to make the sensations more like the predictions so both action
and perception by changing sensations and predictions are just playing the same game
hand in hand trying to minimize that prediction error so we now have if like as an intuitive picture
of active inference inference under action where you are in charge of harvesting those data that
you predict so in some sense your actions now become self-fulfilling prophecies and we'll see
an example of that later so that's the the other sort of the kind of introduction to these ideas
I might give a psychology audience or a psychophysics audience a neurobiological audience
what I want to do now is to change the temper of the talk and just put that to one side and see if
we can get to the same conclusions and the same kind of mathematical phenomenology from a purely
first principle statistical approach and if we can what implications does that have for sentience
so the way I'm going to do that is quickly go through a treatment of the statistics of light
of self-organization with a special emphasis on Markov blankets and I've written a gothic
systems here it should really be non-equilibrium steady state the implications of those non-equilibrium
steady states with Markov blankets in terms of information geometry and I'm going to illustrate
that with a numerical simulation of some active matter or a primordial soup and I'm going to close
with different grades of sentience and active inference that I'm hoping will speak to different
kinds of consciousness of the sort that you will be more familiar talking about so let's start with
this question posed by Skrodinger how can the events in space and time which take place within
the spatial boundary of a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry so we're
not going to address that question head on although we will implicitly answer it what we're going to
do first of all is just focus on this notion of a spatial boundary and he would be the first person
to acknowledge that a boundary is itself a statistical object a construct and for those
people who don't know what a Markov blanket is I'll just quickly take you through it
imagine you've got some universe and these nodes of this graph here are states of some
universe some systemic states and they are influencing each other or they have statistical
or probabilistic dependencies denoted by the arrows here if I just identify some
set of states here we call those internal states then the Markov blanket comprises the parents
the children and the parents of the children of these internal states and its role or its
importance is that it provides a statistical shield or set of states that mean that if I wanted to
predict what's going to happen to me my internal states now given the entire rest of the universe
I would only ever need to know these blanket states that enshroud me here so all the information
out there pertinent to what's going on in here is contained within the blanket states so technically
these states are independent of these states given or conditioned upon the state of the blanket
states now I'm going to make a further move which will make a lot more sense in the next slide
I'm just going to introduce a bipartisan of the blanket states into active states
that influence external states but do not influence internal states and sensory states
that influence internal states but are not influenced by the internal states and you may
be asking why have I done that well if one just looks at this probabilistic structure this very
elemental statement of a dynamical world that somehow is coupled through dependencies
and causal structures then we can look at these blanket states and in particular the
partition into sensory active states in conjunction with the internal states that they encompass
as the states of a particle and by a particle I mean something that could be as big as a brain
or as small as an electron or something of the size of a cell all of these things particular
things having common a mark of blanket and in one sense they have to because if you didn't have this
conditional independence you would not be able to measure in a statistical sense the difference
between the thing or the particle and anything else it would become statistically part of the
universe and so I'm just sketching out why that or how that impacts for example in the brain we can
consider all the internal brain states all the synaptic activity efficacy connectivity
of inside the brain as the internal brain states and they influence active states or autonomous
nervous system or motor effectors that cause changes in the external states that then impinge
back on the sensory states that in turn influence the internal states and the missing dependencies
really here and here define this mark of blanket so there's an exchange between the internal
and the outside but it has to be mediated with this with this bi-directional and permeable
interface that is the mark of blanket where the sensory states mediate the influence of
outside on the inside and the active states conversely the inside on the outside and exactly
the same structure holds for a little cell where the surface states could constitute the
and the cell receptors could constitute the sensory states affecting the internal
milieu of the cell in terms of its intracellular processing and chemicals active states could
be active filaments that support the sensory states that endow the cell with a motility
that change the external milieu that again reports back and influences the sensory states
so what we have here that inherits just from having a mark of blanket which every
particle or thing must have is a circular causality that's very reminiscent of the action
perception cycle I use the word circular causality deliberately because that's going to come back
and do some heavy lifting later on right so what I want to do now is just put a bit of statistical
physics on the mark of blanket but to do so I'm going to have to just back off a little bit and
ask you to forget about the mark of blanket for a moment and just bear with me while we drill down
on self-organization in any arbitrary system and then we're going to see what happens when we put
the mark of blanket back in play again so what I've done here is just produce a little graphic
of some universe or some system here just depicted in terms of two states one state here
and one state here so to any one point in time the state of the universe is a point and as time
goes on it moves around in the state space tracing at a manifold or an attracting set
that in fact is called mathematically an attracting set or a random dynamical attractor
or a pullback attractor now the kinds of particles that we're going to be talking about or systems
are those that endure over time and in that instance that licensed me to understand the
density of these trajectories as they unfold over time say for example I was getting up in the morning
having my coffee going out to work well in fact that's what I used to do before coronavirus
but then you know following the my my normal trajectory over the day
of course this could actually represent my heartbeat or it could be on a timescale over years
we have christmas and eastern or some holidays irrespective of the timescale of the nature of
these states this kind of object must be in play and it means that I can interpret the density of
these trajectories in terms of the probability that if you sampled me at any one point in my
heartbeat or any time during the day or during the year this also denotes a probability you will
find me in that state and I'm going to refer to that as a non-equilibrium steady state density
now the important move that I can make just by stating or stipulated defining the kinds of
systems with that we're interested in as dynamical systems that have this that these dynamics that
conform to a long form that endure over time means I can derive from the certain implications
which actually take us back to that predictive coding scheme that we took we started off with
so I won't go through this in detail but just to reassure you that there exists a simple
mathematical description of the the way in which this non-equilibrium steady state density
evolves over time as a function of the amplitude of random fluctuations on the flow
f of the states as a function of where they are in state space and the p corresponding to the
this non-equilibrium steady state density here so this is a Fokker-Planck equation you may know it
as the master equation you may know it as a Schrodinger equation these are all equivalent
formulations of this basic density dynamics or ensemble dynamics for us we can do something
quite useful here because we just said that these this object this probability density does not in
and of itself change over time so we can set this to zero and we can look at the solution
to this Fokker-Planck equation and when we do so we see something very interesting what we see is
that we can express the flow of states at any point in state space here as effectively a mixture
of a gradient descent or in this case a gradient ascent on the log of this probability over state
space so this inherits from something called the Helmholtz decomposition this amplitude of the
random fluctuations determines the degree to which I'm hill climbing this Q here denotes
circuitous or solenoidal flow around probability gradients I'm going to unpack that for you in
the next slide but the key point to take from this is if things exist in particular those things
with Markov blankets because to have a thing you have to have a Markov blanket then we can write
down this kind of equation and this kind of equation essentially means you are doing a gradient
flow or gradient ascent or descent on some quantity that is related to the probability
of me being in a particular state so for those people not familiar with the Fokker-Planck equation
I just want to illustrate that imagine that I have a piece of ink and I'm dropping it
into some solvent say glass of water and what I would expect to happen normally is that the ink
molecules would dissipate due to the random fluctuations and distribute themselves over the
entire volume of the solvent that's not the kind of system that we're interested in here though
because we just said these systems gather themselves up together and are restricted to their attracting
set or the pullback attractor so this is what this kind of system would look like is it would look
as if it was endowed with some capacity to do inverse diffusion to actually diffuse up
concentration gradients and that's exactly what this equation says what it's saying is that
the flow in order for this attracting set to be realized to attain this non-equilibrium
steady state has to have two components one it has to climb the gradients of the probability
not strictly speaking the log probability of the kinds of states it is found in
and this q-term here is this circular flow around the iso probability
that it contours basic structure that we're going to predicate the arguments on
what I want to do with this slide is just convince you or at least provide some sort of
graphical evidence that that formalism that we've just briefly rehearsed underwrites nearly
all of physics as we know it so special cases of this you will have done at school so when the
amplitude of those random fluctuations on the flow goes to zero we arrive at conservative
systems of the sort that would be useful for describing massive bodies, gravitation,
Newtonian laws, Lagrangian mechanics where it's all about this circular flow hence the
planets revolving around the sun and the moon around the earth we can look at the other
special case where we eliminate the solenoid flow or at least increase the amplitude of random
fluctuations and then what we have is a mechanics that applies to fluctuating systems basically
fluctuation dissipation theorem and all of statistical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics
with the usual constants and proportionality here Belsman's constant and all the things you've
done about entropy and enthalpy again at school and we can make another move we can just say
somewhat arbitrarily although there are good reasons for doing it we can just express that
non-equilibrium steady state density as the product of two complex roots and if we do that
and follow it through we get quantum physics and this is actually just a restatement of that
Boca Planck equation that we saw earlier on however if you remember the reason we're doing this
is to see what are the implications of having a Markov blanket and this is where it starts to
get more interesting from our perspective so there's another kind of physics out there that is
