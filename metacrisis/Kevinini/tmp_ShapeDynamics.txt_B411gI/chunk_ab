curvature radius of your space-time, of your space-time curvature has to be much smaller
than the typical, has to be much larger than the typical size of the system that you use
to explore space-time.
And something similar has to happen here, interestingly the antibody problem that I introduced
at the beginning already exhibits something analogous.
So if I take the antibody problem I can do something very similar to what I did, to what
I, what I, there is a similar description, what I showed you for three bodies works for
arbitrarily large n's.
And there will be, there will, in a generic solution there will be a time where all particles
strongly interact but then if you are, if you satisfy the energy-zero condition then
the system will split up and will form local clusters and most of these clusters will, after
a long time, contain just two particles, so they will form Kepler pairs, most of them.
And then these Kepler pairs, they provide you because they have, they become more and
more isolated, they fly apart, they provide you a local clock because they have an orbital
period, a year and a similar major axis, an astronomical unit and so they, you have clocks
and rods and the direction in a certain frame of reference, provided for free in each solution
and if I describe the dynamics of the, of the nearby particles in terms of the clocks
and rods of this, they look like approximately inertial motion described in these units here.
But of course, it's just a change of units if I'm an inhabitant of that solar system,
I use a different year, I use a different astronomical unit, but the same dynamical
law describes their point of view and so on, that goes all over.
So it looks like, here I have not put in Newtonian at any stage, I have described the
dynamics completely in terms of the change of shape of the system, of the relations within
the system, the dimensionless relations within the system, just the angles between particles.
And yet I still see at the late stages of evolution, I still see something that looks
like a Galilean space-time coming out of that, in my solutions, if I make an appropriate
choice of clocks and rods, of physical subsystems and if I use them as clocks and rods.
How do you know what the solutions look like?
It's actually an interesting, there is a lot of mathematical physics work from the 60s
and 70s that explored energy, well positive and energy zero solutions to the, to the
end body problem.
And actually the only difference, so I, the strongest statements hold for the energy zero
case, but the only difference between positive and zero energy is that in positive energy,
you can have something that looks like a freeze out of shape, basically all particles, there
can be enough kinetic energy and expansion of the system just flies apart and goes into
a constant shape and that, and just seems to stop the evolution, just seems to converge
to a point in shape space.
Yes, okay, there are, this is actually a good point, the, these, these long term stable
configurations, they are actually critical points of this shape potential, so it turns
out that scale is completely irrelevant for determining what the, what these long term
stable configurations are, because if you're at a critical point of that, for a long time
you will get periodic motion near, near one of these critical points and then, and then
looking on global conditions, actually there, there is more to that story, I can, I, I can
say that, I can talk about that afterwards, effectively it's, it's a nice thing, this
Hamiltonian has a particular time dependence like the York Hamiltonian does for the closed
case in GR, and this time dependence effectively introduces a friction term into the equations
of motion, and so you have relaxation into this equilibria, but then this, but then some
of the, some of this equilibria are not stable, so there, there, if you're close to that,
if you're close to, to, to a critical point of this potential, it will stay there for
a very long time, but then eventually friction will set in and you will start to slide down
in a deeper, into a deeper region of the shape potential, and then you get trapped into
a local minimum, and actually there are no local minima, they're only saddle points and
global maxima, so, or these steep valleys which are, when two part, when at least two
particles come very close together, so the other part of the illusion of space time is
has to do with the emergence of units, and so about this thing that is here, we have
good indications for full GR how to do, how to do these things in, in term, in shape dynamics,
for this part I, I only have toy models, I only have particle toy models that illustrate
what I want to do here. So, the question is, if I start out like Sean was motivating with
a completely scale invariant and dimensionless description of my system, as I did on, on
the previous slide, then I have to explain why is the description in terms of units so
useful, I mean why is the mention in analysis, one of the most useful things in physics,
and the operational answer to that is, well you have to evolve quantum system to get quantum
matter together with conformal geometry, well for GR that's a conjecture, for the antibody
problem I can show you roughly, of course and once that I cannot show you the details,
there is a Schrodinger equation that is a natural operator ordering choice for this
Hamiltonian here, that I have there and it's a self-adjoint, it is a nice Hamiltonian, something
that you would accept as a Hamiltonian, and then you look at the, at the time evolution
of this wave function, and it turns out that if you, if certain conditions are satisfied,
then at late times the system will develop atoms with an effective mass, so closed two
body bound systems, and with an effective coupling constant, and this effective mass
and effective coupling constant are derived from the state of the rest of the universe,
through the energy zero condition that is preserved by this Hamiltonian, but of course
I don't know, when I look at this Hamiltonian, I have not, I have defined the system to be
that, I have not defined the system to be Newtonian, yes also in zero angular momentum,
yes, but then of course I can use the, I can use once these atoms pop up, I can use
the effective mass to define my kilogram, I can use the Bohr radius of these effective
atoms to define my meter, I can use the Rittberg constant to define a second and so on, so I
have, and in a very similar way, I mean actually in exactly the same way, just that you have
now, just that you have now Kepler pairs that all look the same, you don't have to make
a change of units, you don't have to change your astronomical unit and definition of year
when you go from here to here, because they are now the same, or effectively the same,
we have a spontaneous emergence of a Galilean spacetime in that, in that system, so this
is how the evolution, how the illusion of spacetime is appears and this is Julian Barber
likes this sentence, the props that hold up spacetime, how they pop out, so if I'm, if
I could do it with all rigor, then I would have a picture in which I have atoms forming on my
conformal geometry, I evolve quantum matter together with conformal geometry, these atoms would
give me a local scale, because they have a local Bohr radius, so I can define a local scale,
this is what I indicated by these arrows here, that I know how large, how much distance there is,
that the unit distance in the main directions that I have here, and then the evolution also gives me
a unit of duration, of duration that I have between, so I can from this succession of the
evolution of geometry with matter, I can deduce local scale and local duration from that and
generate the illusion of a spacetime from within, from within the solution itself, so that's what
I wanted to talk about here, that's just a summary, and here is one of the, that's an
Einstein quote of his autobiography, and it illustrates this point that is, this relational
point that is missing in the construction of GR, and that, that in particular Julian Barber has
been taking very seriously and motivated us and a couple of other people to work on this, so thank
you for your attention.
