1. The illusion of spacetime is an emergent phenomenon from the evolution of quantum matter interacting with conformal geometry.
   
2. In a scale-invariant and dimensionless framework, one might question the utility of units in physics. However, units are essential when dealing with quantum systems that evolve over time.

3. To illustrate this, Carroll presents a toy model where quantum particles evolve under a specific Hamiltonian to form atoms with effective mass and coupling constants. These effective quantities derive from the state of the universe and the energy zero condition of the Hamiltonian.

4. Once atoms form, one can define units such as meters, kilograms, and seconds based on the properties of these atoms, effectively creating a Galilean spacetime within the system. This is because the atoms behave like Kepler pairs, and their properties are consistent regardless of where they are in the universe.

5. The emergence of spacetime units from the evolution of quantum matter and geometry provides a local scale and duration, thus generating the perception of spacetime from within the solution itself.

6. Julian Barber's work emphasizes the relational nature of spacetime, which is a key aspect missing in the construction of General Relativity (GR). This relational approach motivates ongoing research into alternative formulations of GR that could potentially offer a more fundamental understanding of spacetime and its units.

7. Carroll concludes by emphasizing the importance of this relational perspective, as encapsulated by Einstein's quote from his autobiography, and encourages further exploration into these ideas.
