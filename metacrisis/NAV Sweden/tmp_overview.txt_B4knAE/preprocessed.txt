5. The message emphasizes the importance of perceiving each other in this moment of being alive, recognizing disorientation as a challenge but also as an opportunity for learning and growth.

6. The speaker points out the dysfunctional state of the world, where sociopaths appear to be in control, but also highlights the potential for invisible magic and grace to make things happen.

7. They suggest that the simple act of caring for babies and changing with the seasons can lead to a more sophisticated understanding of life, and that by shifting our behavior, we can prepare for the future without being dominated by the system of power.

8. The speaker encourages building relationships, being in care, and anchoring ourselves and others in a time of collapse, inviting people to join in this journey, to learn from the past, and to change the initial moment of that future that has already begun.

In essence, the speaker is praising the unique atmosphere at Nav, encouraging collective action, and advocating for a shift in consciousness and behavior to face the challenges of our time with hope and resilience.

Checking NAV Sweden/＂Learning to be in the world＂ Dinner&Talk @NAV with Nora Bateson & Daniel Schmachtenberger  HD1080p.txt
 The conversation revolved around the concept of parenting and its impact on a child's perception of their importance, as experienced by one individual whose father approached parenting with curiosity and openness to different perspectives. This approach allowed the child to feel significant and heard, which had a profound effect on their development.

The discussion also touched upon the influence parents have on shaping their children's futures, including the challenges of preparing children for jobs that may not exist by the time they are ready to enter the workforce. The importance of adaptability and learning in a rapidly changing world was highlighted.

A notable point in the conversation was the effectiveness of warm data work as a teaching method, which involves engaging in simple conversations that help individuals see things from multiple perspectives and synthesize new understandings.

The group announced an upcoming event—a warm data lab on learning, scheduled for the 26th, which would be an opportunity to explore and discuss the concept of learning within the context of a changing world. The participants expressed their gratitude for the open conversation and the chance to connect with each other, and they indicated their willingness to stay and continue discussions.

The hosts, Daniel and Ana, along with Yohanna for providing the dinner venue, were thanked for organizing the event. The evening was seen as a success, with attendees finding it both useful and interesting.
