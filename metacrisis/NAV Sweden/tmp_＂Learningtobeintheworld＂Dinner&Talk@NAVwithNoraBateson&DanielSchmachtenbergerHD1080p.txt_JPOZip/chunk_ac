those first moments of going back into the classroom it was like
everything beautiful in the world just ran out of the room they all the subjects were divided
and math was no longer fun I was like writing papers for my father's college classes on how
to think in base five and and because he was teaching university classes on perception so he
was just going to get his nine-year-old daughter to write a paper on how to think in base five
perfectly reasonable right and then I went into you know ninth grade math and
I was like this is horrible this isn't fun this isn't groovy this is I think I barely got by with a
C and I never wanted to do math again but um I had this experience of what it could be
what education could be and so when I had kids I took them out of school we were moving from
California to Vancouver Canada and so my California legal world kind of thought I was going to
Canada and the Canadian world thought we were still moving and at that point my husband their
father at the time he's still their father my husband at the time their father um and we just
were like okay let's go and so we essentially stole our children from the system but I imagine
this might sound a little radical to you um we stole our children and we went on this fantastic
adventure it was an incredible privilege we went down into South America and we went and we
learned another we went to a language class in Cusco Spanish intro to Spanish with just the family
so it was intergenerational language learning and we were all at the beginning
and so we got to see how each other learned that was just fascinating so my kids could see
you know ways in which I was struggling and I could ask them for help and they they could see
you know my husband get irritated that some you know it was really a very interesting experiment
what year what year that would have been 2005 or six yeah why it just um I just think it's fun
hearing that part of the story when I finished my uh undergrad I took a one-way plane ticket to
Peru and landed in Cusco and started with a weak immersion class and uh what year that would have
been 2001 so not all of our part that would have been a funny coincidence yeah um so so we
pulled the kids out of school for six months that was the idea and um when we we we did an hour of
reading and an hour of writing they could write whatever they wanted and I had these little math
workbooks I did an hour of math with them every once in a while not every day well when we got back
I couldn't put them back in the school because they were two years ahead
and I wasn't even remotely trying to get them ahead actually I was just we were just traveling and
and having this amazing trip but I just wanted to be sure that I could you know that we weren't
losing any ground and you know I couldn't put them back in and then we had another problem
so we thought well okay uh what we need to do is stall so we took another six months to finish
out the school here and I I actually hired a tutor because I didn't have any more time to do this
it takes a lot of time to be that person and so this tutor was a former teacher who had gotten
glaucoma and gone blind and so he had a blind tutor and he the the project was just spend the next
six months reading a few Shakespeare plays so they went line by line through Macbeth through
mid-summer night's dream through Richard the third and oops that accidentally made it much worse
because in fact they and then they learned poetry they learned history they learned psychology
they learned about all this different stuff and it was actually a very systemic education
they were they were comparing the the great soliloquies with famous speeches by Martin Luther King
or by Hitler or by right they were comparing soliloquies in Shakespeare with with with historical
figures um and then I put them back in school as I was thinking about this I was talking to my
daughter who's now 27 and I and she said to me the other day she and her husband to be have been
reading parenting books and she's like every single one of them is about how your child is going to be
well adjusted what if you don't want your child to be well adjusted to a sick society right what if
the systems we're in are destroying the possibility of their future and being well adjusted to them
only makes that happen how do you get your child unadjusted to this is the question she said the
one regret that she had was that we stopped homeschooling but it was her that begged for it she
longed longed for the tv experience of the prom dress and the lockers and the boyfriends and the
gossip and the parties and the you know this ridiculous thing she had seen in hollywood
which of course turned out to be soul crunching you know bullying mind dividing you know
welcome to the world of reductionism mess
that's kind of what happened at my house
uh there's so many interesting directions that like to go with it um you'd mention briefly
something that we talked about on our walk of if you were a parent in Kiev 10 years ago uh who
was progressive in thinking about the future of the world and thinking about how to parent
thoughtfully and just my kid go to wall door for Montessori or do i unschool you probably
weren't thinking about preparing them for eminent war because that didn't seem like
uh a likely reality because we haven't had that in a long time and i think
when you study the history of civilizational collapse when the roman empire fell or the
ottoman empire fell to the my end of the egyptian they fall after having been in place for so long
that the memory of collapse isn't even in anyone's memory it just feels like myth so it feels like
of course this will be here forever and um so if you knew that was going to happen
how would you prepare your kids is a really interesting question but if you don't know
if it's going to happen through like in syria a drought where all the subsistence farmers have
to move somewhere else and then they have to try to find jobs in a city where there aren't enough
jobs it leads to factionizing and resource war versus it actually means shelling is going to start
versus how do you prepare kids for a world that you can't anticipate what the world is
you have to prepare them for the capacity to notice what is happening that might be salient
and then to figure out what capacities might be relevant that they don't currently have
and then how to rapidly develop them and how to keep doing that which is a really interesting
thing to try to prepare somebody for and yet i would say like Kiev as a canary and a coal mine
is true for everybody currently because the an educational system is embedded inside of a
civilizational system where the civilization functions a certain way so you are training kids
to grow up and be able to fulfill the functions of a society and the workforce independent of
civilizational collapse uh technological unemployment itself portends this changing
in the lives of the next generation of every everybody because you were saying the kid asks
why should i be good at math and it's a harder question to answer obviously it was so important
to be trained in the abacus until it wasn't right and then the calculator changes what we think and
the so important to be trained in the slide rule or the compass and then the gps does anyone
need to know about maps or compasses or and then you're like well we're becoming technologically
dependent but we've always been technologically dependent just earlier technologies you take
away early people stone tools and they're dead right and the unique thing about humans is that
we were not selected for based on the capacity of our bodies the human body in every environment
without tools dies what we were selected for was the capacity to do this recursive abstraction
and make tools and do division of labor and coordination so the unit of selection for sapiens
is a coordinating group with its coordination protocols and its full tech stack because
a single person with a spear can't hunt a mastodon and a bunch of people without spears can't
either right it's a bunch of people with spears and their coordination that can and so it's like
from the beginning what was actually selected for in humans was a civilizational complex and
so then like we don't train people at spear throwing even though throughout all of human
history is the most important skill and of course if we lose some of the current tech stack older
stuff might become a relevant skill but then in the presence of
an AI is different than every tech we've ever had right because previously we figured out
a capacity we wanted and developed a tool for it AI has the ability to not just do a capacity we
wanted to do but to figure out all of the other capacities and develop them faster than we can
become aware of it so you think about math GPT-3 already has which is an open language model that
open AI built that anybody can go access you can just speak to it in natural language it
understands and does stuff and so you can say GPT-3 write me a research paper that cites real
research on why vaccines are dangerous or why vaccines are safe or whatever it is and it'll
generate that output and so you can also say not just solve this math problem for me but
figure out what math is even relevant to solve this real world problem and just give me the
answer to the real world problem so then there's this huge question of in and now this relates
back to the tradition versus progress the traditional wisdom becomes less relevant the faster the rate
of change in the actual world happens and the so if you look at say highly conserved traditions
in indigenous cultures their technological rate of change is quite slow so the life of a great
grandparent and the life of the great great grandchild were much more similar and obviously
we've been dealing with post-industrial revolution these radical changes where what it means to be
adaptive is a completely different world system new tools the singularity is when a new tool happens
that you can't be adaptive without like cell phones and whatever there's a the society has to
completely adjust to a whole set of capacities are irrelevant and a whole new set are required
when you start getting many of those within a single generation and when you start getting
them faster than anyone can adapt what does that world look like and specifically
how do you raise kids how do you do education in a world where robotics and AI are going to
obsolete all the jobs almost all the jobs and can do most everything that we would typically
train a human to do better than humans can you have to say fuck what what is the when
when humans providing a utility to society through some specialist trained task is not
relevant anymore because you can make robots and AI that do almost everything better than humans do
what is the purpose of human life and that's either terrifying if you don't change some
deep things because it ends up looking like a radical unemployed underclass and you know obsolescence
or it looks like something really incredible where those jobs that robotics and AI can do better
are the ones that you have to pay people to do because they don't want to do you have to
extrinsically incent them because the things that were intrinsically motivated to do
involve novelty and connection which are the things that the robotics and AI don't do as well
and so then to get to say all right well what would it look like to have a civilization system and
an education system that had the resources to really train people to the thing that they're
intrinsically motivated to anyways just a few thoughts that come to mind i'm reminded of this
friend of mine and she had a good friend who entered a beauty pageant and you know how in the
beauty pageant they have the gown thing and then they have the bikini thing and then they have to
talk right there's some interview well she was the first person to be in the interview part
and they asked her the question if you were a parent what would you teach your child but she
misheard it and what she heard was if you were a parent what would you teach your child and so
she made the response it's probably the best parenting advice ever which is i would teach them
how to catch worms and how to fly and you know actually it's pretty good
because in a way that is what we need to do is be careful about the flexibility of that
and and the other thing is it's not just parent child i really want to hold that in this room
that when we're talking intergenerational we're also talking the elders i'm i'm right now living
three generations in the house and it's um let me tell you it's not easy actually and it's it's
not easy because all of us have been trained to be in a world in which our education our profession
our identity has been about our individual success not being a burden not needing each other we
have been taught to not need each other and successful parenting is making a child that
doesn't need you okay so my mother is also suffering from the same epistemological glitch
and she feels as a 94 year old that she shouldn't need me to take care of her that she is a burden
if uh if she needs me um but this is a fantastic ripoff because since she's been in my house
i have learned more about how to live and incidentally how i don't want to live okay
because this is something that our parents can teach us not just how to live and what wisdom
they have but also what we definitely don't want to repeat and there it is that's the continuity
and the discontinuity and i am so grateful for the ways in which she has taught me not to live
um and as she gets ready to leave her body um what i'm doing with my days right now
when i tend her wounds and i make her food it's a lot of work you know um
is i'm actually making a home for her
inside me
for when she leaves her body
that's what i'm doing it looks like i'm making a home for her in my house
but when she goes she doesn't go does she she's still living in me what room is she living in
a room of resentment
how do i tend that habitation and and then when i start to do that i'm also paying attention
like how are my kids doing with this what's sort of a what's sort of a house am i inhabiting inside
their world um and paying attention to what's happening in this intergenerational fabric
because i cannot carry with me into this uncertain future the the burden okay there's the burden
the burden of that resentment that i have i can't bring it with me i don't have it i can't right now
we have other things to do so anything i can do between now and the time she leaves her body
to tend that and i don't really know what that means nobody ever taught me how to do that i don't
know what the heck that means but it's really important work for how how i go on when she's gone
something that you said that brings up a a couple of thoughts that i find really interesting i
why in the wealthy industrialized world the nuclear family home is the almost
universal default setting when uh intergenerational family was historically for a very long time
and for the majority of human history and are what were genetically adapted to a tribe was
and it's really interesting to get that for the entirety of human history
the nobody ever lived outside of a band or a tribe and so we actually have evolved in our
genetically fit for um very very deep dependence and interconnection with about that many people
right 50 to 150 type people um and then it's so interesting how all the how many intentional
community projects fail and the default setting goes back to a nuclear family and one way of
looking at it is you know sartre said hell is other people and that having to compromise on
anything how the house is decorated the cleanliness of it who has the chores what's on tv anything
is just such a pain in the ass we if we have the optionality we go to not having to deal with those
things but then everybody is lonely and they watch other people on tv and they look at other
people on social media and they're on ubiquitous antidepressants and yet still don't want to
actually deal with the pain in the ass of other people and the only people that they will live
with is where the bonding energy of sex holds them together or the progeny the out the byproduct of
sex and that's what the nuclear family is like anything less than the bonding energy of sex or
children is not enough bonding energy to deal with how much we don't want to have to deal with
other people and yet ubiquitous depression anxiety loneliness meaningless and this lack of connection
happens and it's it's fascinating because we have to actually get over that and it's obviously a very
difficult thing to get over um and especially to get over it without getting caught back in these
old oppressive versions of it so that to me is the the movement here of of how we're doing
intergenerational living but we're not doing it in the way it got done before because that
became oppressive in a bad way um yeah and and i'm thinking about how these these learnings
of what world we live in are are in the little the little bits of every day so for me this is
always about like who's going to do the dishes but this is a serious evolutionary question
it could be that the entire question of whether or not our species makes it is based on who's
going to do the dishes i mean i'm actually only kind of kidding because we cannot have community
until we can commune period we can't all these lovely projects of how to create sustainability
and this and that and how to remodel the world we can't do that if we can't need each other and be
needed it's it's not going to happen like there's there's no amount of modeling and and working
toward making a rule set that we're going to live within if we can't commune um and so
so we were talking about this earlier the dishes so in a lot of households what you get is you get
a chore wheel or you get a you know um who's going to do what when community you know intentional
communities are famous for this this sort of articulation of how everyone's going to
produce their responsibility and participate in the things that have to get done the toilets have
