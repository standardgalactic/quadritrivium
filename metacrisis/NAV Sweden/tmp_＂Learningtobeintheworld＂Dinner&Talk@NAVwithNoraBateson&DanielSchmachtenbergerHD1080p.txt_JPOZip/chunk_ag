know you get caught in the matrix and um so he was always seeking various experiences and possible
relationship with those potential moments where you get a teeny peak outside the epistemological
box right talking to people from other cultures um various kinds of of you know he worked with
people with mental health issues because they were able to perceive the world differently talking to
children in being in relationship with animals and other organisms um trance um various kinds of
psychedelics and any chance he could get to be get a tiny little peak outside the way that
so many ideas have formed around each other that we don't even know how we're holding them stuck
together um and so as a child he would he would play i mean he was the agenda was not
the agenda was what's she gonna say what's what's what can we find here because i don't know what
world she's seeing and this is a great opportunity to get another viewpoint and i i loved that i felt
like oh boy i am important and um and i was important and that was such a great thing to be at the
table with all these important people and be seven years old and know that i had something that was
important too yeah i mean it's interesting parents can definitely raise particularly
parents of lineages of success can raise their kids with a thought of their importance that is
massively oppressive right but it's also interesting the studies done in the u.s where uh teachers were
told that a group of kids that were moving into the class from another school that had all been
failing were a students and because they wrongly believed they were a students they treated them
differently and the kids became a students um and it's interesting how much the sense of the
meaningfulness of the kids life that the people facilitating them bring in can actually reflect
in who they become so recognizing we're probably at time and on the topic of your dad giving the
sense of that you were important i uh i think that your warm data work is one of the best second
simplicity um teaching methods i've ever come across because when you're describing it to people
like conversations about very mundane things uh where you're just changing context they don't
get that what you're actually doing is teaching people how to see through lots of different
perspectives synthesize those perspectives um so i'm really happy to get to have this little
dinner time with everybody here tonight i don't live in the area norah lives in the area and i
was just thinking about all the topics especially if anybody here our parents are thinking about
being parents that we opened up some of which are huge like yeah what are you gonna is Stockholm
going to be key of at some point and um is the whole world going to go through these massive
transitions and are you raising your kids to perform a job that won't exist by the time they do and
on and on and to not leave people there i was asking her at the break if she would offer some
kind of warm data process on learning and she said it's already booked and so i thought that'd be a
good thing to bring up before we close thank you uh yeah so the 26th we're gonna be doing a warm
data lab here in this very room um and i think we should probably do it on learning what is learning
in a changing world october yeah yeah just in a few days will you be gone by then darn um
and yeah thank you so much this was so much fun thank you this was yeah uh we didn't know
what we were gonna talk about just open conversation and we actually don't we maybe only had three
conversations ever so we're just getting to know each other and this is a fun it and thanks everybody
also for coming i hope something was useful interesting we're gonna hang out and be available
to talk so we're here for a bit yes and thanks and to the people thanks who hosted this daniel
