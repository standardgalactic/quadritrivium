to get clean the food has to get made the dishes have to get done etc um and we had a this retreat
recently at at my house with these people that have been doing warm data with me and we had this
moment where it was like well let's make the chore wheel like no what if we just don't
what if we actually just leave that to the need to pay attention to the relationships
in the group 40 people in a group that's a lot of dishes
so what if we just did that and um it because I had been you know with my own kids thinking about
well if I teach them that it's important to do the dishes on Wednesday I have taught them to look
at this abstracted version of what makes responsibility if I take the time to teach them
to pay attention to the relationships in the room who needs to do the dishes tonight is not
really about whether it's Wednesday it's about who's tired it's about who's busy it's about who's
upset who did you know there's a whole lot of information in the room about this but we don't
teach our children to pay attention to that relational information we teach them that Wednesday
Wednesday is the day that they do the dishes and that is an obscuring now that teaching is not
easily produced this was something my dad did with me all the time where he would articulate
okay so I'm making this decision because I'm looking at these relationships and so because
I'm looking at these relationships I think or I'm learning about but he did a lot of actually
vocalizing for me what he was learning the way he was seeing the way he was putting together
his response and that takes time it also takes mutual respect
yeah it's interesting the the structured rule set obviously isn't teaching them how to assess
the environment and to take responsibility and to communicate and but I'm gonna argue for it for a
moment the it's a relationship between virtue ethics utilitarian ethics and deontological
ethics in terms of the philosophical way to think of it and I never could make a good argument for
deontological ethics i.e. rule-based systems at the best choices based on kind of rule-based
systems it just that seemed like what you do if you assume that everyone is too dumb to figure
shit out for themselves and otherwise you want to balance between virtue and utilitarian ethics
virtue ethics being what is intrinsically right regardless of what's going to come from it and
utilitarian ethics saying well let's think through what's going to come from it and try to make sure
we're thinking through cause and effect well and of course we can't think through it perfectly
so we have to also factor what just seems intrinsically right and balance those so
I was always down with the balance of virtue ethics and utilitarian ethics the the argument for
deontological ethics and the Jews actually make this argument quite well in the kind of Talmudic
tradition is that the system that you're describing of where your dad explained his choice making
process out loud so you were getting to get all of the nuance and context works at small scale
and works for people who got that level of development and evolutionarily humans in the
same way I said like right in the current context the default setting is nuclear families
before the plow the default setting was a sub Dunbar number tribe right and it would never
get bigger than the Dunbar number which is so fascinating right that as soon as it would get
roughly bigger than give or take 150 it would always cleave and so there was similarly something
that made that the stable state and a huge part of it was as soon as it gets bigger than that you
can't actually have a single conversation that everyone can participate in both because without
microphones you can't you just literally can't hear each other across a huge space you can't
track that many people to say is everyone pulling their share in the way that you can with 40 people
and you just literally can't take enough time to hear everybody's views back and forth with
a thousand people to decide what to do timely enough to decide what to do so if you got larger than
that number some people had to have their life subject to the choices that other people made
that they didn't get to have a say in and they're like not fuck that I'd rather go be part of a
smaller group where I get to say anything so it's so interesting and then we only started to get
larger groups when you we had populated so much that tribal warfare started to become ubiquitous
and in the presence of things like tribal warfare if another larger group is going to come
if another larger group is going to come attack us then a couple groups will unify for survival
purposes in which case will sacrifice some of that autonomy and freedom for security which we can see
has been a trend since but in very very large systems where we I can't actually make good choices
about something that involves six continent supply chains and something that involves
division of labor that has thousands or millions of people like I can't see all of it to factor and
internalize all of it so we subdivide it into categories and we make rules and so the rule
based system is the idea that you have people like judges and people like specialists who are way
way more uh spending all their life thinking about these issues and actually embedding some wisdom
into the rules so that people who don't understand all of that complexity and or where it's beyond
the complexity that anyone can understand can at least be able to participate with the system
and so how do you and yet we also know that as soon as the context changes the rules aren't right
anymore and we also know that those who get in the position to make them have their own vested
interests and corruption and blah blah blah so we can see why the rule based systems have actually
succeeded because of scale and so then a question of in societies that can't just move back to small
scale because at a tribal scale you can't produce your own laptops and you're not going to move off
of laptops and still be relevant in the direction of the future and you have to have six continent
supply chains but you cannot possibly see all the effects how do you do very how do you do the
very high context choice making thing not have rules and yet be able to factor that scale i would
say this is one of the huge questions we have to face of how do we get tribal level bonding
beyond the tribe and actually at a fully global scale i think that this is what we're
having this conversation really about because it seems to me that the
the learning and the habit of that kind of perception starts at home
and if you don't have the habit of even trying that perception if you've already you know been
had the training wheels on the bicycle you know to say that you you're going to learn how to do
dishes because you're going to do them on wednesday right this is this is minutiae this is granular
stuff but the perceiving of systemic relational complex processes in the kitchen extend to the
possibility of being able to see them in other places at different you know scales in different
sizes and so i think for me this is where i feel like it's not the answer i don't think it's the
answer but what it is is this question of how are we going to allow these next generations to
actually perceive the world differently so they can respond differently so they can actually
help make it different in ways that actually i don't know that we can even generate the ideas for
because we're so deeply informed by the structures that we have been within
i have a couple thoughts on that but i think he said five minutes so is this should we wrap
two two more thoughts okay two more thoughts
so you're mentioning um when you were homeschooled how much further ahead you got when your kids
were homeschooled how much further ahead they got even though they didn't have and not just
even though but specifically because they didn't have formal curriculum that when
the kids were just reading Shakespeare they because it was a small environment with a tutor
and they got to ask questions which you can't do in a class of 30 people um why did he pick that word
and you get into etymology and then what is that reference and you get into the culture of that time
you get into history you get a much more curiosity driven system and the curiosity driven system means
people tend to become good at anything they really are fascinated by and love so when you get to have
a curiosity driven system the kids just become much more voracious learners and you get to have a
much more interconnected system where the kid isn't memorizing stuff they're learning stuff that is
directly interesting so they just naturally remember it um and you're saying what happens around
how we wash dishes and how we make choices is already that every kid is being homeschooled in
addition to being schooled based on however the parents are operating the kids are learning how
to be human based on that process so a thing that I find so interesting there's a um there's a paper
I found a couple years ago that if people are interested I will share in some uh maybe this
group here on a historical study of the statistical precursors of super genius was the name of the
article and so it was and we're not I'm not saying that this particular assessment of what a desirable
human is is the only um definition but it was specifically looking at polymathic super genius
people who contributed insights to fields that the specialists didn't across many many fields
long term and specifically it was also looking at the idea that we have much less of them
now than we did historically that Richard Feynman said he thought he would be the last generation
of great physicists and a lot of people have this assessment that there just have not been
profound breakthroughs in physics like there were you know him and you know pre that from from
kind of Newton on and some people say no that's not like one answer to why do we not have super
genius of the same level that we had during uh the enlightenment up through say modern physics
one answer is uh we do we just only appreciate it post-humansly one answer is we already got
all the easy stuff and now it's just too hard and it takes groups of people with AI and data
processing but there's actually a really good argument that we aren't developing people as
well as we're developed at the peak not the average but at the peak and there is an assessment
it's a very third real topic of why and the answer is that the super geniuses were almost all of the
result of aristocratic tutoring and this study was first found out in the west by Charles Sanders
Pierce the great arguably the greatest logician of the 20th century and the founder of semiotics
and he was trying to figure out why he was able to formalize all these fields better than the
specialists in the field what about his learning style made that happen so he looked at the super
geniuses of the past to see are there any statistical correlations he was trying to look at
anything from genetics to culture to unique aspects of childhood and the thing that really
popped out the most and then a hundred studies have found the same thing is that the people who
had that and you see this with Wittgenstein you see this with Newton there they were born into
aristocracy where they had exceptionally good tutors not a traditional educational system
and like one of the Dalai Lama is a great example right if you're the Dalai Lama the best lamas in
Tibet are tutoring you and not only all of Buddhist wisdom and history and politics and culture but
how to be a human and you're like yeah I mean I think anybody could be the Dalai Lama if they had that
tutoring but that's you can't democratize that right there's and you read meditations by Marcus
Aurelius and Marcus Aurelius was kind of you know the closest thing to a philosopher king maybe the
world has had and the whole first chapter he dedicates to his tutors and you're like why did he
do that and it's because when you're being raised in the height of the Hellenistic period to be the
emperor of Rome the top mathematician in all of Rome is your private tutor as a kid and the top poet
and the top historian and the top and you're like well and then this brings up a real interesting
question there's another study I saw on world-class mathematicians and it said what is in common to
be a world-class mathematician because it's so commonly been thought mathematical logic is IQ
is genetic and it doesn't actually correlate all that well the highest statistical correlator for
a world-class mathematician that they when we looked at people who were defined in a particular
way as world-class mathematician that they had in common is that they ended up studying with a
world-class mathematician while they were young and the insight is and you could say well they only
got that opportunity because they already had proclivity but that isn't actually kind of what
happens it's that accidentally they got into this environment you can't learn to think like a world-class
mathematician from a normal high school math teacher who doesn't think like that so you can learn how
to do math but you can't learn how to think math you can't learn how to think poetry from someone
who doesn't have that so then this science actually got very suppressed because it was
super third rail because when we wanted to get away from feudalism and the aristocracy and democratize
things you can't actually democratize this and or that was the idea it's like everyone can't have
mark israeli as his teachers right like one a very small number of people could and what's so
interesting is even when you come up to the Feynman topic von Neumann and Einstein both had
mathematician governesses as little kids where who was taking care of them at home were mathematicians
when they were little before they even went to public school and this thing holds and so then
I started to look at my childhood and Nora and I had this of like I was homeschooled and I didn't
have mark israeli as his tutors but I had my parents and their friends who were also thinkers
engaging with me in the topics I was interested in all the time which means that I had a curiosity
based and the thing that my parents said that was really good was whenever I'd ask questions that
they didn't know the answers to they'd say let's go figure it out and let's go find the books and
find the people that know it so I'm like okay I got a ad hoc version of aristocratic tutoring
that was enough for me to realize finding the right people to talk to was key so I started
seeking out great tutors and relatively young I started finding who were the top thinkers in
the world and topics and figuring out how to get them to be teachers and so something that I find
very inspiring about this is that most of the studies we have on human potential that do statistical
analysis it actually has nothing to do with human potential that whether we're talking about being
as compassionate and omniconsiderate as the Dalai Lama or as polymathic as von Neumann or
Charles Sanders Pierce those are developable independent of it's not a genetic thing that's
it's actually a developmental thing so then the question of could we actually make a society
where that was possible widely and there's a number of reasons why the answer in the past was
totally not except tribal culture is different but the reason why it hasn't been is if you have to
prepare most kids for the labor force because the society needs that it just doesn't make sense to
educate them that way and we can't afford putting that much investment into teachers to do that
thing and the people who are the smartest you can't have being teachers because you need them to
work in military manufacturing or in banking or in something like that but as soon as you start
thinking about technological obsolescence because of robotics and AI replacing us in the labor force
and replacing most of those other faculties can we have a much higher percentage of the total
human workforce be things like educators and therapists and being focused in human development
and get a radically higher level of training and then also restructure culture and family
and what you start to think about in terms of what we think is possible for average human
intelligence and average human psychological capacity I think can be radically reworked which
is something I find really inspiring me too I think it's rattling just radical and and possible
and just to close out I just wanted to say one thing that you touched on that's really important
is that these aptitudes and and this greatness thing whatever it is that you are learning to
soak into the grain of your wood okay the hum of your song that the thing that gets in in you
that thing is not just for study it actually plays into every single thing you do in a day
and so you know the fact that the governess is where mathematicians is really significant
because this ties into the artisans of the you know 700 900 year family
intergenerational studies is that the thing that's been getting learned is not just learned
while you're sitting there with the book with the teacher it's learned through all the whole day
it's in everything so there's that let's give you guys a break hang out have a conversation
generate some questions our thoughts responses con you know whatever comes up and then we'll
come back to this in how many minutes Daniel okay 20 minutes in 20 minutes
yeah 8 20 okay all right thank you
okay so um you're free to share some thoughts and perspectives and okay yeah so
um maybe do you want to say something you said something interesting in the break
yes you spoke a lot about teaching and being taught between generations parents children
and but
don't you think there is knowledge in in the newborn child how much should we teach
and what should we teach and why
yeah
I think the biggest opportunity to avoid catastrophe is to activate our innate capacity
to distinguish knowledge from opinion and I don't think that's an intellectual thing
or an academic thing I think it's I think it's something that every child
is capable of doing in the in the in the basic sense like I know I'm in this room with you
but if you ask me who used chemical weapons in Syria I don't know I have an opinion but
it's different I don't know that and given the fact that half the population of the world is now
