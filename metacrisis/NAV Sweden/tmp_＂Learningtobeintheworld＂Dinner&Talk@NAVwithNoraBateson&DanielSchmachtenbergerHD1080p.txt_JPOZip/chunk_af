and you're talking about justification there's almost like there's a the dominant narrative
of a culture is the apologism for the power structure of the culture it kind of has to be
right and so of course if you look at the like you look at the way that somebody like the gates
foundation up regulates Hans Rosling and Stephen Pinker because if you made a lot of money through
capitalism and tech the thinkers who say capitalism and tech makes everything better because they
cherry pick and like offering them and decontextualize someone who wants that as the apologism to
support their power system and say why their power system is good they'll up regulate those
thinkers so we wrote another paper called the where arguments come from and it's basically
the arguments that start to proliferate don't proliferate for no reason and they don't proliferate
just based on what is objectively true they proliferate because someone funded that research
and then someone funded spreading it because it supports and someone funded it who has the
resources to fund it because it supports whatever that dominant system is so yeah the earnestness
to want to know what is actually true and not just true but representative right because I can
have a truth on one side of a cherry picked argument it's the process of wanting to bias correct
I think and trying to deepen earnestness is really critical so that's what you're mentioning on
just if I this is totally unrelated but there was one thing that I didn't say to your thing that I
wanted to say because I think it's more important than what I said so far there's a famous saying
in activism that if you aren't outraged you aren't paying attention and that was like from the 60s
or 70s but obviously now with catastrophic risk you know people can say more like if you aren't
freaked the fuck out you aren't paying attention but of course like Rumi or Hafez would say if you
aren't in utter awe at the beauty of reality you aren't paying attention and that's true and
it's the truth of that that makes the other one what it is because if reality was not beautiful
it wasn't magnificent I wouldn't give a shit about if it's going to burn down
and so if I don't connect to the awe at the beauty of it enough my outrage or whatever will
actually mislead me you know and so there's an interesting thing like am I people will ask
you know how do I process all the stuff am I optimistic pessimistic I absolutely see
possibilities for political economies and infrastructures and cultures that work within
physics and work with what I believe human nature to be that are implementable in time that create
both a desirable and doable world so I do not think that we have fundamental impossibility issues
that by no means means we will figure it out right but my my motivation is not because
I believe we will like it's actually not from some optimism like that it's
um one I think it's very healthy for people to have experiences that simulate death so they're
comfortable with death their own death and being comfortable with your own death you and comfortable
with the reality of death I think is really important for facing the world effectively
because I'm not trying to prevent the inexorable in that way I'm not freaked out by impermanence
um so I think being comfortable with death is one thing I think being awed by the beauty of life is
the next thing and then realizing that the fear of the outrage are only because I actually love
reality otherwise I wouldn't care and then tracing the fear and the outrage and the blame back to
that love and then saying how do I be best in service to it not because I know for sure it'll
succeed but just because it's the only thing that makes sense like it's the only thing that has
coherence to it and then I mean you don't have little kids in your house but when I had little
kids in my house this is probably the most important thing you can model and it's both
it's it's this this recognition I mean I remember saying I'm really angry because I care right I'm
really concerned about this and and whatever it is it was it underneath it is the the awe for the
magnificence of life and you know it's very important that that be part of the experience
of the day whether it's the raspberries on your granola or the you know a poem or a thought or
just you know when you look across the room and you see somebody that you love and it's just
incredible how much you can love them or whatever it is but but that is the reason
for getting up tomorrow and keeping on doing it and working with everything you've got.
There is no other reason because there's certainly no promise of success whatever that is even the
non sociopathic kind so I think that that for me has been you know with my kids and and I got that
from my dad too he was he he would do this thing where he would look at a tree or you know whatever
it was a forest or a tide pool and see a crab or a sea anemone and just just beam and say oh
you know what a beauty that one is or look at this fella he would say this little you know but
it was like this delight in life that superseded everything else and then but it fuels everything
the reason for studying everything is not because you want to be the smartest person in the room
it's because it's incredible.
Yeah it brings up something because my my area of focus has to do with the intersection of all
the possible catastrophes people might think that I'm oriented to catastrophize just psychologically
or pessimistically disposed and I'm very positively disposed as a person
and so I focus on those things because they're real things not because I'm oriented in fact
a lot of the people who focus on catastrophic risk are because they catastrophize
right and it's actually it messes the field up because it makes it very hard for them to work
together because then they catastrophize their relationships with each other and think they
can't trust each other and it makes it very hard to coordinate and um and but I mostly want people
working in the space who just I'll tell a story I have a friend who is very good in catastrophic
risk work and who is almost always uh almost cripplingly anxious and I pointed something out to him
that if someone shares with him a new risk that they come up with the fluorinated surfactants
that pass planetary boundaries or this particular thing with what's going to happen with the
twitter acquisition or whatever it is instantly he starts to think about all the second third order
effects and how that will accelerate collapse and he and he buys it and if someone tells him a
possible solution to one of them instantly his mind looks for why it's wrong but his mind doesn't
look for why the catastrophe might not happen and so there is a which is why he's good at that thing
but also imbalanced right and I'm like no I want you to do both like I want you to look for why
the catastrophic forecast might be wrong but I and right and I want you to look at why the solution
might be wrong and and right but you have a in uneven distribution so I said we're gonna do a
strategy meeting but I'm gonna put you on MDMA first because I want you to see that a part of
your epistemology is just the result of your own state that was conditioned in childhood for some
reasons I didn't know about him but I'm like I want to put you in a state where you feel
because what happens is only when the story says dread is coming does it feel true for him because
of the dread that is carried inside probably because you know whenever dad walked in it felt
like dread and that's still embedded or something like that and I'm like when you're in a totally
different state what lands as true because ultimately we're less logically formal than we
think there's like a felt sense of truthiness that's a big part of our epistemology and so
put him on ecstasy he was rolling and happy and then I'm walking through catastrophic risks and
solutions and he was doing completely different logic and I had to point out to him he's doing
completely different logic and so of course I want I want people to try to notice their biases and
correct them think through the same thing from a lot of different epistemologies and a lot of
different states and a lot of different perspectives but ultimately it's not
not some kind of negativity or catastrophic or pessimistic bias that has me focus on this it's
the love of life that wants to protect it so wants to understand what to protect
and how to be effective at that but there's like yeah it's actually an affirmation of beauty that
is at the source of it so I thought I'd say that I'm coming back to this attention question
um because uh you know the doom porn okay so so there's lots of people who talk about the
way that we have been talking about the metacrisis as this kind of super exciting doom porn and the
more you talk about it like the kind of more like oh it gets it's like you know and it can get addictive
um but you know I remember whatever it was when I was a kid growing up we were having
conversations at the dinner table that were not so dissimilar to the one we're having tonight
what are we gonna do etc I mean these conversations are not new
and there was the sense that oh if we could just get people afraid they would respond
they would we did a good job at that yeah and they didn't do anything well no they did what
well hold on let me finish yeah so the the the idea being that the opposite of the numbness
would be fear and pain if they could feel the pain or they could feel the fear they would respond
but what I'm hoping you're hearing is that in in fact the opposite of that numbness is sensitivity
and the sensitivity is got to be more dimensional than fear and pain it must include beauty and
curiosity it has to include remorse and it has to include humor it has to include lots of different
textures of sensitivity lots of flavors of ideas lots of kinds of relationships to explore all of
those in and that is what allows for a kind of ecology of sensitivity that that I think is that
attention that you're speaking to that's really important so I think it's innate it is there
it is there but it can get grooved in to various habits scripts tones of what's the tone of the
environmental movement yeah you you know what the tone of the environmental movement is right
there's a tone what's the tone of the gender activist space there's a tone and to to expand
those tonalities into much more multi tonal spaces is I think part of increasing that sensitivity
with you drive fear or anger a few things can happen one is you can desensitize people
right and everybody just goes numb and the other thing that you do is drive war and drive
scared radical actions and so one of the things that I want people to think about the most is in
whatever project you're campaigning for you communicate about it in a way that you think
will appeal to a particular demographic to make sure we really stop spraying the neonicotinoid
pesticides or deal with the climate change thing or deal with the abortion rights thing or whatever
the thing is but if you don't think enough about how that communication will affect the people who
don't agree and what the blowback of that will be then you're producing not just the immediate
movement forward of coalescing those who are going to respond you're also producing blowback
of other people who are not inert right who are political actors who disagree who feel
scared who feel what you're doing is endangering something that they care about and then they
employ some more powerful technologies and so then you just drive an arms race and the arms
race ends up having more consequence than the issue itself did right the degree of polarization
the break of the social contract the break of democracy in the process so just one very simple
practical thing in any kind of activism is think about the people that your message doesn't appeal
to and think about why it doesn't and how to include them in it and the blowback of the message
right and if you aren't doing that it's like a strategy 101 is not even being factored and
in order to do that you actually have to understand that perspective better
in order to do that you'll realize that the issue complexities and you realize that the strategy
you're pushing not just the messaging is the wrong strategy there's partial things right to it
but the things that why they don't like it and are pushing back are also real things that have to
be factored into the strategy the way we talk about this sometimes is as an ecology of communication
that everything you're saying is landing in an ecology how's it landing what is it allowing to
grow what is it prohibiting from growing what is it what is going to come out of this thing that
you are putting in the communication context and and incidentally this is true certainly if
you're a politician or an activist and it's also true in your house and attention to that ecology
of communication with your partner with your kids with your aging parents whoever you're speaking
with or in communion with is going to be responding to that what responses have you left open
which ones have you closed so this idea of i'm just going to say what i think and i'm not responsible
for the way it makes you feel is a mess actually that is a mess and and so this recognition that
there is this not only first order of i'm going to teach my kid to do the dishes so they're going
to do it on wednesday but also now i have just actually created a form of communication around
what it is to be responsible that dislocates responsibility and that was the second order
thing that i accidentally taught right so this ecology of communication i think is running through
everything we're talking about and it has to do with the thing we started with which is
what world are you perceiving and how are you going to respond to it the i'm not responsible
for how you feel snowflake i'm going to say what the fuck i want to say and you can deal with it
is a mess but the other side which is how you feel should completely control what i say and
that i'm not going to say anything that's going to ruffle any feathers is a total mess
and so there's a dialectic and it's very easy to polarize that dialectic rather than synthesize
it right to say because one side expressed in extreme sound so ridiculous i'm going to take
the other extreme yeah as opposed to there is a partial truth in each side of this dialectic so
should i not say anything that bothers anyone no do i care about the effect that i have on
other people and do i not want to have an effect that might harden them into their positions further
that's also true right so one very simple principle i would say is any value that you care about look
at the opposing value right ecclesiastes there's a time to kill and it's time to heal and to sew and
to reap well how do you know what time it is there's a there's a discernment that is a there's a
presence and a discernment that is a higher order value than either of those other values it says
how to navigate that dialectic so if you take whatever your belief on a topic is as the thesis
then say who is who are the smartest people i can find who really disagree with me on this
find the antithesis see if you can understand their reasoning really deeply deeply enough that you
can express it and they don't need to correct you and then see how it changes your position and if
there is a synthesis that is a higher order insight that contains elements of both of those so on
values seek the values dialectic well it's about personal freedom well it's also about collective
responsibility it's about the value of the traditions that have served us it's about the
progress into the new world right find whatever the value is seek the opposing value see how they
exist in a dynamic tension find the proposition find the anti proposition find the synthesis
it's amazing how something that simple can guide so much and sometimes the thing you're looking for
is in another context um i i have found so often that i'm just asking the wrong question
and that when there is a polarity like that that if you ask a question that's in another context
the polarity undoes itself most of the time in order to really hold a polarity it requires
a reductionism it requires a decontextualization the more context you add the more that polarity
is going to dissolve um and and then it becomes oh well what question actually were we working on
so it can be a real distraction to think you know if the question is how am i going to get
my kid through fifth grade i have to get him to be you know get good grades and be a good good kid
uh that's a very different question then how am i going to support my kid to figure out how to be
in a world that's really difficult right now and the two are probably the same question
probably one of the reasons your fifth grader is struggling is because they're struggling
with things that are floating around in the in the sphere of shared information in the common
sense if you know beginning to show your kids that you are an advocate for them that together
we're going to walk into this unknown future makes it a lot easier to sit through fifth grade
what you said just reminded me of a couple things um that my parents did that i think are really cool
that they held as like important principles of parenting teaching one was um my dad was really
into asking kids what do you think happens to consciousness after death and questions around
free will and questions that no person has any good reason to have confidence in they're at the
boundaries of philosophy so he's like the kids thoughts are totally equal equally valid to my
thoughts on it because it's not a topic that we have good epistemic basis to know so we get to have
we get to come into symmetry and have a conversation where i have reason to be interested in what they
think about it and i can't actually claim any authority in it and although it was such a cool
insight to try to find context in which you can be in symmetry and i thought uh another one of the
ones was uh he said that there were so few times that the adult was interacting with the kid where
the adult didn't have an agenda for the kid and the kid could feel that they want me to do my chores
or do my homework or behave a certain way or and to spend a genderless time with them where you just
come in interact and find out what they're interested in and follow that and how profound
an experience it is when a kid has someone there that is seeking to facilitate them but not with a
direction i love that i think my dad was really curious um he was always very aware that the
problems with epistemology says they it's hard to know where the edge of your epistemology is you
