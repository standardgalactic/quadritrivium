under the age of 20 and that they're gonna they're already facing the metacrisis and the
grown-ups are incapable of dealing with it at present and all of our institutions are dysfunctional
what are your thoughts about about that relating to what you just said you know using how can we
bring forth that innate learning capacity that every child is born with to handle this
I mean practically in our educational policies and things like that
yeah
hi I have two questions and one is about or both are about the metacrisis that you described in
the beginning and the first is very personal it's how do you live with yourself and how do you
keep well mentally by seeing all this because most of us I think we know it but we try just
not to see it and the other question is the road ahead as you described it is very dystopical
and now we're talking more about a procedural way how to attack the problem and as being
theoretical do we see a vision of what could be or how it we a vision towards which we could
go towards in the way of breaking the dystopic away
yeah hi um you uh my Daniel yeah Daniel you said that we can't all have like at some point on
the in the discussion about education you thought you talked about how we can't all have Marcus
already a student but I think we might in five years or something when you've got
GPT six or seven perhaps we know is which iteration will break it but at some point that's also
going to revolutionize learning probably maybe some thoughts on that thanks
hello I have a question you talk about that we lack the wisdom of gods but we have this
great technology how do we attain the wisdom of gods or the wisdom needed to give technology
the right direction yeah yeah so it seemed like a thing that you both touched upon was paying
attention and then that seems to be an important thing and occurred to me that one one of our
fundamental one of the fundamental things that we do as human beings is to pay attention
and is it worth paying attention to how we pay attention is that a skill that can be taught
in isolation or is this something that just happens alongside other activities
so um my 27 year old daughter about three years ago maybe it was four called me up
and she was in tears and I said what's wrong and she said mom I I don't know how to be a good person
and I can't figure it out because every single thing that I do connects me to the destruction
and the exploitation whether I am taking the bus or whether I you know I'm wearing clothes or you
know going to the grocery store and getting granola it doesn't matter what I do everything I do
links me into this thing that you know we're describing as the metacrisis
and when your kid calls and says that
you can't brush that off you can't just deliver some canned script you know oh honey don't worry
about it you know you just can't carry the weight of the world on your shoulders it's not you can't
say that when your kid calls and they're asking that question you have to show up
with no bullshit actually and so you know the only thing I knew to say was
keep asking the question keep asking that question and know that I'm asking the same question and
I'm right here with you and that we will work on this together but we have no idea
so in that sense the the the kid that really wants to be a good person
this is so important she wants to be a good person
you know you were saying the other night oh but you have your line because it's such an
incredible line but um what I think happened with her and continues is that she has been
in an ongoing conversation with me since she was this big that was a conversation about how
are you perceiving the world what do you see what makes you see it like that
where did you learn to see it like that what if you saw it like this
so for me the the greatest learning happens in these moments when we begin to perceive
our own perception and and most of the time that happens in a way that's a little bit confusing
you know maybe it's culture mix up maybe it's a communication mix up maybe it's a whatever
but that moment when you begin to perceive your own perception uh and and my kids were
in it from pretty young we started in talking about that stuff pretty young they can handle it
they loved it um but but a lot of a lot of breakfast tables don't have those conversations
at them so I think we're we're kind of caught also in a limited understanding of what kind
of conversations you can have with your children and um and then there's I think a lot of times
there's a all kinds of developmental limitations that get assigned that aren't actually real
it's just that there's not a lot of households doing it so you don't know if you had a lot of
households that were you know doing epistemological stuff with their three year olds four year olds
starting with language right um they're pretty good at it by the time they're eight
and that's a different sort of way so that kind of moves through some of this they they can do it
it's there this business of I am a perceiver perceiving the world is is in there um if you
help it give language if it's held at the if it's held at the table it's there
yeah
yeah so your daughter's question of how do I be a good person when to do anything in the world
I am to some degree complicit with the world system and to not be complicit with the world system
um also involves not being able to really uh affect it um which means I can't actually
separate myself from the world that I live in to have my hands clean I am a part of a world system
and that doesn't mean that I just go along with it but it also means I can't be completely
free of its sentence right like I am a part of this world system which is very interesting um
and it relates to the question that you asked about um you know just how to emotionally process and
so that process one of the big steps of where that started for me was I was nine and I saw a
cattle truck from a factory farm taking animals from factory farm to a slaughter and you've seen
the trucks that have the holes for air in the side and I went over and I looked at it and the cow
closest to me was missing an eye and blood was coming from it and all the cows were in their
feces and terrified and um you know it was like a Auschwitz train car or whatever and um I grew up
eating meat without an understanding of what factory farms were and loving animals through that
you know it wasn't a cognitive distance because I didn't know better as a kid and um so I asked my
parents because I was I was shocked and horrified the way a kid would be and uh they said that's
where meat comes from and so I got diet for a new america read it you know that next day and then
dove into pita and going to factory farms and that was the beginning of kind of animal rights work
which then went from factory farms to then also looking at overfishing and looking at
whaling and then that brought environmental issues and that brought the interconnected
extreme poverty issues and just kind of the whole thing started but I remember starting with the
factory farm thing and getting to see the scale of it right getting to see uh that there were
more total biomass of animals in factory farms and there were in the wild and uh you know all
that kind of thing and uh that it's not like hunting it's not like an animal that has a natural
life and then we kill it's like a continuity of torture and I it was the first time that I was
suicidal because I didn't like the world just didn't make sense that my species could do that
and feel okay about it and I couldn't be complicit with it right so I'm like like fuck I can't
this world feels like a crazy house to me and I want out and then it wasn't that hard to think through
if I kill myself all the animals are still in the factory farms and all the all the kids starving
to death and blah blah blah all those things I didn't change any of it so it's like that's a
ultimately selfish move to get out of suffering myself it's a vicarious suffering so I'm like okay
I can't do that can my life feel like a success while that's still happening like that was a
immediate question of if I focus on some things and can I know that there are other sentient
beings that are in just utter trauma and torture and yet I'm stoked because my life is good and I
am like well I would have to I would have to not know what I know and I already know it so I'd have
to pretend to not know I'd have to actively disconnect which would mean I would have to choose
to be a sociopath right I would have to choose to disconnect I'm like all right so the only way
I can live in this world and just feel like my life is a success is as a sociopath and it just
doesn't work for me I can't do that I can't shut off what I know so I'm like all right if and you
know this was very naive this was nine years old but I'm like I have to in factory farms if I
in factory farms the animals aren't in that condition I didn't know the rest of the metacrisis
yet I can live in a world where that's not the case so I remember thinking if I die in factory
farms haven't ended then I failed at living in a way that I could be okay with and you know then
that just expanded from that to all the other issues and but what what it did is say I
I can't think about my life separate from life separate from the whole of all the things you know
I wasn't born into extreme poverty in Sudan I wasn't born with AIDS I wasn't born into a factory
farm I could have been I could easily be the consciousness on that side and I can't take
any merit for having been born on this side but I can do a lot more to get animals out of factory
farms than they can do for themselves and so that feels obligate right but like a like an obligation
I wouldn't want out of like a sacred obligation and and then the problem comes that I have no
idea how to do it and then the problem comes that I get some ideas and they totally don't work
right and so there is a kind of existential devastation and then if you pull yourself out of
that there's a naive optimism of how to possibly solve the things that will totally not work right
the early activist ideas I had of course got shattered on the rocks of how much more vested
interests and how much more complicated and how the solutions I had in mind didn't factor a million
of the causal dynamics involved and and so then back to existential angst devastation but then the
only answer is understand the problem better to know how to contribute to what might be adequate
solutions better and and I remember at being like okay so the Hippocratic oath first do no harm
we'll try to benefit things so I'll stop eating meat that comes from factory farms I'll stop
you know getting stuff that comes from sweatshops I'll stop but pretty soon like Nora's daughters
in sight I realized I can't drive in a car I can't take a bus that's on a road and not be
complicit with climate change and supply chains that get the cobalt from child slave labor mines and
on and on and so I'm like all right I've got to dwell in the forest and only gather things that I
can gather myself and and even then I realize I can't actually not cause harm and I can't change
the systems at all that way and so then there was this recognition that I don't get to be a moral
being separate from my species right like I am up I'm a part of a species I'm a part of
the world and so uh the inheriting the sins of the forefathers the sins of the world if I'm to
operate in it at all I'm part of which also means then I have an ethical responsibility to try to
change as best I can and so there's something nice about not feeling like you can have the
perfect moral high ground and recognizing no I can't but also not just accepting that and going
nihilist right saying like I want to endeavor to do better and I cannot do perfectly and so when
someone is trying to figure out how do I be a good person if it's really obvious they're dangerous
right because everybody on both sides of all holy wars is crystal clear that their side is right
and if you are really factoring all the complexity of you like fuck I don't know if the thing the
choice I'm planning on making is right I don't know factoring the second third order of facts
everybody else who's involved but you can't stay stuck in the because I don't want to be
over certain and because I want to factor appropriate uncertainty you can easily go nihilist
from too much uncertainty and just be like I have no idea fuck it I give up that doesn't work either
so you've got to say under partial and incomplete information not being certain
and yet being able to have relatively higher certainties than others what is and being able
to notice and correct for my own biases as best I can how do I make the best choices that I can
that are imperfect but are importantly better than other choices where I also realize that not acting
has moral consequences because I'm then complicit with whatever happens that I didn't do something
about so when I realize that there's moral consequence ethical consequence to both action and
non-action and that I'll always be acting under partial information then I've got to be really
comfortable with uncertainty and also comfortable with relatively better certainties that can inform
choice and yet my relatively better certainty still needs to be open to being radically changed
with new insight new information and so that's you know and it's real interesting thing about
having kids you know you're asking how how my experience I'm giving my experience as a kid
being exposed so a lot of parents might be like do I want to show my kids what the inside of a
factory farm looks like do I want to show them what extreme poverty looks like or what clear
cutting line in the amazon looks like because you know I grew up with nightmares because of those
things and you're going to traumatize them through the vicarious trauma of the reality of the world
do I not want to and have them have some happiness that's based on lies that makes them unfit to
deal with the world that they will end up having to face and where they can't be part of addressing it
so you know I would say no I want to choose to help them understand the world but
when are they ready for what things how do you help them process it I don't think there's a
formulaic answer for that how do you raise kids now where you can't predict what the adaptive
skills will be that they need but where you also are not just trying to optimize for their quality
of life even though you love them so much but for the possibility of life for the whole world
ongoingly that they can contribute to right and they want to they want that too you know I think
that's part of that thing is that this is not a parking place you can't just come to a position
and just lock in it's an ongoing shifting ever rigorous exploration of some some very tense
choices and what the what that means to be in that that work actually and the habit of doing that
because you have to be an uncertainty you have to be comfortable but not too comfortable in
that uncertainty because if you get too comfortable in uncertainty uncertainty then you become
shallow and nihilistic I mean either one for some people ambiguity is just a way of brushing it
off oh this is just a mystery I just can't know it so why bother which is actually plausible
deniability for doing whatever the fuck you want right and so I remember in your talk on Thursday
there was one word that kept coming up that was really important for me that I noticed
and it was the word justify you were Daniel was describing this metacrisis in much greater detail
than tonight tonight was plenty thank you and the word justify kept coming up in what way are we
justifying this action or that action or this approach or that approach and what's allowing
for that justification what are the underpinnings of that justification
um
what I was impressed with in my daughter's question
was that she wasn't looking for justification
that's that's that's really important and not easy
you know we talk about moving from unwarranted unwarranted certainty in into uncertainty and
unwarranted simplicity into the real complexity of things but uncertainty and complexity can also
be weaponized I can obviously say oh we can't know for sure such and such about climate chains
therefore continue maximizing GDP with oil or whatever the fuck I want to so we can weaponize
uncertainty and we can weaponize complexity by saying it's a very complex situation I can cherry
pick the facts to support any argument I want so the statistical warfare right a subset we talk
about kinetic warfare but then there's non-kinetic warfare and population-centric warfare the fight
for the minds and hearts of the people population-centric warfare happens through information
warfare controlling what people believe is true and um narrative warfare controlling the who they
feel is good and right in the end group they're part of and and statistics are just such an amazing
weapon right we wrote a paper the kinsolans project called how to mislead with facts and it shows why
you can write an article where all of the facts in it will pass the most rigorous fact checker
but because you lay cough frame meaning do I call them terrorists or freedom fighters do I call it a
protest or a riot do I call it undocumented workers or illegal aliens by lay cough framing which is
not a fact or non fact right it's adding moral valence or aesthetic valence to the thing by cherry
picking the stats because I can have stats that will tell very opposite sides of the story because
I'll have a Gaussian distribution of truths and I can cherry pick them and by decontextualizing them
oh the average person in the united states in 1815 only lived on a dollar and a half a day and now
they live on such and such yeah but they grew their own fucking food and they made their own house
and it wasn't mediated by dollars you decontextualize that fact in a way that made it nonsense um by
decontextualizing facts lay cough framing them and cherry picking them I can make any argument I want
with rigorous facts and so this is basically how mainstream journals lie um and or you know mislead
