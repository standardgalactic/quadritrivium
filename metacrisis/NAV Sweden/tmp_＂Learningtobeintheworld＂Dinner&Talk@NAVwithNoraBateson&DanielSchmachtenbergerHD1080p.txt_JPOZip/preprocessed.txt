I was just asking Daniel what he does for a living, you know, these questions get difficult
to answer.
So we can't really see you, but I think you can see us, just so you know we can't see
you.
So if you start sticking your tongues out at us or anything, we will have no idea.
We are staring into artificial suns, they're very bright.
Daniel, this is wonderful that we are doing this together and I'm excited because I have
no idea where this conversation is going to go tonight.
And we're touching into topics and stories that I think neither one of us certainly are
in the habit of bringing into our public discourse.
So both of us do a lot of public speaking.
Both of us are working with the concept of how do we potentially make the changes we
need to make to keep our species and several others around.
But this time we're taking this conversation somewhere slightly different.
And I'm excited about that because the question that is kind of underneath all of this for
me is the question that we sometimes ask in the warm data work, which is what is continuing?
What's continuing?
And in any kind of evolutionary process, there is a need for there to be continuance.
You cannot have continuance without discontinuance.
Organisms have to change in order to stay in the ecologies as they change, context change.
If you don't change, you become obsolete.
If you change too much, you become obsolete.
So how do we not become obsolete?
Now, this is, interestingly, I think, an intergenerational question.
And very frequently when we look out at the way in which change projects are structured,
they seem to be structured towards solutioning for the problems.
But this territory of what happens between parents and children, between adults and elders,
between grandparents and ancestors, this question is hardly ever in the room.
Where did we learn to have a relationship with nature, with each other, with the idea
of identity or idea of success?
Who did you learn to be at the breakfast table?
How is the person that you are now somehow arruminating a rippling of those generations
that came before you in ways that you, some of which you may be aware of, but many of
which you're not?
Who are you?
Who am I?
And what are the ways in which the person that I think I am and the person that you think
you are are actually holding each other into those systems that we spend our days thinking
we'd like to change?
Are we keeping each other in the perpetuating existing systems with our ideas of identity
and prestige, of what it is to be a parent, what it is to be taking care of an elder,
what it is to be in this society?
So this intergenerational question for me is really resonant with where's the change?
One interesting thing here is that both Daniel and I, and I don't know the stories, and he
doesn't know my stories, so we're writing skateboards up here.
We both grew up in really unorthodox ways.
And I think it's no surprise that we are both thinking about the changes in the world in
unorthodox ways.
So what can we bring?
What can we share?
What can we explore together in this territory that might be generative and useful and at
very least amusing for each other and for you?
So Daniel, I want to put you on the spot a little bit because I don't think that we
can have anything in this conversation if we don't have as an assumption the metacrisis.
So I think we could say that for a whole lot of situations that the assumption at this
point needs to be the metacrisis.
But if you were going to give us a quick version of this thing called the metacrisis,
so it's in the room so that everything else we're talking about is predicated on this.
How would you do that?
It's so great to see you.
Well, it's fun that we're doing this and that we don't know where we're going to go in the
conversation and everybody who I got to meet briefly coming in seemed like great people,
so this seems like a cool community.
I know the video quality wants it.
Is there any way this can turn down the tiniest bit because I'm mostly in full blindness?
Is so much better.
Thank you.
Is anyone not familiar with the metacrisis?
Just hands so I have a sense.
I'll try to do this very briefly then.
It's actually a fucked up thing to ask.
Sorry.
No, I don't mean for me.
There's an emotional existential weight of the topic for everybody else to just enter
and then not actually process, but whatever you ask for it.
So a big part of my work is looking at catastrophic risks facing the world, catastrophic and existential
risks.
A lot of people focus on this topic.
The lens through which I have focused on it is looking not just at catastrophic risks
in the areas, in the ways that we normally silo it.
So obviously militaries look at escalation pathways to large scale war, environmentalists
look at environmental risks, which there's some unifying frameworks to not just look
at species extinction or climate change or soil erosion, but things like planetary boundaries
that look at many different catastrophic risks.
There are groups like the big group at Oxford and Cambridge and others that look at exponential
tech risks, risks that could have never happened when we didn't have as powerful a technology
is emerging like the risks associated with synthetic biology and AI and nanotech and
cyber and drones.
So each of these risks also acts like a force multiplier for the other ones.
So if we look at the nature of the social media algorithms, optimizing for engagement
and the optimization for engagement often looks like things that scare us or upset us
or drive tribal identities, it's pretty easy to see that the social media algorithms drive
polarization.
The polarized population in a democratic society ends up electing a polarized representative
class causes gridlock in open societies, closed societies, authoritarian societies don't
have that issue.
So you end up getting a net movement as a result of that towards autocracies being more effective.
But you can see that the social media issue is like a crisis in itself, but it's also
a force multiplier for all the other issues because we can't solve climate change if half
the population disagrees with anything the other half the population wants to do or COVID
or anything.
You can look at climate change as a risk in and of itself, but also as a force multiplier
because as soon as you look at not just total venousification of the planet, but things
like extreme weather events causing human migration and refugee issues, I think Sweden
is very acutely aware of refugee issues currently and the fact that after Syria, nobody wants
climate change mediated refugees coming into their country and yet you're about to, you
know, UN predicts 300 million and some groups predict up to a billion climate change refugees
in the next handful of years, somewhere between five and 10 years.
So what does the world do with that?
Well, that acts as a force multiplier for resource wars, which can then become large
scale wars, which can become collapse to supply chains on and on.
So the metacrisis is looking at not just the individual risk but the cascades between them
and the underlying drivers that they all have in common, whether we're talking about climate
change or war or forever chemicals in the environment, we can see that perverse economic
incentive is a driver of all of them.
We can see that externalities where we're optimizing for one thing but causing harm
somewhere else is a driver in all of them.
We can see that multipolar traps where one group feels like it has to do the fucked up
thing because another group is doing it and if the other group does it, there's so much
competitive advantage.
So nobody wants to give up the nukes first because maybe the other guy didn't really
give up the nukes, right?
And nobody wants to price carbon properly because if Western countries price carbon
properly and China doesn't all it is, is a seeding of the world to autocracy running
the 21st century.
Nobody wants to agree to not build AI weapons because how do we know that the other guy's
not building AI weapons in an underground military base, so we're just an all out race
for everybody to build them, which increases the likelihood that everybody dies from them.
So if we can't solve multipolar traps or coordination issues, we can't solve any of the things.
The metacrisis is basically saying that there's not one or a few catastrophes facing civilization.
There is a whole series of them, many, many different escalation pathways that are the
result of very deep civilizational structures and that unless we change things like the
global economic system writ large, you can't have a, our global economic system requires
exponential growth just to even keep up with interest.
Exponential growth of a monetary system means exponential demand on energy and exponential
demand on materials, can't do that on a finite planet forever.
That means a level of change of global economy that we have no idea really how to do.
And the exponential growth was the answer after World War II to not having World War
III because the major nation states could all have more without taking each other stuff
because they took it from nature faster.
If you don't take it from nature, now you go back to zero some dynamics and higher orientation
for war.
So, and World War II was the first time we had catastrophe weapons.
So it was the first time after which you couldn't have the major superpowers war.
But we had one catastrophe weapon that was really hard to build.
So you could limit it to only two countries and now, you know, maybe eight or so countries
that had it.
But with AI weapons and with drone weapons and with cyber weapons and with bio weapons
getting increasingly cheap because exponential tech decentralizes power.
But that, we hear a lot of the good story of democratizing power for everyone, but democratizing
catastrophe weapons for everyone is a problem, right?
The ability to synthesize genomes for $1,000, which is three years away, in basements when
science OMPIN publishes all of the results of gain of function research.
How does the world make it through decentralized catastrophe weapons for everyone where even
accidents are enough to cause those issues.
So basically, humanity is at a place where it has to make changes that are unprecedented,
like not changes as big as the post World War II change and not changes as big as like
the beginning of democracy and nation states in the, you know, 16th, 17th century.
But more like a change as fundamental as the invention of stone tools with early hominids,
like it's a, because it's a change of evolutionary process itself, where as long as we're seeking
to optimize in groups at the expense of our groups using exponential tech, you get exponential
conflict, which self terminates in a finite space.
And as long as we're optimizing some metrics at the expense of others, you get exponential
externalities in a finite space.
Exponential externalities self terminate exponential conflict self terminates, which means with
exponential tech, we have to solve problems in ways that don't cause other problems, which
means we have to really think through all of the externalities much, much, much better.
And we also have to benefit some groups, not at the expense of other groups.
And that means we have to both have radically better conflict theory in which identity is
not bound to in groups at the expense of our groups.
And we have to have radically better complexity processing.
But this really does mean different identity and different relationship to what getting
ahead and progress and all those things mean.
So this is the stuff I focus on.
And how do we make it through all the catastrophes, where the control mechanisms we put in place
to avoid them don't become dystopic.
So we want a future that is neither catastrophes nor dystopias, but some third option in which
we can be the type of species that can safely steward the power of exponential tech, i.e.,
we are moving into a phase where we have the ability to make artificial intelligence that
is radically more capable than us of every finite game.
And where we have the ability to synthesize new life, the creation of new life, to destroy
whole ecosystems, to make whole new biosystems.
So we can't act like apex predators trying to beat the other guy and get ahead when we
don't have the power of apex predators that like a really upset polar bear or orca can't
destroy everything, right?
We have something more like the power of nature or the power of gods.
How do we become safe stewards of it?
So that's the stuff that I focus on.
That's the context because the catastrophes currently are impending on a short timeline,
not a very long timeline.
So Nora and I were going to have a conversation about, well, I don't know, but including things
like parenting and education and how we raise children, how we how we develop people and
the context of the current world situation is a really important part of thinking about
that, right?
Because if we're raising kids for a relatively stable future that's a lot like the past,
there's one way to think about what development should look like.
If we're raising kids for a radically different future where both, well, how do they deal
with types of change that are unpredictable, that can completely change the type of world
they can expect?
And what capacities would we want to develop in them that they can help actually design
and build those new world systems is a really it's a it's a context for parenting and education
that is kind of requisite now and was never even a reasonable consideration in the past.
Thank you.
I mean, the idea that the older generation prepares the younger generation to be something
like well adapted to their world puts us squarely in obsolescence right now.
So if we are in going to repeat those previous generations endeavors to to help our children
to get better jobs to go through school to get better grades so they can be optimized
participants in the existing systems, we have failed them in the preparation that they are
going to need to actually respond emotionally, intellectually, physically, spiritually, psychologically
to the changes in the world around them.
I think some of us are already seeing this in our kids where, you know, between looming
threats of nuclear war and climate change and coronavirus, our kids are not blind to
what's happening.
They're holding things.
And already there's a tension around how do we talk to them about this?
Let alone, you know, as a parent, I, you know, it's my job if it's raining to be sure that
my kids are ready for the rain.
I give them their raincoat and their boots to put on.
I make sure they've had their breakfast.
I help them do their homework.
I get them.
And beyond that, there are a million messages in everything I say and do that have to do
with how you are going to become in the world around us, how we have collectively made sense
of what it is to be successful, to be well-adapted, to be a good person, to be a bad person, right?
To be any kind of person.
What's a person even?
So now I grew up in a household that was odd.
It was an odd household.
And my father, Gregory Bateson, who did a lot of studies on, actually, you know, helped
sort of bring systems thinking into the world and cybernetics and many forms of information
technology, lots of stuff in ecology and psychology and anthropology, was fascinated with this
question of how is it that we are perceiving the world and how does our perception of the
world inform the way that we create communication and response and community?
What's in that perception and how does it inform all of that?
So this sounds like it's this intellectual realm, and it is.
There's all sorts of fantastic work that you can read on this.
But I was a kid, so when he was teaching me about these ideas, he didn't teach them to
me as intellectual endeavors.
This teaching came to me as breakfast, as how you walk through the woods and you pay attention
to which organisms are in relationship to which other organisms.
It came to me in the way you phrase a question, how you look into the relationships of a room
before you respond.
And so I grew up in a different world.
And on top of that, it was the 70s, it was Northern California, we were living at Esalen
and all these other crazy places.
And in those spaces, there was this, there was an identified urgency.
In that era, it was more like shaking off the bullshit of the 50s, the really ossified
roles and what's a woman, what's a man, what's work, what's, right?
And breaking free, set the humans free.
Free love, free thinking.
But in doing that, they threw out all the rules, not just some of them.
And when they threw out all the rules, I wasn't always safe.
So what the environment that I was in was, I think the most important thing that was happening
was that I was watching adults learn.
I was watching them not know what they were doing.
And that was really important because that was the modeling, the second order modeling
that I carried with me.
It wasn't what they learned, but that they were learning.
And that they really desperately were in pain from the way they had learned to be in the
world and letting go of those shackles.
I remember listening to grownups in the seminar rooms at Esalen banging on pillows and they
were trying to let it all out.
And they were like, I hate my mother and I hate this world and I hate.
And we, the kids of Esalen, we would be outside the door and we would mock them.
And it would be our mother in there, right?
We'd be like, I hate my mother, I hate this world.
But we were just, you know, we were, what else could we do, right?
You have to mock this.
It was ridiculous.
They're punching pillows with tennis rackets.
But they were ripping the fabric of expectations in society and that's important.
And that was a really interesting world to be in because it was a world that didn't have
rules.
The rules were ripping.
There weren't new ones yet.
How about your world?
I was just reflecting that they probably didn't know at the time that a little while later,
roughly this time, we would look back at those few years that they grew up in post World
War II as the golden era that we really wish we could get back to, where a single father
working one job could buy a house, which hasn't been true in the U.S. since and increasingly
less so, and which the average median income and median cost of a house actually worked
out in a short number of years and there weren't mass shootings on and on.
And I think I also grew up with parents who oriented to the rebellious, progressive, visionary
side and pretty much thought of all tradition and orthodoxy as just all the dumb shit we've
done so far that makes no sense that we need to rethink of from scratch.
So of course, a big part of my process was realizing all the aspects of tradition and
orthodoxy that turned out the way they were for some good reasons, which doesn't mean
all good reasons, of course, the metacrisis I'm looking at is largely the result of where
it's not a functional system, but I remember when I first met Brett Weinstein, we had
a very interesting conversation about the sexual revolution of the counterculture movement
where he shared a perspective that then I've heard many people share since was the first
time I'd heard it with him, maybe about eight or so years ago, from evolutionary biologist,
anthropologist perspective on why the sexual revolution was net profoundly destructive
when that along with the civil rights movement and women's liberation and the environmental
movement were all things that I held as liberating type structures and it was just interesting.
And this other perspective I'm going to share quickly is not true, it's a part of the truth,
but it's important to understand the balance.
The perspective that he was sharing, which I think a lot of traditional people would share,
is that the system of kind of obligate institutional monogamy was something that had
emerged as the dominant system because it worked much better than all of the other systems at a
society level and that specifically, from an evolutionary biologist point of view,
it's like men in a society will do whatever it is that they have to do to mate and if the
society guards mating in particular ways, they're basically developing how men are going to behave
and if a guy can't have sex until marriage and in order to get married, he has to actually get
not just the woman who he's interested in to say yes, but the parents and the preacher and at the
community wedding it'll say if anyone here objects, which means if he's really been an asshole to
anyone secretly, they can object, means not only can he not marry but he can't get laid, that it's
binding his ability to get laid to his ability to have people who don't have an oxytocin rush
associated with him think that he'll be a good father and a good provider and a good citizen
and that there was a lot of wisdom in that and that as soon as and this is a place where physical
technology changes culture as soon as birth control decoupled sex from procreation so the
consequence of sex became a lot less in terms of the actual consequence and then the cultural
movement because if you didn't have that the cultural movement wouldn't have happened right
so then the cultural movement was able to say hey we can rethink this thing from scratch we have
fundamentally new capacities let's rethink the premises one of the things that happened was
and it seemed like a liberation that women could make choices themselves but then that also meant
make choices based on oxytocin dynamics that were not coupled to wisdom and long-term thinking where
guys could be assholes but have game be good at getting laid and it created an evolutionary
niche for assholes to get laid and that Reagan followed and prostitutes and blow and then the
pickup artist movement and his whole argument was none of that would have happened had you not
had the sexual revolution movement now there there is take a moment and laugh and I think the point
that it brings up to me that is interesting associated with what you started with on continuity
and discontinuity and then generational transfer is maybe one of the deepest cultural dialectics is
the traditional versus the progressive focus most of the time a focus that orients more towards
the continuity of traditions is what we think of as the political right it's more conservative and
changing stuff and one that orients more towards some idea of progress and novelties
associated with the political left and they're supposed to be in a mutually respectful dialectic
because each old part of the truth but from a very early left orientation that didn't understand
that dialectic the learning of the value of the traditional side for me was one way of thinking
about the traditional or conservative side is that it is actually like has a deeper unconscious
respect for evolutionary process saying that the systems that have worked for a long time were
the ones that made it through wars made it through famines made it through cultural revolutions there
were a lot of things that didn't work the ones that worked probably have a bunch of embedded
wisdom that we don't understand if we change it we might break them for reasons we don't
understand so the the conservative sociologist brings up chester tins fence all the time right
chester tins fences the idea that before you take a fence down be a hundred percent sure or pretty
sure that you understand all the reasons the fence was put up and that you might superficially think
there was one reason the fence was put up and you say that's no longer relevant you take it down
you find out there were 20 other reasons and so in a way you can say the traditional side
actually being more aligned with the recognition of uncertainty epistemic uncertainty which is
not feeling certain that the idea that we have of how to make it better is good right that it
might actually be naive and dumb and mess stuff up so let's keep the things that at least show
some sign of stability and I think they wouldn't describe it that way usually and then of course
from an evolutionary perspective the progressive side says yes and because we do have novelty
the thing that worked in the past of course can't work and so we do have to innovate and the
dialectic is let's make sure we understand let's really endeavor to understand with a lot of
benefit of the doubt and respect why the traditional systems have been selected for and try to
understand all the wisdom that isn't obvious as opposed to a quick rejection of it and then let's
see where it isn't fit for purpose let's see where it is and where it isn't and where it isn't how
do we add things that have congruency with the parts that are fit right so this is the balance
of continuity and discontinuity or tradition and progress yeah I think one of the ways in which
I have been really focusing on that lately is this visitation I had recently to Japan
and while I was in Japan I went to see some artisans that were there and I was introduced to
a family that was making incense and a family that wasn't doing fabric making and a family that
was making paper and these families had been doing these things for 350 years 750 years
1250 years and that's continuity and but in order to do that they had to make changes
now this was interesting to me because I the work that I do I'm also several generations in
and I have battled with that right when I was you know young people would introduce me and they
would forget to say my name and they would say this is Gregory Bateson's daughter and I'd be like
my name's Nora hi um but I fought for some sort of individuation because individuation was the
tradition of my time okay so this is a this is an interesting problem when individuation is the
tradition and that individuation in fact was very difficult for me everywhere I went I could never
not be Gregory Bateson's daughter and I still couldn't be Gregory Bateson so I was always
letting everybody down I couldn't I couldn't possibly be either um so it's taken me a long time
to actually begin to hold this multi-generational work that I'm in and to hold it in a way
that allows for the difference that the context that I'm working in as a woman in 2022 at you
know Nav with dental and you guys is really different than where my father was in 1972
or where his father was in 1902 all of us have been talking about the same ideas
about how context and environments help change and shift organisms basically
that everything we're talking about has been there for three generations at least so
one thing is is that in the past there was this oppression of the family where the first you know
you had to do what your family did and and that was oppressive you had to take on that that's
that career you had to you were limited by those sexual options you were limited by those spiritual
or religious options and um and so getting free from the family was really important because it
allowed for this beginnings of all these new ideas and ways of living um and then
here we are and it's gotten very messy and I have kids I have two kids that came from my womb
and my husband's got four kids and they you know are two different cultures Swedish and American kids
and they range in age from 16 to 29 and uh how do I help them to be in the world right now
in a way that allows them to be in relationship with the past
in all of the goodness and all of the flaws and allows them to begin to nurture a kind of
flexibility for what their future will be I don't think there's any generation that knows
how to deal with what's coming I mean you can like you were asking about how would you
if you were a mother in Ukraine five years ago what did you teach your children
and uh so this is I think a very serious question of how do we teach our kids something that we
actually don't know and it puts it puts us in a difficult relationship with that role of parent
um you know your kids failing math well you have to do well in math why
um that's questions getting harder and harder to answer actually um and you know I think for
me with my kids I first of all I I was pulled out of school and homeschooled for I think three
four years of my life my father had cancer and when my father had cancer we moved to
Big Sur California and the school was really far away and I used to just throw up on the bus so he
said why don't you just come I only have a little time left just be here and so I was homeschooled
and it was really unstructured there was no such thing as homeschooling then it was actually called
truancy at that point um and it was chargeable by law in fact it was illegal but nevertheless
we got away with it and we did math we would have these conversations about math we'd take walks in
the forest and he would tell me the latin names of everything and how it reproduced and I would
travel with him and I would sit in on his workshops and I was at Esalen and Joseph Campbell was there
talking about mythology and Alan Watts was there talking about you know religion and Carl Rogers
was talking about psychology and I got I got a pretty good education for a 10-year-old you know
um but then I went back to school my dad died and I went back to school
and it was like hell I mean I have to tell you like even the memory of those
those first moments of going back into the classroom it was like
everything beautiful in the world just ran out of the room they all the subjects were divided
and math was no longer fun I was like writing papers for my father's college classes on how
to think in base five and and because he was teaching university classes on perception so he
was just going to get his nine-year-old daughter to write a paper on how to think in base five
perfectly reasonable right and then I went into you know ninth grade math and
I was like this is horrible this isn't fun this isn't groovy this is I think I barely got by with a
C and I never wanted to do math again but um I had this experience of what it could be
what education could be and so when I had kids I took them out of school we were moving from
California to Vancouver Canada and so my California legal world kind of thought I was going to
Canada and the Canadian world thought we were still moving and at that point my husband their
father at the time he's still their father my husband at the time their father um and we just
were like okay let's go and so we essentially stole our children from the system but I imagine
this might sound a little radical to you um we stole our children and we went on this fantastic
adventure it was an incredible privilege we went down into South America and we went and we
learned another we went to a language class in Cusco Spanish intro to Spanish with just the family
so it was intergenerational language learning and we were all at the beginning
and so we got to see how each other learned that was just fascinating so my kids could see
you know ways in which I was struggling and I could ask them for help and they they could see
you know my husband get irritated that some you know it was really a very interesting experiment
what year what year that would have been 2005 or six yeah why it just um I just think it's fun
hearing that part of the story when I finished my uh undergrad I took a one-way plane ticket to
Peru and landed in Cusco and started with a weak immersion class and uh what year that would have
been 2001 so not all of our part that would have been a funny coincidence yeah um so so we
pulled the kids out of school for six months that was the idea and um when we we we did an hour of
reading and an hour of writing they could write whatever they wanted and I had these little math
workbooks I did an hour of math with them every once in a while not every day well when we got back
I couldn't put them back in the school because they were two years ahead
and I wasn't even remotely trying to get them ahead actually I was just we were just traveling and
and having this amazing trip but I just wanted to be sure that I could you know that we weren't
losing any ground and you know I couldn't put them back in and then we had another problem
so we thought well okay uh what we need to do is stall so we took another six months to finish
out the school here and I I actually hired a tutor because I didn't have any more time to do this
it takes a lot of time to be that person and so this tutor was a former teacher who had gotten
glaucoma and gone blind and so he had a blind tutor and he the the project was just spend the next
six months reading a few Shakespeare plays so they went line by line through Macbeth through
mid-summer night's dream through Richard the third and oops that accidentally made it much worse
because in fact they and then they learned poetry they learned history they learned psychology
they learned about all this different stuff and it was actually a very systemic education
they were they were comparing the the great soliloquies with famous speeches by Martin Luther King
or by Hitler or by right they were comparing soliloquies in Shakespeare with with with historical
figures um and then I put them back in school as I was thinking about this I was talking to my
daughter who's now 27 and I and she said to me the other day she and her husband to be have been
reading parenting books and she's like every single one of them is about how your child is going to be
well adjusted what if you don't want your child to be well adjusted to a sick society right what if
the systems we're in are destroying the possibility of their future and being well adjusted to them
only makes that happen how do you get your child unadjusted to this is the question she said the
one regret that she had was that we stopped homeschooling but it was her that begged for it she
longed longed for the tv experience of the prom dress and the lockers and the boyfriends and the
gossip and the parties and the you know this ridiculous thing she had seen in hollywood
which of course turned out to be soul crunching you know bullying mind dividing you know
welcome to the world of reductionism mess
that's kind of what happened at my house
uh there's so many interesting directions that like to go with it um you'd mention briefly
something that we talked about on our walk of if you were a parent in Kiev 10 years ago uh who
was progressive in thinking about the future of the world and thinking about how to parent
thoughtfully and just my kid go to wall door for Montessori or do i unschool you probably
weren't thinking about preparing them for eminent war because that didn't seem like
uh a likely reality because we haven't had that in a long time and i think
when you study the history of civilizational collapse when the roman empire fell or the
ottoman empire fell to the my end of the egyptian they fall after having been in place for so long
that the memory of collapse isn't even in anyone's memory it just feels like myth so it feels like
of course this will be here forever and um so if you knew that was going to happen
how would you prepare your kids is a really interesting question but if you don't know
if it's going to happen through like in syria a drought where all the subsistence farmers have
to move somewhere else and then they have to try to find jobs in a city where there aren't enough
jobs it leads to factionizing and resource war versus it actually means shelling is going to start
versus how do you prepare kids for a world that you can't anticipate what the world is
you have to prepare them for the capacity to notice what is happening that might be salient
and then to figure out what capacities might be relevant that they don't currently have
and then how to rapidly develop them and how to keep doing that which is a really interesting
thing to try to prepare somebody for and yet i would say like Kiev as a canary and a coal mine
is true for everybody currently because the an educational system is embedded inside of a
civilizational system where the civilization functions a certain way so you are training kids
to grow up and be able to fulfill the functions of a society and the workforce independent of
civilizational collapse uh technological unemployment itself portends this changing
in the lives of the next generation of every everybody because you were saying the kid asks
why should i be good at math and it's a harder question to answer obviously it was so important
to be trained in the abacus until it wasn't right and then the calculator changes what we think and
the so important to be trained in the slide rule or the compass and then the gps does anyone
need to know about maps or compasses or and then you're like well we're becoming technologically
dependent but we've always been technologically dependent just earlier technologies you take
away early people stone tools and they're dead right and the unique thing about humans is that
we were not selected for based on the capacity of our bodies the human body in every environment
without tools dies what we were selected for was the capacity to do this recursive abstraction
and make tools and do division of labor and coordination so the unit of selection for sapiens
is a coordinating group with its coordination protocols and its full tech stack because
a single person with a spear can't hunt a mastodon and a bunch of people without spears can't
either right it's a bunch of people with spears and their coordination that can and so it's like
from the beginning what was actually selected for in humans was a civilizational complex and
so then like we don't train people at spear throwing even though throughout all of human
history is the most important skill and of course if we lose some of the current tech stack older
stuff might become a relevant skill but then in the presence of
an AI is different than every tech we've ever had right because previously we figured out
a capacity we wanted and developed a tool for it AI has the ability to not just do a capacity we
wanted to do but to figure out all of the other capacities and develop them faster than we can
become aware of it so you think about math GPT-3 already has which is an open language model that
open AI built that anybody can go access you can just speak to it in natural language it
understands and does stuff and so you can say GPT-3 write me a research paper that cites real
research on why vaccines are dangerous or why vaccines are safe or whatever it is and it'll
generate that output and so you can also say not just solve this math problem for me but
figure out what math is even relevant to solve this real world problem and just give me the
answer to the real world problem so then there's this huge question of in and now this relates
back to the tradition versus progress the traditional wisdom becomes less relevant the faster the rate
of change in the actual world happens and the so if you look at say highly conserved traditions
in indigenous cultures their technological rate of change is quite slow so the life of a great
grandparent and the life of the great great grandchild were much more similar and obviously
we've been dealing with post-industrial revolution these radical changes where what it means to be
adaptive is a completely different world system new tools the singularity is when a new tool happens
that you can't be adaptive without like cell phones and whatever there's a the society has to
completely adjust to a whole set of capacities are irrelevant and a whole new set are required
when you start getting many of those within a single generation and when you start getting
them faster than anyone can adapt what does that world look like and specifically
how do you raise kids how do you do education in a world where robotics and AI are going to
obsolete all the jobs almost all the jobs and can do most everything that we would typically
train a human to do better than humans can you have to say fuck what what is the when
when humans providing a utility to society through some specialist trained task is not
relevant anymore because you can make robots and AI that do almost everything better than humans do
what is the purpose of human life and that's either terrifying if you don't change some
deep things because it ends up looking like a radical unemployed underclass and you know obsolescence
or it looks like something really incredible where those jobs that robotics and AI can do better
are the ones that you have to pay people to do because they don't want to do you have to
extrinsically incent them because the things that were intrinsically motivated to do
involve novelty and connection which are the things that the robotics and AI don't do as well
and so then to get to say all right well what would it look like to have a civilization system and
an education system that had the resources to really train people to the thing that they're
intrinsically motivated to anyways just a few thoughts that come to mind i'm reminded of this
friend of mine and she had a good friend who entered a beauty pageant and you know how in the
beauty pageant they have the gown thing and then they have the bikini thing and then they have to
talk right there's some interview well she was the first person to be in the interview part
and they asked her the question if you were a parent what would you teach your child but she
misheard it and what she heard was if you were a parent what would you teach your child and so
she made the response it's probably the best parenting advice ever which is i would teach them
how to catch worms and how to fly and you know actually it's pretty good
because in a way that is what we need to do is be careful about the flexibility of that
and and the other thing is it's not just parent child i really want to hold that in this room
that when we're talking intergenerational we're also talking the elders i'm i'm right now living
three generations in the house and it's um let me tell you it's not easy actually and it's it's
not easy because all of us have been trained to be in a world in which our education our profession
our identity has been about our individual success not being a burden not needing each other we
have been taught to not need each other and successful parenting is making a child that
doesn't need you okay so my mother is also suffering from the same epistemological glitch
and she feels as a 94 year old that she shouldn't need me to take care of her that she is a burden
if uh if she needs me um but this is a fantastic ripoff because since she's been in my house
i have learned more about how to live and incidentally how i don't want to live okay
because this is something that our parents can teach us not just how to live and what wisdom
they have but also what we definitely don't want to repeat and there it is that's the continuity
and the discontinuity and i am so grateful for the ways in which she has taught me not to live
um and as she gets ready to leave her body um what i'm doing with my days right now
when i tend her wounds and i make her food it's a lot of work you know um
is i'm actually making a home for her
inside me
for when she leaves her body
that's what i'm doing it looks like i'm making a home for her in my house
but when she goes she doesn't go does she she's still living in me what room is she living in
a room of resentment
how do i tend that habitation and and then when i start to do that i'm also paying attention
like how are my kids doing with this what's sort of a what's sort of a house am i inhabiting inside
their world um and paying attention to what's happening in this intergenerational fabric
because i cannot carry with me into this uncertain future the the burden okay there's the burden
the burden of that resentment that i have i can't bring it with me i don't have it i can't right now
we have other things to do so anything i can do between now and the time she leaves her body
to tend that and i don't really know what that means nobody ever taught me how to do that i don't
know what the heck that means but it's really important work for how how i go on when she's gone
something that you said that brings up a a couple of thoughts that i find really interesting i
why in the wealthy industrialized world the nuclear family home is the almost
universal default setting when uh intergenerational family was historically for a very long time
and for the majority of human history and are what were genetically adapted to a tribe was
and it's really interesting to get that for the entirety of human history
the nobody ever lived outside of a band or a tribe and so we actually have evolved in our
genetically fit for um very very deep dependence and interconnection with about that many people
right 50 to 150 type people um and then it's so interesting how all the how many intentional
community projects fail and the default setting goes back to a nuclear family and one way of
looking at it is you know sartre said hell is other people and that having to compromise on
anything how the house is decorated the cleanliness of it who has the chores what's on tv anything
is just such a pain in the ass we if we have the optionality we go to not having to deal with those
things but then everybody is lonely and they watch other people on tv and they look at other
people on social media and they're on ubiquitous antidepressants and yet still don't want to
actually deal with the pain in the ass of other people and the only people that they will live
with is where the bonding energy of sex holds them together or the progeny the out the byproduct of
sex and that's what the nuclear family is like anything less than the bonding energy of sex or
children is not enough bonding energy to deal with how much we don't want to have to deal with
other people and yet ubiquitous depression anxiety loneliness meaningless and this lack of connection
happens and it's it's fascinating because we have to actually get over that and it's obviously a very
difficult thing to get over um and especially to get over it without getting caught back in these
old oppressive versions of it so that to me is the the movement here of of how we're doing
intergenerational living but we're not doing it in the way it got done before because that
became oppressive in a bad way um yeah and and i'm thinking about how these these learnings
of what world we live in are are in the little the little bits of every day so for me this is
always about like who's going to do the dishes but this is a serious evolutionary question
it could be that the entire question of whether or not our species makes it is based on who's
going to do the dishes i mean i'm actually only kind of kidding because we cannot have community
until we can commune period we can't all these lovely projects of how to create sustainability
and this and that and how to remodel the world we can't do that if we can't need each other and be
needed it's it's not going to happen like there's there's no amount of modeling and and working
toward making a rule set that we're going to live within if we can't commune um and so
so we were talking about this earlier the dishes so in a lot of households what you get is you get
a chore wheel or you get a you know um who's going to do what when community you know intentional
communities are famous for this this sort of articulation of how everyone's going to
produce their responsibility and participate in the things that have to get done the toilets have
to get clean the food has to get made the dishes have to get done etc um and we had a this retreat
recently at at my house with these people that have been doing warm data with me and we had this
moment where it was like well let's make the chore wheel like no what if we just don't
what if we actually just leave that to the need to pay attention to the relationships
in the group 40 people in a group that's a lot of dishes
so what if we just did that and um it because I had been you know with my own kids thinking about
well if I teach them that it's important to do the dishes on Wednesday I have taught them to look
at this abstracted version of what makes responsibility if I take the time to teach them
to pay attention to the relationships in the room who needs to do the dishes tonight is not
really about whether it's Wednesday it's about who's tired it's about who's busy it's about who's
upset who did you know there's a whole lot of information in the room about this but we don't
teach our children to pay attention to that relational information we teach them that Wednesday
Wednesday is the day that they do the dishes and that is an obscuring now that teaching is not
easily produced this was something my dad did with me all the time where he would articulate
okay so I'm making this decision because I'm looking at these relationships and so because
I'm looking at these relationships I think or I'm learning about but he did a lot of actually
vocalizing for me what he was learning the way he was seeing the way he was putting together
his response and that takes time it also takes mutual respect
yeah it's interesting the the structured rule set obviously isn't teaching them how to assess
the environment and to take responsibility and to communicate and but I'm gonna argue for it for a
moment the it's a relationship between virtue ethics utilitarian ethics and deontological
ethics in terms of the philosophical way to think of it and I never could make a good argument for
deontological ethics i.e. rule-based systems at the best choices based on kind of rule-based
systems it just that seemed like what you do if you assume that everyone is too dumb to figure
shit out for themselves and otherwise you want to balance between virtue and utilitarian ethics
virtue ethics being what is intrinsically right regardless of what's going to come from it and
utilitarian ethics saying well let's think through what's going to come from it and try to make sure
we're thinking through cause and effect well and of course we can't think through it perfectly
so we have to also factor what just seems intrinsically right and balance those so
I was always down with the balance of virtue ethics and utilitarian ethics the the argument for
deontological ethics and the Jews actually make this argument quite well in the kind of Talmudic
tradition is that the system that you're describing of where your dad explained his choice making
process out loud so you were getting to get all of the nuance and context works at small scale
and works for people who got that level of development and evolutionarily humans in the
same way I said like right in the current context the default setting is nuclear families
before the plow the default setting was a sub Dunbar number tribe right and it would never
get bigger than the Dunbar number which is so fascinating right that as soon as it would get
roughly bigger than give or take 150 it would always cleave and so there was similarly something
that made that the stable state and a huge part of it was as soon as it gets bigger than that you
can't actually have a single conversation that everyone can participate in both because without
microphones you can't you just literally can't hear each other across a huge space you can't
track that many people to say is everyone pulling their share in the way that you can with 40 people
and you just literally can't take enough time to hear everybody's views back and forth with
a thousand people to decide what to do timely enough to decide what to do so if you got larger than
that number some people had to have their life subject to the choices that other people made
that they didn't get to have a say in and they're like not fuck that I'd rather go be part of a
smaller group where I get to say anything so it's so interesting and then we only started to get
larger groups when you we had populated so much that tribal warfare started to become ubiquitous
and in the presence of things like tribal warfare if another larger group is going to come
if another larger group is going to come attack us then a couple groups will unify for survival
purposes in which case will sacrifice some of that autonomy and freedom for security which we can see
has been a trend since but in very very large systems where we I can't actually make good choices
about something that involves six continent supply chains and something that involves
division of labor that has thousands or millions of people like I can't see all of it to factor and
internalize all of it so we subdivide it into categories and we make rules and so the rule
based system is the idea that you have people like judges and people like specialists who are way
way more uh spending all their life thinking about these issues and actually embedding some wisdom
into the rules so that people who don't understand all of that complexity and or where it's beyond
the complexity that anyone can understand can at least be able to participate with the system
and so how do you and yet we also know that as soon as the context changes the rules aren't right
anymore and we also know that those who get in the position to make them have their own vested
interests and corruption and blah blah blah so we can see why the rule based systems have actually
succeeded because of scale and so then a question of in societies that can't just move back to small
scale because at a tribal scale you can't produce your own laptops and you're not going to move off
of laptops and still be relevant in the direction of the future and you have to have six continent
supply chains but you cannot possibly see all the effects how do you do very how do you do the
very high context choice making thing not have rules and yet be able to factor that scale i would
say this is one of the huge questions we have to face of how do we get tribal level bonding
beyond the tribe and actually at a fully global scale i think that this is what we're
having this conversation really about because it seems to me that the
the learning and the habit of that kind of perception starts at home
and if you don't have the habit of even trying that perception if you've already you know been
had the training wheels on the bicycle you know to say that you you're going to learn how to do
dishes because you're going to do them on wednesday right this is this is minutiae this is granular
stuff but the perceiving of systemic relational complex processes in the kitchen extend to the
possibility of being able to see them in other places at different you know scales in different
sizes and so i think for me this is where i feel like it's not the answer i don't think it's the
answer but what it is is this question of how are we going to allow these next generations to
actually perceive the world differently so they can respond differently so they can actually
help make it different in ways that actually i don't know that we can even generate the ideas for
because we're so deeply informed by the structures that we have been within
i have a couple thoughts on that but i think he said five minutes so is this should we wrap
two two more thoughts okay two more thoughts
so you're mentioning um when you were homeschooled how much further ahead you got when your kids
were homeschooled how much further ahead they got even though they didn't have and not just
even though but specifically because they didn't have formal curriculum that when
the kids were just reading Shakespeare they because it was a small environment with a tutor
and they got to ask questions which you can't do in a class of 30 people um why did he pick that word
and you get into etymology and then what is that reference and you get into the culture of that time
you get into history you get a much more curiosity driven system and the curiosity driven system means
people tend to become good at anything they really are fascinated by and love so when you get to have
a curiosity driven system the kids just become much more voracious learners and you get to have a
much more interconnected system where the kid isn't memorizing stuff they're learning stuff that is
directly interesting so they just naturally remember it um and you're saying what happens around
how we wash dishes and how we make choices is already that every kid is being homeschooled in
addition to being schooled based on however the parents are operating the kids are learning how
to be human based on that process so a thing that I find so interesting there's a um there's a paper
I found a couple years ago that if people are interested I will share in some uh maybe this
group here on a historical study of the statistical precursors of super genius was the name of the
article and so it was and we're not I'm not saying that this particular assessment of what a desirable
human is is the only um definition but it was specifically looking at polymathic super genius
people who contributed insights to fields that the specialists didn't across many many fields
long term and specifically it was also looking at the idea that we have much less of them
now than we did historically that Richard Feynman said he thought he would be the last generation
of great physicists and a lot of people have this assessment that there just have not been
profound breakthroughs in physics like there were you know him and you know pre that from from
kind of Newton on and some people say no that's not like one answer to why do we not have super
genius of the same level that we had during uh the enlightenment up through say modern physics
one answer is uh we do we just only appreciate it post-humansly one answer is we already got
all the easy stuff and now it's just too hard and it takes groups of people with AI and data
processing but there's actually a really good argument that we aren't developing people as
well as we're developed at the peak not the average but at the peak and there is an assessment
it's a very third real topic of why and the answer is that the super geniuses were almost all of the
result of aristocratic tutoring and this study was first found out in the west by Charles Sanders
Pierce the great arguably the greatest logician of the 20th century and the founder of semiotics
and he was trying to figure out why he was able to formalize all these fields better than the
specialists in the field what about his learning style made that happen so he looked at the super
geniuses of the past to see are there any statistical correlations he was trying to look at
anything from genetics to culture to unique aspects of childhood and the thing that really
popped out the most and then a hundred studies have found the same thing is that the people who
had that and you see this with Wittgenstein you see this with Newton there they were born into
aristocracy where they had exceptionally good tutors not a traditional educational system
and like one of the Dalai Lama is a great example right if you're the Dalai Lama the best lamas in
Tibet are tutoring you and not only all of Buddhist wisdom and history and politics and culture but
how to be a human and you're like yeah I mean I think anybody could be the Dalai Lama if they had that
tutoring but that's you can't democratize that right there's and you read meditations by Marcus
Aurelius and Marcus Aurelius was kind of you know the closest thing to a philosopher king maybe the
world has had and the whole first chapter he dedicates to his tutors and you're like why did he
do that and it's because when you're being raised in the height of the Hellenistic period to be the
emperor of Rome the top mathematician in all of Rome is your private tutor as a kid and the top poet
and the top historian and the top and you're like well and then this brings up a real interesting
question there's another study I saw on world-class mathematicians and it said what is in common to
be a world-class mathematician because it's so commonly been thought mathematical logic is IQ
is genetic and it doesn't actually correlate all that well the highest statistical correlator for
a world-class mathematician that they when we looked at people who were defined in a particular
way as world-class mathematician that they had in common is that they ended up studying with a
world-class mathematician while they were young and the insight is and you could say well they only
got that opportunity because they already had proclivity but that isn't actually kind of what
happens it's that accidentally they got into this environment you can't learn to think like a world-class
mathematician from a normal high school math teacher who doesn't think like that so you can learn how
to do math but you can't learn how to think math you can't learn how to think poetry from someone
who doesn't have that so then this science actually got very suppressed because it was
super third rail because when we wanted to get away from feudalism and the aristocracy and democratize
things you can't actually democratize this and or that was the idea it's like everyone can't have
mark israeli as his teachers right like one a very small number of people could and what's so
interesting is even when you come up to the Feynman topic von Neumann and Einstein both had
mathematician governesses as little kids where who was taking care of them at home were mathematicians
when they were little before they even went to public school and this thing holds and so then
I started to look at my childhood and Nora and I had this of like I was homeschooled and I didn't
have mark israeli as his tutors but I had my parents and their friends who were also thinkers
engaging with me in the topics I was interested in all the time which means that I had a curiosity
based and the thing that my parents said that was really good was whenever I'd ask questions that
they didn't know the answers to they'd say let's go figure it out and let's go find the books and
find the people that know it so I'm like okay I got a ad hoc version of aristocratic tutoring
that was enough for me to realize finding the right people to talk to was key so I started
seeking out great tutors and relatively young I started finding who were the top thinkers in
the world and topics and figuring out how to get them to be teachers and so something that I find
very inspiring about this is that most of the studies we have on human potential that do statistical
analysis it actually has nothing to do with human potential that whether we're talking about being
as compassionate and omniconsiderate as the Dalai Lama or as polymathic as von Neumann or
Charles Sanders Pierce those are developable independent of it's not a genetic thing that's
it's actually a developmental thing so then the question of could we actually make a society
where that was possible widely and there's a number of reasons why the answer in the past was
totally not except tribal culture is different but the reason why it hasn't been is if you have to
prepare most kids for the labor force because the society needs that it just doesn't make sense to
educate them that way and we can't afford putting that much investment into teachers to do that
thing and the people who are the smartest you can't have being teachers because you need them to
work in military manufacturing or in banking or in something like that but as soon as you start
thinking about technological obsolescence because of robotics and AI replacing us in the labor force
and replacing most of those other faculties can we have a much higher percentage of the total
human workforce be things like educators and therapists and being focused in human development
and get a radically higher level of training and then also restructure culture and family
and what you start to think about in terms of what we think is possible for average human
intelligence and average human psychological capacity I think can be radically reworked which
is something I find really inspiring me too I think it's rattling just radical and and possible
and just to close out I just wanted to say one thing that you touched on that's really important
is that these aptitudes and and this greatness thing whatever it is that you are learning to
soak into the grain of your wood okay the hum of your song that the thing that gets in in you
that thing is not just for study it actually plays into every single thing you do in a day
and so you know the fact that the governess is where mathematicians is really significant
because this ties into the artisans of the you know 700 900 year family
intergenerational studies is that the thing that's been getting learned is not just learned
while you're sitting there with the book with the teacher it's learned through all the whole day
it's in everything so there's that let's give you guys a break hang out have a conversation
generate some questions our thoughts responses con you know whatever comes up and then we'll
come back to this in how many minutes Daniel okay 20 minutes in 20 minutes
yeah 8 20 okay all right thank you
okay so um you're free to share some thoughts and perspectives and okay yeah so
um maybe do you want to say something you said something interesting in the break
yes you spoke a lot about teaching and being taught between generations parents children
and but
don't you think there is knowledge in in the newborn child how much should we teach
and what should we teach and why
yeah
I think the biggest opportunity to avoid catastrophe is to activate our innate capacity
to distinguish knowledge from opinion and I don't think that's an intellectual thing
or an academic thing I think it's I think it's something that every child
is capable of doing in the in the in the basic sense like I know I'm in this room with you
but if you ask me who used chemical weapons in Syria I don't know I have an opinion but
it's different I don't know that and given the fact that half the population of the world is now
under the age of 20 and that they're gonna they're already facing the metacrisis and the
grown-ups are incapable of dealing with it at present and all of our institutions are dysfunctional
what are your thoughts about about that relating to what you just said you know using how can we
bring forth that innate learning capacity that every child is born with to handle this
I mean practically in our educational policies and things like that
yeah
hi I have two questions and one is about or both are about the metacrisis that you described in
the beginning and the first is very personal it's how do you live with yourself and how do you
keep well mentally by seeing all this because most of us I think we know it but we try just
not to see it and the other question is the road ahead as you described it is very dystopical
and now we're talking more about a procedural way how to attack the problem and as being
theoretical do we see a vision of what could be or how it we a vision towards which we could
go towards in the way of breaking the dystopic away
yeah hi um you uh my Daniel yeah Daniel you said that we can't all have like at some point on
the in the discussion about education you thought you talked about how we can't all have Marcus
already a student but I think we might in five years or something when you've got
GPT six or seven perhaps we know is which iteration will break it but at some point that's also
going to revolutionize learning probably maybe some thoughts on that thanks
hello I have a question you talk about that we lack the wisdom of gods but we have this
great technology how do we attain the wisdom of gods or the wisdom needed to give technology
the right direction yeah yeah so it seemed like a thing that you both touched upon was paying
attention and then that seems to be an important thing and occurred to me that one one of our
fundamental one of the fundamental things that we do as human beings is to pay attention
and is it worth paying attention to how we pay attention is that a skill that can be taught
in isolation or is this something that just happens alongside other activities
so um my 27 year old daughter about three years ago maybe it was four called me up
and she was in tears and I said what's wrong and she said mom I I don't know how to be a good person
and I can't figure it out because every single thing that I do connects me to the destruction
and the exploitation whether I am taking the bus or whether I you know I'm wearing clothes or you
know going to the grocery store and getting granola it doesn't matter what I do everything I do
links me into this thing that you know we're describing as the metacrisis
and when your kid calls and says that
you can't brush that off you can't just deliver some canned script you know oh honey don't worry
about it you know you just can't carry the weight of the world on your shoulders it's not you can't
say that when your kid calls and they're asking that question you have to show up
with no bullshit actually and so you know the only thing I knew to say was
keep asking the question keep asking that question and know that I'm asking the same question and
I'm right here with you and that we will work on this together but we have no idea
so in that sense the the the kid that really wants to be a good person
this is so important she wants to be a good person
you know you were saying the other night oh but you have your line because it's such an
incredible line but um what I think happened with her and continues is that she has been
in an ongoing conversation with me since she was this big that was a conversation about how
are you perceiving the world what do you see what makes you see it like that
where did you learn to see it like that what if you saw it like this
so for me the the greatest learning happens in these moments when we begin to perceive
our own perception and and most of the time that happens in a way that's a little bit confusing
you know maybe it's culture mix up maybe it's a communication mix up maybe it's a whatever
but that moment when you begin to perceive your own perception uh and and my kids were
in it from pretty young we started in talking about that stuff pretty young they can handle it
they loved it um but but a lot of a lot of breakfast tables don't have those conversations
at them so I think we're we're kind of caught also in a limited understanding of what kind
of conversations you can have with your children and um and then there's I think a lot of times
there's a all kinds of developmental limitations that get assigned that aren't actually real
it's just that there's not a lot of households doing it so you don't know if you had a lot of
households that were you know doing epistemological stuff with their three year olds four year olds
starting with language right um they're pretty good at it by the time they're eight
and that's a different sort of way so that kind of moves through some of this they they can do it
it's there this business of I am a perceiver perceiving the world is is in there um if you
help it give language if it's held at the if it's held at the table it's there
yeah
yeah so your daughter's question of how do I be a good person when to do anything in the world
I am to some degree complicit with the world system and to not be complicit with the world system
um also involves not being able to really uh affect it um which means I can't actually
separate myself from the world that I live in to have my hands clean I am a part of a world system
and that doesn't mean that I just go along with it but it also means I can't be completely
free of its sentence right like I am a part of this world system which is very interesting um
and it relates to the question that you asked about um you know just how to emotionally process and
so that process one of the big steps of where that started for me was I was nine and I saw a
cattle truck from a factory farm taking animals from factory farm to a slaughter and you've seen
the trucks that have the holes for air in the side and I went over and I looked at it and the cow
closest to me was missing an eye and blood was coming from it and all the cows were in their
feces and terrified and um you know it was like a Auschwitz train car or whatever and um I grew up
eating meat without an understanding of what factory farms were and loving animals through that
you know it wasn't a cognitive distance because I didn't know better as a kid and um so I asked my
parents because I was I was shocked and horrified the way a kid would be and uh they said that's
where meat comes from and so I got diet for a new america read it you know that next day and then
dove into pita and going to factory farms and that was the beginning of kind of animal rights work
which then went from factory farms to then also looking at overfishing and looking at
whaling and then that brought environmental issues and that brought the interconnected
extreme poverty issues and just kind of the whole thing started but I remember starting with the
factory farm thing and getting to see the scale of it right getting to see uh that there were
more total biomass of animals in factory farms and there were in the wild and uh you know all
that kind of thing and uh that it's not like hunting it's not like an animal that has a natural
life and then we kill it's like a continuity of torture and I it was the first time that I was
suicidal because I didn't like the world just didn't make sense that my species could do that
and feel okay about it and I couldn't be complicit with it right so I'm like like fuck I can't
this world feels like a crazy house to me and I want out and then it wasn't that hard to think through
if I kill myself all the animals are still in the factory farms and all the all the kids starving
to death and blah blah blah all those things I didn't change any of it so it's like that's a
ultimately selfish move to get out of suffering myself it's a vicarious suffering so I'm like okay
I can't do that can my life feel like a success while that's still happening like that was a
immediate question of if I focus on some things and can I know that there are other sentient
beings that are in just utter trauma and torture and yet I'm stoked because my life is good and I
am like well I would have to I would have to not know what I know and I already know it so I'd have
to pretend to not know I'd have to actively disconnect which would mean I would have to choose
to be a sociopath right I would have to choose to disconnect I'm like all right so the only way
I can live in this world and just feel like my life is a success is as a sociopath and it just
doesn't work for me I can't do that I can't shut off what I know so I'm like all right if and you
know this was very naive this was nine years old but I'm like I have to in factory farms if I
in factory farms the animals aren't in that condition I didn't know the rest of the metacrisis
yet I can live in a world where that's not the case so I remember thinking if I die in factory
farms haven't ended then I failed at living in a way that I could be okay with and you know then
that just expanded from that to all the other issues and but what what it did is say I
I can't think about my life separate from life separate from the whole of all the things you know
I wasn't born into extreme poverty in Sudan I wasn't born with AIDS I wasn't born into a factory
farm I could have been I could easily be the consciousness on that side and I can't take
any merit for having been born on this side but I can do a lot more to get animals out of factory
farms than they can do for themselves and so that feels obligate right but like a like an obligation
I wouldn't want out of like a sacred obligation and and then the problem comes that I have no
idea how to do it and then the problem comes that I get some ideas and they totally don't work
right and so there is a kind of existential devastation and then if you pull yourself out of
that there's a naive optimism of how to possibly solve the things that will totally not work right
the early activist ideas I had of course got shattered on the rocks of how much more vested
interests and how much more complicated and how the solutions I had in mind didn't factor a million
of the causal dynamics involved and and so then back to existential angst devastation but then the
only answer is understand the problem better to know how to contribute to what might be adequate
solutions better and and I remember at being like okay so the Hippocratic oath first do no harm
we'll try to benefit things so I'll stop eating meat that comes from factory farms I'll stop
you know getting stuff that comes from sweatshops I'll stop but pretty soon like Nora's daughters
in sight I realized I can't drive in a car I can't take a bus that's on a road and not be
complicit with climate change and supply chains that get the cobalt from child slave labor mines and
on and on and so I'm like all right I've got to dwell in the forest and only gather things that I
can gather myself and and even then I realize I can't actually not cause harm and I can't change
the systems at all that way and so then there was this recognition that I don't get to be a moral
being separate from my species right like I am up I'm a part of a species I'm a part of
the world and so uh the inheriting the sins of the forefathers the sins of the world if I'm to
operate in it at all I'm part of which also means then I have an ethical responsibility to try to
change as best I can and so there's something nice about not feeling like you can have the
perfect moral high ground and recognizing no I can't but also not just accepting that and going
nihilist right saying like I want to endeavor to do better and I cannot do perfectly and so when
someone is trying to figure out how do I be a good person if it's really obvious they're dangerous
right because everybody on both sides of all holy wars is crystal clear that their side is right
and if you are really factoring all the complexity of you like fuck I don't know if the thing the
choice I'm planning on making is right I don't know factoring the second third order of facts
everybody else who's involved but you can't stay stuck in the because I don't want to be
over certain and because I want to factor appropriate uncertainty you can easily go nihilist
from too much uncertainty and just be like I have no idea fuck it I give up that doesn't work either
so you've got to say under partial and incomplete information not being certain
and yet being able to have relatively higher certainties than others what is and being able
to notice and correct for my own biases as best I can how do I make the best choices that I can
that are imperfect but are importantly better than other choices where I also realize that not acting
has moral consequences because I'm then complicit with whatever happens that I didn't do something
about so when I realize that there's moral consequence ethical consequence to both action and
non-action and that I'll always be acting under partial information then I've got to be really
comfortable with uncertainty and also comfortable with relatively better certainties that can inform
choice and yet my relatively better certainty still needs to be open to being radically changed
with new insight new information and so that's you know and it's real interesting thing about
having kids you know you're asking how how my experience I'm giving my experience as a kid
being exposed so a lot of parents might be like do I want to show my kids what the inside of a
factory farm looks like do I want to show them what extreme poverty looks like or what clear
cutting line in the amazon looks like because you know I grew up with nightmares because of those
things and you're going to traumatize them through the vicarious trauma of the reality of the world
do I not want to and have them have some happiness that's based on lies that makes them unfit to
deal with the world that they will end up having to face and where they can't be part of addressing it
so you know I would say no I want to choose to help them understand the world but
when are they ready for what things how do you help them process it I don't think there's a
formulaic answer for that how do you raise kids now where you can't predict what the adaptive
skills will be that they need but where you also are not just trying to optimize for their quality
of life even though you love them so much but for the possibility of life for the whole world
ongoingly that they can contribute to right and they want to they want that too you know I think
that's part of that thing is that this is not a parking place you can't just come to a position
and just lock in it's an ongoing shifting ever rigorous exploration of some some very tense
choices and what the what that means to be in that that work actually and the habit of doing that
because you have to be an uncertainty you have to be comfortable but not too comfortable in
that uncertainty because if you get too comfortable in uncertainty uncertainty then you become
shallow and nihilistic I mean either one for some people ambiguity is just a way of brushing it
off oh this is just a mystery I just can't know it so why bother which is actually plausible
deniability for doing whatever the fuck you want right and so I remember in your talk on Thursday
there was one word that kept coming up that was really important for me that I noticed
and it was the word justify you were Daniel was describing this metacrisis in much greater detail
than tonight tonight was plenty thank you and the word justify kept coming up in what way are we
justifying this action or that action or this approach or that approach and what's allowing
for that justification what are the underpinnings of that justification
um
what I was impressed with in my daughter's question
was that she wasn't looking for justification
that's that's that's really important and not easy
you know we talk about moving from unwarranted unwarranted certainty in into uncertainty and
unwarranted simplicity into the real complexity of things but uncertainty and complexity can also
be weaponized I can obviously say oh we can't know for sure such and such about climate chains
therefore continue maximizing GDP with oil or whatever the fuck I want to so we can weaponize
uncertainty and we can weaponize complexity by saying it's a very complex situation I can cherry
pick the facts to support any argument I want so the statistical warfare right a subset we talk
about kinetic warfare but then there's non-kinetic warfare and population-centric warfare the fight
for the minds and hearts of the people population-centric warfare happens through information
warfare controlling what people believe is true and um narrative warfare controlling the who they
feel is good and right in the end group they're part of and and statistics are just such an amazing
weapon right we wrote a paper the kinsolans project called how to mislead with facts and it shows why
you can write an article where all of the facts in it will pass the most rigorous fact checker
but because you lay cough frame meaning do I call them terrorists or freedom fighters do I call it a
protest or a riot do I call it undocumented workers or illegal aliens by lay cough framing which is
not a fact or non fact right it's adding moral valence or aesthetic valence to the thing by cherry
picking the stats because I can have stats that will tell very opposite sides of the story because
I'll have a Gaussian distribution of truths and I can cherry pick them and by decontextualizing them
oh the average person in the united states in 1815 only lived on a dollar and a half a day and now
they live on such and such yeah but they grew their own fucking food and they made their own house
and it wasn't mediated by dollars you decontextualize that fact in a way that made it nonsense um by
decontextualizing facts lay cough framing them and cherry picking them I can make any argument I want
with rigorous facts and so this is basically how mainstream journals lie um and or you know mislead
and you're talking about justification there's almost like there's a the dominant narrative
of a culture is the apologism for the power structure of the culture it kind of has to be
right and so of course if you look at the like you look at the way that somebody like the gates
foundation up regulates Hans Rosling and Stephen Pinker because if you made a lot of money through
capitalism and tech the thinkers who say capitalism and tech makes everything better because they
cherry pick and like offering them and decontextualize someone who wants that as the apologism to
support their power system and say why their power system is good they'll up regulate those
thinkers so we wrote another paper called the where arguments come from and it's basically
the arguments that start to proliferate don't proliferate for no reason and they don't proliferate
just based on what is objectively true they proliferate because someone funded that research
and then someone funded spreading it because it supports and someone funded it who has the
resources to fund it because it supports whatever that dominant system is so yeah the earnestness
to want to know what is actually true and not just true but representative right because I can
have a truth on one side of a cherry picked argument it's the process of wanting to bias correct
I think and trying to deepen earnestness is really critical so that's what you're mentioning on
just if I this is totally unrelated but there was one thing that I didn't say to your thing that I
wanted to say because I think it's more important than what I said so far there's a famous saying
in activism that if you aren't outraged you aren't paying attention and that was like from the 60s
or 70s but obviously now with catastrophic risk you know people can say more like if you aren't
freaked the fuck out you aren't paying attention but of course like Rumi or Hafez would say if you
aren't in utter awe at the beauty of reality you aren't paying attention and that's true and
it's the truth of that that makes the other one what it is because if reality was not beautiful
it wasn't magnificent I wouldn't give a shit about if it's going to burn down
and so if I don't connect to the awe at the beauty of it enough my outrage or whatever will
actually mislead me you know and so there's an interesting thing like am I people will ask
you know how do I process all the stuff am I optimistic pessimistic I absolutely see
possibilities for political economies and infrastructures and cultures that work within
physics and work with what I believe human nature to be that are implementable in time that create
both a desirable and doable world so I do not think that we have fundamental impossibility issues
that by no means means we will figure it out right but my my motivation is not because
I believe we will like it's actually not from some optimism like that it's
um one I think it's very healthy for people to have experiences that simulate death so they're
comfortable with death their own death and being comfortable with your own death you and comfortable
with the reality of death I think is really important for facing the world effectively
because I'm not trying to prevent the inexorable in that way I'm not freaked out by impermanence
um so I think being comfortable with death is one thing I think being awed by the beauty of life is
the next thing and then realizing that the fear of the outrage are only because I actually love
reality otherwise I wouldn't care and then tracing the fear and the outrage and the blame back to
that love and then saying how do I be best in service to it not because I know for sure it'll
succeed but just because it's the only thing that makes sense like it's the only thing that has
coherence to it and then I mean you don't have little kids in your house but when I had little
kids in my house this is probably the most important thing you can model and it's both
it's it's this this recognition I mean I remember saying I'm really angry because I care right I'm
really concerned about this and and whatever it is it was it underneath it is the the awe for the
magnificence of life and you know it's very important that that be part of the experience
of the day whether it's the raspberries on your granola or the you know a poem or a thought or
just you know when you look across the room and you see somebody that you love and it's just
incredible how much you can love them or whatever it is but but that is the reason
for getting up tomorrow and keeping on doing it and working with everything you've got.
There is no other reason because there's certainly no promise of success whatever that is even the
non sociopathic kind so I think that that for me has been you know with my kids and and I got that
from my dad too he was he he would do this thing where he would look at a tree or you know whatever
it was a forest or a tide pool and see a crab or a sea anemone and just just beam and say oh
you know what a beauty that one is or look at this fella he would say this little you know but
it was like this delight in life that superseded everything else and then but it fuels everything
the reason for studying everything is not because you want to be the smartest person in the room
it's because it's incredible.
Yeah it brings up something because my my area of focus has to do with the intersection of all
the possible catastrophes people might think that I'm oriented to catastrophize just psychologically
or pessimistically disposed and I'm very positively disposed as a person
and so I focus on those things because they're real things not because I'm oriented in fact
a lot of the people who focus on catastrophic risk are because they catastrophize
right and it's actually it messes the field up because it makes it very hard for them to work
together because then they catastrophize their relationships with each other and think they
can't trust each other and it makes it very hard to coordinate and um and but I mostly want people
working in the space who just I'll tell a story I have a friend who is very good in catastrophic
risk work and who is almost always uh almost cripplingly anxious and I pointed something out to him
that if someone shares with him a new risk that they come up with the fluorinated surfactants
that pass planetary boundaries or this particular thing with what's going to happen with the
twitter acquisition or whatever it is instantly he starts to think about all the second third order
effects and how that will accelerate collapse and he and he buys it and if someone tells him a
possible solution to one of them instantly his mind looks for why it's wrong but his mind doesn't
look for why the catastrophe might not happen and so there is a which is why he's good at that thing
but also imbalanced right and I'm like no I want you to do both like I want you to look for why
the catastrophic forecast might be wrong but I and right and I want you to look at why the solution
might be wrong and and right but you have a in uneven distribution so I said we're gonna do a
strategy meeting but I'm gonna put you on MDMA first because I want you to see that a part of
your epistemology is just the result of your own state that was conditioned in childhood for some
reasons I didn't know about him but I'm like I want to put you in a state where you feel
because what happens is only when the story says dread is coming does it feel true for him because
of the dread that is carried inside probably because you know whenever dad walked in it felt
like dread and that's still embedded or something like that and I'm like when you're in a totally
different state what lands as true because ultimately we're less logically formal than we
think there's like a felt sense of truthiness that's a big part of our epistemology and so
put him on ecstasy he was rolling and happy and then I'm walking through catastrophic risks and
solutions and he was doing completely different logic and I had to point out to him he's doing
completely different logic and so of course I want I want people to try to notice their biases and
correct them think through the same thing from a lot of different epistemologies and a lot of
different states and a lot of different perspectives but ultimately it's not
not some kind of negativity or catastrophic or pessimistic bias that has me focus on this it's
the love of life that wants to protect it so wants to understand what to protect
and how to be effective at that but there's like yeah it's actually an affirmation of beauty that
is at the source of it so I thought I'd say that I'm coming back to this attention question
um because uh you know the doom porn okay so so there's lots of people who talk about the
way that we have been talking about the metacrisis as this kind of super exciting doom porn and the
more you talk about it like the kind of more like oh it gets it's like you know and it can get addictive
um but you know I remember whatever it was when I was a kid growing up we were having
conversations at the dinner table that were not so dissimilar to the one we're having tonight
what are we gonna do etc I mean these conversations are not new
and there was the sense that oh if we could just get people afraid they would respond
they would we did a good job at that yeah and they didn't do anything well no they did what
well hold on let me finish yeah so the the the idea being that the opposite of the numbness
would be fear and pain if they could feel the pain or they could feel the fear they would respond
but what I'm hoping you're hearing is that in in fact the opposite of that numbness is sensitivity
and the sensitivity is got to be more dimensional than fear and pain it must include beauty and
curiosity it has to include remorse and it has to include humor it has to include lots of different
textures of sensitivity lots of flavors of ideas lots of kinds of relationships to explore all of
those in and that is what allows for a kind of ecology of sensitivity that that I think is that
attention that you're speaking to that's really important so I think it's innate it is there
it is there but it can get grooved in to various habits scripts tones of what's the tone of the
environmental movement yeah you you know what the tone of the environmental movement is right
there's a tone what's the tone of the gender activist space there's a tone and to to expand
those tonalities into much more multi tonal spaces is I think part of increasing that sensitivity
with you drive fear or anger a few things can happen one is you can desensitize people
right and everybody just goes numb and the other thing that you do is drive war and drive
scared radical actions and so one of the things that I want people to think about the most is in
whatever project you're campaigning for you communicate about it in a way that you think
will appeal to a particular demographic to make sure we really stop spraying the neonicotinoid
pesticides or deal with the climate change thing or deal with the abortion rights thing or whatever
the thing is but if you don't think enough about how that communication will affect the people who
don't agree and what the blowback of that will be then you're producing not just the immediate
movement forward of coalescing those who are going to respond you're also producing blowback
of other people who are not inert right who are political actors who disagree who feel
scared who feel what you're doing is endangering something that they care about and then they
employ some more powerful technologies and so then you just drive an arms race and the arms
race ends up having more consequence than the issue itself did right the degree of polarization
the break of the social contract the break of democracy in the process so just one very simple
practical thing in any kind of activism is think about the people that your message doesn't appeal
to and think about why it doesn't and how to include them in it and the blowback of the message
right and if you aren't doing that it's like a strategy 101 is not even being factored and
in order to do that you actually have to understand that perspective better
in order to do that you'll realize that the issue complexities and you realize that the strategy
you're pushing not just the messaging is the wrong strategy there's partial things right to it
but the things that why they don't like it and are pushing back are also real things that have to
be factored into the strategy the way we talk about this sometimes is as an ecology of communication
that everything you're saying is landing in an ecology how's it landing what is it allowing to
grow what is it prohibiting from growing what is it what is going to come out of this thing that
you are putting in the communication context and and incidentally this is true certainly if
you're a politician or an activist and it's also true in your house and attention to that ecology
of communication with your partner with your kids with your aging parents whoever you're speaking
with or in communion with is going to be responding to that what responses have you left open
which ones have you closed so this idea of i'm just going to say what i think and i'm not responsible
for the way it makes you feel is a mess actually that is a mess and and so this recognition that
there is this not only first order of i'm going to teach my kid to do the dishes so they're going
to do it on wednesday but also now i have just actually created a form of communication around
what it is to be responsible that dislocates responsibility and that was the second order
thing that i accidentally taught right so this ecology of communication i think is running through
everything we're talking about and it has to do with the thing we started with which is
what world are you perceiving and how are you going to respond to it the i'm not responsible
for how you feel snowflake i'm going to say what the fuck i want to say and you can deal with it
is a mess but the other side which is how you feel should completely control what i say and
that i'm not going to say anything that's going to ruffle any feathers is a total mess
and so there's a dialectic and it's very easy to polarize that dialectic rather than synthesize
it right to say because one side expressed in extreme sound so ridiculous i'm going to take
the other extreme yeah as opposed to there is a partial truth in each side of this dialectic so
should i not say anything that bothers anyone no do i care about the effect that i have on
other people and do i not want to have an effect that might harden them into their positions further
that's also true right so one very simple principle i would say is any value that you care about look
at the opposing value right ecclesiastes there's a time to kill and it's time to heal and to sew and
to reap well how do you know what time it is there's a there's a discernment that is a there's a
presence and a discernment that is a higher order value than either of those other values it says
how to navigate that dialectic so if you take whatever your belief on a topic is as the thesis
then say who is who are the smartest people i can find who really disagree with me on this
find the antithesis see if you can understand their reasoning really deeply deeply enough that you
can express it and they don't need to correct you and then see how it changes your position and if
there is a synthesis that is a higher order insight that contains elements of both of those so on
values seek the values dialectic well it's about personal freedom well it's also about collective
responsibility it's about the value of the traditions that have served us it's about the
progress into the new world right find whatever the value is seek the opposing value see how they
exist in a dynamic tension find the proposition find the anti proposition find the synthesis
it's amazing how something that simple can guide so much and sometimes the thing you're looking for
is in another context um i i have found so often that i'm just asking the wrong question
and that when there is a polarity like that that if you ask a question that's in another context
the polarity undoes itself most of the time in order to really hold a polarity it requires
a reductionism it requires a decontextualization the more context you add the more that polarity
is going to dissolve um and and then it becomes oh well what question actually were we working on
so it can be a real distraction to think you know if the question is how am i going to get
my kid through fifth grade i have to get him to be you know get good grades and be a good good kid
uh that's a very different question then how am i going to support my kid to figure out how to be
in a world that's really difficult right now and the two are probably the same question
probably one of the reasons your fifth grader is struggling is because they're struggling
with things that are floating around in the in the sphere of shared information in the common
sense if you know beginning to show your kids that you are an advocate for them that together
we're going to walk into this unknown future makes it a lot easier to sit through fifth grade
what you said just reminded me of a couple things um that my parents did that i think are really cool
that they held as like important principles of parenting teaching one was um my dad was really
into asking kids what do you think happens to consciousness after death and questions around
free will and questions that no person has any good reason to have confidence in they're at the
boundaries of philosophy so he's like the kids thoughts are totally equal equally valid to my
thoughts on it because it's not a topic that we have good epistemic basis to know so we get to have
we get to come into symmetry and have a conversation where i have reason to be interested in what they
think about it and i can't actually claim any authority in it and although it was such a cool
insight to try to find context in which you can be in symmetry and i thought uh another one of the
ones was uh he said that there were so few times that the adult was interacting with the kid where
the adult didn't have an agenda for the kid and the kid could feel that they want me to do my chores
or do my homework or behave a certain way or and to spend a genderless time with them where you just
come in interact and find out what they're interested in and follow that and how profound
an experience it is when a kid has someone there that is seeking to facilitate them but not with a
direction i love that i think my dad was really curious um he was always very aware that the
problems with epistemology says they it's hard to know where the edge of your epistemology is you
know you get caught in the matrix and um so he was always seeking various experiences and possible
relationship with those potential moments where you get a teeny peak outside the epistemological
box right talking to people from other cultures um various kinds of of you know he worked with
people with mental health issues because they were able to perceive the world differently talking to
children in being in relationship with animals and other organisms um trance um various kinds of
psychedelics and any chance he could get to be get a tiny little peak outside the way that
so many ideas have formed around each other that we don't even know how we're holding them stuck
together um and so as a child he would he would play i mean he was the agenda was not
the agenda was what's she gonna say what's what's what can we find here because i don't know what
world she's seeing and this is a great opportunity to get another viewpoint and i i loved that i felt
like oh boy i am important and um and i was important and that was such a great thing to be at the
table with all these important people and be seven years old and know that i had something that was
important too yeah i mean it's interesting parents can definitely raise particularly
parents of lineages of success can raise their kids with a thought of their importance that is
massively oppressive right but it's also interesting the studies done in the u.s where uh teachers were
told that a group of kids that were moving into the class from another school that had all been
failing were a students and because they wrongly believed they were a students they treated them
differently and the kids became a students um and it's interesting how much the sense of the
meaningfulness of the kids life that the people facilitating them bring in can actually reflect
in who they become so recognizing we're probably at time and on the topic of your dad giving the
sense of that you were important i uh i think that your warm data work is one of the best second
simplicity um teaching methods i've ever come across because when you're describing it to people
like conversations about very mundane things uh where you're just changing context they don't
get that what you're actually doing is teaching people how to see through lots of different
perspectives synthesize those perspectives um so i'm really happy to get to have this little
dinner time with everybody here tonight i don't live in the area norah lives in the area and i
was just thinking about all the topics especially if anybody here our parents are thinking about
being parents that we opened up some of which are huge like yeah what are you gonna is Stockholm
going to be key of at some point and um is the whole world going to go through these massive
transitions and are you raising your kids to perform a job that won't exist by the time they do and
on and on and to not leave people there i was asking her at the break if she would offer some
kind of warm data process on learning and she said it's already booked and so i thought that'd be a
good thing to bring up before we close thank you uh yeah so the 26th we're gonna be doing a warm
data lab here in this very room um and i think we should probably do it on learning what is learning
in a changing world october yeah yeah just in a few days will you be gone by then darn um
and yeah thank you so much this was so much fun thank you this was yeah uh we didn't know
what we were gonna talk about just open conversation and we actually don't we maybe only had three
conversations ever so we're just getting to know each other and this is a fun it and thanks everybody
also for coming i hope something was useful interesting we're gonna hang out and be available
to talk so we're here for a bit yes and thanks and to the people thanks who hosted this daniel
thanks ana thanks yohanna for the dinner and everybody else who helped to put this together
