One technology the government in this region has really taken to heart recently are these things the drones
We've seen them being used for classy photography for
gratuitous selfies and of course for deliveries with both Amazon in the US and Alibaba in China
Considering them for getting packages about the place
But here in the UAE they've started looking for other uses for drones and that's led to the competition going on over there
It's called drones for good
Dubai doesn't do things by halves
So this is a big deal here teams from all around the world have flown in to show the judges their prototypes the task to
Demonstrate how drones can improve people's lives and welcome first drones for a good event here in the UAE
Which is a two-day celebration
There's a million dollars up for grabs for the winners in the international category, so this is a serious business and
You wouldn't believe the number of issues that can be solved with a drone at least when there's so much money up for grabs
From heavy lifters to heat-seeking poacher detectors all drone life is here
For example, I didn't know that fog was an issue in Dubai
But it is or at least it was until the team from Khalifa University invented a drone which gets rid of it
From several years we have a lot of pilot car pilot accidents and disasters happening because of the fog and also the flight
The airway companies and people are really getting annoyed when their flight is diverted
We are doing an extra ordinary experiment in extra ordinary environment using a concept similar to cloud seeding
Which causes rain this drone can carry 40 kilograms of a salty solution
Which it sprays over the fog breaking the dew point and dissipating the mist now
You'd need about seven of these to clear a runway within 20 minutes allowing pilots to take off and land safely
This is an autonomous drone
Yeah, with the no need for joystick to control it really yeah
Just we put the GPS coordination of place that it need to go and spray and it goes
Spray this solution and come back to the base station
One thing I did know about Dubai was its preference for the tall and the fabulous and with all this
High-rise glass about well, you do need something to keep it all clean. So bring on the flying squeegee
It has a washer it has a squeegee and with this drone we are capable to clean up a maximum of 40 square meter per flight
Now personally, I'm a little nervous about flying drones close to buildings
But at least the beauty of this dude is that the sponges protect the blades
So it's less likely to crash when you're wiping your birch Khalifa
and
Crash protection is something being taken to an entirely new level by team flyability
This is fascinating
This is I've never seen a drone like this before
So what was the point so this cage can rotate around the inner frame of the robot
So the part with the propellers in the motor. Yeah, so that if the drone collides against the obstacles only the cage will rotate
With and the inside we just stay vertical this kind of gimbal thing here is fantastic
Because that's what they strap astronauts into isn't it to spin them around
Can you give us some examples of where you see this sort of drone being used? So basically this drone can go anywhere
where other drones cannot go like
Inside collapse buildings anywhere where like there's a lot of trashes and where you cannot have a perfect control of the robot
I mean you can bounce off the wall. Yeah, that's the point because I don't think there's any other drone here that could probably
No, they probably cannot do that. The pilot is actually flying the robot inside the house
So he does not even see the robot anymore. He actually only
Uses the video link from the drone. Whoa
You're in the final what's the competition looking like we are quite confident today that we will have a better demonstration
So that we'll have like a good score. That's amazing
