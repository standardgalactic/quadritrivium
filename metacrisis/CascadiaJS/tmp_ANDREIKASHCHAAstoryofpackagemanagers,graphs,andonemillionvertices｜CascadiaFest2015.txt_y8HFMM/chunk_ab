two followers because otherwise it would take me more than two weeks.
So, my friends, today we started our journey from request animation frame. And then we helped
the force basically out to escape the 16 millisecond window. And then we defeated this
hairball monster and saw the hidden communities within the graphs of package managers. And finally,
this visualization of GitHub concludes our journey into the graphs today.
But it will continue in this repository. So thank you very much, guys.
