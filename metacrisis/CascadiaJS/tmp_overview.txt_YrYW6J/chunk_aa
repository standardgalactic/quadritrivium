Checking CascadiaJS/ANDREI KASHCHA A story of package managers, graphs, and one million vertices ｜ CascadiaFest 2015.txt
1. **Request Animation Frame (RAF):** RAF is a way to mark the screen as needing a refresh all of the content on that page. It is a callback function that fires before the next repaint, allowing for smooth animations in web browsers by updating the rendering at the correct point in the cycle.

2. **Package Managers and Their Dependencies:** The talk discussed package managers for different programming languages—Node.js (npm), Ruby (gems), Go (packages), and JavaScript (composer with 65,000 dependencies). These package managers have a vast number of dependencies that create intricate dependency graphs.

3. **Visualizing Dependency Graphs:** The speaker visualized the dependency graphs of these package managers, highlighting the complexity and interconnectedness of packages within each ecosystem.

4. **Human Aspect:** The speaker emphasized that behind every package or dependency, there is a human being who has invested time and effort into creating and maintaining it.

5. **One Million Nodes Graph on GitHub:** The final visualization presented was a graph of the GitHub network with 1,117,000 nodes, focusing on users rather than repositories or packages. The graph revealed influential figures like Majamba (GitHub's co-founder), TJ (another GitHub employee), and others who have significant followings.

6. **Hidden Communities:** The visualization uncovered hidden communities within GitHub, where users tend to follow a specific set of individuals, forming tight-knit groups.

7. **The Hairball Monster:** A large green cluster in the GitHub graph represented a group of users who mostly follow each other, leading to questions about why these connections are so strong and exclusive.

8. **Conclusion and Continuation:** The talk concluded with the GitHub visualization, leaving the audience with a sense of wonder about the intricate relationships and communities within the developer ecosystem. The speaker invited the audience to explore further in the provided repository, indicating that this is an ongoing exploration into the structure of social networks within the tech community.
