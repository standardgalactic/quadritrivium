I was addressing a big group of people at an Ivy League university this week and we
were talking about origin of life but for some reason I got zero scientific questions.
People kept asking about my faith.
Or do you feel like uncomfortable because of your religious views?
So I didn't inject any religious convictions in my talk.
That's true.
But nevertheless you have some.
I think it was because they were trying to use it as an excuse for my not going along
with their nonsense proposals on origin of life.
And at one point I said, look, my faith in Jesus Christ means more than me than anything.
Now there is a Christian guy there wrote to me afterward and he said, you never should
have said that in a gathering like that.
Made you sound like some fanatic.
This is life.
What I was giving them was life.
What I was presenting to them was a way out.
Somebody who's passionate about Jesus.
I'll tell you there is a narrow way that leads to life.
