but certainly has the opportunity at one given scale to have deterministic chaos. And I think
just in saying that, you're perfectly licensed to talk about free will. In fact, it would be
difficult to imagine anything that plans and selects one of a number of ways forward. Those
counterparts we were talking about before that could not be construed as selecting and thereby
manifesting a pincing at least a minimal kind of wilfulness in the sense it has to do selection.
Well, could argue, well, does that mean that natural selection is selecting you willfully?
Does it make a choice? Does it have free will? I'm not sure about that, but certainly if you
have a genealogy model that sees itself doing its natural selection of the best counterfactuals
about what to do will say next, then that would I think be part of this sort of minimal selfhood
that would be undeniably a representation and an inference and a recognition of my free will.
If I was able to infer that you were sufficiently like me and presumably had the same kind of
genealogy model, I would also infer that you had free will and you would behave as such and I would
secure that evidence by talking to you or just watching you and I would also leverage it. I'd
also use that as theory of mind to infer your intentional stance because I see you behaving
in a way and if I behaved in that way, I would have selected that plan and therefore I would have
made that kind of choice and that would tell me the kind of person you are. So it brings us back
to the priors that characterize all of us in this instance. If I can infer you very accurately,
we share the same prior commitments. We have very, very similar problems.
Okay, thank you.
Amazing. Professor Carl Friston, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. It's been a
pleasure.
I've enjoyed myself greatly. Thank you very much indeed.
Wonderful.
