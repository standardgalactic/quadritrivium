Well, it's it's a thrill and an honor to be here with you guys like frankly. I'm just so pleased
Maxwell it's an absolute pleasure to have you here today and I want to thank you for coming on the show because you're one of the
Uncommon type of combinations that I that I love talking to and find, you know, so enlightening which is a
philosopher who's also fluent in mathematics and I think that brings an interesting rigor, you know
To the philosophy and then there's actually like a really cool interplay between
Philosophy and mathematics and science. So I think I think you gain a lot as a philosopher the more
Science and math, you know and vice versa you gain a lot as a scientist and a mathematician the more philosophy, you know
Well, thanks very much for your kind words
I'm inclined to
Agree the philosophy and formal training go
Hand in hand and you know that it is something of a strange historical
Circumstance that we we don't think of philosophy as a very formal discipline anymore
You know, if you went back a hundred years
Some of the there was no separation. No, there was no distinction between science and philosophy, right?
Absolutely think back to the Prince Principia Mathematica, right, you know
Russell and Whitehead
Philosopher mathematicians, you know, it was very common back in the day and
Less so now, but you know, let's hope that the trend is reversing. I'm definitely optimistic about this
I think I increasingly find myself surrounded by a very technical
Colleagues who also have strong philosophical backgrounds
So, yeah
Hopefully things are changing for the better
Yeah, you know, it's interesting
I'm gonna take the time to ask you since you are, you know, a philosopher like by by education and I mean no offense folks that the
philosophers whatsoever because I think
Science has lost out on losing losing philosophy and philosophy has lost out on losing
Science and like the the rigor that you know confirming your thoughts against reality
Can have I mean, do you find that to be the case?
Which is that I find a lot of philosophers, you know, without that grounding kind of in in science and mathematics
They spend a lot of time
Pontificating really about things that just amount to them to the vagaries and ambiguity of like natural language
Rather than than being able to map it to something symbolic something concrete, you know
Well
So I think I think it depends what kind of
Philosophy we're talking about. I mean in in general I think
The ultimate problem is the being a philosopher of science is
difficult because you have to be a philosopher and a scientist
And usually when you're training you can only do one PhD
So, I mean, I think to be like a proper
Philosopher of science, you know, you would have to be familiar with the the history of philosophy and contemporary philosophy of science and also
To get some proper training in the discipline upon upon which you are
Directing your reflections
and so, you know in my case I had to do a lot of
kind of training on my own so my my
Most of my coursework
was in philosophy and cognitive science and so the the the more formal stuff that I wheeled
I've had to teach myself as a kind of side job
So like when I was doing, you know, my master's and my PhD
In philosophy and cogs I I would also be teaching myself math on the side and I think that you know to
to to to
You know
Exists effectively at these intersections. You can't help but
Get some multidisciplinary training and I you know, I think a good philosopher of science is necessarily a polymath
In some sense like you you need. Oh, thank you. Absolutely, right
And I think that's that is what makes it that is what makes it a kind of a rare breed, right? Like, you know, like one of my favorite
Philosophers of mathematics is Eric curiel and he has so much great
You know content on on general relativity and mathematics and philosophy in general
But like you say there are these rare these rare
Combinations and or it takes a lot of self-study, you know to develop that. That's right. Yeah
And I mean, you know topics like the free energy principle and active interference are inherently multidisciplinary
So it's it's beyond just like the philosophy and the math
You know, what if if you're in some sense if you're doing it well
then
Insights from every discipline will wind up making contributions to the way that you're thinking
FEP theoretically, so yeah
but I
This is one of the things that I love the most about our intellectual community
Around the FEP and active inference is the multidisciplinary the multidisciplinary nature of it
And that's sort of unavoidable, right?
So, you know, the free energy principle
Which we'll be discussing today is an explanatory principle that
that its proponents at least report applies to
every scale at which physical systems self-organize and
therefore, you know
Insights from all of the different disciplines working on on all the different kinds of things
Become relevant and the FEP then acts as a kind of like meta-theoretical
architecture to fit these claims together in a way that's tractable
From a physics and from a mathematics perspective. Well, one of my earliest childhood memories is
understanding how Cartesian coordinates work when I was I guess I
Yeah, 11 or 12 years old
Kind of really like understanding the mechanics of that and going like wow, like there are disciplines where there are exact
Answers to the questions that we have
And so yeah, I was always very into the sciences and math, but I've also always been very interested in the big questions
And by the time I was done with high school, I was I was either going into
philosophy
Physics or film and so I ended up deciding to go into philosophy and I
I remained a physics and math geek throughout so I'm self-taught in a lot of ways and
Yeah, I ended up specializing in philosophy in cognitive science the philosophy of cognitive science and
Formal approaches in cognitive science in particular, you know, when I was doing my undergrad
The embodied inactive embedded extended traditions and cognitive science were very hot
And so I learned some dynamical systems theory
And I was very into ecological psychology
Which is a branch of psychology that attempts to apply principles from physics to understand action perception loops
so I was very into all of this cluster of ideas and
Around late 2014 early 2015 I was exposed to the free energy principle and the ideas of Carl Friston
In part by reading this this really wonderful and by now seminal paper of Andy Clark's called whatever next
Which was his famous BBS paper where he kind of reintroduced
the predictive processing framework
and
You know active inference along with the free energy principle
so that
essentially
Combined everything that I had ever found interesting in some sense and I had a real kind of conversion
experience if you want to call it that
and
So yeah, I I had the pleasure and privilege of meeting Carl and the flesh in May
2016
at a decision-making conference in Montreal and
You know, you've spoken to Carl a few times. He was
Very typical of Carl. He was very extremely generous with his time and friendly and insightful
and
at the time I was working on
Sociocultural dynamics and I was wondering whether it was apt to apply the free energy principle to explain this kind of you know
ensemble dynamics and you know Carl
responded with an affirmative answer and
Encouraged me to you know, take this seriously and exchange with a few other people
And what began was a very extensive email correspondence that turned into some papers
Carl then became my PhD supervisor and I spent about
Yeah, the better part of two years in London
With his group at UCL learning the ins and outs of the free energy principle
Yeah, and so
So I guess that's that's sort of my story and how I met Carl
That's interesting, you know and the free energy principle. So you learned about it much earlier than than I did
I wish I didn't know about it earlier
But I didn't come across it until I guess a couple years ago
Whenever the first, you know, the first MLST episodes that we did on it
But I had had quite a bit of Bayesian, you know background up in that point
So when I first saw it I thought wow, this is it's really ingenious, you know
I like I'm fascinated by it and we wanted to learn more and so we've had we've had professor
Friston on the show a couple of times and like you said
Tremendously insightful, you know, one of the most brilliant people I've ever spoken to it's such a joy
To talk to him and I think even though we he's been on the show a few times and talked about we should probably frame up a little bit about
What the free energy principle is absolutely? It'll play a big role in our
Communication going forward here. So let me take a stab at it. Absolutely. That's great. I'm sure the expert like I
Well, you're usually really good at summarizing
well
You know what fast states me about I think is and I want to get to the the crux of this this
Beautiful statement that was made about it being the ultimate
Existential question right because usually we think
What does what does a life form or a thing even for that matter? What does it have to do to survive?
Right like this is kind of the emphasis of you know, are you fit the Darwinian sense?
You know, what kind of fitness does it take to survive?
But this the free energy principle completely inverts that and it says
Okay, if things exist if things survive what must they do?
Right, and it turns it on the head in this way, which is let's assume that there is a thing
You know and it and it continues to survive it continues to exist
Just by knowing that what must it do, you know, what what dynamics what behavior must it have?
Is that a fair framing and what is?
What are those behaviors that things that exist must do?
So, you know, I think the way that you describe things is
Accurate and an insightful way of putting things the free energy principle is not just a
basically a theory
according to which
things that exist
Must be doing this or that as in it's not it's not trying to
to tell you
Here's something that things do in order to exist what it's what it's telling you is we we observe
That things exist in the sense that
there are
there are
systems or
particles or things
That can be reliably re identified that are
separated from but coupled to their environment and given that we
observe these things that exist
What must be true of them? So it's a kind of inversion of the explanation moving to like kind of
first principles account of what what what must necessarily be the case
If you exist and essentially what the free energy principle tells you is that if you exist in
the sense that you are
Separate from but coupled to an embedding environment
Then it will look as if you're tracking the statistical structure of your environment or more precisely
It'll look as if the states or paths that are internal to a given
Your boundary of a given thing track things that are external to that boundary
so in some sense it it explains why
or it provides a
principle allowing us to
Yeah, explain why it looks as if everything that exists is
Yeah, tracking or representing depending on how you want to think about it features that are external to it
and
This this tracking or representing relation is
It is rather weak in some sense, but we're not talking about like necessarily
Contentful representations little images in my head what we're talking about is something I think more fundamental or existential
So for example, I can see from your your camera
Feed that you're wearing a
A button shirt
That tells me something about your environment
So I can read off you from the fact that you know, you're wearing a button shirt that you're probably not in the Arctic somewhere
I mean, I can see your background also that that's kind of cheating
The basically we we can read off anything
Properties of its in that of its embedding environment by virtue of the fact that it exists
Right, right
So, yeah, and there I think there's an interesting point in there
Which is that it isn't this exact one-to-one correspondence and I mean really how could it be right like how could a how could say a
subset of the system precisely represent the entire system, but instead it in a sense it's representing an abstraction
System, you know, and I mean, I think they're even good energetic arguments
Why that would be the case because you know you since you can't maintain total information you maintain an abstraction
Maintain enough in order that you can predict and track, you know behaviors
Because you exist you must continue to exist, but you don't require
Complete information only sufficient sufficient tracking. Absolutely. Yeah, heuristically
You can think of the the free energy principle and this is metaphorical of course, but as they a map of that part of the territory
