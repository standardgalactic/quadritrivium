Dualizing these to an entropy context where you know in in the density dynamics formulation
You would be talking about the entropy of states or configuration of states or indeed of the beliefs encoded by those states
Or the entropy of entire paths
So this caliber notion
But yeah, all of these are kind of uh joined up and as i'm sure we'll discuss a bit later
Yeah, yeah the uh, yeah the the free energy principle turns out to be
a way of writing down the principle of
Uh
Of maximum entropy
Yeah, so all these things are really like deeply connected. I would say now, uh, you know previously
I kind of prodded you about whether or not the physics
Could explain, you know consciousness and you said the physicist in you was really
Really, uh, you know leaning towards hoping it hoping it could so I want to take this
Chance while we have you to ask you about one of our favorite perennial topics on the show here, which is
Emergence, you know weak emergence strong emergence now, um
You know, there's there's different ways of looking at it different definitions of it
I think um what I want to ask you though is that
There are clearly certain behaviors, right that
Are best modeled and talked about and described mathematically at these higher levels
Of um of abstraction like thermodynamics. Okay. I mean, you know, just there are these bizarre
Kind of properties of you know entropy and temperature and free energy not
somewhat related to the free energy we've been talking about
That you can that you can develop these equations on right the first law second law third law of thermodynamics
And they apply to these kind of bulk systems now
like uh
In principle in principle and that's really the the the key word there, which is in principle if you could write down all the you know
details
Appreciating details of every particle and solve, you know wave equations and kind of massive massive dimensions. You may be able to
Uh formulate those laws, right and predict the emergence of those laws
But the fact is nobody ever has like they they they don't do that
We can't do that and and there's even the possibility that in mathematics like mathematically these
Effective theories, right where you try to do that you try to write down all the particles
Calculate integrals and averages they can sometimes end up with these singularities where you can't cross
You know that divide so I guess my question to you is is this which is that and if you couldn't cross a divide
That would be a strongly emergent
Phenomenon versus a weakly emergent one where you could mathematically cross, right? So i'm just curious if you think
um
First of all
If you think there's such a thing is strongly emergent
Phenomenon or if we're always be able to cross that mathematical divide if you will and then secondly
Even if we could is there really any point or is it better just to develop, you know
Descriptions at different levels and and just be happy with that at the end of the day
That's a really great
insightful question
I would be inclined to say that the free energy principle gives you a kind of heuristic or a map to tame
weak emergence
So maybe we could start there for a second. So the free energy principle applies in a kind of
multi-scale manner to
things composed of things composed of things and the kind of key insight
That you get from the study of ensemble dynamics in the free energy principle is that
um
things
Can engage in emergent behavior provided that they have a shared generative model
So if if you and I kind of encode the same dependency structures
Then we are going to react in
characteristically coherent ways to whatever we're experiencing and therefore
We will end up coordinated even if we're not directly communicating
So that there is a story that you can tell and I know you've had mike levin on the call here
On the show here a few times
Yeah, he's he's absolutely amazing. So this kind of like
Yeah, ensemble behavior that mike is interested in explaining has to do with the emergence of a shared generative model
So this again
It's the same core story, you know, you have things interacting
Over time and the the FEP says that if there are boundaries in the system
Between things then they will track each other across the boundaries, right?
So this means that over time things end up sharing a generative model and can then begin to display
Coordinated shared patterns of behavior
So I think that's really key
The you know and we discussed um Aristotle a bit earlier
This is again removing degrees of freedom from the parts, right?
If you and I are aligned on what this or that means it means that we're aligned on what this or that doesn't mean
So we are, you know, coordinating by uh becoming models of each other becoming good predictors of each other
Kind of sparsifying the set of things that we expect each other to do and over time we can arrive at some form of like
You know coordinated behavior and I think the the contention
Is that this explains, you know, biophysical emergence at every scale where we observe it
So there there's an argument to be made that really this is
Really a theory like a formal theory of
Well, I mean the the FEP itself is not a theory as we discussed
It's a principle that it's a formal approach to that begins to give you a grip on how to model
nested systems of systems of systems of systems
The cool thing is that the whole stack operates on the same quantity basically, so you have one objective function
It's the same pattern at every scale. It's the markov blanket that repeats
And it's this free energy minimization behavior
you know and
So that's I think powerful
You know this segues one of the applications of the free energy principle
Adverses is to design
systems that are able to perform inference at different scales using the same
objective function so the the variational free energy and if you introduce this time scale separation
Into the mix then, you know at the bottom of the stack you have state inference, right? So
I have hypotheses about what might be causing my data. I am generating
data through my actions and I end up selecting the hypothesis that accords the best
With the data that i'm generating, but you can do your parameter learning using exactly the same
architecture just on a slower time scale, right?
So you accumulate counts of state estimation and then over time you're able to
You know estimate what the best configuration and value of your parameters are for your model
And then similarly you could do the exact same exercise at the level of the entire model structure
And then you know that's where you get into the natural selection story that the free energy principle brings to the table
I embody a model
In my existence. I am kind of generating evidence for that model good models
persist and leave copies of themselves bad models are destroyed and dissipate
So you can really tell a kind of I think powerful multi-scale story
So yeah, I would say like there's not much that remains in the weak emergence stuff that you can't
You know address in a tractable manner using this kind of approach
Your other question about strong emergence is a bit more vexed
Um, you know thinking about this. I think the only thing that might really be strongly emergent is our conscious experience
Um, and there are reasons to think that that actually isn't strongly emergent, but just weakly emergent
Um, in particular, are you familiar with Andy Clark's notion of basing qualia?
Um
Not not quite. What is it? It's very cool. He cars. He calls this the meta hard problem
um, okay
Yeah, and what what Andy is basically saying is that well, uh, what we experience is qualitative sensations are just further inferences
Namely inferences that I am feeling this
Right, right. Well, that's that's very similar. You know, I really liked, um
Professor Friston's take on this and I'm blanking on on the uh,
On the article where he described this but but he said that, you know
When you when you're doing this free energy principle and you're doing this this inference once your once your inference has reached a sufficient
temporal depth and counterfactual
depth if you will
Then that's when consciousness can emerge because it can start to model itself and its own internal states and
You know this sort of thing. I think it makes a lot of sense. Um, I absolutely yeah, yeah
Well, you know, you're you're preaching to the choir here. Obviously I find that
Kind of explanation extremely compelling
Yeah, and so, you know, we also have some interesting
in my view, uh work on consciousness that we have, uh, you know
In a free energy principle adjacent
Kind of area and putting out for you know, nearly two decades
But more recently we've been looking at the question whether you can
derive a theory of consciousness directly from the free energy principle
Um, and so we believe that we can and the idea there is that, um, consciousness corresponds to something like an inner
Markov blanket so an inner screen. Um, so to back up just a little bit, um, uh, you said inner screen now
Yeah, we're gonna think of the humonculus
Well, so, uh, that's why I want to qualify this carefully. Um, you can think of any markov blanket as a screen
Of sorts. So it is, um, a screen in the and you mean a screen in like a mathematical
Yeah, exactly. Like in the sense of the, uh, holographic principle, uh, in physics, right?
So the holographic principle is a principle, uh, that originated in black hole thermodynamics
And it relates to, uh, our ability to encode information, uh, within a system
And what it basically says is that you can from the perspective of an outside observer
A given system can only contain as much observable information as you can fit onto its boundary
Um, the reason being that if that if that bulk collapsed into a black hole, uh, and there were more information than that, uh,
Then you classical information would be destroyed in the process. Yeah, exactly
And you would violate basically the principle of unitarity in quantum mechanics. So
Uh, you know, I mentioned this quantum information theoretic formulation of the free energy principle that I said I wouldn't get into
But it's probably worth getting into for like two minutes. Um, so
According to this formulation, you can think of the markov blanket as a kind of holographic screen
That separates the inside of a system from its environment
And it's it's a slightly more kind of computational take on what we've been talking about. So, uh,
You know, the active and sensory states of the markov blanket would correspond to
Reading and writing onto the screen, uh, or a measurement in preparation operations in the kind of quantum mechanics
perspective, okay, so the interesting thing about the markov blanket in this formulation is that by definition
Um, because it is constructed
Or contains all of the degrees of freedom that a couple, uh,
You know systems across the boundary, um, all of the classical information that you need to describe the coupling lives on the boundary
in some sense
so, uh, chris fields about three years ago along with mike levin and jim glazebrook
proposed that well, maybe
uh
The core architectural feature of systems that have consciousness
Is an internal markov blanket
Right the the idea being the the classical information that I use and bring to bear in parsing my
You know perceptual streams and deciding how to act has to live somewhere
And so the idea is it probably lives in this kind of internal
Uh screen of markov blanket. Interestingly, uh, there's a way of just taking this stuff that we were saying about, you know, levels
In the brain and just directly translating that into the markov blanket talk
Between any two levels of brain architecture. There is a markov blanket by definition whereby these messages are being passed
So it you can basically according to the model that we're proposing
So you have an external markov blanket, right that separates the
Uh the internal the inside of the organism from its outside
And then if you look at the these internal states, they have this structure of a nested
hologram in some sense, right? We're like, you have a series of screens
That are successively coarse-graining each other and that are therefore kind of resonating with each other
And so there's a whole story that you can tell about. Yeah the the emergence of something like
uh, yeah
Consciousness, uh, just directly from by appealing to the free energy principle
The kind of key to this architecture is that at the very top
Of this nested hierarchy, there is a right only layer that doesn't get further contextualized from by anything else, right?
And so there's a sense in which that layer is constrained to write down
And can only uh kind of infer itself into existence vicariously by acting on the other layers of the network
Um, and so the idea then is that this is where the
Kind of um, well, this is how you resolve the homunculus paradox first of all
Is that there is a layer that that is not observing itself?
It just exists to observe right layers below
Um, yeah, and so yeah, we have a a new paper that was just published
It's in a series of two or three papers that we're articulating
So I say this because like I think if if anything is a candidate for strong emergence
The only really serious one is consciousness
And the the absolutely utopian over uh, confident part of me thinks that like by
Combining, you know, some of the philosophical work that say Andy Clark is done around basing qualia with these
Computational architectures for conscious systems that we're developing based on the free energy principle
Somewhere in the vicinity of this if you if you you know
If you look at it for long enough, there'll be something
That'll emerge to resolve this
Issue so well, I guess uh, David chalmers will at least be happy that um, you've identified consciousness as the only
If there is something strongly emerging, it's only consciousness
I can't think of anything else frankly. Um, and I mean
Consciousness may ultimately be
inexplicable
But it also may not and so, you know, I'm uh
An optimist until I'm I'm proven wrong
And we're we're gonna keep working on this. I think you know
