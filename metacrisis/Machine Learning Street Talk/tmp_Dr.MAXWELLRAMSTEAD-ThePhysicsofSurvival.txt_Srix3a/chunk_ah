What we're proposing is just the very kind of basics of a sketch of what a
Mechanism for the generation of consciousness might look like
We're very very very very far from like a comprehensive question, but uh, yeah, so, um weak emergence
Oh, yeah, go ahead. Well, I was gonna say we weak emergence
Definitely a cool idea. I think the fvp gives you some tools to handle that strong emergence
I'm not sure. Uh, like if if anything is it's definitely consciousness
But maybe not
Okay, well fair enough and you know, I was gonna say what's funny about the free energy principles
It's this onion that just keeps on giving you can just keep pulling back more and more
Layers and I think we probably have uh, I don't know maybe centuries of mathematics, you know
Uh inspired by it most likely
Well, yeah, I I mean, I I think I think it is one of the
singular most important
discoveries
like
Of the last maybe 200 years like I think, you know
You you you've had long discussions with Carl so
Yeah, you yeah, I mean, I I think this is like, you know the this is physics of mind, you know
We are we are I think this is the same, you know to bring it back to mechanics
um, so Galileo, uh, basically destroyed
Uh, you know, it's the Galilean moment, right?
But like Galileo destroys thousands of years of
Philosophy inherited from the Greeks, right the Greeks thought that there were basically two kinds of stuff
There was the sub lunar stuff
And the super lunar stuff and then the sub lunar stuff was governed according to these four elements where you know like, uh,
things, uh, the
That were uh, earth
Fought fell down and things that were fire rows and stuff like that, right?
And the super lunar, uh, was all about like eternal perfect
secular this cyclical circular
Motions of like planets and so on right and you know, you can if you were
Around 400 bc and you you looked up into the sky
It really would look as if there were two different kinds of things too utterly distinct, you know the the stuff around me
You know rocks fall to the ground and uh smoke rises and water is cold and and so on
Uh, and the stuff out there
That just moves and perfect eternal spirals and so on
What Newton and Galileo, but I mean maybe in particular, uh, Newton
End up doing is to say well, no actually
Uh, it's all one kind of stuff
Like it's it's all, you know subject to the same fundamental laws
It's it's classical mechanics and the Newtonian kind of Galilean Newtonian moment is sort of like the split
Where like, you know the old way of thinking. Yeah, uh started to show
Signs of being incomplete and a new alternative arose
So kind of unifies all of reality under the auspices of classical mechanics
And I think the same kind of thing is at play here where, you know
We used to think that there was physics and then there's biology or maybe, you know, there's an information theory
Yeah, exactly or maybe there's like physics and biology and then there's the mind
But what the f.e.p. Is ultimately telling us and I you've heard this, you know from from mike and carl before
I'm sure is that there really isn't a distinction to make here
Like it's it's all just
You know physics in some sense and biology is just slow physics
And psychology is just even slower physics and culture is just even slower physics
And so yeah, I think we have the same kind of like radical quantum leap in the way that we
You know are able to think about the world that opens up with the free energy principle
Especially when you combine this to like the philosophy of sparseness and emptiness that I was referring to a bit earlier
Like I think what emerges out out of this is like a real
powerful constellation
To to think about the way that intelligence is expressed in physical systems
And you know, that's also why versus has adopted the approach like here is
Finally, we have the physics of intelligence. So let's let's build our ai systems on these bases
I mean, it hits exactly the phrase that that you said that it's so impactful and meaningful
Which is the hole is not greater than the sum of the parts exactly. It's radically less than the some of the park
It's beautiful
Well, listen max well it has been absolutely a pleasure to have you on so thank you so much for uh
Taking the time to join us and um and talk and
You know, I hope you come back on again. It seems like there's so much to discuss
I'd love to and you know, I am a long-standing fan of your podcast. So this was thank you so much
No, really, uh genuinely this was uh a pleasure and also an honor
So thank you very much for having me. Um, this discussion was extremely exciting and fun
And uh, yeah, let's do this again sometime. I I'd love to come back
Absolutely and best of luck at versus. I'm supportive of what you're doing there
Very glad to hear it
