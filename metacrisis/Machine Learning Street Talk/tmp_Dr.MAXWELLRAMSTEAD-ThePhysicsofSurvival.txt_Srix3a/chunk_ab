That behaves like a map
so
it is a
scientific
Principle that we can use to construct models of systems that appear as if they are in turn modeling or tracking aspects of their environment
And I think thinking about modeling for a second is useful here
So if you had a one-to-one scale map, is it Borges who?
Presents that in a in a story at some point. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, so a one-to-one scale map would be completely useless
Right, I mean just imagine the quantity of paper that you would need to
Have a map of say LA right a one-to-one scale map of LA it wouldn't be useful in the generation of
your actions
So the map is necessarily simpler than the territory
But that's okay in some sense right because the implication of that is that using the map you're gonna encounter errors
You're gonna generate errors
But in the active inference and the free energy principle approach those errors are the relevant signal
Basically, so all all you have to do is have a good enough map and act in such a way that you are informed by what your map
Contains in terms of information
And to in real-time course correct based on the errors that you're generating
So it's the these errors in the kind of oversimplified
Character of the model or features rather than bugs
You would need that in order to have a signal at all in some sense
Yeah, and there there is this iterative nature to it that I think is sometimes forgotten because
You know there are these two components and the free energy principle
one is
Fidelity how accurately does it kind of map to?
The environment like so so if you think of the the entity that's surviving the thing that's surviving
You know it has to have a model of the environment
It has to be have some degree of fidelity because if it doesn't it's not accurate enough to maintain its survival
But at the same time it also has to have adaptability because the information is never complete. There's always new
You know phenomenon occurring to it the environment is changing or whatever
So the model has to maintain a degree of flexibility, right?
And that's what this it's kind of entropy term in there is it's saying precisely
You know you need to maintain a certain amount of entropy because that is a form of flexibility. Is that correct?
I mean, that's absolutely correct and you can think of the entropy in a few different ways
and
The entropy term in previous discussions with Carl Friston
You have highlighted that it's technical importance. I mean basically what we are
What we're trying to do when we minimize free energy is
To increase the predictive accuracy of our model
So that is to have a model that
Generates predictions that are as close as possible to the real data that I'm ingesting
But the free energy principle
Allows us to in it in a principle manner
penalize the complexity of the model right because you don't just want an arbitrary
Explanation that as you know, you can construct an arbitrary
Explanation for any data set and you know
Well, you need to be deleterious if it's absolutely income if you have incomplete information and you model it
To accurately accurately in a loose sense, but actually you're just you're you're memorizing spurious
Information that doesn't generalize absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. And so the free energy principle
When you're when you're applying it and you're saying that systems that exist
Minimize this this quantity variational free energy
The variational free energy can be decomposed
Roughly speaking into predictive accuracy minus complexity. And so what you're doing is you're penalizing your gains in predictive accuracy
against
the the complexity cost of your model basically
Penalizing every new degree of freedom that you need to introduce into your model to explain the data
so in some sense the free energy principle is sort of like you can think of it as a
kind of like
Statistical predictive accuracy
But also Occam's razor, right, right, right. So yeah
No, no, it makes sense
I mean and that's it's this interesting balance and the free energy principle
Encodes that balance and I guess the simplest the simplest way possible
Let's say this is a sense in which the free energy free energy principle applies to itself because it's that's right
It's almost the simplest formulation of that of that balance, right? Yeah, and yeah, I mean
There are all sorts of ways to control for complexity that have been introduced in machine learning
But
Those all might seem ad hoc in some sense. What we try to do is to build in this complexity
control
Right into the objective function that we're using right so it's it's at the core of the architecture is that rather than just use reward
Which you could probably cast in terms of like predictive accuracy
So I think we have one more foundational concept that I'd like to kind of get on the table
And that is just a concept of a thing
You know because because a thing the idea of a thing is
Defined in a very certain way in the context of the the free energy principle and it's all about this this Markov blanket
And and we've talked about Markov blankets a few times on the show. They tend to be
Confusing, you know, I I tend to I almost visualize them usually as cells like in the human body
So like, you know, you have a cell and it has stuff inside and then it has the cell membrane
And then there's the stuff outside which is kind of the environment and that membrane in the sense is the Markov blanket
It's the set of stuff and states between, you know, what's inside and outside
But can you talk a bit about, you know, why Markov blankets are important what they are, you know
How they're defined
And maybe some of the edge cases like does an eternal flame have a Markov blanket. Why or why not?
That's those that's a great set of questions. So
you can think of the free energy principle as a
The same kind of thing as the principle of least action in the sense that it's it's a principle that allows you to write down
Mechanical theories or mechanics, right? So
Classical mechanics has the principle of least action and the principle of least action is basically a way of
specifying the
The conservation laws that we want to see our systems conform to in particular the the balance of the potential and kinetic energies
are zero and
The real trajectory of systems physical systems are those for which that balance holds
And maybe I'll just quickly interject here
It's not so much that we want them to conform to that just that they do
And that and that's actually key to the free energy principle too because it's not like
It's not like we want things to obey the free energy principles
They must obey the free principle if if they you know exist, right? Absolutely
I was speaking in the manner of a mathematician
Oh, yeah, no totally totally get it. I just wanted to point this out for our readers
Is it because as we go along like you are almost these are principles that in the case of classical mechanics?
Just are they're just the way
Things behave right and in the case of the free energy principle
If you survive if you exist you're inexorably drawn to this set of dynamics to the set of mechanics
Otherwise you don't exist. Well to get technical for a second
I think there are two issues
That that are both striking and that speak to what you just said so
Things like the principle of least action and the free energy principle and the principle of maximum entropy
They are in some sense true a priori or mathematically. They are mathematical truths
So you wouldn't try to falsify the principle of least action
Empirically any more than you would say try to falsify calculus or probability theory by coming up with an empirical
Counter-example so there's a sense in which like the the truth of these statements is robust and mathematical
Having said that it is a striking empirical fact that the physical universe does in fact seem to conform to these mathematical
Regularities, so it's sort of a one-two punch
in some sense and
Right, right. It's the unreasonable effectiveness of absolutely. Yeah
And it's getting even more unreasonable now with the free energy principle coming into play
So the way I like to think about the free energy principle is like I was saying as introducing a new family of
mechanical theories or mechanics, so
You have classical mechanics
Which follows from the principle of least action
And you have quantum mechanics and you have statistical mechanics
So basically the idea behind the free energy principle is let's get the rest of physics working in the background
So you get you get your classical statistical and quantum mechanics working with all of those
Yeah, all of that mechanics is in play and then you ask a simple question
What does it mean to be a thing in this context?
i.e. what could it possibly mean to?
Reidentify some state as the system as being the same state over time
and so yeah
Unpacking that question leads to a Bayesian mechanics
So Bayesian mechanics is a physics
But it's a it's a physics for the that kind of duly constrains
the system itself the physical system and the beliefs that the system encodes about the things to which it's coupled right and
That I think is really the key
for the kind of underwrites this whole construction
This is also what makes it unique among other
candidates in the cognitive sciences and the biosciences
It's that it is connecting the thermodynamic entropy of the states the system is made of
To the information entropy of the beliefs the probabilistic beliefs that those states encode
so the free energy principle is all about this hinge between the two and
The equations of motion that you write down using the free energy principle are constrained in both of these spaces
And that I think is absolutely the key to understanding what's going on here like the the system trajectories that you get
when you're writing when you're writing down an FEP theoretic
model of the system that you're considering it is
constrained both by the the physics and thermodynamics of the system and
By the physics of the representations if you will that the system is entertaining about the rest of the universe in some sense
And I think it's it's not without precedence in the sense that for example in statistical mechanics
You know back back when we're deriving Boltzmann's
Distribution and there were questions about are these particles do they behave as if they're identical or if they have the same attributes?
Are they are they are they the same particle and the same thing with poly exclusion, you know
It applies to some particles and not others. So there those are examples of where a statistical
Calculation a statistical property
Does map to the actual underlying physics, you know, that's happening as well. This is almost a
Big step up from that. It's like, you know, it's a generalization to a much richer set of
I don't want to say conservation laws, but a much richer set of these
Flow laws, you know, absolutely and dynamics. Yeah, that's exactly the right way to think about it
In fact, it what's transpired over the last few years is that really you can think of the free energy principle as a kind of
generalization of the second law of thermodynamics to open systems
So, you know that the kind of universality that the second law
Has with respect to closed systems
the free energy principle has with respect to systems that are far from equilibrium and as Carl has, you know
Pointed out the Markov blanket is precisely the apparatus that allows you to move from the equilibrium to the non-equilibrium
regime in the sense that you are now specifying the
Interface through which the system is coupling to its environment or the particle. So the word system is a bit ambiguous
Usually, you know, because we could mean, you know, the whole in agent environment system or we could mean
The specific kind of compartments that we're considering is agents
Yeah, so the
You can think of the the free energy principle as applying to
Systems that are not at equilibrium and as giving you the dynamics of like particles within the overall system
If there exist particles in the system, if there are these things that you can poke and re-identify
Over time, right, then the free energy principle will basically tell you how they behave
Yeah, and it's it's interesting because almost the Markov blanket really provides a concept of
stability because when I think about equilibrium, right when when I'm
You know the thermodynamic kind of equilibrium what comes to mind at least visually to me is things that are kind of
Unchanging and just kind of quiescent and they're just sitting there like a goo
You know, that's kind of all thermally stabilized and never never moving around
But that's the point the key point there is stability
I can say it's a stable sort of unchanging system and what the Markov blanket gives you as a way of defining a
Property that's stable about the system and yet the system as a whole may be far from stable
It may be in flux and moving around all the time and jiggling
It's the eternal flame where the boundary is, you know kind of changing all the time
But there's this property that you can map from from time to time that that's still there and so it's the stable
The stable blanket even though it may have a different form
It's still got a boundary between some stuff that's inside and outside that's identifiable
You know from frame to frame if you will yeah
And I'd I'd go even further and say that it's the self identical pattern that you see at all scales of self-organization
So it's got this kind of fractal quality to it where you know the it's blankets of blankets of blankets of blankets
So I mean you can think of the brain for example, so the brain has this nice Markov blanketed structure
At several different scales, so you can start with neurons and neurons have their own
Markov blankets that yeah, they are membrane
Yeah, precisely, and it's probably the most obvious, but you can go downwards in scales and upwards in scales and what you recover
are
You know similarly Markov blanketed structures, you know from the the from the voltage gated channels
on a cell membrane to dendrites
to the you know arbor essences that form up to the the
Neurons Soma and then you know
You could go the other direction to right from neurons to canonical micro circuits
to
More specialized brain regions to brain networks and so on all of these things are things
They can be reliably re identified with their own kind of
Properties and features and connectivity to other things
