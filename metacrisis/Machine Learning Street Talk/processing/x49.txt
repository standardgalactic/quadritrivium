Elizabeth spoky had these core knowledge

priors and you know things like um agess

and spatial reasoning and objects and

and stuff like that and it's almost as

if there's a core set of um basis

functions that we've acquired or learned

about how the world works and that

suggests that any reasoning system would

just compose those simple priers

together is is is that all there is with

reasoning or do you think that AI

systems could discover weird alien forms

of reasoning that we wouldn't understand

that but I believe also different

concepts uh the concepts we developed

words and uh is what helps us uh and for

example I was say neuron Network perhaps

you have speed

acceleration uh uh uh and so on you have

this Concepts but if you now do a linear

transformation of this you have the same

uh uh uh information but a little bit

mixed up for neural network that's Now

problem because using a linear

transformation you can do the inverse
