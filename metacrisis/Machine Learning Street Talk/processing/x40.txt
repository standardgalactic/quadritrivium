incredibly limited they can't copy they

can't count there's lots of things they

can't do do yeah but do you think the XL

STM could overcome some of these obvious

computational sort of like limitations

of of the Transformer probably some of

them can overcome but I think the

solution is to combine both I think uh

uh what we have right now is not the

final solution we have to go

symbolic uh and uh there already things

out where Transformer is perhaps uh uh

uh uh using mudlab to uh to solve an

equation or whatever or is inquiring at

the internet or whatever I think we need

V because uh there are so many symbolic

techniques out there where for 50 years

we have developed and we should somehow

integrate them use them I don't know

where everything is learnable perhaps in

principle but now a shortcut would use

what's already there combin in the right

way and uh in Austria the biggest AI

project it's about 40 million EUR I'm

reading it is bilateral AI bilateral
