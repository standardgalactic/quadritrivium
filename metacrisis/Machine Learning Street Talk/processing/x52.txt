because it's helps our kind of thinking

or uh uh might it uh be acceleration

plus the location I don't know oops but

but we we also have this weird ability

as humans to think of things that are

not directly coming from our sensory

experience like you know um abstract

mathematical platonic ideas and so on

yes and where do those come from uh I

think uh uh uh uh

many of this things first of all there

could be only symbols there are only

placeholders for something more

interesting is also in physics because

you have a concept of an atom probably

you never saw an atom I at least did not

see an atom but you have an concept of

an atom if you know say what what shap

has an atom you say it's it's it's it's

perhaps a ball it's it's it's a circle

why perhaps it's a triangle or whatever

uh uh you do this kind of abstractions

and you have some uh image in your uh

head for for things but often it's a BL

holder uh uh uh if this and this
