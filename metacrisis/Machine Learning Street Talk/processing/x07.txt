you need a lot of reasoning a lot of

logic to go to the next step next next

step and it was not in your training

database I don't think the current large

language model can do it right now I

don't believe they really understand

reasoning the concept say imitate

reasoning say reproduce they have

already

seen but I don't know whether I

understand it and there are many

examples where you change a little bit

and then as I go wrong can can you

explain the difference between the kind

of reasoning we do you know so strong

reasoning and the kind of reasoning that

we can do in in current AI I think in

current AI the reasoning is uh not real

reasoning it's uh uh repeating reasoning

uh uh things or code things

which have been already seen in the

input data and combining it and also uh

replacing some variables reasoning we do

we have uh uh uh we have uh uh this

reasoning concept like uh uh uh
