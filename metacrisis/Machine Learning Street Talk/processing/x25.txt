you find something better you should

thray away or throw away what you

already have stored both how uh large is

surprise uh so old M could not do it if

I found a better matching uh thing and I

have to memorize surprise I have to

delete everything as the xlsm can do

this and the idea is exponential gating

yes to revise a storage decision we do

with exponential gating the IDE is if I

find something better I upway it very

heavily and then I normalize it

therefore the old best solution is down

weed and by this I can uh find something

better and can throw away my my old

stuff in theory so for getgate could do

it but in practice you cannot learn to

forget because you cannot learn at the

same time to store very precisely and

then forget some one time step but

exponential gating exponential input

gating was the key that they say I have

something better forget everything what

was before and this gave us uh uh an
