robotics a deep mind had a paper uh

Tesla had a paper but they all struggled

so a Transformers is too slow yes that's

uh sometimes you have to wait a couple

of seconds before agent is reacting now

we have something which is much faster

and we have a second Advantage we have a

fixed memory we know in advance how

large our memory is if we now go

embedded on embedded device we know how

large the memory is we will resign uh

the LSM with this fixed memory and no

matter how long the sequence was you use

the same fixed memory if the sequence is

100 uh uh uh sequence elements or 100

Millions uh you have the same

memory and we can fix the memory and we

are very fast and this two things give

us advantage to go embedded to go into

robotics say's even one already tried it

out for drones so have this uh uh

devices this gpus on drones and they

emailed us they don't want to reveal and

they said it's it's unbelievable that

much better results and now the drones
