and uh speed that we can go in other

directions not only uh in in Industry

not language because language there are

so many companies doing language and

competing and uh it's it's yeah it's I

don't know whether you can make money

and it's not that's a Core Business the

second pillar is AI for simulation yes

and I for simulation also here we have

uh uh big success stories uh because now

we can do simulations we numerical

simulation uh struggle which which they

cannot do

uh there could be uh discrete element uh

methods it's like particles you have

many particles but if it's a million

particles 10 million particles 100

million particles uh the numerical

method cannot copos it cannot do it

anymore the same with mesh points

perhaps you have computational fluid

dynamics you have this mesh points like

uh if air goes over the car you have all

these points or over air a airplane any

of the mesh points and sometimes the
