techniques

even with that I guess you could say it

was still an approximate value function

there was no formal guarantees or

anything exactly that's true but but I I

completely agree that llms on their own

that they are they are approximate

retrieval engines but the thing is we

can build systems we we can have formal

verifiers we can have neuros you know we

can have um like lean and for

example we can build these systems so

with these systems can we do reasoning I

think in principle it should be possible

I'm not sure uh but I think the

reasoning is

limited uh

to uh uh the domain you see in the

training data uh there are different

formal systems formal Logics you can

learn at one Logics if it sees enough of

these rules I think it can uh it knows

what of variables what I can change and

how I can I produce something I can I

think you can train an llm for one logic
