mesh points are so many that the

numerical methods do not work anymore

now we have things where for example for

a car you change something uh a

numerical simulation takes three weeks

the guy does something goes home after

three weeks he looks up what came out

and we can do it in three minutes W and

and uh what is the idea behind it why

are this uh uh um this neural Sim ation

so good I always uh make a example with

the Moon the Moon can be described by a

location by an Impulse perhaps by mass

but we don't describe each uh uh

particle each atom or each s corn and

it's a very good uh uh prediction uh

where some moon is in an hour or next

day or whatever uh and also in many

numerical

simulations you can group particles

because they are structures

and if you can group uh like if you

throw a snowball you would not uh uh

simulate every snowflake or whatever but

the whole snowball and it's it's quite
