system to produce new logic uh but it's

it's it's it's it's uh uh you learn the

syntax what you don't learn the

semantics if you I want to prove

something then you have to have

different steps towards this proof yes

and here think I would struggle I would

learn to do the formal things uh the

syntax I have have a sentence a correct

formula and I produce another correct

formula by applying the rules it has

learned it it has seen it it can do it

but it's not gold directed in the step

by step they they still not perfect or

there still uh uh uh sometimes or in

most cases not as good as humans it's

interesting I I kind of agree that

knowledge is created in service of a

goal and there's a creative component to

to reasoning and we can build systems

that can dream and and generate data and

we we can boot bootstrap that and some

of it can come from the users of of a

system so it feels like we can build

systems that that can reason but perhaps
