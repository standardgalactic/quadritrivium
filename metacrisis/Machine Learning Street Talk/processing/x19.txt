to be stored and so non-relevant stuff

is not stored it's was one of the first

attention mechanism but we called it

gating yes just before we get to xlsm

because of course you got this amazing

new invention which solves many of the

problems that that the original lstm had

can you tell me maybe like the the

computational complexity of an lstm

compared to an RNN how how did it

compare uh LM is an RNN yeah vanilla

without without all of the the G

yeah without the gating and uh the

complexity is only increased by this

gating mechanism but it's still linear

in time because uh uh perhaps it's

better to compare it to to to attention

attention if you have a new query a new

piece of information you have to look

back to all previous items and lsdm only

interacts with the memory with all

already stor uh memory so it's always a

constant for one query you have a

constant uh interaction with the memory

uh attention have to go through all keys
