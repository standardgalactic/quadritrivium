the other says have other success

stories but I think set a way for tunks

to to to advance AI but also to make

industrial AI as I said in my talk

because for industrial AI we need

symbolic systems to make it robust to to

guarantee stuff we now have uh to team

up with a symbolic guys to advance AI I

completely agree so we need to have

formal um verification the thing is

though can we have our cake and eat it

because the only problem with these

hybrid neuros symbolic systems is the

degree of human engineering can we

automate the the creation with some kind

of architecture search because we're

building the the these big these big

systems that have many many components

many verifiers and so on how much of

that can we automate in the group from

uh where we do the neuros symbolic uh so

symbolic I said hey we need machine

learning uh perhaps to adjust our

parameters for our symbolic stuff uh so

Subs symbolic guys say uh we can use the
