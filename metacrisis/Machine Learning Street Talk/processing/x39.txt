hopefully yes the reason I asked is of

course you've got your symbolic AI paper

as well and I'm really interested in

neuros symbolic architectures there and

there are many approaches to doing that

so in URS we've seen many people using

Transformers to generate programs um

some folks are just skipping the

explicit program generation and just

getting Transformers to perform symbolic

like tasks and Transformers are
