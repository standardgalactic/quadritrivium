because bringing symbolic and Subs

symbolic AI together because we need

said in my talk scaling is over now we

have to go into industrialization of AI

and here we need new techniques and

perhaps not uh new techniques only from

the sub symbolic side from the neuron

Network side perhaps we need uh things

from symbolic side to make things more

robust uh uh uh uh uh because if you uh

uh if the uh uh production uh uh process

stands uh or stalled uh uh that's not uh

that should not uh happen and therefore

you need perhaps a sub symbolic methods

integrated or surrounding the sub

symbolic methods like large language

models or or or others I completely

agree no I I think we need to build

hybrid systems yeah yeah that's the

neuros symbolic approach and that's what

we are doing uh in Austria in this big

thing it's hard I still it's hard to

bring these two communities together

sometimes they don't like each other the

other say we have big success stories
