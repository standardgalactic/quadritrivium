something which is quadratic so you know

something that should be worse but it

actually ran faster why is that it run

faster because uh of the implementation

on the GPU uh graphical processing units

so chips where uh everything is

implemented on we had something like

it's called flasher attention this is

very fast attention mechanism and you uh

uh uh use Hardware

optimization uh uh this is one thing and

the other thing is uh you could do it in

parallel uh I say one quid is looking

back to all keys but it can look back to

all keys at the same time you can do

everything uh in parallel you can push

up all keys or or or a whole uh like

assume you have a sequence you have you

have a sentence and all the words are

pushed up one level

simultaneously while uh theal networks

or LSM has to go over it sequentially

the first thing build up a new memory

the next thing build up a new memory and

aention could push up everything in
