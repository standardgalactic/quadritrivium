same idea but also the fast weights use

this idea could you also just give a

little bit more intuition on um uh you

know the the gating so you said you move

to exponential from from sigmoid

certainly in the 1990s people were using

like sigmoid and and hyperbolic tangent

even for an activation function what was

the intuition at the time to go sigmoid

and and and just in a bit more detail

how does the exponential version fix the

problem um to go sigmoid it's gating uh

Sig is between zero and one yes and

that's the natural thing to do one is uh

the gate is open everything go through a

zero is nothing go through uh the gate

is closed and between you do scaling so

for the Sig was a natural thing using

for gating but uh it has a problem

because if you encounter one sequence

element and you say I multiply it by 0.5

let's say and there come another element

say oh if this is 05 I should multiply

this by four but this doesn't work

because sigit only goes to one I cannot
