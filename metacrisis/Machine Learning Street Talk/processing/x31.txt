could go back in time and tell your

younger self about this would your

younger self just say yes absolutely and

and would you have done it then yes but

my younger self had have to see a couple

of examples uh because at this time uh

we don't have this big language models

uh we don't have this problems where we

see exponential gating uh helps this big

memory helps because we did we did not

had this data sets yes I know only had

to say what to do but also what data

will come then it would say yes of

course uh I have such a small storage if

you want to store much more of course

you have to do this I would have seen it

but I also needed a a glimpse in the

future what data will come in your paper

you um you studied how these things

scale with with data and model size and

so on can you tell me about some of the

theoretical underpinnings uh this is a

standard scaling laws is we not U uh uh

developed by us where uh uh either uh

you do model parameters you increase
