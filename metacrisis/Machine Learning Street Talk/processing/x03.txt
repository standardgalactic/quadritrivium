not our way to uh uh to uh Advance AI on

the long term it's a good database

technology it's a good knowledge

representation technology it's important

for AI but we have to find new ways

could I could I challenge a tiny bit so

I completely agree vanilla llms are

approximate retrieval engines and and

even that they're not quite databases

because they have this interpolative

property things like 01 they are

approximate reasoning engines so they're

doing this test time comput and they're

they're searching many combinations

because the thing is even though this

thing it's a a finite State autometer

has a fixed amount of compute do a

single forward pass but it can generate

code and the code contains all of these

fundamental basis Primitives that can be

composed together so you can do this

test time search you can compose

together programs you can in in a sense

um search touring space indirectly right

by searching through the space of
