data uh so were faster and LSM could not

compete at this time how did the lstm

solve the trade-off between storing new

data and protecting data that was

already stored that's uh uh uh uh a very

uh interesting questions and that's also

the strength of the new x lsdm uh IDE is

gating uh I have uh we have different

Gates uh some perhaps most important uh

uh thing is the input gate uh and uh it

scales up or down new information which

coming in it can be scaled down to zero

it's not store or one everything is

stored and the input gate is something

like an early attention mechanism

because input gate is an attention you

have a Time series and to put what

sequence elements you want to uh uh pay

attention to the input gate would do

that uh and then it's a forget gate

forget gate uh uh is saying is the

already stored memory important or

should I downscale it but more important

is the input Gates the input gate really

uh picks out specific sequence elements
