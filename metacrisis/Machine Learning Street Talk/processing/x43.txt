symbolics I perhaps as a shield

surrounding it but they don't merge it

they don't integrate it like learning

rules learning new symbolic rules with

rule things I I know how symbolic goes

but perhaps some rules are better uh uh

uh you have to better integrate uh uh uh

uh uh uh those things but now every uh

these two groups are thinking in their

own uh domains and I'm missing uh this

and if somebody is doing this Tak this

from this community this from this

community clue it together but it's

clumsy uh not nice not elegant things

elegant things also we as we did is we

learn some formal systems but perhaps

the learning should go into to the

formal systems and the formal system

should be a a subcomponent integrated

subcomponent of I don't know a large

language model or whatever right now

it's it's not there we this two groups

are too separated yeah so on on on the

connectionist camp you know there's

there's um Hinton and Benjo and and Lon
