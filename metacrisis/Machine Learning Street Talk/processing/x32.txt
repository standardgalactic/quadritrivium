model parameters and so follow a certain

uh like exponential law a certain curve

and you compare it with like

Transformers or state space models which

also follow a certain law and then you

can extrapolate and say if you build

larger models uh we will be also better

but this are scaling laws uh which were

used not invented by us uh by others

which is nice because you can now

predict if it makes a model larger or if

I use more data how will these models

these larger models behave you mentioned

um State space models you things like

Mambo could you just contrast to that M

was most competitive method for lsdm and

then after our publication of uh x lsdm

m two came out and the nice thing is M

two is X lsdm without G uh input gate

it's exactly the same because it has uh

e e to the uh soft plus eof soft plus is

a sigm you can uh do some math then you

see they have also this uh for gate

Gates they have also an output gate

number two is uh uh like an
