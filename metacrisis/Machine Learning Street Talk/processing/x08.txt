contradiction uh induction all this

things we learned and also for us was

hard to learn it as in school or in

study but now we have reasoning Concepts

how we can do how we uh structure things

and how we show that something is true

or not true all this formal system

you have to have some formal rules uh in

theory llms might learn some formal

rules but then I can do reasoning uh in

a very specific thing and produce new

things because I only apply the rules if

the rules are is a training data I can

apply they can apply the rules also to

new things but then in this reasoning

system I probably can reason but uh if

you go to another system uh uh uh uh I

lose the reasoning capabilities I mean

two quick points on that first of all

would you consider you know move 37 in

Alpha Z would you consider that

reasoning so in in Alpha Z you know the

the the Google the go player algorithm

creatively discovered this amazing move

that be so now it's a move okay uh yes
