good and if uh uh say I system can

identify his structures where 10,000

particles stick together or do the same

or in parallel or whatever you can speed

up the simulation and this uh uh is

happening you have the things where

particles are somehow synchronized

or glued together or and one example is

uh if you have something like a corn you

have corn in a machine there's no

physics between qu if you have this uh

uh the numeric simulation have to uh

this qu go down to Atomic level or

something like this and uh uh how I Inda

but if you have this corn and another

cor and you can learn physics how I uh

interact with this as this is pushing

thisis uh and perhaps how does interact

when if they're a little bit wet if a

little bit larger and so on then you

have like thousands of points which the

numerical simulation needs you have one

thing or sandorn or or whatever you

learn physics of sorns so simulations

there's no physics of sunqu have to go
