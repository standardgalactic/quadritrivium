models and and deep learning um in

general is that they capture a lot of

the subtle intuitions cultural

information um creativity and and so on

so they're really good for generating

programs and the thing is if we want to

do abstraction we need to have programs

but the thing is where do the programs

come from if we if we build systems that

can create and acquire abstractions we

need to build systems that can write

their own programs it doesn't seem

possible just to do some discrete

program search because it's too

difficult what my view on large language

models is a large language models is for

me a database technology yes it has uh

uh uh is not artificial intelligent okay

uh give me it's artificial but uh that's

more or less a database technology you

grab all the human knowledge in text

perhaps also in code or whatever and

store it and uh you generalize it you

combine it you know uh uh if there's a

Tuesday I can uh replace it by Wednesday
