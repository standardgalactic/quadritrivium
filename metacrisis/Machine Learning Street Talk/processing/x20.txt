and have to do this PA interactions and

there are two disadvantages first

disadvantage is computational very

complex it's uh quadratic in the context

length and the second disadvantage you

have only pair interaction you do a DOT

product then exponential of the dot

product which is sensor soft Marx but

you have only pair comparison it could

be better that uh uh more tus more

sequence elements are pulled together

and a new element interacts with I would

say an abstraction of of this uh uh

different tokens two disadvantages uh

the Transformer comutation complexity

plus very simple interactions but lsdm

is like a recurrent Network all recurr

networks are linear uh in the sequence

lengths linear in are context length LSM

is a little bit more complex because it

has the gating mechanism which makes it

a little bit more complex but it's by

far not as complex as a Transformer with

this quadratic uh uh uh complexity could

you explain to the audience why
