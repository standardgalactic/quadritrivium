already written somewhere you only have

to pull it together or to combine it uh

but if you really can uh can should come

something new and ser are very limited

but they very powerful because AI needs

a knowledge

representation and right now there's a

problem of hallucination uh okay uh how

inference with strawberry it's about the

access the information we need new
