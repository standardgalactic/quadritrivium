you do you think things are starting to

swing back the other way I me I'm

certainly seeing look at Deep Mind for

example loads of neuros symbolic

architectures coming out I mean do you

think that the the Consciousness is

changing a little bit I think so perhaps

it have to because I think uh our path

ends with scaling up with making things

larger uh building and and I don't know

whether it was the right way because uh

uh it's more about storing more

information in this systems uh you put

more training data to make it larger but

uh not smarter not the systems we not

different so were only larger and if

this has an end uh we have to be smarter

uh uh and I think uh the symbolic way or

a neur symbolic uh thing uh have to come

because it gives us the way because I

don't know when a sub symbolic way which

neural networks where should we go or

what what should we uh do uh we scale it

up we have this almost brain likee uh uh

models now but something is missing it's
