advantage the second thing was a matrix

memory uh uh a big memory and the

original lsdm has a as a memory a Scala

one number you have only one number what

which you can store that's not much you

can store and now the new lsdm the X

lsdm has a whole hopfield network we use

a classical hopfield Network and it

became popular again because there was

something called Nobel Prize and uh uh

John hopy got the Nobel Prize for this a

classic hopfield Network and now instead

of this uh single uh scolar we use a

whole hopfield network it's like a a

classical hopfield Network plus gating

we with input say what we should uh uh

store in the hopfield network and with a

forget gate uh how much should be the

old storage items be downrated it's a

hfield network equipped with gting so we

merged the ho Network idea with the lsdm

idea and this G us an lsdm with a much

stronger memory with a much bigger

memory so exponential gating was

important increasing the memory and the
