down of atomic level or or this helps a

lot to speed up the simulations and they

super powerful because now we can do

simulations where numerics struggles and

this goes so far that uh there are the

we have from the local industry like

steel industry you have this big OV with

steel they cannot simulate it because

there are too many many uh numerically

too many particles and often so have to

build a prototype a larger prototype

because the simulation cannot cope with

it now we can can jump over the

Prototype the Prototype is 100 million

euros wor because of thing and now we

can simulate it and we can build a real

thing uh uh and this gives industri a

big big uh push uh if this works that

would be a simulation uh idea uh uh

youan that is a guy he will come

hopefully yeah he will tell you much

more about it but I think it's super

fruitful I think uh uh it's it's a super

cool Direction but ask johanes he can

convince you much better than I can do
