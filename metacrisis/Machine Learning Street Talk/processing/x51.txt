the uh think and therefore I think uh

the our abstraction our language our

kind of thinking is tailored uh uh uh to

our society to and I think uh AI systems

should come up with complete different

reasoning things but also different

abstractions for them uh other Concepts

might be much more useful because they

live in the same world in a different

way they uh uh manipulates the world in

a different way yeah it's it's something

I I think about a lot because there's

this constructive component to

abstractions as you're talking about so

there's the language game and we have

this mtic cultural transfer and it seems

to be in service of some utility for us

to understand each other but they are

still grounded in the physical world

acceleration is a thing in the physical

world is it uh I would challenge you for

us it is perhaps acceleration plus

something else combined is the real

thing yes I don't know uh it's it's only

uh is it it only convenient for us
