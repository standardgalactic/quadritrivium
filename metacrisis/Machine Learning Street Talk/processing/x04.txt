programs so there seems to be something

there are you saying that doing these

kind of methods like 01 is the road to

nowhere and we need something completely

different or could we just tweak a

little a little bit you can tweak it and

you you will uh go very far because uh

you have uh let's strain the program

space because that's very nice uh there

are so many programs so many combination

of programs which give you a new program

uh if you if you uh like if you think

it's the col work of complexity it's the

length of the programs and complexity of

the programs programs the simple k of

complexity programs already stored or

combined but if you uh have to find a

program which needs completely new

Concepts cannot be combined out of

existing

programs I think it cannot do it it can

only combine things it has already SE

seen the large language models uh

learned on code but it cannot come up

with completely new code Concepts
