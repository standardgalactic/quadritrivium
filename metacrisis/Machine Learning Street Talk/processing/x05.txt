perhaps they don't exist then uh uh then

if you say everything which uh uh in

code was already invented we only have

to combine and there's some nothing new

s i with you but if there's something

new to invent I don't think large

language models can advance us mlst is

sponsored by sensl which is the compute

platform specifically optimized for AI

workloads they support all of the latest

open- Source language models out of the

box like llama for example you can just

choose the pricing Point choose the

model that you want it spins up it Auto

scale you can pay on consumption

essentially or you can have a model

which is always working or it can be

freeze dried when you're not using it so

what are you waiting for go to sent ml.

and sign up now well yeah let let me

push gently on that so um I I think this

is a discussion about creativity and and

also epistemic foraging so you know

creating new knowledge to expl also

reasoning program is a lot of about
