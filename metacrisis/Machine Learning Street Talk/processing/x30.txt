it's uh uh different also uh and there's

another thing uh it changes theic

Dynamics but we we don't have a clear uh

understanding what's happening we only

saw if you have different uh

architectures So Soft Marx with this

exponential function has gives Advantage

learning Dynamics meaning if other

systems got stuck are installed do not

learn anymore uh there are some gradient

Peaks which let the Transformer learn

and we now observe the same with XL SDM

to revise s decision was our reason but

the learning Dynamics also were modified

in a positive way but it's not

understood completely what's uh

happening here exactly I think there's

some random directions where you if if

nothing goes anymore that you have some

random weight updates which help you to

progress learning but it's uh a

speculation exponential gating again

Matrix memory and uh to paralyze it I'm

just interested in in what triggered the

the flash of inspiration I mean if you
