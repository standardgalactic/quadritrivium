uh this

was sort of a solution because required

neuron networks are not working and then

uh two things happens first uh I build a

neuron Network yeah only one weight have

to be adjusted as a way to store a piece

of information which you need at a

sequence end and the network could not

do this I did all my print FS all my my

coding on the screen numbers flow over

the screen and then so hey this a super

small numbers and this were the

gradients uh there was no weight update

the gradients uh uh were not there and

and this was s the discovery of the

vanishing gradient that if you you want

to have some Target you want to know

what is needed to predict the target uh

uh you would do createit assignment in

the sequence end you got no signal and

finishing gradient now I new by Rec

networks do not work and the solution

was lsdm so long short memory memory

cell where I build something which make

sure that the gradients as I get
