reasoning but you have do have have some

logic if you do this this this this very

comp complex logic uh said your program

is working absolutely but if we say

reasoning is knowledge

acquisition and we need systems to come

up with new abstractions and if we agree

that those abstractions can be

combinator deduced from abstractions

that are already in the system so we we

have the the um the combinatorial

closure so they they do exist then

creating the abstractions is is more a

matter of understanding when a good you

know how do I find a good abstraction

using an algorithm but I think what we

humans have it's not only uh that we

draw our ideas from coding but

understanding uh the world uh having all

this World Knowledge uh I think from

coding alone uh you're limited I think

we have much reasoning cap capabilities

uh outside of uh doing only programs but

I agree uh in programs you can uh go

very far I think if it's a program where
