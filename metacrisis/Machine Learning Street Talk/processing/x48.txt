think about it but sometimes uh you

think a little bit I think say greatly

think and sometimes you plan two steps

should I go here or here what's faster I

hear some guys are coming I think it's

it's a very short

two two thoughts uh where you're thing

and for me it's it's not so separated I

do it immediately and I do a long long

thinking I think there's everything grad

many things you do do uh uh intuitively

it's system one like and sometimes you

have something where you really thinking

about think but there are so many things

between when I if I leave here will I go

home I can go straight ahead and see a

peps I go down there and so uh I make a

couple of decisions it's a little bit

planning uh and it's intermediate I

don't think there's a clear uh uh

difference between system one and system

two yes I are you I agree I agree the

abstractions in these systems should

they always be human intelligible and

what I mean by that is um you know
