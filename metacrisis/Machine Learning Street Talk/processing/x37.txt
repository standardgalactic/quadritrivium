are flying uh uh autonomous and and you

have to have real time control you

cannot wait until and with this xsm it's

working we are it's fantastic and this

guy also uh talked to me at

newps there I said I don't know whether

I want to Ral it because it's so good

for them it's a company uh but uh to

going robotics going to drones also to

self driving uh uh uh in a car uh you

want to be energy efficient you want to

have also batteries with you you want to

be fast you want to be uh concise you

want to have a small uh a powerful

system and here I see big advantages

with this xlsm perhaps even going uh uh

to to the cell phone I'm not sure I

don't know the constraints of the cell

phone perhaps this is too farfetched but

we have a thing which is energy

efficient it's fast and we can control

some memory we can design some memory

for the device for the embedded device

for example do you think the XL STM sort

of move us closer to something that
