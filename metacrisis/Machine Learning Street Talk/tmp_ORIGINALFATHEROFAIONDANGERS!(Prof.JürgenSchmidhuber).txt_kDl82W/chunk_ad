coming out with these models and i think the best way of making sure that there won't be dominance
through some large company is to support the open source movement because how can a large company
compete against all these brilliant phd students around the world who are so
motivated to you know within a few days create something that is a little bit better than what
the last guy has um um put out there on github and whatever so i'm i'm very convinced that this
open source movement is going to make sure that there won't be a huge mode for a long time
i'm reading between the lines here but i would guess you would be opposed to
legislation like the eu is considering where you know very tight restrictions on
generative models you know onerous onerous kind of uh approval processes and things like that
because that's going to have this chilling effect on on open source innovation and the little guys
wouldn't it yes i have signed letters um which which support the open source movement and whenever
i get a chance to um maybe influence some you um politicians then i'm trying to contribute to
making sure that they don't don't shoot themselves in the foot by by by killing
killing innovation through the open source movement so you certainly want to avoid that
there are lots of different open source movements around the world so if one big entity fails to
support open source or even makes it harder for open source there will still be lots of other
entities which um won't follow follow and so no matter what's going to happen on the political
level i think open source is not going away i guess just in closing you've been in this game
for decades now and what is i know it's a bit of a strange question to ask but what's your fondest
memory in your career my fondest memory oh it's usually when i discover something that i think
nobody has seen before but that is that happens very rarely because most of the things you think
are well somebody else has done before um but yeah so
yeah um what usually happens is um you and and this has happened many times not many times but
quite a few times in my career since the 80s as a scientist who publishes stuff
but suddenly you think oh that is the solution to all these problems and now i really figured out
a way of building this universal system which um learns how to improve itself and learns the way
to improve the way it improves itself and so on and now we are done and now all is that's
necessary is to scale it up and it's going to solve everything and then um you think a little
bit longer about it and maybe you have a couple of publications but then it turns out something
is missing something important is missing and and actually it's not that great and actually
you have to think hard to add something important to it which then for a brief moment looks like the
greatest thing since sliced bread and um and then you get excited again but then suddenly
you realize oh it's still not finished something important is missing and so it goes back and
forth like that i think that's the life of a scientist the greatest joys are those moments
where you have an insight where suddenly things fall into place such that along the lines of what
we discussed before the description length of some solution to a problem suddenly shrinks because
two puzzle pieces they suddenly match and and become one or become one in the sense that
they fit each other such that suddenly you have the shared line between the two
puzzle pieces one is negative and the other one is positive and certainly the whole thing is
much more compressible than the sum of the things separately so these these things that's
what's driving um scientists like myself i guess
wonderful um professor you again schmidhuber it's been an absolute honor thank you so much
for coming on the show today thank you it was such a pleasure talking to you
