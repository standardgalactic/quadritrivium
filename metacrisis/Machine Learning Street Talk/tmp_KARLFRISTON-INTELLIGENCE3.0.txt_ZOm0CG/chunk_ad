intelligence do its own basal leaf updating just automatically for its lifetime which may only be
a few hundred milliseconds um you're making sense of its world or inter being interpreted as having
this sort of um sort of your biotic intelligence and self-organization just because it exists for
that period of time so then again this interesting question you know the how does one time frame
contextualize the other starts to bite and you know you start to now think about um from the
point of view of a slower time scale what would um a succession of Markov blankets uh look like um
and what one uh immediately encounters is the notion of a of a wandering eye tinder and Markov
blanket yes um we spoke about vagueness on on the first one so we'll we'll park that but the
wandering sets is very very interesting but um I there were two things that I that I think I wanted
to understand um you do think that there's a hierarchy of blankets but I'm interested in
exploring this idea of whether the blankets could be observer relative because you used the word
understood as a Markov blanket and that brings up two things to the core of my mind first of all
the extent to which they are a lens versus describing something in reality I see and if they
do describe something in reality you spoke about this symmetric causal pressures which we can we
can speak to as well but but on this understood thing it's very similar to um Wittgenstein said
the meaning of a word is in its use and that meaning in language is is embedded in pragmatic
actions and the language game and so on and and then like the the further forward occurs well
maybe the the understanding of a boundary or a you know Markov boundary blanket could be um
understood in the context of one's perspective right that's a great question and um and I
it may be informed by reading some of the philosophical literature and I should remind
you of course I am not a philosopher so um so what I say will be naive um you need to speak to
philosophers about this but I would I would say the Markov blanket um is is something which is
metaphysical um you know it it is defined by a particular spastic structure when formulating
any state space in terms of dynamics and specifically you know a long fan equation
so one talks about the free energy principle as a first principle account um but it does
actually commit to something it commits to the notion that there are states and that those
states have a separation of temporal scales that disambiguates or separates systemic states
from random fluctuations so but that's all it does there are no more assumptions and then
everything else follows from that under the understanding that for sufficiently large systems
the probability of there not being a Markov blanket is um um zero um so when this comes back
to the sort of um this sparse coupling conjecture um that Christopher I think was alluding to um or
at least we um we unpacked in terms of your if a system comes to uh exists of and it's
sufficiently big it will be sparse and once it spars there um with probability one will be
Markov blankets so at no point now have we introduced the notion of observers we haven't
at this point even introduced the notion of the free energy principle we're just saying um there
will be one way of carving up large dynamical systems or certainly systems can be expressed
as a large van equation or a random dynamical system um um will be ways of carving them up
into one or more Markov blankets at one or more scales yes um and then the question is well what
what would it what what would one uh how would one then describe um the dynamics
for any given Markov blanket so you at this point you are at liberty if you are simulating
a universe to choose the Markov blanket and the scale that you want to simulate if you're part
of this system you're not at liberty because if you're part of this system you have your Markov
blanket so all you see are the sensory impressions upon your Markov blanket and you may or may not
have active states and it brings us back to the other bright lines that make between agents and
sense-making machines that can't act sessile things um so if you're asking um I am I um
are the observer dependent perspective dependent aspects of um this formulation
using Markov blankets as a um a physiological device not if you're part of the system it says
something quite profound about what you could you know what you know what and if you're being
observed by something else if you believe if your world model is populated with the fantasy that
there are other observers out there yes um then um those observers will never ever know your internal
states well what about rather than an observer um an actor or an agent and we'll talk about
an activism in a little bit but even at the microscopic scale there are still affordances
and you gave this beautiful example of um of a type of species where someone might kill themselves
with a great good and that that shows the kind of information sharing that you have in in these
complex systems so similarly if I'm an agent in this system and and I act and and there are these
you've described this cybernetic loop and there are these kind of symmetrical causal pressures and
so on and and and then you almost get this emergence of the Markov blanket so it's so it's
changeable yes no it certainly um that's only true um it is changeable and it's malleable and
it's self-assembling uh and certainly when you have Markov blankets and Markov blankets and
coalitions of Markov blankets for example of formation of in-groups and out-groups and the
like yes you would expect there to be a a you know a dynamics of of the Markov blankets or
who you're relating to so you know the sparsity uh structure and who I talk to and who I listen to
and you know what social media uh you know I commit to all of these things are um products of or
reflections and can all be articulated in terms of you know wandering Markov blankets that's
absolutely true um I I thought you were you were asking um something more about um whether the
Markov blanket is part of a realist metaphysical description or whether it's uh you know I mean
there is another argument if you if you now play god and you now put your universe in in a computer
and now to simulate and write papers about your simulated universe where you can see
the the internal states next to all states then you know I think you're in a different world um
just I get I repeat that's something quite profound about the questions of you know what
is it like to be something um are interesting because from the point of view of the free energy
principle what is it like to be something means that someone's asking that question so they are a
thing and they're asking about another thing so now they're asking questions what is it what are
is it like to um know the internal states of a Markov blanket but by definition you can never
know them so there is something impenetrable about being something else so it's a question
which is unanswerable it's unknowable um um so if um from that point of view I think there's something
beyond the um the sort of the epistemology of you know um of Markov blankets but if you're just
simulating cells or people or you know doing multi-agent simulations then obviously you can
you can choose where to put your blankets and you can you can just use them as a device to um
to understand self-organization to simulate it and to predict it and I think in that instance
you know that you you could deploy your Markov blankets wherever you wanted to at every any
scale you you you thought was interesting for the phenomena of interest that's not quite speaking
to what you're into though which is a changeability of the the Markov blankets or well I mean we
can get into that um because if uh and later on we'll talk about the the real world implementations
of these ideas but um but if you if you did hard code the the Markov blankets then you
would bottleneck the system essentially so ideally you you would actually have the system
to find a sufficient resolution where all of this could could emerge um itself yeah did did you cover
the point of whether the blankets can be um must they be spatially temporally you know should they
have a spatial temporal contiguity and the reason I'm asking that question is when you think of a
blanket I like almost synonymizing it with an organism and maybe that's a bad thing to do and
you can correct me but but if we think of um the discontinuous blankets in information geometry
that's an interesting idea because we kind of visualize them in 3d space don't you yeah yeah
yeah well certainly they'll have a topology yeah um I mean I've noticed earlier on you're talking
about sort of play cells and grid cells which are you know very special and beautiful constructs
which speak to a certain continuity or contiguity aspect yes they they suggest that these um you're
coming back to uh Christopher some of um Summerfield's um book um you know one way of understanding
the um the Markov blankets in the brain so you know we've been talking about Markov blankets
delineating me from a world but of course um your temporal lobe has a Markov blanket as it
wouldn't be a thing you wouldn't be able to call it a temporal lobe so you know the very hierarchy
could also be described now in terms of um Markov blankets within Markov blankets within Markov
blankets and some really interesting questions about what that means for what what part of the
brain can know about another part of the brain and what and what action becomes of course it becomes
a tension yeah I just wanted to slip that in because I think that was in part what you were
driving at with this sort of context sensitive fluid dynamics on in exchanges between Markov
blankets I think it's incredibly important even within the brain in neuroscience this is basically
the the routing of information the deployment of selective attention or sensory attenuation
attenuating ignoring some signals it is exactly that that makes us such adaptive context sensitive
information processing um machines and of course that is exactly what you'd have to worry about
when designing a web with routing and and context sensitive you know who do I listen to uh so you
you know this is really really important um the um so the the the emergence of um I think
you're absolutely right they will have a topology and if I were using Markov blankets and you know
I do and many other people do every day when um thinking about message passing as a statistician
on factor graphs or um which are due to a graphical model a probabilistic graphical model of the
system you're trying to estimate or understand um then you know the Markov blanket is just the um
you know the implicit notes that that are the influence of me or the or the parents of children
the parents of the children you know and that has enormous implications for minimizing the
complexity of the message passing um and you know and I repeat defines a hierarchy for example
so Markov blankets there will have a topology um probably best understood practically from the
point of view of graph theory as opposed to um information geometry um but there are special
kinds of connectivity that you see um such as place fields and I'd also say if you just look
at the history of machine learning there are particular um kinds of Markov blankets that
characterize the very structure of certain neural networks I'm thinking here convolutional neural
networks I'm thinking about you're often motivated through weight sharing and the like but you know
if you look at weight sharing as just the kind of structural learning that's trying to minimize the
complexity part of your free energy or your um negative um log marginal likelihood um then what
you are doing is finding the right kind of spastic fit for explaining these kinds of data
what uh what what what is the architectural principle it's it's the translational invariance
the translational symmetry it's just the contiguity aspect it's a fact that you are sampling data
that is generated in or from a metric space that has a well-behaved metric so I would I would say
that sort of you know place cells and grid cells and many in and many other are thinking about
Chris's friend Tim Behren's work for example um finding grid light structures everywhere
in abstract spaces uh so what that tells you is that that it's likely that we live in a world
um where data are caused by samples from a metric space that has a you know a measure to it um not
all spaces do um I think it'd be you'd be hard pushed to find you know the right kind of metric
for language for example um and certainly if you're if you're if you're sort of building
message-passing schemes or believe propagation schemes on a factor graph you don't you don't
think about contiguity in a metric sense you know you don't measure the distance between one node
another node it's is it connected or not um so I think there are some special um contiguity
there are some special worlds that are recapitulated that emerge in the internal architectures of
intelligent machines that have this contiguity property in virtue of the fact that some aspects
of the causes of the sensorium are elaborated in a metric space but not necessarily everywhere
and yeah well I want to take you back I know you for you I want to where you want to take me
anyway well I will I will finish then because um I see uh in the brain and I also see in the
direction of travel in terms of um building thinking machines um as you get deeper into
these hierarchies and you go from a fine scale to larger scale there is an interesting move between
um um architectures that would speak to this metric aspect in space and in time
to a more discretized topological non-metric representation yes I know I wanted to touch
on that I mean there's a beautiful example I mean Christopher Summerfield talks about
Pierce's triad and various ways that we learn different types of um symbol and abstractions
and so on and there is a famous experiment in neuroscience I'm sure you're familiar with it
where they showed people pictures in a certain order and associations and then the same topological
structure was was recovered I think in the NTL and and this is because even though with spatial
temporal contiguity there is a metric space but the brain learns these kind of associations and
then you can essentially learn these abstract concepts that you know concepts that reverberate
in our language and experience they get represented yes and I completely agree with your um point
about the the revolutionary idea of the um the translational local um equivalence you know the
the way it's sharing with CNNs it's a beautiful idea it's revolutionized deep learning so um
just to finish off the discussion on Markov blankets I wanted to talk about part-hole
relationships so um for the benefit of the audience in logic and philosophy myriology
is the study of parts and holes that they form whereas in set theory it's founded on the membership
relation between a set and its elements and myriology emphasizes the relation between entities
which is to say the inclusion between them so anyway when considering systems Markov blankets
can nest into hierarchies and what connection if any is there you know between that in the
philosophical study of myriology and um I was also going to bring in I don't know if you've
heard of Hinton's glom architecture but it it it was it came after capsule networks and it's
you know we were just talking about these wonderful inductive priors in deep learning and they
they make the problem there are many curses in machine learning but one of them is kind of like
the curse of optimization and um and there's a complexity curse as well and that's why most
of these inductive priors they reduce the size of the hypothesis set if you reduce it too much
you get approximation error which doesn't help you either there's curses everywhere but um
but this is a really interesting prior as well these part whole relationship
gosh yes there's so many issues you bring that I'll just reiterate my favorite one which is the
you know the the notion of um these inductive biases minimizing the complexity I think that's
absolute you know that's something which is absolutely central um from the physicist's
perspective you know this um reading um self organization as self evidencing which is a
philosophically poetic way of simply um describing existence as an optimization process which you
shouldn't really do it's all it's really a principle of least action but you can read it as an optimization
process what are you optimizing the evidence for my world models what how can I carve up that evidence
complexity and accuracy what does having a what would I then mean by optimization what I mean
just providing the simplest account that maintains a degree of accuracy what do I mean by simplest
minimizing the degrees of freedom that I use up in providing that accurate account how do I do that
by the right spastic structure what does that mean it just means finding the right structure
and you know you could actually think of much of evolution and um the trajectory of machine
learning architectures as this game of finding the right structure but there are just these structural
priors that are apt for describing the kind of data you know so if you're you've spent your
entire life doing emnist images then it's going to be the kind of structural priors that they are
that's that inherit from being sampled from a metric space and you'll have all the convolution
I think the capsule I didn't I didn't know about the glom stuff I was like listening to Jeff's
latest ideas because he's always got the right kind of intuitions and and these intuitions are
part of the I think part of our reflection of ashby's law of requisite varieties explored in
hypothesis space about the very structures but certainly the the capsule stuff and the you know
the one aspect of structures of graphical models or implicit factor graphs when it comes to
implementation which I think is often neglected is the orthogonal direction from the orthogonal
aspect you know in relation to hierarchical composition and that's the sort of the breadth
of a model in terms of having factors that can be separated so if you wanted to have
say scene construction you wanted to have multi-object you're the ability to track and infer
and and make sense of data generated by multiple objects what are you saying well there are multiple
things out there and these things again from the point of view of first principle account
have certain conditional independences that is literally revealed by a lack of connections
in your world model what would that look like well if you're a physicist it would just be a
