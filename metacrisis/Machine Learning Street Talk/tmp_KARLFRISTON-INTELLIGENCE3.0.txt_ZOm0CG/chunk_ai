yeah yeah that's right sorted that one um I mean yeah you know I mean you know I think there are
interesting issues of different levels you know planes or levels of consciousness you know there's
minimal selfhood um and then if it's the case that sort of consciousness as a process entails
some kind of action you have to now think about sort of what is action on the inside what is
mental action and then what what normally what ends up doing is thinking in terms of attention and the
the kind of routing and selection the smart data sampling but now not by moving my eyes or by
going to the right wikipedia page but by basically switching on and off various sources of input from
lower in the hierarchy so you know I repeat from the point of view of psychology that would be like
endogenous attention so that would be the mental action that makes it conscious processing
and then you have to ask well at what point is that you know is that necessary to actually
experience anything and I think I think you probably there are people who argue yes that is
actually a prerequisite for a qualitative experience so you have to be able to select it
what does that mean you have to be able to attend to it and you have to be the source of that sort
of enabling attention that active sampling inside the brain so now there's a deep link between
qualia or qualitative experience and attention and conscious processing that of the kind that
is accompanied by qualitative experience I think is important it also interestingly also speaks to
your dynamic Markov blankets because of course by switching off and selecting various bits of
neuronal message passing in the brain you're reconfiguring your Markov blanket out though
some somebody's Markov blanket lower down which is an interesting an interesting notion but
it that also fits comfortably with Thomas Metzinger's and Vanya's advice's formulations
I actually Yakov Linsky as well formulations of
phenology in the context of transparency and opacity that you know what what renders something
opaque in the sense oh I see now if you like as a projection on a murky window
it's not just going straight into it's not direct perception it's it's your it's now
something I am looking at oh I'm looking at a red apple and it may well be exactly this
controllability the fact you can attend or disignore it so I think there's a nice link there
from the from the point of view of certain philosophical takes on self-modeling and
phenomenological transparency and opacity and the mechanics of belief updating when it comes to
selection through basically a getting the Kalman gain right or you know doing the root getting the
routine right same exactly the same mechanism you get in transformers so they call it attention
it's just basically a waiting in that context it's a waiting that inherits or is inferred from
something in the past a pattern in the past but if it if that waiting comes from higher
in abstract hierarchical model that would look very much like in Dodger's attention
and it starts to have the look and feel of a mental action that would you know bring you
closer to it but whether you would know that you were deploying attention and whether you
could tell somebody else oh I've got a qualitative experience or whether you become a philosopher
as well your life puzzling about the fact that I can tell somebody else I'm having a qualitative
experience there's the different planes I think you'd have to you'd have to contend with beautiful
beautiful do you have any final thought I mean we've got a machine learning audience so any calls
to action how can they start looking at active inference where should they look and what would
you like to tell them I was very charming of you I'm not going to tell them anything I'm just
if it's if it's the right kind of approach that you know it'll already be out there it'll be
self-evident it's just a question I think of people finding their own language and their own
their own rhetoric or calculus that makes sense of it and the other reason I'm not going to say
anything is I've spoken far too much and I'm trying to be a recluse and the more I'm calling
people to my work the less easy it is to be a recluse yes indeed uh professor Carl Frister
that's been an absolute honor thank you so much for joining us thank you thank you very much okay
this is just a bit of a note from me at the end of the podcast thank you so much for supporting
all the stuff that we're doing it means so much to me um we have a patreon if you would like to
support us personally if you're touched by the work that we do um also I'd really appreciate it
if you could give us a rating on your podcast app um I actually discovered the other day I couldn't
quite believe this but on Spotify we are the top rated AI podcast for active AI podcast um yeah it's
incredible so thank you so much for those of you who have rated us um unfortunately on apple
podcast the learning rate is only 0.01 so it hasn't quite caught up uh with the fact that we're the
best AI podcast yet so particularly on on apple podcast if you could give us a five star rating
and and a review I think that will accelerate the learning process um yeah other than that if you're
on youtube most of you aren't subscribed um of course youtube has recently changed its modus operandi
it's less of a subscription chronological model and it's more of a magical algorithm model so I
guess it doesn't matter so much but just from a just from a metrics point of view it would really
help us out if you hit the subscribe button uh we have an active discord community as well
so check us out on there and yeah I just wanted to say one more time thank you so much for all
of your support it means so much to us and uh plenty more content like this coming your way soon
cheers see you on the next one
