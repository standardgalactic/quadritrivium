and hume of course was a famous empiricist and and i think you are one as well probably the
extreme version of that so the free energy principle concerns itself with model evidence and entropy
but evidence is not an ought you know so the question is how do moral states come into be in
in the system right okay i didn't know about the is or stuff that's really nice um um
so if i understand what you said correctly um then is is ought that completely dissolves
the distinction so if you know from the point of view of the free energy principle um existing
in particular characteristic states are those attracting states they are part of an attracting
set that define who i am and collectively who we are if we share the same kind of world model or
narrative um so they are exactly how i ought to be they are definitively defining the nature of
the thing that i am so if i exist the is is just the ought um and that's quite fundamental because
if you if you then say well what then does um a distributed cognition or an extended cognition
you know this um or a designer environment on the web um you know being undeclared for
a moment if if you think about what that might look like from a first principle account then
what ought to it look what ought it to look like well it will look like what it is um but
being what it is if it includes us it will be like us so it will um it will be effectively um
the kind of uh system where you cannot prescribe any ortoness you know because it is what it will be
it will be um it will um as we have learned in the previous conversations it will come to share
a narrative in a world model with certain levels of abstraction in our own world models provided
we are part of that that ecosystem part of that network one could imagine a completely independent
you know a mark-off blanket between us and an information you know a a worldwide web which
was never used so um so it wouldn't be a mark-off blanket even it would be two separate systems um
and there will be a universe where the the world web does what it does we will never know by definition
but if we are part of that if we are users of either in the sense of um triaging generative
AI or in acting recommendations um or supplying data um and um you know so we are in a an exchange
and therefore part of that web a part of that network part of that factor graph a node on that
factor graph um then by definition the is equals ought as read by the free energy principle means
that the what will happen is all the intelligent artifacts on that web will converge to some
kind of common ground and some kind of common sense making another way of looking about that is
that you know what are the imperatives what are the things that are being optimized if if you
want to use an optimization um approach um it's the um the effectively the expected free energy
what is that it's just minimizing uncertainty minimizing surprises it is not making paper clips
it is not you ought to be good to mankind or you ought to increase prosperity um it is not
monothematic um pre-specified heuristics about this or that it is just um it is all about
resolving uncertainty and when there are preferences that underwrite that uncertainty just
technically just in case this sounds a bit too hand-waving the expected free energy is literally
the sum of the expected information gain and the expected value where the value or the negative
expected free energy is the sum of the expected information gain expected value where the expected
where the value is the um the log probability of a characteristic outcome now crucially in that
statement where you now read value or utility or the ortness um as um a a probability distribution
over the space of outcomes notice that this is now specified over all possible outcomes
so it now becomes a way of specifying ortness that just is um in the spirit of multiple constraints
over all dimensions of outcomes not the amount of money I make or the number of paper clips I make
but over everything and over everything then converts this effectively into a sort of the
solution to a multiple constraint satisfaction problem where the multiple constraints are
definitive of what I am and if I am embedded in a network of sympathetic agents and artifacts
what we are so baked into this kind of belief sharing there should be a harmony and a mutual
understanding at various levels I mean I'm not talking about sort of direct sort of language
to language you know it could be some sensory substitution devices that have a sort of very
elemental very fast sympathy with with our bodies for example um but at least from the
point of view of the information geometries that there will be a convergence which will be effectively
if you're a quantum physicist an entanglement if you're um if you're a uh a dynamical systems
theory person a generalized synchrony of everybody in that web that is necessarily
a facet of free energy minimization on the one hand on the other hand it's also just a statement
of the steady non-equilibrium steady states to which any distributed network will ultimately
converge to it can be no other way in principle yeah I mean many people have an intuition that
when designing utility functions if you look at how markets work and so on that utility and value
are orthogonal and and then we have institutions like the church and government and and so on to
introduce value pressures um onto the utility function and I guess what I'm what I'm getting
from you is certainly from an evolutionary perspective that they they need to not be orthogonal
and um I mean in in religion for example I mean I'm not religious myself but they
they have um they're moral realists and you and you have moral relativists and and they they say that
um we need to hold something sacred uh because otherwise you know if everything's sacred then
nothing's sacred at all so we need to have a difference between the sacred and and the profane
but um they they think that uh morality shouldn't be achieved through consensus and this is this is
what we need to behave properly I don't believe that but I'm very interested to know where morality
comes from and I think you kind of alluded to that in in in your answer so um are they
hardwired in the brain or is it just a kind of like constructivist social phenomenon I think it's
a constructivist social phenomena but and over a transgenerational sort of niche construction
as well but also um in the moment um and constructivist in the sense that the we're not born with
these things so these things are very much part of cultural um culturally evolutionary thinking and
sort of you know um um nurture um that we inherit not just from our mum but also our mum's mum a
mum mum you're all the way back um so they are in the brain they are learned which are um distinct
from innate priors that underwrite my homeostasis so there are certain beliefs I have sub-personal
beliefs about the way I should behave um that are held with incredible precision and conviction
sub-personally that they're hardwired epigenetically and these would include everything that um
leads to homeostasis and then you build upon that and you get to our stasis and you build upon that
and you can probably at some level get to the right way to behave morally and ethically at school
with your in the playground for example and so as you you know so mathematically the the
distinction between these sort of um very fixed um prior preferences or prior beliefs
that are basically just an encoding of beliefs about the states I characteristically occupy or
aspire to or to or narratives that I would pursue um they are very very precise in some dimensions
and you said you know they are or are not orthogonal you know it was exactly that sort of multi-dimensional
aspect to writing down value of something which would be possible to do for a human being unless
you give me your your DNA and also your mother's womb I couldn't actually write write write it down
very very easily but you know the specification has to be upon all dimensions some of which will
be written down with great precision and others will be much more flexible and I think when it
comes to um writing down values over attributes that do not yet exist because you haven't grown your
deep generative model sufficiently deep in order to have that do abstraction then clearly those
kinds of beliefs about the way I should behave um are not even specified at birth but they have to
be learned through interactions with other people so I guess I'm trying to bring to the notion that
it's perfectly okay to have a spectrum of different convictions about the way to behave
that can be absolutist or it can be more forgiving and relativistic simply and you would be able to
simulate that just by writing down very very precise beliefs versus less precise beliefs
the second key thing here is that we're talking about when it comes to
the building beliefs about the way I should behave that basically presupposes you've got to a
sufficient developmental stage to have selfhood which not everybody gets that far about severe
autism you wouldn't and if you know certain other lower life forms may never get that far but
certainly you have to have um selfhood you have to have a model of that selfhood and then you have
to um um ask um have a model of um others that may be actually be a prerequisite before you have a
model of self and then other kinds of people so um when it comes to making decisions of a moral
ethical sort you know it's just inferring what would I do in this context given I am this kind
of person and my limited understanding of some social signs is it is a little that's a little
bit more complicated that is not necessarily what should I do in this context given I'm that kind of
person it's what do you think I should do given I am in this context given what you think what kind
of person you think I am so basically I'm trying to work out what you think what kind of person you
think I am if I can infer that on the basis of our exchanges and my epistemic foraging and my sort
of self-evidencing through language um then um I can then decide what is right or wrong so it's
just basically an inference you know what's the probability of making that decision with those
outcomes given my world model um if I am that kind of person versus that kind of person um to solve
that I need to know what kind of person I am and that I can just get from them or I can get from
my convert my correspondent or my peer group um or I can choose to you know my in-group from the
social media or the the kind of television news that that I subscribe to so you know we're talking
about before about sort of this utopia of um generalized synchrony and perfect quantum entanglement
and we're all in perfect harmony of course it doesn't quite work like that there's a scale free
sort of specialization and you know different you're at a bigger scale different Markov blankets
where you get in groups and institutions and uh because of that scale freeness and because of
it we're all quintessentially curious in our self-organization we're always exploring other
ways of being um whilst trying to find the shared narrative and common ground with people like me
my family my institution my um my sort of um theological commitments um there will always be
other kinds of me and I and I can sometimes you know I can I can sort of people that kind of me
or the other kind of me so in that context it's really a really interesting question about um
really inferring you know of all the ways I can behave what is the most likely way of behaving
and if you can you know if you if you look at morals and ethics through that lens then you
have now a calculus of being able to write these things down in terms of alternative ways of responding
in a given situation and crucially you mentioned before uncertainty so precision is just the inverse
uncertainty the confidence with which I can assert no I will always do this yeah as opposed to I'm
you know 80% sure I'm that kind of person but also noticing you're now conditioning your moral
position or your ethical position um on being a particular kind of person and of course we can
all be a different kind of person I can be a teacher I can be a student I can be a parent
you know I can be a friend um you know all of these will call to four different sets of
prior beliefs because they're all conditioned on the kind of the the library or the repertoire of
ways of being a human being which I learned from you or my mum and everybody else on television
fantastic I wanted to touch on this idea of um I mean as you said you believe that it's socially
constructed which rather gets away from this notion of some people believe that it's kind of
hardwired and then there's the notion of is our you know our values might be changing faster than
evolution essentially which necessitates the need to have some kind of societal pressures or
governance if you like and I do believe that we're in a new regime now I mean people always say oh
the sky's falling down everything's changing but now we are in the information world and things
are moving at a scale and magnitude that they haven't done before and our values are changing
much faster than they have done before and what you are talking to is very interesting about this
kind of fractionation so there are macroscopic pressures and there are microscopic pressures
there's the internet and so on and I just wonder from your perspective how do we how do we wrestle
with that because there are we've never been in in in a more kind of pluralistic interconnected
environment and how does that affect us yeah I mean these are big questions I'm sure you have
your own answers to um but yeah I think I think that that that sort of fast-moving um globalized
exchange um that that that does speak to a deep pathology um and I have a deja vu I'm sure we've
spoken about this before but sort of you know um Zuckerberg and the you know the genius boy
races of of that the previous decade um talking about connectivity as somehow being a good thing
I find quite frightening remember that we've been talking about um structure and existence
right through to morals and ethics in the context of helping the right kind of sparsity that gives
you the right kind of individuation of things from the world and within any given thing the
right kind of structure that allows it to act gracefully uh and in harmony with that world
every point it's the absence of connectivity that defines the structures so if you destroy
that sparsity by over connecting over globalizing you will um essentially destroy it would basically
cancer um you know so if you look at this is my clever thing if you look at um you know
sort of a cancerous cell as a basically a self-organizing system who has forgotten its
boundaries yes then you are um you have a metaphor for the kind of thing that happens
if you do not respect the sparsity of communication and the um the the joyful
isolation that there is existence behind your own Markov blanket so every affront to
um that uh maintaining that sparsity smart data carefully sampled not being overwhelmed
with a deluge of um very imprecise data that it makes it very difficult for me to actually
go and smartly sample and work out what would happen if I go and look over there or look on
that website um you know so what that would suggest to me is that um there will be um
um there will be and I take your point that that things are changing um I I initially thought to
myself well no hang on a second because all of the information and the sense of making and all
the kind of um exchange of information we're talking about is about constructs that do not exist
when I am born um you know you can't have you can't have misinformation uh from the um what you
called the confabulation what I in my blurb refer to as the the flighty ramblings of gtp uh um
you know you can't that has no meaning for some you know a child that has not yet learned to read
or write or to you know so this is something that has to be below the scale of evolution
so I was just thinking that it's okay you know this is a with you know this is limited to um
to um your each um each each uh generation but I think that's probably a false false
comfort um because you know we were talking about sort of um evolutionary psychology and
cultural evolution as well and I think that's what you were talking about I think that that
that then is if things are speeding up um that usually means you've lost um you've lost precision
in your prior beliefs which means that the precision the informativeness the salience the
reliability of information now takes precedence and you increase your learning rate you become uh
in schizophrenia that we call as jumping to conclusions on the basis of sparse information
you're basically looking out there not inside uh to um resolve uncertainty about states of affairs
because you've lost confidence in your in your very structured prior beliefs so if things are
speeding up that basically means that um whoever is now generating um and garnering that information
in the information age um is has lost um has lost confidence or precision in the in their own
convictions and prior beliefs and possibly information morality uh so what's going to happen um
I read um Carlo Brevelli's book um uh uh yesterday in fact he's he's he's he wrote in
2014 just sort of seven things you need to know about physics which was originally um published
each chapter as you know in the in the the um the sunday newspapers with potentials to scientific
discourse and then he ends up with a very very pessimistic he thinks it's all over
I was actually compelled with by that he you read the last few pages uh yeah he makes exactly the
same points that we we've just been discussing from the point of view of physics um at different
levels um and and and he you know he jelly thinks it's over it's uh I know it's so hard because it's
like the hill climbing problem and you can't see behind the next hill and there are always people
who were uh you know techno luddites and people who think that the sky is falling down it's genuinely
hard to know just just to finish on on this um ethics point uh Lisa Felben Barrett was a constructionist
she had a book called how emotions are made the secret life of the brain
and she thought emotions themselves are socially constructed would you subscribe to that view
and I think I probably would I mean she she writes very wisely and has thought for many
decades about the you know the nature of emotion I think you know I would say yes absolutely it's
simply because you know the the notion of building generative models in a neurodevelopmental
context is an act of construction you know it's a free energy minimizing process that is
that explains why we construct better and better explanations which are sort of
