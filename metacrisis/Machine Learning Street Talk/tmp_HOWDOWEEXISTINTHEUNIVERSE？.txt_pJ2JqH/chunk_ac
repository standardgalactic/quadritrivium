x y plane are very predictable we can just you know there's a road that's just very well defined
and if we go off the road we're in this kind of billowing area where all kinds of random things
are happening so my understanding would be that that in your principle if we don't start talking
about the internal states of the observer that what your principle would say is follow the road
follow the thing that's predictable don't go off into those billowing outside areas where there's
much more randomness in the in the behavior I mean that would be if I understand correctly and that
would sort of minimize that would make things as predictable as possible because you're just going
down the road you're not so you're not subjecting yourself to the to the to the other randomness
in the environment so we start with that now you start to say well I don't just want to talk about
the external environment I want to talk about also the internal states of the observer and how
the observer builds up some view of the environment um and and builds up their own model of what's
going on and let me see if I can untangle that I mean so so first of all am I am I more or less
right in terms of thinking about in the pure fixed observer external environment the observer will
pick the predictable road not the unpredictable areas of randomness is that is that kind of the
right intuition or well I wonder if I can just jump in here for a second if you don't mind and
kind of formulate because I've been thinking about this a lot you know since we've been talking to
professor first and I think this road right so we have this 2d landscape and there's there's really
a narrow path I think is is the idea because hey the universe is complicated life is complicated
there's lots of fire and brimstone you know kind of all over the place and really the path that
leads to you continuing to exist is quite a narrow needle that you need to thread and if I understand
correctly in order to thread that needle in order to even stay on the path you have to be able to
model the landscape a bit at least sufficiently well that you can stay on the path because most
actions actually lead you off into the the billowing chaotic area where you're likely to say
have your cell membrane disrupted you know if you're if you're a cell and so that
therefore if you're going to continue to stay on this path of survival you must in some way at
least partly sufficiently well enough model this landscape in order to stay on the path is this
is this correct I think to me that that that sounds like a clear way to think about it given I mean
particularly if the landscape is changing then it is necessary then then some purely inertial
activity of just I'm going to keep going in a straight line isn't going to cut it and you
know so that sort of necessitates some kind of internal you know learning on the part of the
observer I mean the and I suppose in this thinking about so what attributes does the observer have
to have so that um so that it can be successful for example would you imagine that if the world
was too unpredictable a place if physics was I mean is this a fact of physics that the world
is predictable enough that an observer who can sort of continue to exist is possible I mean this
is something which I think from from my understanding of fundamental physics one of the things that is
not obvious is that an observer who persists in time is possible in the universe that's almost
an assumption of kind of the way that one can derive the laws of physics that we see
from sort of underlying computational foundations is that it is possible to have an observer
who persists in time so I'm curious with your setup Carl what you know could you imagine a world
in which the I mean you might say well whatever the world is like there's always going to be
something which follows this minimum principle of of minimizing maximizing predictability but
you know maybe there is maybe there's a question of whether there could be a world in which you
can never achieve a decent level of predictability and in which I mean perhaps there's a different
thing to ask which is okay you predict what's going to happen but I mean for example you know the
control system that the autopilot that's flying the plane can predict what's going to happen
but if there's a great big vacuum in the air the plane is is toast you know whatever prediction it
might make it might say hey I want to you know move the ailerons in this way and that way but if
the plane's just going to drop by 500 feet it's going to be toast whatever goes on so I'm sort of
curious what you know do you imagine that there's some kind of limit to you know there's there's
some domain of controllability that the world exists in a domain of controllability or do you
think that there's sort of that kind of a brain can learn anything so to speak or I mean I'm curious
how you think about that I think that brains are very privileged and unique and that I would imagine
there are there are parts of the universe all there are universes in which this kind of thing
could not exist so I think that we're very rare things we have attained or some degree of
non-equilibrium steady state with our particular environment which I suspect is a very rare kind
of occurrence and that that very existence the emergence of an observer is would manifest
to us and indeed does manifest to us as a kind of intelligence a kind of sentence that may or
may not have some kind of deep planning associated with it but these I would imagine are very rare
instances and if I you know had to qualify why why are they so rare they depend upon a very very
sparse and structured dependencies amongst amongst the states in question and the states
in question here would be the states of the the universal the niche and in particular that that
subset of states that constitute the observer so the observer cannot is you know very much as I
imagine you know in the way in the or physics project the the observer is part of the system
so we just have a joint distribution or over all possible states and there are certain patterns
of interactions in certain states that you can associate with an observer in some very very
rare instances and then under the free energy principle or at least for me the deep question
then is well how do you then define that subset of states and in so doing can you say anything
about the relationship between the subset of states that constitute the observer and
remaining states that are that are that are being observed the only things you can say
well let's put this another way so that puts pressure on the definition of the subset of
states that constitute something or some some observer and you're at the end of the day you
and I end up or we end up saying well okay we have to be able to identify the states of something
in a way that allows us to disambiguate or not confuse it or let exchange it with the
states of everything else and that usually relies upon in you know in the classical formulation
of the FEP it relies upon specifying sparse coupling sparse dependencies so if one imagines
you know some kind of universe where there are lots of states or locations that can have
occupy different states then you're now talking about a universe that is essentially or parts
of this universe that are essentially empty of connections so you're resting upon the assumption
that there are there are there exists pockets of the universe where there are sufficient sparsity
of dependencies and neighborhood interactions that permit the emergence of this separation between
say the inside of something and the outside of something when that is in play then the free
energy principle principle applies even our in our own universe shortly after the big bang we
wouldn't expect there to be this type of life because the universe wasn't by that point sparse
is that is that essentially what you're saying i think i think that's what's being said i mean i
think i think that you know in a sense what you're saying is the observer is a persistent thing
and in order to be persistent it better not be being bashed too hard by things from the outside
world there better be some way in which the observer is only sparsely coupled to the outside world so
the observer can have a coherent identity that is persistent in some way now obviously there are
things that are persistent you know your average little black hole is fairly persistent and you
know so is your average electron or photon propagating through through you know through empty
space so to speak or the vacuum whatever that term which isn't that empty actually um but uh
so you know this so i think i think what as i understand it your notion of an observer
which by the way is is kind of similar to my notion of an observer would be that um it is
a thing which has a certain coherence and persistence and it has certain internal states
and i think part of what you're describing is the way in which
you know you have a more complicated feedback loop than perhaps uh than i've really thought that much
about a complicated feedback loop where the observer is kind of building their own world
both in terms of their model of what's happening in the outside world and the part of that outside
world in which the observer is choosing to live i mean the observer is hanging out on the surface
of the earth and isn't going and flying to the sun and you know sticking themselves in a um in a
you know 10 million degree furnace so to speak and um that and so there's i mean this question
first question i suppose is and by the way when it comes to physics this question about persistence
is there's even more basic questions like is pure motion possible you know what is motion
motion is you've got a thing and it can move to other places but it's not obvious that when you
move the thing that it is still the same thing and that's something we're very familiar with
because but you know for example if we lived near a spacetime singularity we might not even
believe in pure motion because near a spacetime singularity your average you know coffee cup or
something will be so distorted that it's not clear you would still identify it as that same
coffee cup so to speak so i i think in in um uh it's kind of the nature of of physics that we're
used to is is one where it is possible to have pure motion it's possible to have persistence
at that level but i think what you're i mean you know what i've i've been interested in in trying
to characterize what our observers like us like and the the thing in our physics project that's
really the the kind of the the sort of motivation for that is
that there is this thing we call the rouillade this kind of entangled limit of all possible
computations which is in a sense has everything in it and to know what things we will perceive to
actually be in the universe that we experience we have to kind of know how we're going to
be doing that experiencing and that forces us to understand something about us as observers
and so it is interesting quite interesting as far as i'm concerned to try and get a better
characterization of what observers like us are like and i think for me two critical features of
observers like us are that we are computationally bounded we have sort of only finite minds we
can't untangle every detail of what might be happening in the universe we can only look at
sort of aggregated large-scale features and that's one thing and the second thing is that we at least
believe we're persistent in time we believe that even though we might structurally be made from
different atoms of space at successive moments of time we we can imagine that we have a persistent
experience of the universe so to speak so i think what you're and i'm very those two conditions
are sufficient to allow us to derive second law of thermodynamics general activity and
quantum mechanics which i think is absolutely spectacular because the fact that those things
could be derivable from some underlying principle is really remarkable to me but it's my suspicion
that if we knew more about what we are inevitably like as observers that we will be able to derive
more of the way that we but that the universe seems to us so for example something i was just
realizing today actually in connection we just had a lovely little simulation that we made
of two little black holes in our model of spacetime merging and one of the things that's really
dramatic in that simulation is how much activity there is in the background of space that is that
space in order to exist has to have a lot of activity just to knit together the different
pieces of space independent of having the black hole there and that sort of as as one tries to
think about what one is seeing in that video one realizes that another thing about observers like us
is we kind of believe that we are at a fixed place in space it is not necessary that in other
words in in general activity for example we could have a coordinate system where we're
moving around all over the place in space but one of the things that again is one of our assumptions
i think implicit perhaps assumptions of observers like us is that we think we're at a fixed place
in space i was kind of realizing that that's sort of why Copernicus was so shocking so to speak
because you know we really did believe we were at a fixed place in space because that is our
experience and yet you know if the earth's going around the sun that can't really be what's actually
happening in some sense but but i think so what i'm trying to understand is in your sort of view of
kind of characteristics of observers i think you're you're describing sort of a more nuanced
version of what an observer like us has to be like and this kind of seeking of predictability
is it's an interesting idea i mean it's some uh and the question would be you know to what extent
in this kind of you know unruly really add so to speak of all possible computations
that we are seeking the predictable paths or the predictable sort of seeking predictability in that
is is sort of an interesting principle i mean i suppose i'm curious if you look at it
from the point of view of uh well i think as you say it's a little bit tautological because
um uh you know without predictability if things are sufficiently unpredictable you
don't get to coherently exist if things are sufficiently unpredictable you will be torn
apart by those outside forces that you cannot control so to speak um i i am curious uh you
know when it comes to things like control theory and you know the the whole sort of idea of uh
you know i mean control theory is a is a much more limited way of thinking about what can you
control but i'm sort of curious in um i mean if if i were to try to let's say my environment was
uh some well how unpredictable an environment can i be in and still achieve enough control
to be your kind of observer i guess i would be curious if there's a characterization
of just how unruly can the world be and still allow a a coherent observer of the kind that you're
you're imagining that's um yeah that's a challenging question a superficial answer was
not that unruly there has to be something uh recognizable as time proceeds can i just say
brought so many wonderful issues to the table there all of which i can see through the lens of
my understanding of much simpler and classical physics that um underwrites you know the free
energy principle you know um just very briefly this um these two fundaments that you mentioned the
notion of computational boundedness plus persistence in time underwriting thingness and in particular
you know the capacity to just observe or be an observer um for me um that is immediately reflected
in the uh the two pillars of the free energy principle which is first of all a mark-off boundary
which is the thing that demarcates the observer from from the observed so i know that you were using
bounded in a in a you know sort of bounded rationality possibly a different sense yeah
different sense but um you know i still think it's quite beautiful that in fact the whole
FEP can just be written down from the statement there exists a mark-off boundary that separates the
inside of a thing from the outside of a thing um and if you can i actually can i pick up on that
for a second because i'm really curious about um you know to me for example our sensory organs
are presumably there's a brain inside but it's connected only by certain sort of thin sensory
organs to the outside world and i guess that i'm curious because to me what sensors what our sensors
and our measuring devices typically do is they take a large number of possible things that might
be happening in the world the equivalents a lot of those together so we just get to say
i see a cat even though the details of the pixels in that cat might be very different
and i'm sort of curious to the extent that you talk about this kind of mark-off boundary
mark-off blanket idea um to what extent is the is the sparsification of external stimuli
for that same reason that is that that it seems like measuring devices or our sensors
you know whatever their big purposes take all these different possible states of the world
and equivalents lots of them together so that we can just make a simple summary
is that consistent with your kind of view of how how you get that sparsity of connection between
the outside and the inside so to speak or do you have a different point of view about that
no no i have exactly that point of view and i'd even go further you know the all the internal
machinations on the inside which of course you will never see because it's hidden behind the
mark-off blanket you observing the observer will only actually ever see the behavior the active
states of that mark-off blanket and the impression of the environment on that sensory epithelia or
those sparse sensory sampling those measurement tools but beyond that the whole point so one key
way of reading the maximization of marginal likelihood or the basically the the likelihood
of these sensory impressions under a model of what caused those sensory impressions that is under
the hood is to say what the the most accurate explanation that is as simple as possible so
literally the you know the log marginal likelihood is equal to accuracy minus complexity so you're in
the game of compression you're in the game of coarse-graining that is an emergent property
of maximizing the marginal likelihood of your sensory exchanges with with the with the observed
so this i think notion of coarse-graining is absolutely central here at many many different
levels you know i'm like you know that's that's what i want to ask about is because this is a
connection that Tim and i have been thinking about to the being computationally bound is that
