is that you want the world to be as predictable a place as possible.
And that it can be predictable either because you have a great model of what's going to happen,
or because you've organized your world so that it is set up to be predictable.
You know, we, we, we kind of, you know, part of what we try to achieve with technology and things
is to make our lives sort of more predictable.
And I suppose my, my assumption is that, I mean, first of all, am I,
am I roughly right in what the, what the point is here?
Am I totally, totally off base?
No, no, you're perfectly right.
I mean, that's almost word for word, how, how I would portray the sort of
telogical implications of the free energy principle to psychologists and neurobiologists
and other sort of theoreticians in the life sciences.
I should say, if I was talking to a physicist, and now I am,
and just want to say that I'm only an intuitive physicist.
I've forgotten all the physics I did when I was, when I was a young man.
But if I were trying to explain to a physicist, then everything you said is exactly right,
but inverted.
So if things exist and thing-ness is defined in terms of establishing some kind of
synchrony or some kind of non-equilibrium steady state with everything else,
or particularly the local niche in which it finds itself,
then it can always be read as if it is trying to predict what is happening,
and exactly as you say, engineer or design its niche,
so to, as to make things more predictable.
So it's one of, done then, it's strange inversions.
So part of the simplicity of the, the free energy principle lies in that almost
tautological framing of the free energy principle whereby you're just saying
that if something exists in harmony in relation to its environment,
then it will show these kinds of properties that can, on a certain reading,
be interpreted as minimizing surprise, maximizing predictability.
But there are lots of nuances, and I would like to know how this might fit into
what we were talking about before going on air,
the Ruliad and your conception of how the universe unfolds, and what part of that,
what slice of that constitutes the thing, the observer, and how it relates to the context
in which it is evolving.
Yeah, I think that's interesting, but let me see if I can paraphrase what you just said.
You basically said that for an organism to be sort of happily going along,
as you said, in harmony with its environment, it is inevitable, you say, that it must have
achieved this minimization of surprise, this maximization of predictability.
Is that right? I mean, that's some, so in other words, that somehow,
if things were still dynamically changing, and the world was becoming a different place,
for example, and equilibrium of the type you described had not been achieved,
then, as I understand it, you would not expect your sort of, well, I kind of,
the term free energy kind of confuses me a bit because, you know, I'm used to kind of
a physics version of that, which I think is not quite the same as what you're talking about,
but let's say you're, let's talk about, you're saying that, so let me ask, in a situation
where the world is changing, do you anticipate that this minimization of surprise, so to speak,
still is still there, or do you think there's a different thing that might be more like a
non-equilibrium version of thermodynamics as compared to a sort of equilibrium things are
going along with, in the case of thermodynamics, maximization of entropy, in your case, the
minimization of surprise, or did I misunderstand that? Well, no, it's an excellent question. So,
strictly speaking, the free energy principle does assume that there is some steady state,
but it is a non-equipment steady state, so it's certainly as meant to speak to 21st century physics
are not the thermodynamic equilibria that you would have in say a closed system, so it's all about
how something, say an observer, is open to the thing that it is observing, and understanding
the statistics of that exchange with the thing that is, it is open, say for example, a heat
bath, it's understanding how you couple to a heat bath and beyond, and what certain properties would
that coupling and the system, say the observer of that heat bath would possess, if it were the case,
technically, that this joint system had a pullback, it's largely framed around the notion of
random dynamical systems, but it does assume that there exists a pullback attractor to which the
system is being attracted, so most of the free energy principle would really only apply
over the time scale that you are circulating on that attracting set, so if at a certain time scale
there could be reasonably assumed over a period of time an unequilibrium steady state, then you
can apply the free energy principle, so at that level there are assumptions about persistence,
and I know that you make a big thing about the way that we measure and observe the universe,
rests upon that sort of notion of things having temporal persistence, I guess that the same kind
of commitment is inherent in assuming that there is a non-equilibrium steady state solution to the
dynamics in a classical formulation. So you're really talking about if the world isn't changing
too much, this is what brains and things like them are going to be trying to achieve, that is
they're going to be trying to set things up so that they can as well as possible predict what's
going to happen, so I'm kind of curious whether you see that as being an inevitable feature of
sort of our success and the struggle for life in biological evolution and whether you think it's
kind of almost a corollary to kind of a brain-oriented corollary to sort of success in
natural selection or whether you think it has a different kind of origin?
I would look at natural selection as one manifestation of exactly the same kind of
self-organization but at a much slower timescale, so success just is existing and existing is
maintaining yourself in some characteristic states that you can be identified as that kind of thing
over a certain time period, so if that is success then the free energy principle is just
describing the necessary properties from the point of view of sort of a classical physicist or at
least somebody framing things in terms of random dynamical systems, success just is existing for
or persisting for a sufficient amount of time and that could be at a timescale suitable to
understand the organization of a single cell so that the persistence would actually possibly be
in hours to weeks to months or it could be the kind of persistence you might bring to the table
to characterize or define the characteristic coarse grain states that apply to a particular
species for example and then you'd be looking at evolution as a process of effectively finding
those phenotypes that persist, there's a lot of tautologies here which perhaps if you just
indulge me so the surprise we're talking about is just the self-information in a Chalonesque sense
that's just a negative log probability of you know me as something being in a particular state
so in minimizing that self-information I'm also implicitly maximizing the probability
of me occupying this particular state so I'm just maximizing my marginal likelihood
having marginalized out all the environmental or external causes of the exchange with the environment
so read it in that way it's just you could also say it is a statement of adaptive fitness at an
evolutionary set in an evolutionary sense that it is a measure of the probability you'll find
something like me in this particular eco niche so then you can now start to read evolution natural
selection as Bayesian model selection in the sense that a Bayesian statistician would just
select the best hypothesis or the best model of her data on the basis of the marginal likelihood
or the evidence for that model so that leads to a nice picture of evolution is effectively
nature's way of doing Bayesian model selection trying to get the right kind of model for this
kind of eco niche I mean clearly things get a little bit more complicated when the model is
starting to build that eco niche but in essence that you know that that's a sort of the deflationary
aspect of this description you know it's just yeah but I mean so I'm kind of curious in an organism
it's trying to make its world as predictable as possible by by getting smarter as an organism
and by giving itself you know an easier house to live in where it doesn't have to be
subject to the vicissitudes of nature so to speak where it can it can just you know have a predictable
life but I suppose you know maybe it seems very kind of sort of every day to say I mean
if that's kind of like you're setting things up to make things as status quo as possible
because that's that's the case in which things will be as as predictable as possible but yet
some of us perhaps even like you and me like going to explore things where we don't kind of
know what's going to happen and so I'm sort of curious how you see kind of unexpected scientific
discovery in the context of kind of a model of what what in a sense brains try to achieve
in so far as you're you're you're positing that sort of things should be set up to be as predictable
as possible how does kind of going out and finding surprising things in in science or
in nature fit into that I'm sort of curious right well it's interesting you end the question with
curious because that that that would be the answer wouldn't it yeah how would you explain us as
curious creatures so from yep from the the physicist's point of view this rests on the
the picture of the free energy principle as simply a principle of least action so it's
it's you know there is some time integral in play exactly of the kind that's sort of written
fine it's and just to explain where the free energy comes from in this sense it is exactly the
kind of free energy that Richard Feynman used to elude the intractable problem of marginalizing
over all possible paths but providing a variational bound on that marginal that marginal or the log
of the the marginal likelihood which has been used a great effect in statistics and indeed
you know defines a whole field of variational bays so it is purely an information theoretic
probabilistic quantity that bounds the the marginal likelihood but crucially it applies to
trajectories and paths so I think that's the solution to your I think very natural and challenging
question why is it if we are surprised minimizing we act in a way that is information seeking
that responds to novelty to response to sensation and indeed as you say you know both an eye you
and I now are engaging in this sort of uncertain to resolving curiosity driven kind of behavior
and one could also cast both our lives as doing exactly this and our and Keith and Tim yeah that's
the whole raison d'etre of the of these of these interviews to gain information you know celebrate
information seeking behavior you're the the narrative answer to your question that if you're
trying to minimize surprise and you want to use that principle to understand the kinds of paths
that I would choose or elect to take through some state space then I'm going to try to choose those
are I more likely to choose those paths that minimize expected surprise now if you remember
expected for surprise is just expected self-information so that's just uncertainty so entropy so I
will in terms of the paths that I take in terms of my behavior my choices and my actions over time
then I am more likely to choose those actions that reduce the entropy of my beliefs or my measurements
namely reduce my uncertainty so that's that that is if you like the kernel of the application
the free energy principle not just the states of mind but to the way that one can understand
agency in the sense of your how do sentient things or things that could be cast as observing in
some sense how do they behave or how must they behave if they on average minimize the path integral
of their surprise or the bound of a bound upon surprise so read like that it is just a statement
it's just a variation of principle of least action that now acquires an interpretation
you end up saying well I am then if I exist and I am an agent that can act upon that world
and can gather the right kind of data or sample the right the right sensory inputs or sensory
exchanges with that world then it will look as if I am curious and you know perhaps you know we
you know mankind or woman kind is you know the epitome of that kind of self-organizing
realization of that principle of least action does that make sense I'm not quite understanding this
so I mean in in uh in the traditional path integral of physics one has what one is trying to minimize
is the action effectively the relativistically invariant kind of energy
quantity and one one specifically one's trying to you know find well actually it's not necessarily
minimized find the extrema of e to the i times the action where so you're I mean you know there's
there's a there's a fairly specific kind of concept in physics of how that works that rather
spectacularly in our kind of models of fundamental physics we can actually derive from much lower
level computational concepts but I think that's not really where you're going with what you're
thinking about I think instead what you're thinking about is you have a path integral of
if I'm if I'm not mistaken you're saying there is sort of the life of the organism is
the the time variable and the life of the organism is what you're integrating over
and the possible paths correspond to the possible things the organism could do
somehow navigating through what is some kind of distribution space of probabilities
is that is that roughly right or did I did I totally misunderstand that no no I think it is
certainly roughly right the rightness there is that you know well first of all
the sort of formal the pathological formulation the free energy principle he is he is just
exactly finding that path that that minimizes that that the integral of the this variational
free energy but you're also right that the variational free energy is a functional of
a probability distribution so the twist here is that the physical states of an observer
that is somehow identifiable or individual or separable from the thing that is that is being
observed stand in for the sufficient statistics or the parameters of probability distributions
conditional probability distributions you know interpreted or read as Bayesian beliefs of a
very sub-personal sort so this free energy is a function of a function it's a function of
probability distributions that are parameterized by the physical paths that your internal states
internal to the observer would take and so then the game is to try and find or
for certain particles that have very very precise internal dynamics they will follow the paths of
least action in a standard classical physics sense and but in this instance you would be
interpreting that as paths that are described in terms of the smallest variational free energy
functional of the beliefs encoded by those paths so if those if that free energy is now
read in terms of a measure of or representation of the internal states sorry the external states
then what you're saying is that this path of least action is effectively the path of least surprise
about what you think is actually causing the your your exchange with the external states
so the twist here is that your your work you're making a distinction well the move from say
physics or the move which makes the the physics that is described by the free energy principle
distinct from the usual applications of the path integral formulation is that you've got a
distinction between the states and observer and that which is observed which now allows you or
licenses you to interpret the observing states as holding beliefs about the observed states so
under you know what we would normally call a sort of Markov blanket partition where you're
partitioning the all possible states into the states of the thing doing the observation
and the thing and external states being being observed what you're saying is that the internal
states now play the role of the sufficient statistics of beliefs or distributions about
the external states so these are beliefs about something they're not the probability distribution
of the thing itself which is you know what you would apply or how you deploy the principle
deploy the principle least action in the usual sense but it's the same exactly the same math but
now applied to the the conditional distributions or the Bayesian beliefs encoded by or entailed by
the internal states so this is where the sort of the physics of sentence comes in and you can start
to talk about being surprised you know in an anthropomorphic sense but the maths is
is you know there's there's nothing new in the maths it's just it's just what inherits from being
able to distinguish between the inside and the outside does that make sense so you're moving
on let me see if I understand that so so let's take a sort of an initial simplified model where we
don't consider the internal states of the observer at all let's just start with an observer hanging
out in an environment and choosing a path through in a sense through that environment so imagine
that the environment is parametrized by let's say an information amount or an entropy the
environment is parametrized by different let's say we've just got a plane x y plane for example
and at every point in the x y plane we have a certain amount of randomness some places in the
