even though that's been a very popular idea for a long time right the the black hole electron
there's so many similarities between between and I think people have told me you know I'm
I'm remembering when I was like 15 years old or something maybe 14 years old something I went to
some talk by some well-known physicist and you know I sort of said they you know they were
talking about black holes and I was like is there something you know similar between electrons
and black holes and it was like no no no that's a completely silly idea you know you should forget
that idea there's so there's so much that's similar and then there's just a little bit that's off
right it's like not quite doesn't quite match well I think the thing that I really enjoy is the
concept of why is that why are all electrons why do they all seem the same and a black hole you
know your average black hole all the different black holes in the universe we imagine they were
made from the crushing of completely different stars but to the outside of the black hole they
look the same and so that leads one to the kind of amusing idea that all those electrons all those
10 to the 80th electrons that there are in our universe that seem to all be the same maybe actually
each of those individual electrons has sort of a crushed civilization inside it that's different
but to the outside of the electron they look the same and that's and now and now we have to start
talking about those to the you know those observers that live inside the crushed civilization
inside the electron how do they feel about sort of how do they how do they kind of
conduct their lives so to speak and are they like those those creatures we were talking about earlier
inside the initially moving spacecraft who are who are like having this whole you know they're
having a whole giant you know that they're giving lots of speeches all inside the electron but
nothing outside the electron can tell that there's that there's anything going on there
well so just real real last quick and Carl I'm sorry if you're taking the time here but for the
for the black holes which you can identify in the Ruliad are they able to experience pure emotion
well ha to observers who have certain characteristics they will appear to have pure
emotion but for example the knitting together one of the things that actually is pretty tricky
it was even tricky in making this video which is kind of an interesting thing
is in order to make the video we had to have we had to it took more effort to constrain the
observer than to work out the underlying dynamics in other words to to render the video required
aligning the sort of different pieces of space at different moments of time and keeping those
coherent and that took vastly more computational effort than it took to do the underlying dynamics
of what was going on and so that's that's kind of highlights the fact that you know we had to
make an assumption about the observer the observer thinks they're standing still the observer is not
zipping around all over the place the observer believes they're stuck they're persistent in
time and they're stuck in more or less the same place in space we didn't have that we wouldn't
be able to make a video that anybody recognizes even though the underlying connections and all
these hypergraphs are all absolutely correct we just wouldn't be able to see that so it's a so in
that sense you know we can say that to an observer with those characteristics yes black holes are
persistent things and and those characteristics by the way this is all reflected in in the in the
traditional treatment of general relativity there are it is you know the this business about aligning
things is if you don't do that even in standard numerical relativity you end up with all these
weird coordinate singularities that kind of that kind of shred your space so anyway that this is
so it's kind of fun that we get to see even in just we're trying to make a video it kind of
forces us to think about these scientific questions about what how observers work and how much effort
it is to be an observer how much effort it is to kind of successfully knit together you know these
these things that that sort of are happening underneath in the universe um well anyway this
has been i i have to run off here i i don't want to but i i'd love to go on and and chat some more
but i i see i'm actually two meetings late so i think i have to go back to my let me um keep maybe
just before we wrap up could you recapitulate some of what we were discussing earlier which is similar
to what you just said now and i don't want to say that you are an agency chauvinist but you
were just saying that there might be one particular way of demonstrating agency and earlier on you
were saying okay well we should look at the overall system and there is a distribution
of agency it's it's it has loci all over the system and you could draw a big boundary and say well that
things has agency but you could be much more efficient and you could draw a smaller boundary
and that smaller boundary would have almost all of the agency of the big boundary because most of
the things in the big boundary are just mimicking or stealing agency from things in the small boundary
so keith you were saying it's really important for us to encapsulate the most agency possible
which is to say the most amount of temporal planning in the smallest space yeah and so what
i had in mind there carl was just that imagine imagine i'm a pilot steering a ship okay and
as somebody looking from the outside looked at the ship they may decide that the ship as a whole
is an agent you know it's planning like obviously it's planning it navigated through you know the
suez canal and some locks and whatever else but but there's a smaller subsystem if we had the
ability to analyze this we could find a smaller subsystem which is the pilot you know this human
being who's sitting at the controls who's actually the the agent right and maybe you could shrink it
down a bit further and say it's really just all his brain that's everything inside of his skull
that's kind of doing the planning but then we realize that agency actually has the two sides
of the coin like it has the planning side of the coin which is only happening up in here but the
inaction side is perhaps different because if you're looking at the all the machinery necessary
to enact the plan it's the pilot's brain and the pilot's body and the ship itself and all its
components so I think you you know you can come up with a different boundary if you look at the
an active piece of agency versus the planning piece of agency but I think you do need to
on the planning side you need to at least shrink it down to that minimal
system that contains the the actual planning
