Traditionally,
for conventional entropic force,
consider an ideal chain.
So how would we formulate,
how would we formalize
the notion of a system
that doesn't just want to occupy
as many spatial microstates as possible,
but also wants to occupy
as many paths through the future as possible?
So go back to the example from
Moho for MCTS.
At a high level,
all Moho is doing and its successor systems
are they're looking for ways
to perturb a system
such that that system can explore
the largest number of possible paths
up to some future horizon.
So can we use this language
of entropic forces to characterize that?
And the answer is yes,
and it's beautifully simple.
We simply take the concept of an entropic force
on a spatial ideal chain
and we rotate it in space-time.
So rather than considering an ideal chain,
we could consider
random walks through space-time.
A random walk to a physicist
is more or less what
for Moho you look at
for an MCTS search
if you add in a bit of proving for efficiency.
Monte Carlo sampled the possible
future paths between the present state
of the system and some future time
horizon that could be parametrically chosen.
So at a high level,
this is what we did.
We took the same concept of entropic forces
which are ubiquitous in our visible world
and asked what happens if we generalize
an entropic force to space-time
to characterize systems
that are trying to maximize their future
freedom of action.
And it turns out
very satisfying that you could describe that
with a minor modification
to an equation
that you would use to describe conventional
entropic forces.
So
you could print this on a t-shirt if you want to.
What does this mean?
So with a conventional entropic force
you have some force
which is
so
you have a conventional entropic force
where you have a force that's proportional
where the constant of proportionality is the temperature
going back to the rubber band analogy.
To a gradient
in, now traditionally this would be
entropy space.
So you could define entropy in a variety of ways
for entropic force discussions
entropy is typically a Shannon entropy
associated with microstates
that are partitioned into backward states.
Yes, here's your line.
Could you define causal entropy where precisely?
Next slide.
I should just give this talk in reverse, I think.
So all this is doing
is saying that
we're going to look at processes
that are writing gradients
in a landscape
where the landscape
is determined by for each state
in our universe.
What is up to some future time horizon
which we've parameterized this towel
what is the diversity of accessible future paths
in our universe?
How much future freedom of action do we have?
And
so for Yoshua
next slide how do we calculate what a causal entropic force is?
I get the cursory treatment here
if you'd like more depth
I would encourage you to speak with me afterwards
or just go read the original VRL
where we laid this out
in exhausting detail.
So the high level idea is
in answer to Yoshua's question
which is what is causal entropy?
Causal entropy we define
as a path integral
from the present state of the universe
up to some future time horizon
of the Shannon entropy
of possible paths that the system
could evolve along.
So in a certain very real
sense this reduces to
a traditional entropy depending upon our definitions
if your time horizon is zero.
At a high level
all we're really doing and I know there's a follow up talk
about ways to express the same concept
quantum mechanically is
we're enumerating all possible paths
that the system could take if you started off
in its present state
and then evolve that out up to some future
time horizon.
And we're then using these
partial entities as weights
for actions.
So this is a control policy
in the sense of optimal control theory.
But instead of an action
we're using the language of physics
to say this isn't going to be a force.
And it turns out there are numerous advantages
which maybe we can discuss more in Q&A
to describing this physically
versus describing this from
an optimal control policy perspective.
Is there a question?
So we can use all of
our path integral calculus
machinery to
reduce this
expression for
partial causal entropy
weighted actions
to a simpler
approximation which converges
on the actual force
as you sample more
and more densely possible future
path space
a very computable expression.
And let me just talk for a minute about
at sort of a high level
what this expression means.
So the idea here is
it's never going to be feasible
to allude to some of the questions that happened in the tutorial
right before this to densely
sample some very realistic spaces.
You're never going to exhaust some of these spaces.
All that we can hope for is
some sort of sparse sample.
If we were anthropologists or psychologists
we would be tossing around
terms like memory of the future.
The idea that in your imagination
you're in human planning
in a certain sense remembering
things that are going to happen.
You're using your imagination to explore
possible future contingencies.
But your contingency tree is always going to be sparse.
You'll boil the oceans before
you can exhaustively sample
the entire search tree.
So the question is how do we use sparse sampling
to calculate this number?
And it turns out
if you sort of crank
the math machine enough times
that you can reduce this path
to a number
to a set of quantities
that are relatively easy to calculate
which is, and I'll describe this at a high level
as a sort of table of contents
for people who want to discuss in greater detail
we can have difference.
Imagine that
you as a human have to make a decision.
So how are you going to do that?
This prescription for how you would
policy, for how you'd make a decision is
imagine yourself in your present state.
Now repeat the following several times.
Imagine randomly
how your life could evolve
up to some future point in the line of state
five years from now. Obviously it's going to be multi-scale
obviously it's going to be low resolution
fine. So now
you have five ways,
