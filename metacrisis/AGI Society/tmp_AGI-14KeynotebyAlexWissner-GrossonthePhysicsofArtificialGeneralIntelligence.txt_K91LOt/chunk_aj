but we choose not to be lazy anyway
so
let's go to the next example
so tool use
so for anyone here
who's familiar with the
ethology literature
it's very natural to ask the question
since we would say struggle
as a species with defining
what human intelligence is
it's very natural to go to behavioral studies
for some semblance
of standard experiments
that we can apply to a system that we can't
communicate with, do touring tests
with all these really human specific
activities
so in the ethology literature
study of animal behavior
it turns out that there are a few canonical
physical experiments
that are performed on animals
to try to benchmark their level of intelligence
the mirror test
is a very popular one in the media
but it's not the only one
there are a few others that turn out to be
far more widely used and not dependent
on having a mirror
and also
it can be argued that the mirror test doesn't actually
measure anything other than
one narrow slice
so maybe we want lots of canonical experiments
that we can test across animals, humans
and AIs that we build
so one popular example
is this concept of tool use
so
in its most canonical form
tool use experiment
basically consists of giving an agent
an animal, human, whatever
access to an environment
containing
a restricted region that is too narrow
for the agent to reach into
but for which
there exist objects in the environment
that can be deployed to reach into that environment
for the agent
we call these objects tools
we call process tools
in terms of animal behavior
this has been demonstrated in crows
demonstrated in a wide variety of primates
typically to fish food out of the container
a few years ago
a pro example of crows figuring out
how to use paper clips
to reach into cylinders
that were too narrow for their beaks to reach into
to fish food out
became a popular example but it's just one among
many animal examples
so it's very natural to ask
does causal entropy maximization
in this
canonical animal test
of tool use? the answer is yes
so let me just step through this
frame by frame again
there's a more
exacting video of this
online I'll put it at the end
so we start with the system
it's a model system
for convenience
because we don't want to waste too much computer power
trying to
simulate 3D objects
so it was very natural
to ask ourselves what's the sort of
lowest dimensional model representation of this
tool use experiment
and so the lowest dimensional model
that we can come up with
involves so it's a two dimensional universe
instead of a three dimensional universe
and it involves three disks
so people like to sort of
joke that a physicist likes to model
a cow with a spear
so it's sort of a popular job
but there is a reason why it's popular to
model objects with spears
it's very easy to understand analytically
so here we have a large disk
representing agent
animal this large disk is being
forced by causal entropy maximizer
so it's being steered
by this engine
and we have two objects in the environment
we have two disks
both of which are passive
which is actively forced
by a region here that is too narrow
for this agent
to squeeze into
and we have these added degrees of freedom
in this
container that are initially locked up
because the object is stationary
representing again the standard
animal intelligence test
and so you can see almost immediately
so we apply
causal entropy maximizer forces
causal entropy forces to this large disk
it immediately collides
and this
will hopefully speak to the erudicity
question from that moment ago
with this other disk
that was previously stationary in its environment
in order to cause it to enter
probably have to play this several times
cause it to enter
this restricted region
unlocking the degrees of freedom
for that object that had previously
been stationary there
and that's something really interesting to happen
so let me just pause it before
we get to the next interesting stuff
and ask for a second
why to the erudicity question
why didn't this large disk
which was being causal entropy
force
10 minutes?
10 seconds
no 10 minutes
we can ask why doesn't this large disk
just remain stationary
why doesn't it sit around waiting for some
future need to explore space space
the answer is it has much greater
access to position
and momentum space by
keeping both of these disks
and let me replay the segment
so you get sort of a more visual feel for this
keeping them within
really tight temporal access
to their position moment
and degrees of freedom
so you'll notice
constantly colliding with them
and to use a sort of simplified metaphor
if you had say
a baseball or basketball
and you wanted to exercise
maximal control over its future freedom
of action what would you do
would you throw it really high in the air
would you just sit on the ground stationary
or would you sort of be
dribbling it
or sort of tossing it around in your hands
so that at a moment's notice you can enable it
to
I guess if you can't hold it
that wouldn't be a proper analogy
but say you're allowed to dribble
because if you're dribbling it
then on a very short timescale if you want to do something with it
you'd go throw it somewhere else
and in fact, and I'll get to the question in a minute
if we played this all the way through
we'll see because this is using
sparse sampling and can't model
all possible future courses
of action so occasionally
it will slip up and allow
both of these disks out of the container
and it's fascinating
what happens next
so if it has both of them
caged it has great access to their
future free of action
but then it slips up
because we're only finitely sampling
a certain number of possibilities
it's about to let one out
lets one out and immediately
puts it back in the cage
so I'll answer
