of one AGI on the planet and the rest of
humanity and the AGI is asking
itself do I torture all of humanity
some of humanity none of humanity
and why the answer would depend
on whether there would be
perhaps countervailing
forces in the universe
to try to punish an AGI
through reduction
of its future freedom of action
so with today's knowledge
we don't have
I would say the knowledge to be able to credibly answer
that question but my proposal
is that at least we have the formalism
to frame the question in rigorous terms
so other questions
let's go over it
so the question was
does into causal entropy maximization
just revert
or reduce ultimately to
survival maximization
so that's a very interesting question
I have several different answers
to that
first answer is you can use this to calculate
in universes where there's no concept of
survival
so maybe this is an excellent jumping off point
to actually show some examples
how to take a call first
how many people have actually
seen any systems
any demonstrations of what happens
when you apply causal entropy maximization
to systems
so maybe a third of the audience
so if you guys will permit me
I'll just show a video that demonstrates
what actually happens
and this is a very long and circuitous way
of answering your question regarding
doesn't this just reduce to survival maximization
the answer is no it doesn't just reduce to it
because there are a variety of systems
where you get really interesting results out
of the concept of survival
so let me
I suppose no way to connect
the audio here so maybe I'll just
right before me
alright so people let me know
if you can hear this
fortunately it's transcribed
so
okay so I'll just
I'll now read this
so first example
standard problem control theory 101
an inverted pendulum
so this isn't the full video
but we've shown that
this control theoretic task
you take a downward hanging
pole connected to a cart that can move in
in one dimension
that if you connect up a causal entropy maximization engine
to the cart
it will immediately
swing up the pole and
vertically stabilize it
let me just
show part of that video here
if you want to see the full video it's available online
you'll see here
maximizing causal entropy by keeping
the pole upright
why is this causal entropy maximizing
behavior because
if you're a cart and you have finite
you have access to
finite temperature reservoir
basically a velocity limit
if you swing the pole up and then you start
to allow it to swing around
now suddenly you've biased yourself
in angular momentum space
and it's going to be very difficult to access
more paths through position momentum space
so this is a four dimensional system
horizontal position in momentum of the cart
and angular position
in momentum of the pole
turns out that there's a global maximum
in causal entropy space
there's a whole upright
if you want to be
yes
let's hang on
it turns out that
that's not a global maximum
so if you want a heuristic argument
for why hanging down
is not a global causal entropy maximizing
maximum
because it seems like you can still go into this
in the future if you want to
so one answer is
if you have access to finite energy
to move around
if you're upright you have more potential energy
and while this reasoning doesn't generalize
beyond this example
it's easier for you to access all of these other positions
more quickly because you have all of this
potential energy you can then convert
over to kinetic energy versus drawing upon your scarce
kinetic energy reservoir
question
sorry question
it seems like you're going to focus
a couple times on different time scales
on different time scales
let's
sorry
sorry
sorry please continue
yeah so the different time scales
let me get away with
you know avoiding
look at this
I'm wondering
how that applies in this case it seems like
there's seven time scales
that would allow you to have
a swing around
and that's an excellent point
and without allowing that
you're reducing some of the degrees
of freedom
so the question was
on that time scales
conversely I could say if you reduce
I think this
can I throw my phone
on your phone
so
the answer about time scales is
I could pose the converse question which is
what happens if you make your time horizon
shorter than say some characteristic
time needed to swing around what happens then
and the answer is it behaves stupidly
if you
for this system if you take t goes to infinity
then it converges
on this behavior of always spinning it to the
upright because there's still always going to be
a small difference even though in principle
you would sort of be really lazy
to wait around for future need
to explore all of these
possible paths through phase space
there's always going to be a small
differential advantage to swing the upright first
and then remaining there for the rest of the universe
as to how it goes to infinity
yes
so you're going to have
if you get to pick that way
for some of these other examples
you are going to have a little bit of a problem
because
there will be examples where
some of these won't
allow
you know
they'll say it's a spin violation
instead of exploring
possible possibilities
because they're a longer term
is that a problem?
no so I'll show an explicit example
of that in a minute or so
any other questions on this before we move on
so that's an excellent
question
so to paraphrase the question
won't for a broad class of systems
we just be completely lazy
because
it's more convenient to be lazy
than to do other things
and I'll show one explicit example
of a case where
the universe is energetically flat
and
it's periodic
