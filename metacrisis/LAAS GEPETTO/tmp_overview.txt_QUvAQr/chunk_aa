1. The principle of generative models in neuroscience involves minimizing prediction error through a process that can be approximated using Gaussian assumptions, which leads to the use of Gauss-Newton schemes due to their computational efficiency.

2. These schemes are particularly appealing for those with limited computational resources, such as users of MATLAB or similar platforms.

3. The predicted coding formulation and Kalman filtering are equivalent in terms of message passing observed in the brain, with superficial cells in the cortex representing predictions and deep cells representing expectations.

4. While these macro-level models are well-investigated in neuroscience, there is a challenge in implementing statistical reasoning into microscopic models of individual neurons or clusters of neurons.

5. Microscopic models typically deal with continuous states and continuous time representations of posterior activity, whereas many existing microscopic models work with discrete states based on large vectors, often without the full Bayesian framework.

6. The distinction between predicted coding and Bayesian filtering schemes is significant when considering the temporal dynamics and state representations in neuronal models.

7. The discussion highlights a gap between macro-level theoretical understanding and micro-level implementation in neuroscience, particularly in how to accurately model the statistical reasoning at a single neuron or small cluster level.
