We can also get in a trap when we start to think about purpose in terms of doing
exclusively and so very commonly people think what is the purpose of my life
and they think that there is an answer in words that relates to something that
they're going to do. So I'm going to end extreme poverty or prevent AI
catastrophe or whatever it is and of course if that one doing is their
purpose then every opportunity to relieve suffering or add beauty other
than that isn't part of their purpose.
Welcome to 2050 the Norflav podcast about the big picture, positive impact and
life purpose. This podcast inspires you to think big, create your life purpose and
make it happen. My name is Max Haag and for this episode I spoke to Daniel
Schmachtenberger. Daniel Schmachtenberger is a system thinker and
thought leader. He is director of research and development and a co-founder
at the Neurohacker Collective where he's focused on developing processes and
technologies for advancing medicine and human optimization. This episode is a bit
longer than usual but well worth it. Daniel dives deep into the meaning and
different dimensions of life purpose and shares his big picture view on
civilization and the trajectory of the world. Hi Daniel, thank you for joining
the 2050 podcast. Hey Max, I'm happy to be here. Thanks for having me. Daniel, what
is your life purpose? I think I'll start with sharing a little bit about how I
think about that question, the arc of how I've thought about that question in my
life which is probably going to be more relevant for people than what my
particular answer to the question happens to be. As valuable as a question as it is
it's also a problematic one, can be a problematic one. So as a kid I didn't
feel like I could actually make any choice without knowing that because I
didn't have the context. So the most trivial choices of what to study or who
to play with or what to pay attention to like well what is the what is the
coordinating basis for choice for me? What is it that I am making choices
towards and why? And so I needed to have a sense of the purpose of my life to
have a sense of the purpose of any decision to have a sense of a basis to
choose. And then to have a sense of the purpose of my life I felt like I needed
a sense of the purpose of life writ large to know what my life what the
embedding function that my life was within and that usually looked like
what is the purpose of human life within the whole then even larger what about
life this thing we call biologic life and then even deeper what is the purpose
of reality at all of something rather than nothing. And then of course we
realize that even the question purpose imports a whole bunch of concepts that
may or may not be the right ones. It purposes an inherently utilitarian
concept and so do I want to be asking what the purpose is or do I want to be
asking what the inherent value of life is what what I or what I value do I
want to ask what the meaningfulness and the basis for meaningfulness is do I
want to ask what the nature of it is. So these are all non-synonyms and all
deep in terms of value meaning purpose and all all deep questions and important
ones. We can also get in a trap when we start to think about purpose in terms of
doing exclusively and so very commonly people think what is the purpose of my
life and they think that there is an answer in words that relates to something
that they're going to do. So I'm gonna end extreme poverty or prevent AI
catastrophe or whatever it is and of course if that one doing is their
purpose then every opportunity to relieve suffering or add beauty other
than that isn't part of their purpose and that means the presence being
present with and loving with their family members isn't their purpose being
present with the opportunities that present themselves that they could
contribute to the piece of trash they walk by on the street and so we start
to realize that one of the other challenges is as soon as I define it
then the outsiders of that everything that is meaningful outside of that has
been excluded from my sense of purpose right so then we start to say well
there what is the purpose of my life not just at a doing level but at a being
level that all of the doing relates to and obviously my best understanding of
this now might also be quite different than my best understanding of it in the
future. So is there is there an evolutionary process for how I think
about this? So with all that as preface I'm obviously not going to address the
question comprehensively on this short conversation so I'll speak to a few
things that are probably underneath the question. I'll say a little bit more
about and I'm gonna hold them as synonyms for now because the
distinctions take more work philosophically and most people hold the
synonyms so the purpose or the meaningfulness of life from a being and a
doing and a becoming perspective I'll just say a little bit about this and how
they fit together. We can say that living a good life living a meaningful
purposeful life has different elements to it and so I'm gonna offer a little
model here where there are at least that well there are not at least there are
three elements to living a meaningful life that are distinct but all
necessary. So we can talk about the being mode in which one way of defining it
is the purpose of life there is to appreciate the beauty of existence as
deeply as I can to take it in to be moved by it to experience it at that
that the purposefulness and the value of a piece of art requires it being
appreciated there's the relationship between subject and object that is
neither subject nor object but but that triplicate the relationship where the
meaningfulness comes and so when I am taking in the beauty of reality reality
is becoming more meaningful and the deeper that I'm taking it in right so we
can think about purpose from the being point of view as being about endeavoring
to be more present to reality as it is all the time and when we start to think
about doing we can say that doing is about adding to the beauty of reality
acting in ways that change reality with the hope with the intent to add to the
beauty of it in ways that will increase the potential for the experience of
beauty for others right that will affect the being of others when I think about
becoming I think about evolving my capacity for being and doing increasing
my capacity to both appreciate and add to the beauty of life and so I get that
being doing and becoming are all meaningful and they're all meaningful
only in relationship to each other the doing adding to the beauty of life
that's all anyone did and no one actually appreciated it would ultimately be
baseless etc right so we can see how those are how those are bound concepts we
can think about the being as related to our relationship to reality on the
perceptual side and doing on the expressive side we can see the whole
thing as our relationship to life with a capital L or reality with a capital R and
so then you know I just speak about it again in a broad way I can say my purpose
is going to be expressed each moment in terms of how much presence and love and
integrity I can show up to life and whatever aspect of life happens to be
in front of me each moment and across the arc of my life and so if I have an
idea about what I should be doing that actually makes me less present with
what's in front of me and less available to appreciate and serve what's in front
of me that can be a problem now not just the moments of life but also the arc of
life I want to see how full is my relationship with reality moment by
moment and also across the whole arc of my life how relevant was it to what was
needed for the whole of life during that time so these are all interesting and I
think generally applicable considerations for everyone if we want to
talk about the doing side for me as a specific person well it's different in
this particular time in the world than it would have been in the past or in the
future because different things are needed and I have different capabilities
than I would have had in those developmental environments etc and
obviously it's different here than if I was growing up in the Peruvian rainforest
and so what mine is is not going to be what anyone else's is in that way right
so it's there are generalized things which we spoke about and then there's
also the unique expression of those generalized things so having the
orientation to think about systems and complex systems that my life brought
that orientation to me and and various other capacities orientations doing what
I can to help transition civilization from being on a path that is currently
self-terminating to a path that is not self-terminating and that is as
supportive of the possibility of purpose and meaning for everyone
enduringly into the future and working on changing the underlying structural
dynamics that help make that possible is what we could say my main sense of
purpose at a doing level is so if you think about your your doing level
do you have goals for the year 2050 of what you want to change in the world by
then so 2050 is just over 30 years from now what I would like to see different in
the world by then is first I think it warrants saying that there are
existential risks risks of us continuing to exist or not that could play out in
less time than that so it is not a given currently that we make it to 2050 this
is an important part of framing that question there are other existential
risks and catastrophic not necessarily fully existential but civilization
collapse type risks that even there are some that could actually play out in
that time there are other ones that might not play out in that time but we
pass critical tipping points where they will inevitably play out after that time
during that time so one thing by 2050 is I want us to not have experienced
civilization collapse or existential risk and I also want us to not have passed
tipping points that are irreversible towards catastrophic or existential risk
and to speak even more broadly than I would say I want by 2050 that we that
there is a change in the vector a change in the overall trajectory of the path
that civilization is on from one that is heading towards many different self
termination scenarios whether we're talking about the 100 different
versions of AI apocalypse or we're talking about World War three or we're
talking about climate change induced human migration issues that lead to
resource wars or we're talking about collapse of biodiversity peak nitrogen
peak phosphorus dead zones in the ocean etc or killer drones or the gazillion
different scenarios we have we have a civilization that is generating all
those scenarios at increasing speed and magnitude switching off of that path onto
a path that is developing all of its technological capacity for omnipositive
purposes is what I want to see in the world writ large now if I want to speak
to some pretty specific things that people could see by 2050 I would want to
see a I do want to see a prototype of a new model of civilization a full stack
new civilization model that has in its design categorically solved the generator
function of all of the catastrophic and existential risks and is a civilization
model that is not only not moving in the direction of self termination but is one
that moves in the direction of increasing quality of life and is actually more
adaptive than the current civilization so it becomes a new gravitational basin
for everything to flow and so specifically this requires new economics new
governance new law new jurisprudence and philosophy as a basis of law new
judicial new medicine new you know all those systems new infrastructure and new
technology development processes and new culture and sense of what is meaningful
purposeful etc that the system is all orienting towards and all of those
inter-effect each other so we're talking about a full-stack reboot from an axiom
level and when we think about all of the risks the existential risks currently
and we say what do they have in common that is driving all of them we see
things like well if we have a rival risk game meaning win lose games in group out
group team dynamics that are competing in in where they cannot both win then harm
definitely happens from that right my win requires your law so I'm seeking
army directly and we're both trying to extract more resource from the
environment or externalize them for harm to the environment or indirectly doing
that to the harm that happens through war or whatever so we're harming each
other and harming the commons with exponential technology which means
exponentially increased capacity to affect the world through our choices then
to the degree we're making choices that are directly and or indirectly harm
causing exponential harm-causing choices self-terminate on a finite playing
field and so for the for thousands of years of the thing we've called
civilization we have killed people who had different ideas than us as a
reasonable way to deal with problems and we have had unsustainable agriculture
that desertified areas that were previously non-desertive I mean that's
not a new phenomenon desertification is a thousands of years old phenomenon
we've extincted species for a long time so we're not talking about the existential
risks that humanity faces now are not different in kind they're different in
magnitude and speed so solving those so we say okay so exponential tech which is
the fact that we have tech that makes it easier to make better tech computers
that help us make better computers right exponential tech can't be put back in
the bag that's going to keep happening but exponential tech multiplied by
rival risk game theory self-terminates therefore we have to create anti rival
risk environments that make us safe stewards of the level of power that
exponential technology brings or the human experiment completes in a in a
mythopoetic sense we can say as exponential technology is bringing us
to have the power of gods we have to have the love and wisdom and prudence of
gods to guide the use of that power or irresponsible use of that power will
end up self-destructing and so what does you know what does that look like so when
we talk about solving the generator function there to anti rival risk games
that doesn't just be creating an anti rival risk environment obviously requires
changing macroeconomics because my balance sheet is the scorecard of a
finite rival risk game it requires not having in group out groups like nations
those things become obsolete or religions or race identifications in any deep
kind of sense right or these are deep changes it requires not having things
like democracy where we make a proposition that is ill-formed or if the
proposition goes through it benefits something and harm something else and
if it doesn't go through then something else is protected and something else is
harmed as opposed to had it went through which will always lead to groups of
people based on which of the needs that they have more cluster around one side
versus the other which now creates polarization and eventually radicalization
which then eventually has to be stabilized in war but wars that we can't
keep having with exponential increasing military tech that become actually
unwinnable so solve creating an anti rival risk environment is a non-trivial
thing it's this kind of thing humanity's never done but we have to do
something we've never done because every civilization that we've ever had so far
has all collapsed and but now we have a fully global civilization where the
collapse is actually catastrophic and so when Rome fell it was a lot but it
wasn't the whole world right when the Mayans fell the Inca fell Mesopotamia
Sumeria any of those they wasn't everything now we have a fully globalized
supply chain economy that is also connected to the biosphere in such deep
ways that collapse is really a catastrophic collapse so given that the
systems always failed for these reasons we have to do something that the world
has never done before we also though have increased capacities that the world
has never had and we have to realize them to guide the other capacities that
are coming on board so the reason I'm saying all this is because creating an
anti-rival risk environment doesn't only prevent x-risk it also changes the
underlying basis of what has sucked about humans for the whole history of
humans the those rivalrous bases are why we have fought wars and tortured and
hurt the environment and etc and we've made whole philosophies around the
nature of duality and the mixed bat bag that humans are that are really just
based on the game theoretic environment we've been in we can create a different
environment that doesn't incentivize right harm because as long as as long as
I am incentivized to do something that is harmful to you it can't be prevented at
scale but we can actually change that underlying incentive and make it to
where your well-being and mine are more tightly coupled and yours mine and the
commons are more tightly coupled it's not communism or socialism or anything
that has ever been presented it's totally new shit that again is outside of
the scope of what we can talk about today but we can you know people are
interested when you talk about some time they're actually are very real paths
for how to do this but in the process of create solving the generator function so
that one that I mentioned is one there are other ones solving the generator
functions of catastrophic risk we're also solving the basis of the historical
human suck dynamics and bringing about a really radically different humanity and
so you know if we have an intentional community today that is trying to
prototype some ideals but they still to get the computer that we're talking on
have to buy it from Apple which has to get minerals that came from conflict
zones and rainforests over six continents and was made in factories where
there are nets on the windows of the workers don't commit suicide because
the conditions are so shitty and then our lovely villages still being supported
by the tragedy of the whole rest of the thing right so until we can actually get
a high-tech closed-loop civilization that does not require import that is
actually more adaptive than the previous civilization we haven't yet shown we can
do that thing that happens at the scale of a high-tech city-state city-state
meaning it has to be sovereign and law city meaning that's the minimum kind of
scale of self-organization that could actually produce all its own needs so by
2050 I want to see a fully operating city-state new civilization model that
is anti-rival risk that has the right relationship between complicated and
complex systems all the other dynamics that we need and I want to see that
having been operating long enough and well enough that the rest of the world
is already starting to move in the direction that it is setting an example
of and that means also off of the ex-risk path so if you think about the 2050 the
full-stake prototype of the city of the new civilization model maybe you can
give us like a brief overview of how are you going to make that happen like what
are you working on right now to move civilization in that direction well
what I'm working on right now with a number of other people that are
endeavoring similarly is what we started with is really inventorying all of
those risk scenarios catastrophic existential risks and then looking at
what the common generator functions that drive all of them are at a deep level
and then looking at what would a categorical solution to that generator
function be because whether I'm talking about the depletion of phosphorus or the
depletion of nitrogen or the depletion of fish or the depletion of old growth
or the depletion of topsoil those are all depletion dynamics that are driven by
certain things whether I'm talking about the excess of CO2 or the excess of
nitrogen runoff in dead zones or the excess of mercury in the air or the
excess all those toxicity dynamics those have something in common whether I'm
talking about this type of war scenario or that type of war scenario or this type
of terrorism scenario they all have certain types of things in common we
can go to deeper levels of assessment as to what the generator functions are and
then say if I try to solve one of these but all the other ones are still on
course at most I maybe move the the curve of like giving us a few more months
you know maybe a couple more years unless the one I'm doing wasn't actually the
first one that hits in which case it was kind of worthless so given that the
generator functions have so many different expressions unless we solve them at
that level we we don't really move we don't really change the future
possibilities that much so we've been looking at being able to articulate the
generator functions in ways that we can show are complete meaning that solutions
there are not only necessary for civilization making it but also
sufficient and then actually developing architectures for viable solutions to
those which means how how would an economic system a governance system a
legal system an infrastructural system etc a work that didn't do those things
right the generated fundamentally different types of behaviors so we've
been been working basically on this level of understanding the nature of the
problem well enough and then being able to characterize design criteria of a
solution and then starting to develop actual instantiations of solutions that
meet those design criteria next is starting to prototype then starting to
prototype governance methods we've developed to see that they do what we
think they will and refine them and then you know before we can build a city
state since it has an economic system that isn't any economic system that's
ever been there's nobody trained in the things that they will need to be trained
for how to administer it since it would have a governance system etc the
the politicians and lawyers and judges and bankers of this world would have
nothing to do in that world and the corresponding functions don't yet exist
the theory you know there the people aren't trained on them so there's a
whole new civics right there's a whole new set of stuff that people have to be
trained there's a whole new process to technology design for how to do
technology that doesn't cause toxicity issues as you know and externality so
that means that we have to have a lot of people working on components of it and
getting trained in those components who will then be able to help build the
city-state scale and populate it you know to begin with and that is it it's
deep enough training that a little have to happen in immersive environments
which means communities villages you know places where people are actually
together working on training in these new skills and capacities that will then
be able to boot and those will be not closed loop they'll still require
getting on a Boeing to fly somewhere and buying a computer from Apple but but
they will be developing some of the capacities necessary to build a
civilization with that won't occur so we're working on kind of as best as we
can the full articulation and description of the design criteria that
are necessary so that other people can can play with those ideas also and see
if those design criteria make sense to them if they agree with our analysis and
then also work on those things independently and then start to work on
instantiating some of those ideas and then evolving the scale of them towards
full-scale prototype and then you know spread of that prototype that prototype
has to be not only right in kind meaning that it has solved the generator
functions but it also has to be anti-fragile in the presence of the fact
that the rest of the world is still rivalrous and this is a new system and
it also has to be auto poetic meaning it has to be able to make expand and
propagate itself so those are all parts of the design criteria so those are
those are some of the things that I'm working on now towards those goals so if
our listeners want to support you in your mission and your purpose how can
people help you thank you for that I don't know since I don't know what
skills and aptitudes and passions and resources they have one thing I would say
is it all needs done right it all needs done so the if someone currently is
working on trying to solve coral reef issues or carbon sequestration issues or
AI risk issues whatever and they have a path to make meaningful progress there
keep doing that our chance of doing what we're doing depends on assuming that
lots of people are trying to do lots of important things right so knowing that
we're working on the same project at a meta level the re trajectory of
civilization to a better trajectory that's one thing I would say while those
big projects are happening the children still need raised and old people need
taken care of and food needs grown and all those things and if you're doing
those things do them also with full presence integrity love realizing that
they're critical and if those are the things for you to be doing as far as the
specific projects we're working on go to my blog and read the stuff and see if it
can you know it's compelling I've only written the tiniest little bit of
stuff on there have a few podcasts because most we've been focused on kind
of the research and thinking about it more than sharing it just for a share
time reason but getting more educated is a valuable part of it you can do a lot
more that is relevant if you understand the nature of the problem space and
solution space better and so in addition to my blog there's a number of good
resources some of which I have linked on my blog to to study and you know already
right now and over the next period we there's a lot of research we need to do
there's stuff that we need to write this piece of media to develop there are so
people who have those skills people who have funds that could support people who
have those skills all of that is relevant so if if you feel called send me a
message great Daniel thank you so much that was yeah really really fascinating
like high macro overview of the world from your perspective and I really
appreciate appreciate you joining the 2050 podcast I appreciate being on and I
appreciate the questions that you are asking people and the way that you are
supporting people to think and inquire hi beautiful people I hope you enjoyed
this conversation with Daniel to learn more about his work and the newer hacker
collective check out the show notes and the blog article with all the relevant
links if you want more interesting interviews like this you can help me by
a leaving a review for this podcast on iTunes and b letting me know if you know
