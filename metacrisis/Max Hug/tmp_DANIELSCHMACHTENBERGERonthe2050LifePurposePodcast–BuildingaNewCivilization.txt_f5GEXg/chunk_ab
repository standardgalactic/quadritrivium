which then eventually has to be stabilized in war but wars that we can't
keep having with exponential increasing military tech that become actually
unwinnable so solve creating an anti rival risk environment is a non-trivial
thing it's this kind of thing humanity's never done but we have to do
something we've never done because every civilization that we've ever had so far
has all collapsed and but now we have a fully global civilization where the
collapse is actually catastrophic and so when Rome fell it was a lot but it
wasn't the whole world right when the Mayans fell the Inca fell Mesopotamia
Sumeria any of those they wasn't everything now we have a fully globalized
supply chain economy that is also connected to the biosphere in such deep
ways that collapse is really a catastrophic collapse so given that the
systems always failed for these reasons we have to do something that the world
has never done before we also though have increased capacities that the world
has never had and we have to realize them to guide the other capacities that
are coming on board so the reason I'm saying all this is because creating an
anti-rival risk environment doesn't only prevent x-risk it also changes the
underlying basis of what has sucked about humans for the whole history of
humans the those rivalrous bases are why we have fought wars and tortured and
hurt the environment and etc and we've made whole philosophies around the
nature of duality and the mixed bat bag that humans are that are really just
based on the game theoretic environment we've been in we can create a different
environment that doesn't incentivize right harm because as long as as long as
I am incentivized to do something that is harmful to you it can't be prevented at
scale but we can actually change that underlying incentive and make it to
where your well-being and mine are more tightly coupled and yours mine and the
commons are more tightly coupled it's not communism or socialism or anything
that has ever been presented it's totally new shit that again is outside of
the scope of what we can talk about today but we can you know people are
interested when you talk about some time they're actually are very real paths
for how to do this but in the process of create solving the generator function so
that one that I mentioned is one there are other ones solving the generator
functions of catastrophic risk we're also solving the basis of the historical
human suck dynamics and bringing about a really radically different humanity and
so you know if we have an intentional community today that is trying to
prototype some ideals but they still to get the computer that we're talking on
have to buy it from Apple which has to get minerals that came from conflict
zones and rainforests over six continents and was made in factories where
there are nets on the windows of the workers don't commit suicide because
the conditions are so shitty and then our lovely villages still being supported
by the tragedy of the whole rest of the thing right so until we can actually get
a high-tech closed-loop civilization that does not require import that is
actually more adaptive than the previous civilization we haven't yet shown we can
do that thing that happens at the scale of a high-tech city-state city-state
meaning it has to be sovereign and law city meaning that's the minimum kind of
scale of self-organization that could actually produce all its own needs so by
2050 I want to see a fully operating city-state new civilization model that
is anti-rival risk that has the right relationship between complicated and
complex systems all the other dynamics that we need and I want to see that
having been operating long enough and well enough that the rest of the world
is already starting to move in the direction that it is setting an example
of and that means also off of the ex-risk path so if you think about the 2050 the
full-stake prototype of the city of the new civilization model maybe you can
give us like a brief overview of how are you going to make that happen like what
are you working on right now to move civilization in that direction well
what I'm working on right now with a number of other people that are
endeavoring similarly is what we started with is really inventorying all of
those risk scenarios catastrophic existential risks and then looking at
what the common generator functions that drive all of them are at a deep level
and then looking at what would a categorical solution to that generator
function be because whether I'm talking about the depletion of phosphorus or the
depletion of nitrogen or the depletion of fish or the depletion of old growth
or the depletion of topsoil those are all depletion dynamics that are driven by
certain things whether I'm talking about the excess of CO2 or the excess of
nitrogen runoff in dead zones or the excess of mercury in the air or the
excess all those toxicity dynamics those have something in common whether I'm
talking about this type of war scenario or that type of war scenario or this type
of terrorism scenario they all have certain types of things in common we
can go to deeper levels of assessment as to what the generator functions are and
then say if I try to solve one of these but all the other ones are still on
course at most I maybe move the the curve of like giving us a few more months
you know maybe a couple more years unless the one I'm doing wasn't actually the
first one that hits in which case it was kind of worthless so given that the
generator functions have so many different expressions unless we solve them at
that level we we don't really move we don't really change the future
possibilities that much so we've been looking at being able to articulate the
generator functions in ways that we can show are complete meaning that solutions
there are not only necessary for civilization making it but also
sufficient and then actually developing architectures for viable solutions to
those which means how how would an economic system a governance system a
legal system an infrastructural system etc a work that didn't do those things
right the generated fundamentally different types of behaviors so we've
been been working basically on this level of understanding the nature of the
problem well enough and then being able to characterize design criteria of a
solution and then starting to develop actual instantiations of solutions that
meet those design criteria next is starting to prototype then starting to
prototype governance methods we've developed to see that they do what we
think they will and refine them and then you know before we can build a city
state since it has an economic system that isn't any economic system that's
ever been there's nobody trained in the things that they will need to be trained
for how to administer it since it would have a governance system etc the
the politicians and lawyers and judges and bankers of this world would have
nothing to do in that world and the corresponding functions don't yet exist
the theory you know there the people aren't trained on them so there's a
whole new civics right there's a whole new set of stuff that people have to be
trained there's a whole new process to technology design for how to do
technology that doesn't cause toxicity issues as you know and externality so
that means that we have to have a lot of people working on components of it and
getting trained in those components who will then be able to help build the
city-state scale and populate it you know to begin with and that is it it's
deep enough training that a little have to happen in immersive environments
which means communities villages you know places where people are actually
together working on training in these new skills and capacities that will then
be able to boot and those will be not closed loop they'll still require
getting on a Boeing to fly somewhere and buying a computer from Apple but but
they will be developing some of the capacities necessary to build a
civilization with that won't occur so we're working on kind of as best as we
can the full articulation and description of the design criteria that
are necessary so that other people can can play with those ideas also and see
if those design criteria make sense to them if they agree with our analysis and
then also work on those things independently and then start to work on
instantiating some of those ideas and then evolving the scale of them towards
full-scale prototype and then you know spread of that prototype that prototype
has to be not only right in kind meaning that it has solved the generator
functions but it also has to be anti-fragile in the presence of the fact
that the rest of the world is still rivalrous and this is a new system and
it also has to be auto poetic meaning it has to be able to make expand and
propagate itself so those are all parts of the design criteria so those are
those are some of the things that I'm working on now towards those goals so if
our listeners want to support you in your mission and your purpose how can
people help you thank you for that I don't know since I don't know what
skills and aptitudes and passions and resources they have one thing I would say
is it all needs done right it all needs done so the if someone currently is
working on trying to solve coral reef issues or carbon sequestration issues or
AI risk issues whatever and they have a path to make meaningful progress there
keep doing that our chance of doing what we're doing depends on assuming that
lots of people are trying to do lots of important things right so knowing that
we're working on the same project at a meta level the re trajectory of
civilization to a better trajectory that's one thing I would say while those
big projects are happening the children still need raised and old people need
taken care of and food needs grown and all those things and if you're doing
those things do them also with full presence integrity love realizing that
they're critical and if those are the things for you to be doing as far as the
specific projects we're working on go to my blog and read the stuff and see if it
can you know it's compelling I've only written the tiniest little bit of
stuff on there have a few podcasts because most we've been focused on kind
of the research and thinking about it more than sharing it just for a share
time reason but getting more educated is a valuable part of it you can do a lot
more that is relevant if you understand the nature of the problem space and
solution space better and so in addition to my blog there's a number of good
resources some of which I have linked on my blog to to study and you know already
right now and over the next period we there's a lot of research we need to do
there's stuff that we need to write this piece of media to develop there are so
people who have those skills people who have funds that could support people who
have those skills all of that is relevant so if if you feel called send me a
message great Daniel thank you so much that was yeah really really fascinating
like high macro overview of the world from your perspective and I really
appreciate appreciate you joining the 2050 podcast I appreciate being on and I
appreciate the questions that you are asking people and the way that you are
supporting people to think and inquire hi beautiful people I hope you enjoyed
this conversation with Daniel to learn more about his work and the newer hacker
collective check out the show notes and the blog article with all the relevant
links if you want more interesting interviews like this you can help me by
a leaving a review for this podcast on iTunes and b letting me know if you know
any interesting potential guests for the 2050 podcast just go to the contact
