Hello, and welcome. It's September 20, 2020-23. We're at the Active Inference Institute in
the course, Active Inference for the Social Sciences, and here with Mal Abrasen, who will
be presenting today on normed scripts and linguistics under Active Inference. So, thank
you, Mal, to you. Awesome. So, hi, everyone. As last time, there was a presentation on
semiotics and semantics. I won't dig too far into linguistics, but I'll touch on it at the end of
the course. So, what are we going to do? In this module, we're going to explore the concept of
Active Inference and its relevance to social norms and human decision-making. As you will
have seen in the previous classes, Active Inference is a theoretical framework that seeks to explain
how organisms, including humans, engage with their environment to minimize uncertainty and
maintain their internal states. We're not going to dig into these concepts too, too much because I
assume they have been previously explained at length. However, I will explain how they connect
to social phenomena. So, this framework has significant implications for understanding
social behavior as it can help explain how individuals conform to social norms and make
decisions based on the expectations of others. We'll delve into the role of Active Inference
in human societies, emphasizing how humans and other organisms constantly seek to minimize
their uncertainty about the world by updating their beliefs and taking actions to maintain
a stable internal state. This is a crucial process for survival. It allows individuals to predict and
adapt to their environment in the context of human societies. Active Inference plays a critical
role in explaining how individuals navigate, complex social situations, conform to social
expectations, and make decisions that align with their beliefs and values. Furthermore,
we'll explore the concept of the ontic value within Active Inference,
which refers to the value attributed to actions based on their adherence to social norms and
expectations. By adhering to social norms, individuals can minimize the uncertainty
associated with their actions and maintain a sense of predictability and stability in their
social environment. So, together, all these insights will provide you with a comprehensive
understanding of the complex interplay between Active Inference, social norms, and human decision
making. Let's dive in. We'll start by introducing a philosophical framework. Building on the
framework of Active Inference in activism offers us a complementary lens to understand the dynamic
and contextual nature of social cognition. While Active Inference provides the computational
underpinnings for understanding social norms and decision making, we still need to anchor
ourselves within a larger theoretical framework. Inactivism enriches this perspective by emphasizing
the practical and developmental aspects of social understanding. So, what is inactivism?
If it hasn't been introduced before, inactivism is a philosophical stance that extends beyond
traditional theories of cognition, emphasizing the role of interactions and relational dynamics
in shaping both individual and social cognition.
It argues that cognition is a dynamic, real-time, fluid, and contextual social action.
You can read more about this in Ines Cipollito's texts and Thomas Van As in 2022.
Generative models in hermeneutics serve as a cognitive structure and framework for interpretation
respectively. These elements are continuously updated based on social interactions and signals,
thereby facilitating effective communication and understanding. Permanutics provides a
theoretical framework for interpreting social signals and cues crucial for effective social
interactions. So, Permanutics allows for a nuanced understanding of contextually constituted
meaning. It goes beyond the conventional notion of self-contained objects to explore the deeper
contextual meanings in behavior and cognition. Gadamer's Permanutics offers a way to analyze
social action that goes beyond positivist and humanist approaches by fusing the conceptual
schemes of the observer and the social actor. It complements inactivism by providing the
interpretive framework that are continuously updated through social interactions, enriching our
understanding of cognition as dynamic, real-time, and contextual. In the realm of social cognition,
inactivism introduces the concept of generalized synchronization, which allows for a nuanced
understanding of how social interactions mutually influence cognitive processes.
The relationship between individual beliefs and social expectations is complex,
is fundamentally shaped by our interactions with the others and the world.
We thus see that meaning is co-constituted by the individual and the environment. If we
adopt an inactivist and Permanutics approach, we find the philosophical foundations that
lead into a comprehensive overview of the intersection with social cognition. If you
want more references to read about these topics, you can ask me at the end of the class and I
can send you a few. So it's essential to note, however, that there are some criticisms
that point out the limitations of inactivism in explaining social cognition.
One of the key criticisms is that current articulations of inactivism are not yet
up to the task when it comes to explaining complex social interactions.
Despite these criticisms, inactivism provides a consistent epistemology for a psychology that
is intrinsically social. Looking forward, the field of inactivism in social cognition is
right for exploration and would benefit from a deeper connection to active influence. There has
been such research, so researchers like Maxwell Remsted has developed a concept of inactive
inference which offers a promising avenue for integrating inactivism and active inference.
His research aligns with folk psychology and suggests that these frameworks can coexist and
enrich our understandings of social cognition. Future other directions can involve, for instance,
integrating inactivism with other cognitive theories and exploring its applicability in
real-world social scenarios. Through its connection to active inference, we can make
accurate and testable predictions. While inactivism now provides us with a foundation
of understanding of cognition and social interaction, the concept of agency
further enriches this understanding by introducing more philosophical perspectives
that align with or diverge from inactivism. We can build on top of inactivism through the notion of
agency. So we will now focus on the key issue of inactivism, which is how does agency emerge?
How do things self-organize through their interaction with the environment? Why are they
not fully determined? How can we account for agency in a system where effectively self-organization
is seen as some degree of determined by the materiality of the agent and its environment?
Agency is a complex construct that has been explored through a multitude of philosophical
and scientific frameworks. One prominent approach is the inactive affordance-based
perspective, which underscores the centrality of the eye-can notion in shaping both cognitive
processes and behavioral outcomes. So Maxwell Rammstein again substantiates this perspective
and resonates with the research conducted by Bruenberg in 2018. It posits, for instance,
that agency is far from being a mere passive state, rather it involves active, dynamic engagement
with the environment. Current investigations in this domain are being, for instance, continued
by researchers like Rudy Pitlia, who is working on connecting properly the psychological phenomenon
of agency in active inference modeling. In parallel, Tom Holtzian-Basian models conceptualize
active inference as a Bayesian process in-depth minimizing prediction error. This model finds
support in the work of Kallen Kopp and suggests that agency is an active endeavor who aligns
sensory inputs with internal predictions, thereby fostering a sense of control and self-efficacy.
The cybernetic interpretations offers a more mechanistic lens focusing on control mechanism
in homeostasis. In this view, agency is not just about accurate predictions, but also
about maintaining a balanced state through dynamic interpretations, interaction with the
environment. Recent studies highlight the significance of performance-based inferences
in shaping our sense of agency. That approach suggests that the congruence between our actions
and their expected outcomes plays a pivotal role in strengthening or weakening our sense of agency.
So collectively, these diverse interpretations serve as intellectual bridges, connecting the
domains of philosophy, psychology, and computational neuroscience. They offer complementary insights
that enrich our understanding of agency, thereby contributing to the broader discourse on inactivism
and its application in understanding complex cognitive and social phenomena.
So how is agency extended? Deep temporal models and the concept of agency both focus on the
minimization of uncertainty and the optimization of decision-making. Deep temporal models provide a
computational framework that can model the complex, time-dependent patterns of behavior and cognition,
offering insights into how agency is exercised in dynamic social contexts.
In the context of our overall goal of understanding scripts through active inference,
combining deep temporal models with theories of agency allows us to create more nuanced and
predictive models of how individuals navigate social norms and make decisions through goal-directed
actions across different scales of concern. In social cognition, deep temporal models help
individuals anticipate and adapt to changes in their social environment across time scales
that go beyond what would be considered simply reactive, thereby reducing uncertainty and enhancing
decision-making. An individual can plan an extend agency beyond the current moment.
So in the realm of planning algorithms, deep temporal models allow us for a theoretical
foundation for optimality, especially when resources are limited. They enable state
abstraction and cognitive control, essential elements in hierarchical planning.
Deep temporal models also contribute to various cognitive processes such as
action understanding and language processing, which we will discuss later.
They can be interpreted and integrated into deep reinforcement learning algorithms
to develop socially aware navigation policies. Deep temporal models thus serve as a computational,
again, bridge between the neural mechanisms of action, understanding, and the cognitive
processes that give rise to agency. So what might be potentially a neural mechanism that allows us
to connect deep temporal models to social interactions? This is where we bring in the
insights from mirror neural systems and active inference. This way we can have a more comprehensive
models that don't only predict but explains how individuals exercise agency and complex social
landscapes. Here, mirror neurons serve as a neural cornerstone for social cognition,
firing not only during the execution of an action, but also during the observation of
that same action performed by another. These specialized neurons are central to the continuous
updating of internal models of the environment, including the actions and intentions of others.
They minimize uncertainty and facilitate navigation through complex social landscapes,
allowing us for smoother social interactions and more effective communication.
So here, the deep temporal models are hierarchical generative models that offer
computational framework, and these models are adept at handling the complexities of
self-agency and other agency. In the context of self-agency, a deep temporal models
affords a high bias or precision to proprioceptive predictions, which gives us a nuanced understanding
of one's own actions. When observing another, this bias is adaptively suppressed, enabling
the system to be flexible and context sensitive. The interplay between mirror neurons and
deep temporal model is thus a compelling area of research. Mirror neurons contribute to the process
of updating internal models, which is a core function of deep temporal models.
This synergistic relationship allows for a more nuanced understanding of action prediction.
We can see a deep and significant implication for long-term planning in social context.
The continuous updating of internal models, facilitated by mirror neurons and computationally
powered here through the deep temporal models, is crucial for making complex decisions and
planning future social interactions. There's been research that indicates that our capacity
to understand actions extend beyond the mirror neuron systems, which involves the activation
of areas signaling unexpected events. This adds another layer of complexity to the already intricate
interplay between the neurons and the models, which suggests that our understanding of action
prediction and social cognition is far from complete, but is advancing rapidly thanks to
these integrated frameworks. Given the ongoing research on mirror neurons, we have to consider
how computational models like deep temporal models can offer a more nuanced framework for
studying these neural mechanisms. Let's try to think about some of the issues with mirror neuron
research. It's not without controversy. Some critical reviews argue that there's no compelling
evidence supporting the role of mirror neurons in action understanding. Others can suggest that
mirror neurons may be involved in lower-level processes of action perception, but not in
higher-level attention understanding. So we need more studies to control for premotor
contributions to action perception and provide a clearer definition of what is meant by action
understanding. This is particularly important as some research indicates that there may be no proof
that mirror neurons lead to action understanding. This doesn't mean that it negates the importance
of these systems. It means we need more research to make sure that they are in fact related to
action understanding. The functional properties of the mirror neuron system indicates that
action understanding may primarily be based on the motor cognition that underpins one's own
capacity to act. So we will now consider how these neural mechanisms can be integrated
into broader frameworks like extended and optimized active inference. So by doing so,
we can leverage generative models to provide a more nuanced understanding of action perception,
prediction, social cognition, and adapting behaviors to lead us to scripts, gender perspectives,
and cultural affordances. We have expanded in time. Now let's expand in space.
Extended and optimized active inference represents a comprehensive framework that
bridges between internal cognitive processes and external environmental interactions.
Generative models serve as the cornerstone, extending beyond the confines of an organism's
brain and body to incorporate external cognitive resources such as maps or written language.
This extension not only enhances the efficiency and accuracy of these models,
but also has practical implications in various domains like social interactions and language
processing. If we think of a cognitive niche, the framework introduces key dynamics like selective,
developmental, and organism niche coordination. The dynamics elucidate the intricate relationship
between organisms and their environment, including the reciprocal effects of environmental
modifications and selection pressures. In sequential dynamics, generative models
facilitate effective communication and understanding. They allow us to see the emergence of behavioral
and neurophysiological correlates such as Theta Gamma coupling, which we will discuss later,
in neural activity, which can be seen as an emergent property of belief updating under
variational message passing. Building upon the foundational aspects of extending and optimized
active inference, it's crucial to delve into its specific applications and social context.
When we optimize our generative models through social scripts and norms, we can see how
extending active inference serves as a practical tool for navigating and modifying complex social
landscapes, aligning with the framework's broader goals of cognitive niche construction.
So we can see that this integrates both internal and external cognitive resources
to optimize the generative model. Scripts serve as a cognitive blueprint
that reduce the uncertainty and facilitate successful social interactions. They are
continuously updated through adaptive changing social landscapes. They enhance the fluidity
and adaptability of social behaviors. Social norms act as a macro level behavioral expectation
that shapes the social environment and creates favorable niches for human interactions.
These norms are internal representations that help individuals navigate complex
social environments effectively. So here, cognitive niche construction involves active
modification of the environment to create those favorable contexts.
Extended active inference takes this a step further by allowing for the optimization of
generative models, creating environments that are not just favorable, but also harmonious.
The comprehensive approach here has implications that span from psychology, sociology,
artificial intelligence, and allows us to potentially set the stage for future research in cognitive science.
So here, we see that there's an importance to optimizing internal models for effect to effective
social interactions. So while extended active inference focuses on the broader cognitive
architecture involving generative models and social norms, here we zero in on the role of
deontic value and social conformity, providing a more nuanced understanding of how individuals
adapt and shape their social environment. So we can see that there's an importance to
the concept of deontic value refers to the value attributed to actions based
