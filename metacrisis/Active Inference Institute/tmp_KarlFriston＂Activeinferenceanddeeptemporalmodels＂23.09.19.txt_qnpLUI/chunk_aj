how in term of
how can we describe
the theory
the hundredth of the oral
why is
all come together
and why the world has
the belief that the prey should be
catched
it's the first question
and another one is related
and maybe it's how
I'm trying to resolve this problem
is the question is how
is active inference related to initial selection
and
because testing hypothesis is risky
it's time and energy
we're consuming
I mean that you are resolving uncertainty
you invest something
in terms of energy
and time
and so on
and what do you think about
how natural selection shapes these
prior beliefs to make them
more efficient in terms of survival
more complete
in terms of
complete
so to answer your questions
we have probably three questions there
so I think we're
going to start with the first question
so the first question
how do I account for
context for survival
what determines the best
sort of behavior
when I'm very hungry
as opposed to when I'm just eating
so in this scene
that all of the answers
usually result in
reduced to the form
of the challenging model
so that will be a nice example
of having a high mark for chapter 2 model
where
your prior preferences
will now become
conditioned upon different states
of behavior
so if I were to
now we're interested
that we are entering
the interesting world
of active inference
applied to the homistasis
bound spaces and intersection
let's say I have evolved
creating the next question
to have a genetic model
under the regimen
that was able to recognize
certain states of hunger
so that these
were good explanations
of particular gut feelings
of particular
particular
inputs from say
receptors measuring
blood sugar
and also my beliefs
about when I must
have something to eat
then if I had those
representations I would be able to do two things
first of all
I would be able to contextualize
my prior preferences
about what I think I would be doing in half an hour
which could be
being in a restaurant
or it could be continuing to work
or continuing to socialize
so you can contextualize
any behavior simply by
conditioning a parameter
of your genetic model
at one level
on both slowly context
dependent states at the high level
if you have a sufficiently
deep genetic model
and that leads to all sorts of interesting
issues you know the distinction between
homistasis and other spaces
so
I would imagine that a virus
unlike the alpha
doesn't worry about
whether it's hungry or not
in or just on let's say an
E.coli
doesn't worry about whether it's hungry
or not it just
assumes chemotaptic reagents
and
who can I
find a man
it's radically skeptical in this one
let's assume
let's use my
thermostat
that doesn't care whether it's hot or warm
so it just
immediately minimizes
it chooses
policies of a very trivial sort
which is just the very next thing to do
based upon fixed
fries and no change to the homistatic
set point
that's very different from having another level above
which recognizes a different
state
though would then actually change
the set point
from a homistatic reflex
to other spaces where we now start
to anticipate the causes
of our behavior for our
spaces
so I will go and eat something
before I need to have a clinical
monotonic reflex
so I think it's a great question
because what it speaks to
is a fact that we're not dealing
with simple general molecules
or the sort of temperature
for a thermostat or a virus
we're dealing with very different structure
that I repeat diachronic
in the sense of separation of temporal time
scales which are
the kinds of models which would be
necessary for you or me
possibly even a bacteria
but then the question is
where do those come from
because then I can answer that
by answering your third question
the model is just the prize
so the prize could be
of a form
of structural sort
how many levels does my model have
how many hidden states
so if you were doing machine
learning and deep learning
so using a very short encoder
you have a prize at least
and you say yes there are 12 hidden layers
hidden layer 6
has 217 hidden units
all of these are
formifiers and we believe
are fitting the purpose
and appropriate to the kind of
thing you want to classify
and then of course you actually have
the parametric prize
the actual prior expectations
distributions anything that you would normally
especially put in privately
so by model I mean prize
and obviously
there is an idea of an attribution of my tree
because the likelihood
just sits at the bottom
of these models
so if we get that
this graphic here
all of these are promise
the only time a lighter
becomes evident is right
in the pattern here
so all the interesting structure in terms of
depth and conditioning
and contextualization is a prize
structure and the actual
cost of a parametric prize
you apply to all of these variables
so that means you
me too or you
to your second question where do they come from
