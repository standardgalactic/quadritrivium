essentially puts from your environment
at your time space
and once you acknowledge that
then there are lots of
global minima or a global answer
that correspond all sorts of different
ways of being both in terms of
species but also in terms of
species then you can see
now an easy tax on
in terms of high local death
and sophistication and particularly
temporal death
that I think comfortably separates
us from other animals
from other animals from plants
from plants in certain organisms
Thank you
Mr. President
thank you very much for the lecture game
as I said in the very beginning
I would like to
make a little bit away from
scientific point of view towards
theoretical future prediction
whenever you think it is possible
for us to
fit current state of
psychological outlooks
towards personal belief
motivations and beliefs
into this key that you are describing
like saying that those
beliefs that are
wrongly believed to the person
and they could also
be in the states of the person
which is not recognising you know
and if so
is there a possibility of point of view
to create like a human impact
software
which will be possible to
predict
behaviour of each kind
of certain person in certain conditions
by that human kind
of enormous power I was having
to manipulate those people
Thank you
Right
So I think
a fascinating question
I just want to give more aspect to
the difference
Perhaps I will just take a practical
form
and take your question
as a psychiatrist
because then it becomes very important
in terms of understanding
made beliefs and false beliefs
and the remediation
of that false difference
that may or may not be
a good thing or a bad thing
but certainly being able to do it
and understand what you are doing
is practically very relevant
in a therapeutic confidence
in the quality of the quality of our treatment
by Christ
So the idea here is that
this psychiatric symptoms
can be thought of
as a form
of false
or aberrant influence
So a remediation
will be basically believing
in this theory
that something is there
when there is an essential evidence for it
that illusion
is having a conviction
in some state of affairs
usually in personal
for which there is no evidence
that a law person
would accept as an evidence for remediation
You could even take the stupid things
like anorexia
and dysmorphophobia
holding beliefs about myself
which have no evidence
when I look at myself
in the mirror for example
I see myself as fat
and furred
but I am fat even when
you might see me as being very thin
So you can certainly get an enormous
variety of
posterior beliefs
I would say they are quite accountable
because you bring them to
a certain number of fears
like death, hunger, whatever
that's why I am asking
so those of us who are not
accountable to me there
can be brought to
a final number of
accountable factors
Yes
I agree with you
there will be mathematical reasons
based on competitive evidence
that makes that true
I guess what I really meant was
the number of ways in which you can
I can deviate from you
are large but the number of dimensions
may be quite associated
So if that's the case
if there is an opportunity
and evidence for
a better belief updating
then
people have been focusing on
how that could happen
It seems that the most important
synaptic mechanism
that enables that
sort of false inference
is in the
precision afforded to various
sources of sensory evidence relative
to prior beliefs
So if you are a psychologist
there is an attention
So now the game becomes shifting
from how we form our beliefs
or our data beliefs
to how we attempt to
different things
and we were talking just before
about this being the same
mathematical problem as
they obviously think
that there is an effect
to any millennial society
and when you use the social media
becomes big data
to select
what you
accredit or assign
in precision
that enables that sort of
information to update your beliefs
So I think in terms of
understanding the mechanics of belief updating
and intervening
in that either therapeutically
or for commercial reasons
like in advertising for example
it's probably going to be all about
how you can get attention
and what you mean by attention
and the physiognomic mechanisms
of attention
and also
just gaining some high level
control of attention to be able to
mentalize it
So there are certain forms of attention
which we have known, not because of I data
but any control over
which it may be possible to learn to control
with suitable mindfulness
for example
So can it be expression
so this is the phenomenon when I move my eyes
as I look around the room
During the
motion of the eyes
I do not see the optical flow
I don't see the words sweep
or pass them
All I see are the static samples
that I then integrate into a coherent
coherent theme
So that saccadic suppression
is a very interesting example
of temporarily ignoring
or reducing the precision
of the lighting of mapping
here
in a very, very
tentatively precise way
