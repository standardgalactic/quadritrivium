which you cannot
affect by the least higher
in the model
Now imagine that you now had a connection
in the generative model
so you felt hungry
talking about contextualizing before
so it was some higher level
representation of self
or myself saying to self at this point
you could actually get eaten
and then suspend
that saccadic suppression
so you could choose whether to see
the world moving when you move your eyes
or not
In fact, to a certain extent you can
this isn't the old hand that was driven
you can see what it would look like
and you would push the side of your eyeball
and you see the world shift
So there are ways of getting around it
if you have a sufficiently deep generative model
So my question
I'm not sure what the implications were
in terms of the ethics of it
or the localization of that
which is another issue of course
but just in terms of practically
what you would be looking at
I think you'd be looking at the process
of the media and the precision
and the degree of the message
passing between these hierarchical levels
that would look very much like
what you could use for a change
or what you could ignore
which is to get control of another
for yourself and the possible
presentation that you may well
have in your own strategy
Thank you. I wasn't talking
about the therapeutic effect
later. I'm probing this
position. I was talking about
the investigation of this system
which is still being bad
you know
Can you give me a concrete example?
Just
Well it is the same thing
like as you said
advertisement rate so it's not
kind of changing human attitudes
explaining how bad
fast or bad or whatever
you know, not patriotized
but that just
predicts
what kind of
disorder
will react to this kind of
like, what will be the way
that people with these or that kind
of disorder, not psychiatric
kind of
to this certain message
like the hatred, not patriotized
that's a bad one. So will they still
die? Will they still like
will they say no? Will they say yes
I'm talking about kind of like
prognostication model not improvement
but just improvement of the
management, not improvement of
agents themselves. So what was
in the economics context then?
Some should have politically
because it's a
digitizing or whatever
I don't know because
this particular
mathematical formulation hasn't really
got that far. It's penetrated
theoretical biology
in terms of multi-agent games
and ecological structure
and anthropology. So there are
issues of how much of an agent
he finished constructing and
constrained their own conversion
behavior
and there have been
sort of multi-agent simulations and the
number of cells organizing different
patterns and conditions
but nobody to my knowledge
has taken these
variational free energy solutions
to model
markets of advertising or
gene political events. It's a
really exciting opportunity but
to my knowledge it hasn't
been done. It's only been
initially addressed in the past couple of years
in ethology
and in
literature in psychology
and in all the genesis.
Thank you very much for
an interesting presentation.
I would like to ask several questions
concerning Markov processes.
First of all
the principle feature
of Markov processes
is that the future
is determined by the past
only by the present.
Is this factor
resulted from the application where
or is only the simplification
to be able
to solve mathematical problems
associated with
problems solved?
The second question
is on this slide
devoted to
activity
and currents
there is two molecules
entropy
and energy.
Energy is non-dimensional
energy is dimensional
how do you explain the
difference between them?
And the third question
we're really
solved ordinary
general equations to predict
the area of
Markov worlds.
So a few easy questions
there.
We'll probably be a physicist.
Can I answer your
answers?
So a really interesting question
but what do you spend
on Markovian
dependencies
that are implicit in the Markov
decision process
for convenience?
Or do we think
or is one thing that these are
the only kinds of generated models
that fit for the universe
in which we live?
I think
technically
all of this maths
inherits from
the treatment
of random dynamic systems
in which case the
Markovian properties
are true and
that's where you start.
So
my answer would be
they are not
a device of mathematical convenience
they are actually dating
to the underlying premise
and that also enables me
to stress the third question
what we are basically
solving here
are not ordinary differential equations
that would follow from
a stochastic differential equation
that you can treat along
with others
that could be applied to the density
dynamics. For example
Fokker-Pak equation
on the density dynamics
on a straight wave equation
or a master equation.
So much of this really
all of these simulations are actually
created to sense on funtionals
where there's a function
a probability distribution
very much like the Fokker-Pak equation
so that's the belief-based aspect
