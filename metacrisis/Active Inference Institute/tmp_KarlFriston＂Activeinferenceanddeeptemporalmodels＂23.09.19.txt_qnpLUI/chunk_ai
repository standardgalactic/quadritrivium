it sees nothing on either
sample
and yet it knows
because it knows what could possibly happen
in terms of the alternative
and the structure of the sentence
the solution has to be
sees up here
and burns up here
and indeed its posterior beliefs
is hallucinating effectively
in a very positive and base-optical way
the existence
of these percents
even though we never looked there
and you see evidence of that
if you look in detail
the sequence of circadian eye movements
as they
form beliefs
they resolve uncertainty
their response when it is done in accordance
and go and get the next
sort of information
that will resolve uncertainty about
what this agent is looking at
I share the same results here
in a different format just to end of the slide
the separation of 10 plus gains
so
these are beliefs
at the higher level
about one of six sentences
that the
synthetic agent
was looking at
and notice
it's going to be right at the end
it actually resolves its uncertainty
about the sentence because
these two sentences share everything apart
from the last word
in no context immediately
it must be looking at these two sentences
because the first word is unique
to these two sentences
but the last word disambiguates
so this uncertainty
evolves slowly and it's been
slowly and it's only resolved
by the last word
in contrast
the beliefs about what particular word
I am currently looking at
develop much much more quickly
so these
converge
to a particular
posterior belief
and then that is
evidence for the higher sentence
based belief and then we start
again with a new outcome
a new outcome and a new outcome
that is hard to select with visual
impressions
and I try to get that in terms of
this separation of time scales
dictated by
and only by the belief updating
just want to make a point
a point again
what you actually see
in these
in cynical creatures
is very similar to what you see
as we are looking at for example
pre-secatted delay productivity
in the prefrontal cortex
shown here
in the raster format
looks very similar to the kind
of responses observed to the view of recordings
shown here in terms of the bar chart
furthermore we look at the deflections
associated with the belief updating
on a stimulus by stimulus basis
which is definitely
very much like the periscope
evoked potentials
during anti-vision in markets
and I just want to close by pursuing that
but by focusing on the responses
to stimuli
towards the end of the sentence
and I am going to play a trick
on this little creature
I am going to teach you a violation
or two violations
of a different sort
in the home of what we briefly seen
chemical responses you find
in cognitive neuroscience
namely
a pre-attentive like this much negativity
at about 100 to 170 milliseconds
and then a reorienting
novelty like response
and later
more indulgent response
700 versus a P300
associated with semantic violations
by changing
stimuli so there is a surprising
mean to the work
so I am going to do that
just by presenting it in other case
I am going to present it in no case
so this is if you like
the stimulus manipulation
at a low level
and I have shown the results
at a low level in blue
without the manipulation
and then probably the difference here
may be not very much like this much negativity
of the sort that you would see
if I
played you with a bottle of stimulus
in a stream of standard stimuli
without any differences
I would say another one of more semantic
representations
if I did the same trick
with this file
instead of just changing other cases to lower case
I now have to change the meaning of the word
to use the same stimuli
I now have a much more
semantic high level violation
and now the thing that recognises
the surprise
of the free energy
here is
first but also now
the second semantic level
but of course it has to wait longer
to get the evidence from the first level
to be surprised
to do with the belief updating to the sport
without surprise
which means that the difference weight
forms that are expressed
in the Paris film this time
in a regime that would correspond
to the EP300
so it's a very particular
specific example
but I use this
just to explain how far you can get
and understand the
classical results that are used
and have been used for decades
in cognitive neuroscience
with actual physiology
that can be understood in terms
of the computational architecture
and message passing
I would simply imperative
to minimise uncertainty
about the weight of the world
words and indeed how
can I work in that world
and this conclusion
is nice and summarised in relation
to my movements by Helmholtz
who was the farmer of many of
the
inferential interpretations
of the scheme
so each movement we make
the appearance of objects should be thought of
as an experiment designed to test
everything around us to correctly
the invariant relations of the phenomenon
of the forest that is the existence
of indefinite spatial relations
and with that
it remains for me to thank
the people of whose ideas I've been talking about
but most of all
thank you for your attention
thank you very much
exactly to the biological reality
so to clarify something
can we return to your first example
with the oral
and so I had two questions related
to this first example
the first one is
