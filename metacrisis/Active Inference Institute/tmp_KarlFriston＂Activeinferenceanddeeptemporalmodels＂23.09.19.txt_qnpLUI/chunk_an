that you can get away
from creating flows
on functions of states
or gradient flows
on functions of states
but in terms of now
in terms of gradient flows
there are functions on beliefs and coding
like states. It's a big technical
if you'd like to discuss that further
in the email I'll send you
something which I've never
done so much from here with you
that takes you through those arguments
very precisely.
The interesting thing
though
is coming back to the first
question
because clearly
this particular
MDP is semi-markoval
I have written the Markoval property
because I've now
got two times here
in place here
so in practice
what happens with
these immensely complicated
itinerant captive sets
that we use as a mathematical model
of
self-organizing systems
like biological systems
when you summarize it in terms
of a Markoval-like
process
in the sweet space
and in the sweet time
it looks like it has now
acquired the semi-markoval aspect
so it is interesting
that from
the purely Markovian
physics of it
due to the complicated nature
of the systems that we
like to study
when you find the
free-engine optimizing
models that turn out to be
hierarchical with
that
breaking the simple Markoval
into making the same Markoval
so
at that point I think the
disputed model of decision process
has become a mathematical approximation
to what is actually
a continuous time Markoval process
that looks as if
it's lost its simple Markoval
property because it's just become
so itinerant, so complicated
and so structured and so
interesting from a biological
perspective.
