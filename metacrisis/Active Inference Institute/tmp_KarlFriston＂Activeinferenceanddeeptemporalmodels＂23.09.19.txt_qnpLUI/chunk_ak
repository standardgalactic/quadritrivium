and
and again
you appeal to
hierarchical
difference
but now over
a more extended time frame
so from the point of view of
statistician
the way that you would
learn the good prize
for a particular environment
for a particular sorted data
via manifold learning for example
between 20 model selection
so now
you are selecting
the form of those models
then maximizes model difference
after a certain time
and if you
look for the physiological formula
lots of that could be things like life
as you'll see
I will be giving the lecture
I think it's shaped that point
towards the end at some point
the limit of change
we'll discuss this further
but probably more interesting I think
is neural development
to the next level
but as you've hinted
all of this takes place at an evolution time frame
so the way
mathematically we bring all of these things
now under the same
principle
is to interpret natural
selection as lazy model
selection
and that's actually very easy to do
but not only that but in the past 10 years
people have now started
to interpret
in theoretical biology
the models or the
dynamics of natural selection
in terms of Bayesian filtering
so for example
the regulator of dynamics
or the replicator equation
or the price equation
these are
very easily
shown to be spent with a
few simplified assumptions
they can be shown to be
Bayesian filters or Kalman filters
so what you're saying is that
evolution
is just nature's way
of doing basic model selection
to change or to
select those models that
prior structures was phenatized
that have the greatest evidence
what do you think by evidence
they're likely better than they are there
they're likely they are
the best model for that
environment
so from the environment's point of view
it is tested by hypothesis
that this is a good fit
for being the environment
or this phenotype
the evidence
that it is a good fit
for being the environment
corresponds to adaptive fitness
is scored by the time interval
of the variation of the energy
because that's the balance
of the ability of that
model being the right model
given the experience
of the environment
so the answer is
it all comes down to evolution
but it's exactly the same process as operation
very very very slowly
and in that context you wouldn't think about
the phenotype as being
the individual thing about cost-specific
so cycle of life
with one selection of critical
over a developmental cycle
so
thank you very much for the talk
I have a small question about
is there a small body
about human evolution
is it possible in terms of your theory
to describe
just to describe and explain
the huge quality
difference between humans
and other animals
and is there
any hint
that you think
or have solved this problem
thank you
that's a difficult question
I think it's a short answer
because I think it speaks very much
to what we were just talking about
I think it's just the depth
of the challenge involved
that distinguishes the kinds
and structures
meaning you
as opposed to say a dog
as opposed to say a fish
as opposed to say an insect
as opposed to say a single-cell organism
so just the distinction
between single-cell organisms
and multi-cell organisms
that immediately speak to a hierarchical aspect
and an ethnic aspect
but if you take that further
I just think what kinds
of hierarchical
extensions
would make you you as opposed to
a bacterium
or the me as opposed to a bacterium
I think the answer is
in the span of death in time
I think that's basically it
I think it almost reduces
to the very simple observation
that you and I plan
and the bacterium doesn't
and we can argue about
whether the bean delts or the dog does
but certainly the bacterium
during its chemotaxis
does not plan
it does not plan to go to school
or to find birthday presents
whereas we do
so what do you need to plan
to plan to select
various policies
which means you have to have a journey
of the future the consequences
of those policies
so that's just simply a statement
of the fact that we
infer our world
under journey models
for example death
they have a horizon that goes beyond
the present
it enables us to plan
and to think about
what would happen if I did that
now because as soon as you have that capacity
you now have to make a choice
so the bacterium doesn't have a choice
about what it does but you and I do
and I think that's a
qualitative
distinction
which again is just a structural
is a thing which would distinguish
high local life from low local life
it's not the same
where better the bacterium
or the virus
for any particular
economy or environment
there will be a free energy
expanse
so viruses are great for
fitting and inferring
their environment
just as the person said
about the cell
so we've been very doubtful
and after compressing down very very small
you will not do very well outside
the cell
but the virus will not do very well in the university
so it's all in relation
to
the way that you are
