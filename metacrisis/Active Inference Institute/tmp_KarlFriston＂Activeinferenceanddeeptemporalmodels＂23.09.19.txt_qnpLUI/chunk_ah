of the dynamics
the terrible scattering of those
messages
in real brains
and it's an interesting
jigsaw problem to solve
but there are lots of immediate parallels
that we can evidence
when you just look at the factor graph
and you look at the textbook neuroanatomy
I just sketched out
some ideas here
we don't need to talk about this
the point is there's a very interesting opportunity
once you understand
what has to be
the computational anatomial
if you commit
to this
genetic model of erosion
and self-evidence and formulation
of belief updating behaviour
if you commit to that
then you've got that
necessary computational anatomy
you've got the empirical neuroanatomy
that we presume does this computation
so now you can start
to look for parallels
and assign different roles to different parts of the brain
so for example
in this instance
it looks as if
the nervous paradigm
contains labels
for horses for example
just on the basis of the connectivity
in reference to that factor graph
on a previous stage
but let me think about this by taking you through
conceptually
a genetic model
of a simulated agent
is doing a very simple form of pictographic reading
so here
there are no letters
but there are little icons
and the position of these icons
depends on a particular word
so
an icon can be
that comprises
each word if you like comprises two icons
therefore there's seeds
a bird
or a cat
and if
the cat is meant for the bird
that means the bird will flee
so that's the word flee
if the seeds are meant for a bird
the word feed
the bird can feed on the seeds
on the seeds
if however there's nothing
next to the bird
so the seeds are down here
from the diagonal corner
that just means weight
so it's a very simple little language
we've arbitrarily invented
and
the reason
for using this
pictographic form
is that the agent has to decide
where to look
if he wants to read this word
look at the letters in the word
it has to decide
where to look at
over here
has denoted by the locations
one, two, three and four
from the point of view of the genetic model
what does that mean
these are the states
the hidden states that you would need
to generate an outcome
so what would be the sensory outcome
well the sensory outcome
would be feeling that I'm looking
at positions one, two, three or four
or what I'm actually sampling
or foaming at that time
which can either do nothing
seeds, a bird
or a cat
but to generate those outcomes
I have to know
the configuration
of these pictographic letters
where I am looking
and I've introduced another
hidden state here
which is filling
presenting words in upper
or lower case
so with those three causes
I can generate any particular outcome
in a visual modality
and a proprioceptive
or feeling where I have
currently pointed my eyes
in modality
and because I have written down
the genetic model
I can use the standard
message passing
scheme of previous slide
to simulate inference
I can simulate what this
is a creature would do
in terms of foraging information
I try to understand what word it is looking at
but what I really want to do
is to do that with some deep
temporal structure
so diachronic aspect
I want it to remember the words in the seed
and from the point of view of the genetic model
generate sentences
or sequences of words
from the point of view
of servovenancy
inverting that genetic model
to recognise
what this word is
in the context of beliefs of our own sentences
so to do that
I now have to put together
four words or four different pages
if you like
and the four words
are basically sequences
of words here
typical of superscriptive sentences
flea-point, flea-point
and I classify those with an even higher level
which we actually do not want to show here
so now if I know the sentence
I know the sequence one
you know, flea-way, flea-point
and I know
where we are in terms of
which page we're looking at
I can now generate the word
I can generate the word
if I am now looking at information
if I am looking at whether I flip or not
I can now generate the outcome
and if I can generate the outcome
that means I can invert the outcomes
to make inferences of how beliefs
about the sentence
so I'm going to take that factor graph
that computational anatomy
and this genetic model
and then simulate reading
in terms of where
this page and law is
to try and accumulate evidence
to build postgeophilies
about the sentence it is reading
and the actual sentence it is reading
is flea-way, flea-way
and these are
the expectations
of the lowest level
about what is actually there
at the lowest level
and the key point
made in these simulations
is you can have
very precise beliefs
about
what you would see if you got over there
even though
you never actually got there
and these precise beliefs
come from this deep structure
so for example
you can see
that in the first
the first calendar
to the second word
and no point
because it actually samples
a stimulus that it either
sees or burns
