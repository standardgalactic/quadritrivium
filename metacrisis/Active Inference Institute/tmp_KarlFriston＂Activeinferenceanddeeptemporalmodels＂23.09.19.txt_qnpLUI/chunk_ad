whether the sign is pointing this direction
or in that direction
so this is an example of a policy
that has no epistemic value at all
contrast that
with the situation where you are looking directly
at the sign resolving an ambiguity
and getting very precise sensory information
so now if the sign is pointing in this direction
then you will be 100% certain it is pointing this direction
if the sign is pointing in this direction
then you will be 100% certain it is pointing in that direction
and you know that
and then that before you even made a high movement
so that is basically what this
k-r divergence
this epistemic affordance
this salience
this information gain means
you can if you know the way the world works
and you know and have a journey of what are the consequences
of your act of sampling of that world
you can work out in advance
what the best move is to make to reduce your uncertainty
and that is mostly what I am going to say from now on
rests upon
a fundamental imperative, an epistemic imperative
that is certain to reducing self-imperity
so that is all the hard work done
now I am just going to see some pretty examples
and simulations to show what it looks like
in simulations
and hopefully convince you that you have seen
a lot of this phenomenology
in papers indeed possibly
in your own research
I should say
you know I made a joke about the mathematics
and the formula before
but perhaps I should
excuse why we use the mathematics so much
there is a simple reason
if you really want to understand something
as Richard Feynman used to say
you have to be able to build one
and to be able to build a little creature
that does the paradigms that we ask about subjects
or our experimental animals to do
you need to be able to write down the software
and you need to be able to write down
the mathematical formula
upon which the software are generated
so that is our motivation
really to create little in silico
in silicon regions
that we can expose to the same experimental paradigms
or lesions
as real creatures
and then see what this belief I've dated
this active infant self-emphasizing looks like
and then we can see the same kind
of empirical phenomenology
in real creatures
so that's the excuse or the motivation for it
but it does require you
to commit to very particular
and well specified models
that are used by creatures
living systems
when explaining their paradigm or their world
a very general one
again please ignore the equations
we're going to walk you through with the graphics
on the model
is called a Markov decision process
so with this single and same model
we have modeled an entire range
of different kinds of behavior
ranging from
waiting games
to foraging in a team
that's what the bats will do
through to reading
we'll see exactly that later
through to active curiosity
and problem solving
so many different kinds of paradigms
can be modeled with this one very general
generative model
so I'm just going to briefly take you through
to give you one worked example
just to give you a feel for the simplicity
in which you work
you want to use these kinds of models
to simulate your paradigms
so the idea is
we need to generate outcomes
things that can be a creature
or something like me
would be able to observe
sea, air, field
and these outcomes
we're going to say are going to be generated
by hidden states of the world
they are hidden because they are
not directly observable
we can't observe our sensations
we can't see them
directly because of their sensations
so they're often infertile
either latent or hidden states
and they have
a narrative, they have dynamics
there are successions
and transitions of hidden states
so if I'm in a particular hidden state
at this point in time
I will be statistically at this point
at the next point in time
and so on and so forth
in the need of hidden states
each one of these states generating an outcome
must time ticks them off
and the mapping between
the hidden states and the outcome
is just a white bit of nothing
it's the probability of getting this outcome
here in this particular state of the world
that's usually left by a hand matrix
now clearly
the way that the world unfolds
these hidden states
depends upon how I act upon
the hidden states
the hidden states of where my eye is pointing
determines
what I actually see
so we imagine that some states of the world
depend upon
policies
in other words the transitions between
this state of the world and the next state of the world
at the next time point
encoded by a probability transition matrix
beaten
is a function of policy
we've just said that policies
are determined by
our prior preferences
by states
and eventually then the prior preferences
by C
and they will have
some precision
some confidence associated
with that
I won't talk about that very much
but it is interesting because it looks
very much like
don't be the sponsors of the brain
and I'll show you a brief example
of that later
and finally I just have to specify
beliefs about the initial states
or probabilities of the initial states
and a few hyper parameters
that statistically parameterize it
and with that model
I can go all the way to anything
within reason
so toy model of all that
anything
furthermore
if I make some simplifying assumptions
about my beliefs about all the unknowns
the key unknowns of course being
the hidden states of the world
generating outcomes
and crucially the positives
so these are the two things I need
to
infer
four good beliefs about my minimizing
that
by optimizing that free energy
or that evidence you're about
I'm also going to
think about optimizing the confidence
of my policies
the important thing here
notice
that we're casting behavior
here
in terms of forming beliefs about
what I couldn't do
and then just selecting action
from the most likely
or the policy that I think I'm as likely
to be pursuing the model
there's sometimes known as planning
