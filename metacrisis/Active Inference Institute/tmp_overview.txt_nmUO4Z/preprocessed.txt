Checking Active Inference Institute/ActInf GuestStream 051.1 ~ Tommaso Salvatori ＂Causal Inference via Predictive Coding＂.txt
1. Predictive coding is a theory of how the brain processes sensory inputs by forming predictions and updating these predictions based on prediction errors. It's a framework for understanding perception, action, and attention in terms of predicting sensory inputs and motor outputs.

2. While predictive coding traditionally deals with static data, it can be extended to dynamic systems using approaches like the Kalman filter, which allows for modeling temporal data and potentially incorporating Granger causality and other dynamical causal models.

3. Predictive coding can be integrated with action through various means: internal actions (like attention), the outputs of nodes within the network, or by treating action as another variable within the architecture, especially in the context of active inference.

4. Active inference is a framework that combines predictive coding with decision-making and action selection, where actions are chosen based on predictions about their outcomes.

5. The intersection of predictive coding with action opens up possibilities for addressing complex problems, potentially leading to more sophisticated interventions and treatments in fields like psychiatry or robotics.

6. While there is potential for applying predictive coding with action to practical problems, this area has not been as extensively explored as other applications of predictive coding.

7. Both Thomas and Daniel emphasized the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of predictive coding and how it can be extended to include actions before applying it to real-world scenarios.

8. Thomas expressed interest in future works and the potential for further collaboration and exploration into this domain.

The conversation highlighted the theoretical foundations of predictive coding and its potential applications, particularly when combined with action within dynamic systems. It also underscored the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to understanding and applying these principles in real-world contexts.

1. **Active Inference vs. Other Models**: Dean and his colleagues compared the predictive power of an active inference model with six parameters against other models using two different datasets. The active inference model, which includes a dynamic learning mechanism and a forgetting rate function, was found to be the best-fit model in both cases, though the difference in predictive accuracy was minimal compared to the next best model (81.5% vs. 80.6%).

2. **Clinical Applications**: They are currently conducting a study that includes both online and in-person components to further explore the clinical applications of these models, focusing on how they can predict individual differences in subjective well-being and negative affect.

3. **Interception Data**: Alongside this research, they are also modeling interoceptive awareness (how individuals perceive their internal bodily states) data, which is particularly relevant for anxiety disorders.

4. **Ongoing Research**: The ongoing work aims to bridge the gap between basic science and clinical utility by developing models that can be practically helpful to people suffering from mental health issues.

5. **Future Directions**: Future research will likely involve a continuous update of literature reviews and meta-analyses across different systems, including empirical status reports on brain regions like the amygdala, to further refine and understand these models.

6. **Community Engagement**: The researchers are open to feedback and further discussions on their methodologies and findings, emphasizing the importance of transparency in research processes and acknowledging the limitations of the studies conducted.

7. **Invitation for Further Discussion**: Dean and his team welcome the opportunity to share more about their work and are happy to return to discuss further developments or results.

In summary, Dean and his colleagues are engaged in cutting-edge research that combines basic science with clinical applications, using advanced computational models like active inference to better understand human decision-making, mental health, and the perception of internal bodily states.

Checking Active Inference Institute/ActInf Livestream #026.0 ~ “Bayesian Mechanics for Stationary Processes”.txt
 The discussion revolves around a recent paper that extends the framework of active inference, particularly focusing on how it can be applied to systems that interact with and infer the states of other systems. The paper suggests that active inference might not just apply to cognitive systems but could also be relevant to a variety of other systems, including potentially non-biological ones like internet networks or robotics.

Key points from the paper include:

1. **Interacting with External States**: The paper discusses how active inference can be applied when an organism (or system) is not just inferring a static state of the external environment but also inferring the trajectories of these states over time. This involves decomposing the motion into higher-order terms, which can be seen as a form of Bayesian filtering, such as the Extended Kalman Filter or the Particle Filter.

2. **Nested Mark Off Blankets**: The concept of "mark off blankets" at different scales is introduced to describe how systems might partition the base state space into subsystems that themselves can mark off blankets. This adds complexity to the inferential dynamics and the generative model.

3. **Realism vs. Instrumentalism**: There's a philosophical debate about whether non-biological systems (like cells, robots, or networks) can perform active inference. The paper raises questions about what constitutes an entity doing active inference, whether it's following the free energy principle or adapting to constraints of nature.

4. **Engineering Applications**: The paper also touches on the practical side of designing systems within the active inference framework. It's one thing to claim that a system is performing active inference; it's another to engineer a system that operates under this paradigm.

5. **Temporarily Deep Inference**: The paper suggests that active inference can be extended from inferring the current state of an external process to inferring its trajectory over time, which is particularly relevant for systems that need to adapt to changing environments or behaviors.

The discussion highlights several implications and questions that arise from the paper:

- What understanding might emerge from applying this framework to different systems?
- What unique predictions can be made based on this research?
- What are the next steps in free energy principle and active inference research?
- What are the goals of this research, and what are the researchers still curious about or looking to learn?

The session concludes with an invitation for further discussion and exploration of these topics through subsequent events or comments on the videos. The paper and the ensuing discussion underscore the interdisciplinary nature of active inference and its potential applications across various fields.

Sure! In this conversation, Richard is explaining the concept of dynamical systems in a way that's easy to understand, as if he were explaining it to a 10-year-old. A dynamical system is essentially a collection of things (like particles, objects, or even abstract concepts) that interact with each other according to certain rules or laws of physics. These interactions can be complex, but they follow specific patterns that mathematicians and scientists can describe and predict.

Richard uses the analogy of a system as something as simple as a pen or as complex as an organism. The key point is understanding what boundaries define the system and how its internal parts interact with each other and with external elements.

In a sparsely coupled system, which means that most parts of the system don't directly affect each other but may be influenced by one or more intermediate components, the behavior of the system can often be understood through Bayesian inference. This is a statistical method for updating the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

In simpler terms, Richard says that the state of a dynamical system—whether it's a bacteria, a robot, or any other entity—can be described by a set of variables (like temperature, pressure, etc.). These variables can be thought of as parameters that define the system's current situation. By understanding these parameters and how they change over time, scientists can predict the future states of the system.

Richard emphasizes the importance of combining historical knowledge from dynamical systems with new research to advance our understanding and ability to predict complex interactions in the world around us.

Overall, the conversation highlights the beauty and utility of dynamical systems theory in making sense of a wide range of phenomena, from the motion of celestial bodies to the behavior of living organisms or even artificial intelligence systems.

 Throughout the discussion, Thomas Schönauer emphasized the importance of understanding chronic pain not just as a physical phenomenon but also as a complex interplay between our perception, attention, and the inferences we make based on the information our bodies provide us. He highlighted that our brain is constantly making inferences about the world around us, and these inferences can be influenced by past experiences, expectations, or even misinterpretations of signals from our body.

Thomas suggested that some chronic pain conditions might arise from a misestimation of precision – our brains overestimating the accuracy of the information it receives from certain body parts, leading to an overconfident interpretation of those signals as pain. He also pointed out that there might be a learned component in which attention becomes fixated on a particular area due to past injuries or illnesses, even after the initial cause has resolved.

He recommended leveraging our brain's plasticity to correct these mislearned models and potentially resolve chronic pain syndromes through adaptive learning. Thomas also commended the efforts of those who create educational resources and discussions around this topic, as they make complex scientific concepts more accessible.

The conversation underscored the multifaceted nature of chronic pain and the potential for interventions that target the cognitive and perceptual aspects of pain experience. The closing thoughts reiterated the value of ongoing dialogue and education in this field, with the understanding that a great book or resource is one that provokes thought and generates further questions rather than providing simple answers.

The discussion was wrapped up with appreciation for Thomas's insights and encouragement for listeners to engage with educational resources and discussions on chronic pain to deepen their understanding and contribute to the collective knowledge in this area.

 Chapter 2 of the book delves into the foundational concepts of active inference, which is a framework for understanding perception and action as processes for minimizing free energy, a tractable proxy to surprise or discrepancy between expected and observed outcomes. The chapter starts by introducing Bayes theorem as the fundamental statistical relationship that underpins all subsequent developments in active inference.

Key points from the chapter include:

1. **Bayes Theorem**: It is the cornerstone of active inference, providing a way to update beliefs (belief update) given new evidence (evidence updating).

2. **Generative Model (P(D))**: This represents our model of how the world works and how data is generated. It encapsulates our prior knowledge and expectations about sensory inputs.

3. **Beliefs (Q)**: These are our subjective beliefs or predictions about hidden variables that cannot be directly observed. They are updated using Bayesian inference.

4. **Free Energy (F)**: This is a measure of surprise, prediction error, or discrepancy between expected outcomes and what is actually observed. Minimizing free energy corresponds to minimizing surprise.

5. **Variational Free Energy (F_ ELBO)**: This is an approximation to the true free energy that can be optimized using gradient descent methods. It allows for tractable optimization of beliefs in real-time.

6. **Action Selection (G)**: This involves predicting future sensory outcomes based on different actions and selecting the action that minimizes expected free energy, which corresponds to maximizing expected evidence or expected surprise reduction.

7. **Expected Free Energy (F_G)**: This extends the variational free energy to include the impact of potential actions. It guides policy selection by considering both the current state and the anticipated consequences of actions.

8. **Active Inference**: This is the process of updating beliefs and taking actions in a way that minimizes expected free energy, thus aligning behavior with the goal of reducing surprise over time.

9. **Counterfactual Cognition**: Active inference allows for considering alternative outcomes, which is essential for decision-making, planning, and understanding the consequences of actions.

10. **Summary**: The chapter emphasizes that active inference provides a unified framework for perception and action, where both are seen as processes for minimizing surprise in an uncertain world. It combines elements of Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and cognitive science to describe how organisms maintain their existence by actively engaging with the environment.

The chapter concludes by encouraging readers to understand the mathematical framework, particularly equations 2.5 and 2.6, as these are essential for grasping the concepts of active inference and applying them to various problems across different domains. The authors also invite readers to join their community for support and resources in understanding and teaching active inference.

2. It establishes parallels between free energy in statistical physics and expected free energy in Bayesian active inference, showing how these concepts can be applied to cognitive processes such as perception and action.

3. The chapter explains the variational principle using the examples of FEP (Free Energy Principle) and minimum surprise, highlighting that both are essentially about minimizing a form of free energy to maintain coherence between predictions and sensory data.

4. Equations 3.1 and 3.2 are key in tying together the concepts from chapters two and three, framing perception and action as forms of inference guided by the principle of least action or minimization of expected free energy.

5. Table 3.1 is particularly exciting as it draws connections between different fields: statistical physics, Bayesian information theory, and cognitive interpretations, showing how active inference can bridge these areas.

6. Box 3.2 clarifies the distinction between different types of 'free energy' to avoid confusion with concepts from physics or engineering.

7. The chapter continues with a detailed explanation of variational free energy (F) and expected free energy (G), their roles in real-time sensory processing (F) and policy planning (G).

1. **Discrete Time POMDP Models**: We discussed the construction of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) models in discrete time, which are essential for decision-making in environments where actions have stochastic effects and observations may be incomplete or noisy. The process involves defining the state space, action space, observation space, transition dynamics, and reward function. The POMDP challenge is to find a policy that maximizes expected long-term rewards. Equations 4.13 and 4.14 in the text provide the formal representation of the POMDP problem using vector notation and gradients. For more detailed guidance on constructing POMDP models, the authors recommend consulting the set by step paper.

2. **Continuous Time**: We previewed the continuous time generative model, which is more complex than discrete time models. This part will involve understanding differential equations to describe dynamics and Laplace approximation for variational inference. The key distinction in the free energy principle as used in active inference compared to Gibbs free energy is the application of Laplace approximation.

3. **Generalized Coordinates of Motion**: This concept simplifies models by reducing the dimensionality of state space, which can be particularly useful for high-dimensional problems. The idea is to use a subset of variables that capture the essential dynamics of the system.

4. **Approximate Bayesian Inference**: We will learn how variational free energy minimization can be used for approximate Bayesian inference, allowing us to make probabilistic inferences under uncertainty.

5. **Message Passing**: This is a big topic that we'll come back to later. It involves algorithms like belief propagation and sum-product algorithms for computing marginals in graphical models.

6. **Laplace Approximation Equations**: This approximation is crucial for computing the variational free energy, which is central to the approach taken in the book.

7. **Another Message Passing Representation**: This will be another way to look at the same problem, providing an alternative algorithmic perspective.

8. **Summary**: By the end of chapter four, we should have all the essential mathematical tools necessary for the rest of the book. Chapter five serves as an interlude and is not a direct continuation of chapters one through four but rather sets the stage for what comes next. The first part of the book, which covers the foundational concepts and mathematics, concludes here with a solid grounding in both theory and practice for applying these models to real-world problems.

1. **Chapter Overview**: Chapter six of the textbook on active inference provides a comprehensive overview of setting up an active inference model. It addresses four key questions that guide the modeling process: what system are we modeling, what is the most appropriate form for the generative model, how to set up the generative model, and how to set up the generative process.

2. **System Identification**: This involves identifying the system under study, its components, and their interactions. It's crucial to understand the system's structure to determine what aspects need to be modeled and which can be treated as exogenous inputs.

3. **Generative Model Formulation**: Here, the chapter guides us through choosing an appropriate generative model based on the system's characteristics. This includes deciding between discrete or continuous models depending on the nature of the system's dynamics.

4. **Model Implementation**: The practical aspects of setting up the generative process are covered, including defining the parameters, specifying how they change over time (the learning process), and identifying which parameters require constant updating versus those that change slowly.

5. **Interoperability and Creativity**: Active inference is presented as a flexible framework where motifs can be composed and adapted creatively to model various cognitive phenomena such as counterfactuals, multi-scale attention, covert action, and memory-based decision making.

6. **Practical Application**: The chapter sets the stage for applying active inference models to real-world scenarios, with subsequent chapters providing case studies and further guidance on using the framework with empirical data.

7.5 introduces learning directly into the generative models within the framework of active inference. This is a significant advancement from previous formulations where learning was not explicitly accounted for. The example provided is a creature navigating a world of black and white tiles, which requires the agent to learn and update its model as it moves through the environment. This scenario illustrates how different components of active inference—such as perception, action, and information seeking—are interconnected.

In 7.6, the chapter explores hierarchical or deep inference, which involves nested inference processes across multiple scales or time steps. The structure learning interlude (boxed off-topic) explains how models can be learned from observable data, which is a foundational concept for understanding deeper models. Figure 7.12 represents a fractal generative model as a component within a larger, multi-scale generative model, showing how lower-level inferences at the leaf level can influence and contribute to higher-level learning and inference processes.

The composability of these generative models is highlighted, with the discrete time model introduced by Toby Sinclair-Smith serving as a foundational motif that allows for the layering of additional features such as action, learning, and so on. This leads to a more nuanced understanding of complex cognitive processes like language learning through reading, which involves multiple timescales from reading individual letters to comprehending larger word groups.

7.13 extends the discussion to language comprehension during reading, demonstrating how the model can accommodate the anticipatory nature of reading by processing words sequentially and building a coherent generative model of the text. This example further showcases the utility of the active inference framework in modeling various aspects of cognition and perception across different scales and time steps.

The key points include the distinction between discrete and continuous models, the mathematical formulation involving differential equations, and the practical implications for modeling hierarchical decision-making and sensorimotor coordination.

2. **Hybrid Models**: The authors discuss the integration of continuous time models with discrete state space models, which allows for a more nuanced representation of cognitive processes that involve both rapid, discrete decisions and slow, continuous changes over time.

3. **Examples of Applications**: The chapter provides examples where continuous time active inference has been applied to various phenomena such as synthetic bird song, ocular motor delays, conditioned reflexes, smooth pursuit eye movements, action observation, attention, saccades, and self-organization.

4. **Philosophical Implications**: The discussion on continuous time active inference raises philosophical questions about the co-constitution of agents and their environments, the nature of emergent properties, and the ontological status of these processes. It suggests that active inference, particularly in its continuous form, can serve as a bridge between philosophy and science, offering a rigorous framework for exploring these concepts.

5. **Practical Implications**: The chapter emphasizes the importance of understanding the parameters involved in continuous time models and how they can be accounted for in practical modeling scenarios. It also highlights the need for further exploration into how these models can be applied to real-world data in chapter nine.

6. **Future Work**: The authors acknowledge that the topic of continuous time active inference is vast and complex, with much left unsaid. They suggest that there are many areas ripe for future research, including the development of hybrid models and the exploration of self-organization processes.

In summary, chapter eight provides a comprehensive overview of how active inference can be extended to continuous time domains, offering a more dynamic and integrated view of cognitive processes. It also underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches that combine both scientific and philosophical inquiry to understand the complexities of the mind and brain.

 Chapter Nine of the OMDP provides an overview of generative modeling applied to empirical data in the context of experimental design and computational psychiatry. Here's a summary of its key points:

1. **Generative Modeling**: The chapter discusses how generative models can be used to explain and predict empirical data, particularly focusing on the intersection between sensory input (like visual or auditory cues) and motor output (like eye movements). It emphasizes the importance of understanding the generative process underlying observed behavior.

2. **Active Inference**: The authors explore how active inference, a framework within Bayesian models, can be used to understand decision-making processes in both normal and abnormal scenarios. Active inference involves agents who make decisions by inference, updating their beliefs about the world based on sensory data and actions.

3. **Isocade Task**: An example of generative modeling is provided using an isocade task, where the model must account for both the visual input (patterns of light) and the resulting motor behavior (eye movements). The chapter compares two generative models of this task, highlighting the plurality of models that can be constructed to explain the same behavior.

4. **Computational Pathology**: The chapter extends the discussion to computational models of psychiatric disorders. It outlines how normal human behavior can be modeled and how deviations from these models can lead to various abnormal behaviors associated with psychiatric conditions such as addiction, impulsivity, compulsivity, delusions, hallucinations, interpersonal personality disorders, ocular motor syndromes, visual neglect, and disorders of interoceptive inference.

5. **Experimental Design**: The chapter concludes with a set of six steps for designing experiments that can be used to test generative models. This is particularly applied to the field of computational psychiatry, where the goal is to understand how abnormalities in belief formation and updating lead to symptoms of various psychiatric disorders.

The chapter underscores the potential of generative models, particularly within the emerging field of computational psychiatry, to shed light on the underlying processes of mental health conditions by bridging the gap between theoretical models and empirical data. It also highlights the importance of considering pathologies as deviations from optimal generative processes.

1. **Diversity of Social Cultures and Norms:** The discussion began with a question about why there is a diversity of social cultures, norms, and standards globally, rather than a singular homogeneous culture aimed at reducing prediction error. This touches on the self-evidencing nature of collective behavior and why different societies develop distinct ways to achieve this objective.

2. **Creativity in Collective Behavior:** A comment was made about the challenge of modeling creativity within systems due to its inherent nature of bringing about something new, which conflicts with traditional mathematical representations that are based on state spaces and predictability. The example given was the comparison between cognitive models inspired by biology (like autopoiesis) and the notion of agency and creativity, which are difficult to model mathematically but central to understanding collective behavior.

3. **Units of Collective Life:** Michael brought up the question of what constitutes "we" in collective behavior. He pondered on the units of collective life, how individuals transition from a sense of "me" to "we," and the stages or processes involved in the formation of a collective identity.

4. **Limiting Beliefs and Language in Collective Discourse:** There was a thought about the language we use when discussing collectives, which may perpetuate certain limiting beliefs and blind spots. The suggestion was made to consider alternative ways of talking about collectives that could help escape these preconceptions.

5. **Enjoyment and Engagement with the Course:** Participants expressed their appreciation for the course so far and acknowledged Aval's coordination efforts. Ben concluded the session by inviting everyone to put on their "student hat" again for the next part of the lecture, signaling a return to learning mode after the open discussion.

Overall, the conversation was rich with insights into the complexity of collective behavior, the challenge of modeling creativity, and the nature of collective identity. Participants were encouraged to think critically about how language shapes our understanding of collectives and to consider the units that make up "we" in collective contexts.

Checking Active Inference Institute/Basics of Active Inference (Lecture) ~ Ben White ~ Active Inference for the Social Sciences 2023.txt
1. **Active Inference Framework**: Active inference is a framework for modeling how organisms use predictions about the world to guide their behavior and perception. It's a way of understanding how agents make decisions, given what they believe about the environment and what they desire or need.
   
2. **Predictive Processing**: This is the idea that the brain is constantly generating predictions about sensory input and updating beliefs based on prediction errors. Active inference formalizes this process by using Bayesian methods to update beliefs and take actions that minimize future prediction errors.

3. **Embodied Agents**: Active inference agents are embodied, meaning they interact with the world through a body, which provides them with specific affordances (opportunities for action). These agents are not just abstract entities but are situated within an environment, influencing and being influenced by it.

4. **Normativity and Affectivity**: Affordances are not just passive opportunities but have a normative aspect, guiding behavior based on what makes sense in context. They also have an affective component, as they can evoke emotions that influence decision-making and attention.

5. **Agency and Self**: Active inference agents possess a sense of self, which is crucial for understanding agency (the capacity to act) and the motivations behind actions. This self-awareness allows agents to plan and execute actions based on their desires and beliefs.

6. **Addiction as a Case Study**: The concept of addiction was used to illustrate how active inference can model complex behaviors, showing that choices are not just determined by rewards but also by the context in which those rewards are sought.

7. **Future Discussions**: In subsequent weeks, discussions will explore how multiple active inference agents interact with each other, how their expectations and beliefs influence one another, and how this framework can be applied to real-world scenarios involving more than one agent.

8. **Engagement and Collaboration**: The course encourages engagement from participants, suggesting that questions from the audience will guide the discussions and potentially shape the direction of exploration in the following sessions.

9. **Expert Input**: Mark Miller, a key figure in the development of predictive processing, will be involved in upcoming discussions, offering passionate and enthusiastic insights into his work.

10. **Further Reading and Exploration**: The course emphasizes the importance of engaging with the original works by the researchers mentioned to gain a deeper understanding of their ideas and contributions.

In summary, active inference provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how agents perceive, act, and learn within an environment, integrating both cognitive and biological perspectives. It's a powerful tool for modeling complex behaviors such as addiction, and it opens up avenues for exploring interactions among multiple agents, potentially influencing fields like psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and beyond.

Checking Active Inference Institute/Collective Behavior (Lecture) ~ Daniel Friedman ~ Active Inference for the Social Sciences 2023.txt
1. The lecture discusses the concept of collective behavior in ecology, evolution, and development (EvoDevo) through the lens of multi-scale systems.
   
2. It highlights the importance of understanding interactions among organisms at various levels, from genes to ecosystems, and how these interactions shape evolutionary trajectories and developmental pathways.

3. The idea of a gene pool versus a birth pool is introduced to differentiate between genetic potential and realized phenotypes influenced by environmental factors.

4. The lecture emphasizes the role of organisms within their environments and how individual behaviors can influence larger ecological patterns, illustrating this with the example of a kombucha fermentation process.

5. A visualization of nested systems is used to describe the hierarchical organization of biological entities, from colonies to cells to molecular components, and how each level affects the others.

6. The concept of renormalization group from physics is borrowed to articulate the scale-dependent nature of these interactions, allowing for a clear understanding of multi-scale systems.

7. The lecture introduces new formalism by Carl to express the lateral interactions among organisms within a given scale of analysis and how they influence the collective behavior of the system as a whole.

8. The concept of nested selves is introduced, questioning what constitutes a self at different scales and how this relates to collective behavior in social contexts.

9. Open questions are presented, inviting further exploration and discussion on topics such as social ecologies, abductive logic, and active inference in various social organizations.

10. The lecture concludes by encouraging active participation in the upcoming discussion session and invites the audience to join a live conversation for an interactive experience.

Overall, the lecture is a call to consider the complex interplay of factors that influence collective behavior at multiple scales, from microscopic to macroscopic levels, and how understanding these dynamics can contribute to a broader comprehension of ecology, evolution, and development.

Checking Active Inference Institute/Conclusion (Discussion) ~ Active Inference for the Social Sciences 2023.txt
1. Athel describes the challenge of developing a coherent theory of nature that accommodates self-affirmationality and the possibility of new things emerging that are not pre-defined within a known set of possibilities. He mentions quantum information theory as an approach that attempts to address this by using transformation groups in algebraic topology, but acknowledges the abstractness and difficulty for humans to grasp these concepts.

2. The FEP (Feynman's formulation of physics) structure shows dimensions of interaction between systems A and B, with a con-cocon diagram representing an agent and their representation. Athel emphasizes that while the math may exist, it is not currently tractable for humans to understand its concrete meaning or to verify its self-consistency.

3. The work ahead involves entangling concrete meanings from the real world with abstract mathematical concepts to create a coherent theory that applies to both physical and social phenomena. This is seen as an exciting challenge, indicating the potential for future developments in understanding the interplay between physics and social sciences.

4. The course has been successful in bridging disciplines, such as Chris Fields' quantum work with social science, showing that these fields are not just juxtaposed but deeply connected within a scale-free first principles paradigm.

5. The plan is to process the lectures and discussions from the course into an open access publication, which will include any final questions and answers. This could be an opportunity for those interested in editorial or curatorial work, as indicated by the mention of the active inference journal.

6. The future of active inference and its integration with social sciences will be a topic to revisit in 2024 and beyond. The course organizers encourage continued interest and contributions to further explore and expand upon the ideas presented during the course.

Checking Active Inference Institute/Introduction (Lecture) ~ Avel Guénin-Carlut ~ Active Inference for the Social Sciences 2023.txt
1. **Variational Free Energy (VFE) and Expected Free Energy (EFE)** are concepts within the predictive processing framework used to understand how the brain models the world and updates those models based on prediction errors. They are mathematical representations of the discrepancy between predictions made by a generative model and observed sensory data, or between different levels of the hierarchical generative model.

2. **Active Inference** is a computational framework that combines Bayesian inference with optimisation to describe how agents make decisions and act in the world. It is used to explain behavior and decision-making processes from a free energy perspective.

3. **Happiness, Wellbeing, Depression, Addiction**: These states can be understood within the predictive processing framework by examining how different conditions affect the generative models of individuals. For instance, depression might involve a model that overestimates the likelihood of negative events, while addiction could involve a model that prioritizes certain rewards over others.

4. **Professor Mark Miller** has contributed significantly to our understanding of these phenomena through his work on predictive processing and neuro phenomenology. His research provides insights into how we can use this framework to better understand mental health conditions and potentially develop new therapeutic strategies.

5. **Prediction Error**: While it is a marker of when an agent's model is updated, it is not always a negative indicator. The resolution of prediction error itself can be beneficial, as it may lead to learning and exploration, which are essential for growth and adaptation.

6. **Markers of Free Energy**: There is no single definitive marker for variational or expected free energy in the brain or body. Instead, these concepts are statistical constructs associated with the performance of generative models. Physiological markers such as heart rate, neuromodulation, galvanic skin response, and cortisol levels may correlate with aspects of prediction error or model updating but are not direct measures of VFE or EFE.

7. **Engagement in Challenging Activities**: Predictive processing can account for phenomena such as playful behavior, creativity, engagement in challenging hobbies, and participation in dangerous sports by explaining how agents actively seek out prediction errors to improve their models, which is a fundamental aspect of learning and exploration.

8. **Course Engagement**: Students are encouraged to participate in discussions, submit questions through the course website, and engage with the material and each other to enhance their understanding of the predictive processing framework. The course will continue to explore these topics over the coming weeks.

Checking Active Inference Institute/Karl Friston ~ Active Inference Insights 001 ~ Free Energy, Time, Consciousness.txt
 In this conversation, the topic of death is explored from a philosophical and scientific perspective. The speaker, Carl, argues that fearing death might stem from it being an unexpected state, one that doesn't align with our personal priors or expectations. He also discusses death within the context of the free energy principle, where the process of returning to the fabric of the universe is seen as a natural part of life's cycle, not inherently negative but rather essential for the evolutionary process and for the memory of the environment (natural selection).

Carl suggests that death can be viewed as Bayesian model selection at an evolutionary scale, where old structures are sometimes discarded to make room for new ones that are better adapted to changing environments. In this light, death is beneficial for future generations, as it allows them to explore and adapt to their world without being burdened by the past.

The conversation touches on the idea that while death might be a loss for an individual who is currently alive and engaged with the world, it serves a greater purpose in the continuity of life and evolution. Carl finds the process of dying as part of the natural order to be something that can evoke awe rather than fear.

The discussion also highlights the importance of constant learning and adaptation, as well as the necessity of sometimes letting go of past knowledge to make room for new insights. The conversation ends on a positive note, with both participants expressing appreciation for the opportunity to engage in such a thought-provoking dialogue.

1. The principle feature of Markov processes, where the future state is dependent only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it, is indeed a fundamental characteristic of these processes. It is not solely a simplification for mathematical convenience; it reflects the underlying nature of random dynamic systems. In complex biological or social systems, this Markovian property can be approximated or appear semi-Markov due to the complexity and structure of the system, which is why we sometimes use these models despite their inherent simplifications.

2. Regarding your question about entropy and energy being depicted differently on the slide, energy here is a non-dimensional quantity, often represented by a lowercase 'e' or without units, while dimensional energy would have units like joules (J) in physics. The distinction arises because in the context of thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness with units of joules per kelvin (J/K), whereas energy is a more general term for the capacity to cause change or work, without units of measurement until specified by context.

3. The equations we solve are not ordinary differential equations but rather stochastic differential equations (SDEs) like the Fokker-Planck equation, which describe how probability distributions evolve over time in a system influenced by random forces. These SDEs can be simplified or approximated to ordinary differential equations under certain conditions. The simulations based on these equations are indeed solving functional equations where the functions could represent belief states or coding states, and they involve gradient flows on these functions.

In summary, while Markov processes provide a useful mathematical framework for modeling decision-making processes, biological systems, and other dynamic phenomena, their application to complex real-world scenarios often necessitates approximations and simplifications. These models aim to capture the essential features of the underlying processes, even if the resulting behavior in the model appears semi-Markov due to the system's complexity.

1. The discussion revolved around the application of different models to break down reality, particularly in social sciences. This involves testing various models (like Bayesian models or DCM-style models) to see which one aligns best with observed data.

2. The conversation highlighted the importance of formalizing how observations map onto the 'carvings' of nature. Social sciences tend to favor a more fluid approach, where reality is not fixed but can ebb and flow, allowing for new phenomena to emerge.

3. A key point was made about the distinction between what we have agency over (our actions and decisions) and what we do not (the external causal model of action-observation links). Our ability to influence observations is indirect and must pass through our cognitive frameworks.

4. The discussion emphasized the evolution of research in this area, from a more qualitative focus several years ago to the current integration of generative models, which has been influenced by advances in AI and machine learning.

5. The presenter encouraged active participation from the audience, suggesting that engagement and discussion are vital for the advancement of social sciences, which they believe is at a pivotal point where interdisciplinary connections can yield significant insights.

6. The presenter concluded by expressing optimism about the potential for groundbreaking research in social sciences if the community actively engages with these models and ideas. They invited the audience to contribute to this exciting field of study.

1. **Modeling and Prediction**: The discussion touched upon the idea that models are not exhaustive or definitive but can still be useful for prediction and decision-making within their scope. Models serve as instruments, and their utility depends on how well they align with the specific practices and contexts in which they are used.

2. **Golden Gate Bridges Analogy**: The conversation used the example of Golden Gate bridges to illustrate how different state spaces can be explored within a general category. For instance, one could model the structural aspects, traffic dynamics, or aesthetic features of such bridges separately, and these models could be combined to create a more comprehensive understanding.

3. **Historicity and Adjacent Possible**: The historical context influences what is currently possible (the adjacent possible) in modeling. Modelers can explore counterfactuals and hypothetical scenarios that may not be true in reality but can still serve practical purposes, like navigation in the desert using a simplified model of the solar system.

4. **Cognition and Practice**: Cognition is deeply tied to specific practices and cannot be understood independently of them. The value of a cognitive system lies in its relevance to real-world activities and the way it informs practice.

5. **Active Inference and Semiotics**: The integration of active inference and semiotics offers a rich framework for understanding how models are constructed, interpreted, and used within communities. However, there is a need for more research at this intersection.

6. **Future Exploration**: The conversation encouraged further exploration into the practical applications of integrating active inference and semiotic theory, particularly in how these concepts can inform model development and use.

7. **Closing Thoughts**: Lorena expressed her interest in continuing to explore the implications of instrumentally realistic modeling within specific contexts and its consequences for understanding complex systems. She also highlighted the importance of considering models as tools that are meaningful within a community of users who have a shared history and practice.

In summary, the discussion emphasized the pragmatic value of models, the interplay between modeling and real-world application, and the potential for further research at the intersection of active inference and semiotics to deepen our understanding of how we make sense of the world around us.

1. **Integration of Higher-Order Beliefs in Active Inference Models**: The concept of "integrated" refers to incorporating higher-order beliefs into an agent's internal model, specifically the belief that one is doing better than expected at prediction error minimization (or free energy minimization). This can influence the affect associated with the agent's experience. The affective inference work suggests that if free energy decreases as expected, it's associated with neutral valence, while improvement beyond expectations leads to positive valence, and worsening results in negative valence.

2. **Recommended Reading List**: While slides from the lectures are available on the BigTable platform, additional reading materials or books mentioned during the lectures will be compiled and made accessible through the Active Inference Journal. The journal aims to maintain a version-controlled, open-source repository of these resources. Contributions to this bibliography are welcome.

3. **Course Continuation and Next Steps**: The course is ongoing, and participants are encouraged to register for the concluding session if they haven't already. Those interested in presenting their ideas or questions in the conclusion session can submit a short video or written message. The format of presentations is open to experimentation, with encouragement for innovation both for current and future audiences.

4. **Final Thoughts**: There were no additional specific thoughts to add beyond the points discussed. The focus now is on continuing engagement with the course material and preparing for the conclusion session, where participants can share their insights or questions.

5. **Closing**: The conversation concluded with a reminder to check the course website for updates on how to participate in the concluding session, including presenting personal insights or ideas, and the open invitation to contribute to the expanding bibliography through the Active Inference Journal.

1. The discussion revolves around the concept of cognitive constraint framework and how active inference under the free energy principle operates to make sense of the world and act within it.
   
2. Modern states have significantly more administrative capacity and affordances, particularly through advancements in writing and information technology, which have been rapidly evolving in recent decades and centuries. These changes have altered the information environment and how influence and cognitive warfare (propaganda and cults) are conducted.

3. Propaganda and cults can manipulate perception and decision-making by modulating the precision of information, creating symmetries that align individuals with state narratives, and controlling the information environment to justify actions or requests for resources.

4. The case of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas is used as a specific example where misinformation and framing can lead to asymmetrical blame assignment and potentially genocidal outcomes. The confusion between Hamas and Palestinian people as a whole, versus the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and the government under Netanyahu, exemplifies how propaganda can frame conflicts in a way that justifies extreme actions against an entire group.

5. The discussion highlights the importance of understanding how information is framed and how it can influence decision-making and actions, leading to potentially dangerous outcomes if not managed carefully.

6. The conversation underscores the complexity of cognitive warfare and its impact on sense-making and action selection within the framework of active inference as outlined by the free energy principle. It also emphasizes the importance of being critical of information sources and narratives, especially in contentious geopolitical situations.

7. The session concludes with a commitment to continue the conversation and a reminder that the way problems are framed can have significant implications for how conflicts are understood and resolved.

1. Avel expressed a desire to understand the concept of a "corn cocoon" and more seriously, sought clarity on where communication protocols or quantum reference frames come from at a physical level. He appreciated the unity between his physical structure and these protocols and acknowledged their role in individuating physical states and meaningful measurement outcomes.

2. Another participant echoed the sentiment of there being a lot to learn from Chris's dense and epistemically rich lectures and emphasized the importance of refining our generative models by exploring uncertainties, asking why certain variables behave as they do, and understanding the implications for our current knowledge.

3. Andrew looked ahead to lecture two, which will delve into the ontological aspects of quantum measurement. He recommended that participants review two papers: "A Holographic Principle View on Black Hole Entropy" by Jacob Bekenstein and John D. Wheeler, and "The Free Energy Principle for Generic Quantum Systems" by Giulio Toninelli and Alessandro Sassolini, which may shed more light on the concept of cone, coco, and diagrams mentioned in the context of quantum measurement and holography.

4. The first discussion session concluded with a reminder for participants to check out the course site for readings that will help prepare for the second lecture. It was suggested that there might be a similar or different format for the next discussion session, which is planned for about a month later, and everyone is welcome to join.

1. **Quantum Measurement and Reference Frames**: In the context of quantum measurement, as demonstrated by the Stern-Gerlach experiment, Alice measures the spin of an electron as being "up" or "down" relative to a macroscopic apparatus that is aligned with Earth's gravitational field. This alignment serves as the reference frame for Alice's measurement. However, if Alice were in a different reference frame, like in free space far from Earth's gravitational field, her measurement would still be valid because it's based on the internal reference frame encoded in her nervous system, not just external physical references.

2. **Contextuality and Semantics**: The contextual nature of measurement implies that the act of measuring affects the system being measured. The semantic content of what "up" or "down" means is determined by the actionable significance it has for the observer—it's not just an abstract concept but something that influences what an organism can do.

3. **Differences That Make a Difference**: This principle, often associated with Gregory Bateson, underscores the importance of action in distinguishing between different states or conditions. If an organism cannot act differently on two things, it cannot meaningfully distinguish between them. The nervous system encodes the differences that are relevant to the organism's survival and actions.

4. **Transcription and Preparation for Next Lecture**: Chris mentioned that the discussion will be transcribed, and Ender will work with others to ensure that the transcript is accurate and helpful for those who wish to prepare for the upcoming lecture on quantum measurement.

In summary, the conversation highlighted the importance of context, reference frames, and internal representations in understanding quantum measurements, emphasizing the interplay between the physical world and the observer's perceptual and cognitive framework.

1. The session focused on how information emerges from communication, with the concept of free energy being central to understanding how agents reduce uncertainty and predict future states. This involves minimizing variational free energy, which can be seen as a measure of prediction error or surprise.

2. The discussion highlighted that achieving unity between different entities doesn't necessarily mean blurring their boundaries; it could also involve increased differentiation (integrated information). Life and cognition operate on a trade-off between these two approaches.

3. Chris Huygens will expand on the concepts of common cause and fine-tuning in the upcoming lecture, which are crucial for understanding how agents align their states through communication.

4. The course is halfway through, with three lectures and discussions completed, and students have performed well on the first midterm exam.

5. Upcoming topics include how agents use multiple communication channels (session four) and the emergence of space-time from communication. The final session (six) will connect these ideas to biology and explore their implications for understanding life and preparing for the future.

6. Participants are encouraged to engage further by submitting questions for Chris Huygens, joining upcoming discussions, and contributing to the publication of the course materials. This is an opportunity for students and interested individuals to be part of a cutting-edge conversation in information theory and its applications to various domains.

Lectures six and beyond will continue to explore these ideas, integrating insights from various fields.

6. **Engagement and Learning:** Chris and Harris encourage participants to engage with the material by looking ahead in the syllabus, reviewing past content, asking questions, and preparing for future lectures. They emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary learning and dialogue to make progress in understanding quantum mechanics and its implications for our perception of time and space.

7. **Appreciation:** Both Chris and Harris expressed their gratitude for the opportunity to present and engage with the audience, hoping that the live streams have contributed to a better understanding of quantum mechanics and its relationship with classical concepts.

In summary, the discussion touched upon the role of quantum error correction in preserving quantum information over time, the foundational aspects of space and time, the development of spatial and temporal perception through biological processes, and the anticipation of further exploration of these topics in upcoming lectures. The speakers encouraged active engagement with the course material to foster a deeper understanding of the interplay between quantum mechanics and classical concepts.

 It seems like we've had a rich and engaging discussion on the active inference ontology and the broader implications of Chris Fields' work in quantum mechanics. Here are some key points and takeaways from today's conversation:

1. **Active Inference Ontology**: This is an approach that combines active inference, Bayesian models, and quantum mechanics to understand how intelligent systems make decisions and learn about the world.

2. **Quantum Mechanics Interpretations**: There's ongoing debate about different interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as many-worlds versus collapse theories. Chris Fields suggests that these debates may be less central once we fully understand the information-theoretic underpinnings of quantum theory.

3. **Pilot Wave Theory and Many Worlds**: These are two different interpretations of quantum mechanics. The pilot wave theory, proposed by Louis de Broglie and developed by Hugh Everett, suggests that particles have definite positions and velocities guided by a 'pilot wave' through configuration space. In contrast, the many-worlds interpretation posits that all possible outcomes of quantum measurements are physically realized in separate "branches" of the universe.

1. **Historical Context and Thermodynamics**: The story begins with the foundational principles of thermodynamics in the mid-19th century, particularly the works of Clausius, Maxwell, and Boltzmann, who laid the groundwork for understanding entropy and energy conservation from a statistical mechanics perspective.

2. **Information Theory and Computation**: The development of information theory by Claude Shannon and others in the mid-20th century paralleled and extended these ideas into the realm of communication and computation, emphasizing the role of information in physical systems.

3. **Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory**: With the advent of quantum mechanics, physicists like Feynman further developed the understanding of probabilities and interactions at the smallest scales, leading to the formulation of quantum field theory.

4. **Holographic Principle and Entropy**: The holographic principle suggests that all information about a system can be encoded on its boundary, much like a hologram. This principle is deeply connected with the concept of entropy and the thermodynamics of black holes.

5. **Free Energy Principle**: The free energy principle emerged from this background, unifying concepts from physics and computation into a framework that describes how systems maintain their identity over time by minimizing free energy. This involves maintaining the integrity of their Markov blankets, effectively acting as agents that interact with their environment to optimize their models of the world.

6. **Active Inference**: The concept of active inference, which is central to the work of the Adaptive and Cognitive Systems Laboratory (ACSL), views every system as an agent engaged in science by constantly updating its model of the world based on observed data and actions it takes.

7. **Quantum Information Science**: The recent integration of these concepts into quantum information science further expands our understanding of computation, communication, and causality at the quantum level.

8. **Course Interaction**: This session introduced these ideas and invited participants to engage in a subsequent discussion on June 3rd. Additional sessions are planned for mid-June, where these concepts will be explored in greater depth, especially within the context of quantum theory.

9. **Future Discussions**: The interactive Q&A platform was highlighted as a venue for continued engagement and learning. Participants were encouraged to post questions and contribute to the collective understanding of the material presented.

In summary, the journey from thermodynamics to the free energy principle and beyond is a rich tapestry woven from threads of classical and quantum physics, information theory, and computation. It underscores the fundamental role of information processing in all aspects of the natural world and highlights the universal nature of agents interacting with their environment through communication and prediction.

1. **Key Points from Lecture**: Chris discusses quantum reference frames, specifically focusing on the problem of alignment between observers in different reference frames. He uses a coin flip analogy to explain the Born rule and the concept of superposition. He also relates this to the free energy principle (FEP), suggesting that FEP drives systems towards entanglement, which is consistent with the principle of unitarity in quantum mechanics.

2. **Quantum Superposition**: When a quantum system is in a superposition of states, an observer cannot determine the state of the system until it is measured. The Born rule provides the probabilities for each outcome upon measurement.

3. **Born Rule and Pythagorean Theorem**: Chris explains that the Born rule can be related to the Pythagorean theorem, where the sum of the squares of the probabilities of the outcomes equals one (the metric distance in possibility space).

4. **Alignment of Reference Frames**: The FEP, when formulated within quantum theory, suggests that interacting systems will behave in a way that aligns their reference frames, leading to entanglement as they communicate and exchange information.

5. **Upcoming Sessions**: There will be an interactive Q&A session on the web and a discussion session on Saturday, July 1st, where participants can engage with the material and each other. The next lecture session is scheduled for July 13th.

6. **Complexity of Alignment**: As systems become more complex, aligning their reference frames becomes more challenging. This complexity correlates with system complexity, which is why simpler systems (like particles) are easier to align than more complex ones (like human societies).

7. **Final Thoughts**: Chris encourages participants to engage in the upcoming sessions and discussion for a deeper understanding of quantum reference frames and alignment, as it relates to the FEP and the principle of unitarity. He also hints at the relevance of these concepts to complex systems in sociology and beyond.

Remember to check out the course syllabus for more information, ask questions through the designated site, and participate in the upcoming sessions and discussions.

1. **Thermodynamic Boundaries**: In thermodynamics, systems are often considered to be surrounded by an environment that can provide energy and absorb waste. The second law of thermodynamics dictates that the combined entropy of the system and its environment cannot decrease over time, leading to the concept of heat death where the universe eventually reaches a state of maximum entropy.

2. **Quantum Mechanics**: In quantum mechanics, the universe is considered an isolated system where information is conserved. Unitarity in quantum mechanics means that information is not lost but transformed, and the notion of entropy is relative to an observer's boundary or division of the system. This perspective suggests that entropy is not a globally definable quantity, which has implications for our understanding of time and causality.

3. **Perpetual Motion Machine**: The concept of a perpetual motion machine is often used to illustrate the limitations of energy extraction within thermodynamics. In classical thermodynamics, such a machine is impossible because it would violate the second law by continuously extracting energy from an environment without increasing its entropy. However, in quantum mechanics, the situation might be different since information and entropy are considered differently.

4. **Information Processing**: The efficiency of a system's information processing is crucial for its survival, especially for biological systems. A system that cannot extract more energy from its environment than it uses to modify its own state will cease to function, effectively 'stopping.'

5. **Environmental Interaction**: The environment can be seen as an agent that interacts with other agents (systems). It can absorb waste heat and perform operations using the energy obtained from these systems, highlighting the importance of understanding multiple interacting agents in a system.

6. **Holographic Principle**: The holographic principle suggests that the information contained within a boundary scales inversely with the area of the boundary (two-dimensional hologram). This principle can be extended to three dimensions, implying that all the physics within a region can be encoded on its boundary.

7. **Markov Blanket**: In discussions about causal relationships and information flow, the Markov blanket of a network includes the nodes connected to it (its parents, children, and itself) and the connections between them, effectively transmitting information within the boundary.

In summary, the discussion touches on thermodynamic boundaries, quantum mechanics' treatment of entropy and time, the impossibility of perpetual motion machines in classical thermodynamics but potential reconsideration in quantum mechanics, the importance of energy efficiency for biological systems, the role of the environment as an agent in a network of interacting agents, the holographic principle, and the concept of a Markov blanket in understanding causal relationships and information flow. These concepts are interrelated and have profound implications for our understanding of physical systems and their interactions with their surroundings.

1. The topic for September, as mentioned by Chris, revolves around the question of how agents, particularly biological ones like organisms, perceive and assign spatial coordinates to their boundaries. This leads to discussions about the evolution of spatial understanding from discrete locations to metric representations (angular, radial) and eventually to a full-fledged geometric space.

2. Chris emphasizes that the concept of rotational symmetry in space is closely tied to the recognition of object persistence. We learn to recognize that an object can maintain its identity through various transformations, including rotation, around a certain point. This suggests a reciprocal relationship between spatial understanding and object recognition.

3. Phylogenetics and embryology are seen as analogous processes. Mike Levin and Chris have published papers suggesting that the lineage of life can be understood in terms similar to how we understand the development of an individual organism from a zygote.

4. The weak rotation in quantum mechanics, which can be thought of as a reversal in the direction of time, is related to the input-output cycle of agents interacting across a boundary. In this context, the flow of time for two agents separated by a boundary may point in opposite directions with respect to each other, depending on which side of the boundary they are on.

5. Chris invites everyone to join the upcoming participatory discussion in about two weeks on Saturday, where they can delve deeper into these topics and engage with others who are interested in these subjects.

1. **Variable Binding and Semantics**: In programming languages, variable binding gives different values to a variable at different times, which affects the program's behavior and actionability, thus defining its semantics. This concept can be applied to understand how semantics work in other contexts as well.

2. **Embedding Theories**: These are theories that describe relationships between systems, such as between a programming language and its operating system. In the context of biology or spacetime physics, these theories help us understand how different scales and systems interact.

3. **Reductive vs. Scale-Free Theories**: Reductive theories often ignore semantics by focusing solely on fundamental scales (like Planck scale in physics), while scale-free theories recognize the importance of semantics at all scales, especially in biological processes where the environment and actionability are crucial.

4. **Functional Engineering Principle (FEP)**: The FEP emphasizes that an agent's model of its environment must be semantic and actionable to increase predictive power and influence the environment effectively. It contrasts with classical views that treat agents as passive observers, which are not tenable in quantum theory or when engaging directly with one's environment.

5. **The Role of Semantics**: Semantics are central to an agent's ability to model its environment and make decisions based on that model. It's not just about what is computed but how the computation relates to the real world and what actions it enables.

6. **Quantum Theory**: Similar to FEP, quantum theory also rejects the notion of a passive observer, highlighting the interplay between observation and reality. This underscores the importance of active engagement with one's environment in understanding its semantics.

 Throughout this lecture, Chris continues to emphasize the importance of considering dynamic processes rather than static structures in both cell biology and quantum systems. He points out that biological observations are snapshots of a much more fluid and dynamic reality, just as protein conformations are not true switches but complex and reversible processes.

Chris also highlights the need to think about larger scales, such as societies, as living systems with their own dynamics. By making measurements and probing actions, we can detect and respond to changes in context or measurement basis. This is analogous to the frame problem in artificial intelligence, where predicting what won't change after an action is a significant challenge.

He suggests that cells might be continuously detecting and responding to their own contexts, but our understanding of these processes is still incomplete. The tension between expecting the expected and being prepared for the unexpected is central to life and will likely continue to inform biological research.

Chris wraps up by acknowledging the audience's engagement and anticipates further questions and discussions in the upcoming final session of this lecture series. He signs off with a warm thank you, leaving listeners with much to reflect on regarding the fluidity of biological systems and their parallels with quantum mechanics.
