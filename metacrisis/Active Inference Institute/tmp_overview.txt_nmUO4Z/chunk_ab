1. **Discrete Time POMDP Models**: We discussed the construction of Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) models in discrete time, which are essential for decision-making in environments where actions have stochastic effects and observations may be incomplete or noisy. The process involves defining the state space, action space, observation space, transition dynamics, and reward function. The POMDP challenge is to find a policy that maximizes expected long-term rewards. Equations 4.13 and 4.14 in the text provide the formal representation of the POMDP problem using vector notation and gradients. For more detailed guidance on constructing POMDP models, the authors recommend consulting the set by step paper.

2. **Continuous Time**: We previewed the continuous time generative model, which is more complex than discrete time models. This part will involve understanding differential equations to describe dynamics and Laplace approximation for variational inference. The key distinction in the free energy principle as used in active inference compared to Gibbs free energy is the application of Laplace approximation.

3. **Generalized Coordinates of Motion**: This concept simplifies models by reducing the dimensionality of state space, which can be particularly useful for high-dimensional problems. The idea is to use a subset of variables that capture the essential dynamics of the system.

4. **Approximate Bayesian Inference**: We will learn how variational free energy minimization can be used for approximate Bayesian inference, allowing us to make probabilistic inferences under uncertainty.

5. **Message Passing**: This is a big topic that we'll come back to later. It involves algorithms like belief propagation and sum-product algorithms for computing marginals in graphical models.

6. **Laplace Approximation Equations**: This approximation is crucial for computing the variational free energy, which is central to the approach taken in the book.

7. **Another Message Passing Representation**: This will be another way to look at the same problem, providing an alternative algorithmic perspective.

8. **Summary**: By the end of chapter four, we should have all the essential mathematical tools necessary for the rest of the book. Chapter five serves as an interlude and is not a direct continuation of chapters one through four but rather sets the stage for what comes next. The first part of the book, which covers the foundational concepts and mathematics, concludes here with a solid grounding in both theory and practice for applying these models to real-world problems.

7.5 introduces learning directly into the generative models within the framework of active inference. This is a significant advancement from previous formulations where learning was not explicitly accounted for. The example provided is a creature navigating a world of black and white tiles, which requires the agent to learn and update its model as it moves through the environment. This scenario illustrates how different components of active inference—such as perception, action, and information seeking—are interconnected.

In 7.6, the chapter explores hierarchical or deep inference, which involves nested inference processes across multiple scales or time steps. The structure learning interlude (boxed off-topic) explains how models can be learned from observable data, which is a foundational concept for understanding deeper models. Figure 7.12 represents a fractal generative model as a component within a larger, multi-scale generative model, showing how lower-level inferences at the leaf level can influence and contribute to higher-level learning and inference processes.

The composability of these generative models is highlighted, with the discrete time model introduced by Toby Sinclair-Smith serving as a foundational motif that allows for the layering of additional features such as action, learning, and so on. This leads to a more nuanced understanding of complex cognitive processes like language learning through reading, which involves multiple timescales from reading individual letters to comprehending larger word groups.

7.13 extends the discussion to language comprehension during reading, demonstrating how the model can accommodate the anticipatory nature of reading by processing words sequentially and building a coherent generative model of the text. This example further showcases the utility of the active inference framework in modeling various aspects of cognition and perception across different scales and time steps.

 Chapter Nine of the OMDP provides an overview of generative modeling applied to empirical data in the context of experimental design and computational psychiatry. Here's a summary of its key points:

1. **Generative Modeling**: The chapter discusses how generative models can be used to explain and predict empirical data, particularly focusing on the intersection between sensory input (like visual or auditory cues) and motor output (like eye movements). It emphasizes the importance of understanding the generative process underlying observed behavior.

2. **Active Inference**: The authors explore how active inference, a framework within Bayesian models, can be used to understand decision-making processes in both normal and abnormal scenarios. Active inference involves agents who make decisions by inference, updating their beliefs about the world based on sensory data and actions.

3. **Isocade Task**: An example of generative modeling is provided using an isocade task, where the model must account for both the visual input (patterns of light) and the resulting motor behavior (eye movements). The chapter compares two generative models of this task, highlighting the plurality of models that can be constructed to explain the same behavior.

4. **Computational Pathology**: The chapter extends the discussion to computational models of psychiatric disorders. It outlines how normal human behavior can be modeled and how deviations from these models can lead to various abnormal behaviors associated with psychiatric conditions such as addiction, impulsivity, compulsivity, delusions, hallucinations, interpersonal personality disorders, ocular motor syndromes, visual neglect, and disorders of interoceptive inference.

5. **Experimental Design**: The chapter concludes with a set of six steps for designing experiments that can be used to test generative models. This is particularly applied to the field of computational psychiatry, where the goal is to understand how abnormalities in belief formation and updating lead to symptoms of various psychiatric disorders.

The chapter underscores the potential of generative models, particularly within the emerging field of computational psychiatry, to shed light on the underlying processes of mental health conditions by bridging the gap between theoretical models and empirical data. It also highlights the importance of considering pathologies as deviations from optimal generative processes.

1. **Active Inference Framework**: Active inference is a framework for modeling how organisms use predictions about the world to guide their behavior and perception. It's a way of understanding how agents make decisions, given what they believe about the environment and what they desire or need.
   
2. **Predictive Processing**: This is the idea that the brain is constantly generating predictions about sensory input and updating beliefs based on prediction errors. Active inference formalizes this process by using Bayesian methods to update beliefs and take actions that minimize future prediction errors.

3. **Embodied Agents**: Active inference agents are embodied, meaning they interact with the world through a body, which provides them with specific affordances (opportunities for action). These agents are not just abstract entities but are situated within an environment, influencing and being influenced by it.

4. **Normativity and Affectivity**: Affordances are not just passive opportunities but have a normative aspect, guiding behavior based on what makes sense in context. They also have an affective component, as they can evoke emotions that influence decision-making and attention.

5. **Agency and Self**: Active inference agents possess a sense of self, which is crucial for understanding agency (the capacity to act) and the motivations behind actions. This self-awareness allows agents to plan and execute actions based on their desires and beliefs.

6. **Addiction as a Case Study**: The concept of addiction was used to illustrate how active inference can model complex behaviors, showing that choices are not just determined by rewards but also by the context in which those rewards are sought.

7. **Future Discussions**: In subsequent weeks, discussions will explore how multiple active inference agents interact with each other, how their expectations and beliefs influence one another, and how this framework can be applied to real-world scenarios involving more than one agent.

8. **Engagement and Collaboration**: The course encourages engagement from participants, suggesting that questions from the audience will guide the discussions and potentially shape the direction of exploration in the following sessions.

9. **Expert Input**: Mark Miller, a key figure in the development of predictive processing, will be involved in upcoming discussions, offering passionate and enthusiastic insights into his work.

10. **Further Reading and Exploration**: The course emphasizes the importance of engaging with the original works by the researchers mentioned to gain a deeper understanding of their ideas and contributions.

In summary, active inference provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how agents perceive, act, and learn within an environment, integrating both cognitive and biological perspectives. It's a powerful tool for modeling complex behaviors such as addiction, and it opens up avenues for exploring interactions among multiple agents, potentially influencing fields like psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and beyond.

1. Athel describes the challenge of developing a coherent theory of nature that accommodates self-affirmationality and the possibility of new things emerging that are not pre-defined within a known set of possibilities. He mentions quantum information theory as an approach that attempts to address this by using transformation groups in algebraic topology, but acknowledges the abstractness and difficulty for humans to grasp these concepts.

2. The FEP (Feynman's formulation of physics) structure shows dimensions of interaction between systems A and B, with a con-cocon diagram representing an agent and their representation. Athel emphasizes that while the math may exist, it is not currently tractable for humans to understand its concrete meaning or to verify its self-consistency.

3. The work ahead involves entangling concrete meanings from the real world with abstract mathematical concepts to create a coherent theory that applies to both physical and social phenomena. This is seen as an exciting challenge, indicating the potential for future developments in understanding the interplay between physics and social sciences.

4. The course has been successful in bridging disciplines, such as Chris Fields' quantum work with social science, showing that these fields are not just juxtaposed but deeply connected within a scale-free first principles paradigm.

5. The plan is to process the lectures and discussions from the course into an open access publication, which will include any final questions and answers. This could be an opportunity for those interested in editorial or curatorial work, as indicated by the mention of the active inference journal.

6. The future of active inference and its integration with social sciences will be a topic to revisit in 2024 and beyond. The course organizers encourage continued interest and contributions to further explore and expand upon the ideas presented during the course.

1. **Variational Free Energy (VFE) and Expected Free Energy (EFE)** are concepts within the predictive processing framework used to understand how the brain models the world and updates those models based on prediction errors. They are mathematical representations of the discrepancy between predictions made by a generative model and observed sensory data, or between different levels of the hierarchical generative model.

2. **Active Inference** is a computational framework that combines Bayesian inference with optimisation to describe how agents make decisions and act in the world. It is used to explain behavior and decision-making processes from a free energy perspective.

3. **Happiness, Wellbeing, Depression, Addiction**: These states can be understood within the predictive processing framework by examining how different conditions affect the generative models of individuals. For instance, depression might involve a model that overestimates the likelihood of negative events, while addiction could involve a model that prioritizes certain rewards over others.

4. **Professor Mark Miller** has contributed significantly to our understanding of these phenomena through his work on predictive processing and neuro phenomenology. His research provides insights into how we can use this framework to better understand mental health conditions and potentially develop new therapeutic strategies.

5. **Prediction Error**: While it is a marker of when an agent's model is updated, it is not always a negative indicator. The resolution of prediction error itself can be beneficial, as it may lead to learning and exploration, which are essential for growth and adaptation.

6. **Markers of Free Energy**: There is no single definitive marker for variational or expected free energy in the brain or body. Instead, these concepts are statistical constructs associated with the performance of generative models. Physiological markers such as heart rate, neuromodulation, galvanic skin response, and cortisol levels may correlate with aspects of prediction error or model updating but are not direct measures of VFE or EFE.
