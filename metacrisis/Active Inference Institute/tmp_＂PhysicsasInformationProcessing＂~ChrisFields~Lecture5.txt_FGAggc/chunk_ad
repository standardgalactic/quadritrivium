So all of this ties together.
Would you say that FEP says semantics is important
and then what does it say about what semantics are important
or is that entirely left up to the modular?
Well, it tells you a lot about what's important
for the system itself, right?
The system itself is dealing with its environment
and it's trying to increase its predictive power.
So it's building a theory of the environment
and that theory is intrinsically semantic, right?
It's about the environment and it's actionable.
The theory is meant to drive action on the environment
that will either yield more information
or get the environment to behave
to do what I'm predicting it's going to do.
So I think the FEP is intrinsically semantic
in that sense that it's about an agent modeling its environment.
Yes, and about the semantics of action
as opposed to a partial or limited semantics
of passive inferiors or semantics of abstraction
which leaves the important link between the agent
and the environment through sense making and decision selection
basically unaddressed because it's kind of
in the thought experiment in the room
and here when we actually engage with the boundary of the room
that's where we start.
Yeah, the FEP completely destroys this classical notion
of the passive observer as does quantum theory.
There are no passive observers in quantum theory.
So this is a construct that we inherited
from a classical worldview that is seriously misleading.
So we have a lot more to say, but that's a great place to end.
Thank you, Chris.
Okay. Thank you, Daniel.
And thanks to you all and ask questions.
See you next time.
Bye.
Thank you.
