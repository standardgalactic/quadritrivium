inference so those were some really cool pieces that was a great discussion
could I just uh just just add something on the topic of creativity that I uh should have said
earlier as well because I think it's really relevant to Regina's question and just the topic of
creative and novel behaviors in general and their active inference I think that
whenever we talk about especially artistic creativity there's a tendency
even even for people who are kind of well very very well borrowed into active inference and
and activism and and these kinds of frameworks from cognitive science I think there's a tendency
to think of creativity as as still like it's almost like the last bastion of internal
cognitivist thinking like you think creativity is something that happens in here and bursts
outwards and so how does that happen with this kind of whatever cognitive architecture we're
positing but there's really very cool work by uh have to give a shout out to Mike Wheeler
who's written some papers on the extended mind and creativity and one thing that's not really
come up very much that I didn't get time to talk about in the lecture is this really nice natural
marriage between the extended mind and active inference something that Andy Clark has been
working on and I know he's gonna gonna be doing a lot more work on it but the claim Wheeler makes
and some others um I think Jana Zalinska has written written a little bit about this as well
is the fact that creativity itself is just as subject to kind of uh material in but the
the sculpting effects of material environments and socio-cultural environments as everything
else is so create creativity is not this kind of romantic with a capital R kind of internal
process that kind of bursts forth but it's creative thinking is just as much extended and
embedded as everything else and there's some really great examples in in Mike Wheeler's
essay um I don't know is anybody familiar with the band Alt J they're a British band they were
kind of really big a few years ago they won the Mercury Music Award because they have a super
original sound so Alt J have this really quiet tinkling uh yeah they are a great band they're
one of my favorites and they have this really quiet tinky sound that everybody kind of assumed
was just the result of some kind of internal genius on the part of the band and as it turns out
Alt J originally they they tried to rehearse as a as an indie rock band but they were confined
to rehearsing in an apartment block and they kept getting noise complaints and so they ended up
developing this quiet tinkly sounds because it was the only sounds they could rehearse that
wouldn't get them kicked out of their apartment and I think this is a really beautiful example of how
like even the most creative processes that seem on the face of it really creative are in fact
just as subject to these external kind of this kind of agent environment system that underpins
the whole framework so it's that's something that's going to apply to absolutely everything
awesome and just a last question people are welcome to to drop off um the next section
that we're heading into I'll be doing the lecture that's going to be in August and it's going to
be on collective behavior so what would people like to learn or focus on about collective behavior
so
anyone who hasn't um spoken or or it can just be a thought question
but I haven't prepared the slides at all so I'm happy to take suggestions
I think what might be interesting is if we're saying that these uh systems are all in the
business of reducing prediction error of self-evidencing why do we see a diversity
of um why do we see a diversity of social cultures of norms of standards at a global scale
why do we not just see some um homogeneous way to reduce picture error which would manifest as
the kind of singular culture which which is in the kind of business of self-evidencing
that just kind of popped my mind cool
anyone else want to give give it that on collective behavior or on any other aspect
otherwise it's been great I'd like to make a comment of creativity
so but uh does anyone like it's a moment if you want to make a comment on the next session
I'm not going to cut that
okay I'd say that to complement what Ben said that creativity is something that is intrinsically
very hard to model because by definition creativity is something that brings about
something new let us say and the mathematics we have to describe physics and life they are
not very good at new things because the most basic tool you have the basic way to represent a system
that literally everyone uses is a state space which is the least of all possibilities of the system
if you say something is creative you're likely to think that it means it can bring about new
possibilities and this intuition it conflicts directly with the very basic use of math
describe it so it is basically the same issues I was referring to all year when I talked about
the comparison between active in France and an activist so let's say activity biology inspired
model of cognition and a core concept historically in those circles is autopoiesis so the ability
of the living to self-create literally this is Greek for self-creation and you had a lot of drift
and concept politicization and ambiguities that were resolved or not resolved and led to the
crisis or frame of blah blah blah but today we talk of autonomy rather than autopoiesis and we
define autonomy as the property for a system of constraints over the activity of a system
to reproduce and and because we're talking constraints just the ability to influence
cause area outcomes there is no really a prior that dynamics in this space would be
conservative so we have a possibility for constraints to you know bring about new things
and reconfigure themselves and the notion of agency ad use is based on that it's the ability to
let's say reconfigure constraints in your environments and so is the notion of creativity
which would be a likely a very close proxy to that but it's something that we do not know how to
advance and most of the mathematics that exist are structurally unable to represent and so yeah
that's a big one
no true
michael
i uh good to be here sorry i was late
what comes to mind for me at the collective you know i mentioned units of collective life
what is it of we is it of we a parent you know but you know what what are the what are the units of
we and any thoughts or insights about that uh that the stages of the emergence of formation
into a collective from a me to a we for example or um oh my god i had one of those on the tip
of my tongue and it's just a statement oh um you know this idea of precision that um that
i think it was part of what we were talking about for matt um saying um you know uh
if there's options in the
looking at collectives and what might be some of the most well understood limiting beliefs about
when we use language of collective that keeps us repeating the same blind spots
and how might we say differently about collective so that we we escape those predispositions
make sense
they'll do what i can do in the solo lecture and i'll i'll look forward to the conversation
where we can unpack it yeah exciting thank you for doing it i'm looking looking forward to it
yeah that's awesome um nate thinner david you want to add anything
all right then thank you all hope everyone is um enjoying the course so far thanks aval again
for for coordinating it and to ben for this great section now you can put on your student hat again
so and to you for organizing thank you see you all next time thanks everyone bye thank you
thanks thanks everyone
you
