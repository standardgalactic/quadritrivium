want to check it out something really special happens when the system models its own reaction
to volatility it starts to learn that um even reactions to volatility uh don't need to be um
they don't need to be compounded up into dangers that it's okay it's okay to be uncertain at certain
levels of the system so how that translates in the business i'm not sure other than i know
tolerance to uncertainty as a marker of business success and um i suspect the framework gonna fit
lots of mindfulness mindfulness work about learning to tolerate uncertainty
is there anything about um the role of language in kind of modulating those metacognitive
oh it's good if i may i was uh preparing an answer on that specifically and i was
nervously waiting for the opportunity so um
like meta in terms of evolutionary um cognitive archaeology we don't know when language emerge
but we do know that's uh let's say an anchoring semantic system so you can build things in
language and you can expect things in the world to correspond to things in language
so for example if you that's abstract as i say it's abstract but you can for example have a
self identity and i'm a french i'm a french and i communicate with the expectation that are
embedded in that identity with other people and that means we communicate over and over so so we
have specific expectation of what we will do and those expectations they become embedded in specific
symbolic markers that are embedded in language and uh something that uh like the thing that it
was strongly evoked in my mind when you talked of tolerance to uncertainty is that um
as far as documented history goes uh europeans well indoeuropeans they are pretty strong on the
idea that things have a nature and they act lawfully and their nature and their laws they
somehow correspond to linguistic categories so i can say stuff like um chickens quack and that's a
proper explanation of what are chicken and why they quack and if you look in chinese philosophy
as far as written history goes you have a much more accent on the way we weigh so um a poor
translation would be a effortless action closer translation would be action without action so
it's a form it's something that is quite close to the phenomenology of flow in that you observe
yourself doing things and you do not apply a conscious effort to uh the flow of what you're
doing and that looks like something that is uh closer to the phenomenology you'd expect if you
apply you know recursive proactive cognition with less or less heavy or more effectively integrated
symbolic concurring like use of language as something that you actually expect to be meaningful
and to uh constrain strongly reactions and marginally i'd expect very strongly
to expect that linguistic categories will map and what you build with it so i don't know self
identities plans whatever uh will map cleanly onto what you observe you will be very very
anxious about things because that does not happen usually um and yeah um besides uh grand discourse
on the interpreter preference traits which are usually not that constructive i'd uh
yeah sorry i got lost because i do not i the speech tonight tonight let me just say one thing
before before we move off this point uh a simple way that language might help is by invoking
cognitive flexibility so um oftentimes we think about the management of error being either updating
predictions or acting on the world those are the that's the dyad usually what it overlooks is the
third one which is we can also manage volatility by redeploying precision in a better way so rather
than just updating your model to fit the world or updating the world to fit your model you can just
change the set of what matters so that you're not you're not really updating the model and you're
not really changing the world you're just changing the problem landscape and that's something language
allows us to do it's maybe one of the one of the really amazing things that language allows us to
do is we can use language to bootstrap that kind of precision adjustment so if the train doesn't
come on time we both notice it okay and we feel bad that's perceptual updating we might go and
get a taxi that's active updating but i might just say to you um wow look isn't that isn't it lovely
that now we get a little bit more time to read our book or to continue our conversation or let's
finish our coffee with a little bit of ease i mean we get an extra 20 minutes now even just saying
that redeploys precision over the problem space now the train being late isn't volatility in the
system the train being late is signaling to the system that a better than expected slope has been
achieved isn't that so interesting the exact same occurrence is either undigestible volatility
right like you're gonna be late oh my goodness or it's an opportunity for an improvement in the
system which is now you get more time with the person that you're um taking the train with
and that was just a matter of linguistic um perturbance of the way that precision is being
deployed so i if you're looking at if you wanted to dig into the research here i would look up cognitive
flexibility and language or coaching cognitive flexibility is such a good point here
if i meant for something um so the uh you have a paper by nick lark on
this specific and coring role of language and something it entails is that basically you got
like if the acting from specter is correct you will flexibly predict the flow in the
interoceptive proprioceptive exteroceptive is that even a thing uh space and that is that is what
build an integrating experience integrated you know um cognition and language it adds another
layer of complexity if you can just talk to yourself in your head that is another dimension
that you can predict and that can be coherent or incoherent with uh you want and so that is
an extremely powerful and coring system because i just have to like tell a plan to myself and boom
that uh pushes me nudges me nicely to follow the plan but then you can have a different level
of meta expectation over how language corresponds to reality and i'd say a very very strong factor of
you know a version to incident is whether you expect your plans or your linguistic structure
to nicely map onto reality because it will not happen but if you expect strongly that it will
be the case you will have to make it happen somehow and here you will adapt rigid strategies and you
will like lose flexibility but also language and sorry for flexibility to be the case in the
first place so it's about coupling between dimension of cognition
yeah and i would just uh just kind of this risk and danger are uh two things that i've been
really interested in across a kind of variety of different contexts and i i would say
some of the things that have been said like the kind of how you can influence the system by
externalizing things through language and the different strategies that systems whatever scale
they're on have that minimize in prediction error um minimize in free energy but also i would just
emphasize the importance of like external context here as well so even in the case of like a
collective like a business you still have to take into account the environment in which the
business is operating and i i've been really interested in a particularly extreme example
of context um i used to do still do some work in philosophy of sport and i've been really
interested in dangerous sports and why there seems to be this insane contextual effect where
within a very kind of narrow contextual band of sporting practice people seem willing to
take on risks that outside of that context would just be completely insane um and i think
this is something that's probably going to come up again again in uh you know subsequent weeks as
well here when we talk about um the way that expectations on an individual or a collective
basis can be set but through other minds uh select patient so what somebody else expect myself to do
and so on and so on uh darius you've had your hand up a while do you want to jump in yes please
i'm not sure this is the sort of grand synthesis of any of this but um flow was mentioned as i say
that's the kind of um pet topic of mine and something that we know about flow and this
why it's integrated into this idea of language and agency is that at least in its original
conception success mahali and the sort of qualitative experience associated with flow
you would find stuff like not only the dilation of time but also the reduction in self-consciousness
and now this is sort of picking up a lot of work that happens at ucl and people like jeremy
skipper how integrated languages into the sense of self and it seems to me and i you know this is
kind of shooting from the hip that all of these very deep rooted i guess they're kind of psychotechnologies
the self language seem to dissipate at this goldilocks zone at this point of at the at this
edge of criticality at this flow state which makes me think if the flow state is a phenomenological
option of being you know optimally reducing prediction error what is the kind of role
of the concept of the self or linguistic functions because it seems to me that that
becomes a regulatory function when that optimality is reduced when stuff starts going wrong um so i
think you can also think about this in the kind of heideggerian or drafus sense of just opening a
door you only start to represent the door in yourself you only give it the linguistic
object of a door when you can't open it when you open the door standard there is no representation
going there i mean you could do the argue there's no quality at that so i'm wondering how deep that
runs and what the kind of what we can say about the role of agency selfhood maybe even consciousness
because they don't seem to be that prevalent at least from my understanding
when we are at the edge of criticality the suggestion you're making there is um
it sounds like what you're saying that these things you call them psychotechnologies which i
really like you know like language and and and self like certain aspects of self modeling they are
a kind of scaffolding uh or like a ladder that you then kind of gets kicked away once you reach a
certain kind of edge of criticality like where the performance becomes i don't know what you kind
of want to say there but you're performing at such a level that you just don't need those those
scaffoldings yeah or the self regulatory mechanisms that we harness when we're not in flow
are linguistic or agentic in essence and once yes once you sort of you don't need that when
you're the sort of yes when you're at this edge of criticality um and i you know i only
postulate that because i want i'm only i'm only thinking how deep does that go because i know
obviously the the active inference framework is trying to tackle in some ways the hard problem
as well and there are some floatations of the idea at least within the flow community about
the kind of i don't want to say elimination but the moderation the modulation of qualia
under flow states so could that could we also consider that to be a construct
which happens when we're not necessarily
at optimally you know producing prediction error so a couple of things i so i'm certainly not the
person to start talking about consciousness so i won't um but i would just um i one of some of the
readings that i mentioned in the lecture might be interesting for you on this topic so if we're
if we're talking about certain structures that seem very very pervasive in our phenomenology
and how those structures can sometimes kind of dissolve away um and how that might be
accounted for under an active inference framework there's some really interesting work on psychedelics
by george deen and some of george deen's uh co-conspirators i know i know mark
and sam welkinson worked on a paper with george so george deen's done some work on
kind of ego dissolution and certain kinds of experiences um related to selfhood um kind of
and i i kind of don't want to overstep the mark i but i think they kind of come they fall generally
under this kind of rebus model of um psychedelic efficacy so i don't know if people are familiar
with this but this kind of finds a natural articulation through predictive processing
and hierarchical self-modeling and and that kind of stuff i also wanted to really quickly flag on
this topic i'll find the paper and i'll put it up on the coda because i don't think i'll be able to
find it quickly enough now but there was a paper that came out very recently um that showed the
efficacy of um internal self-talk on sports performance so there were so they did a they
did an experiment with cyclists and they found that when you um when cyclists were allowed
to engage in kind of constant self-talk with them so like an inner monologue in their head
their their performance at cycling was like measurably boosted which i thought was really
interesting and kind of relevant here so but it's it's interesting because it kind of just kind of
uh it sounds like it might prima facia be in tension with what we were saying about flow states
as well right so it's if if the real edge of performance is is a place where these structures
of phenomenology phenomenology bleed away um it kind of calls into question like to what extent
are these psychotechnologies effective and in what way are they effective and yeah there's a yeah just
a whole kind of universe of really interesting questions there so if i may uh serve food indirectly
will be the the central topic of the last two sessions uh my position about it is that it's
self-food in a sense we use all of the time uh is a quiet high-level construct that
emerges from the ability we have to compare our activity to a socially embedded model of our
activity so that is something that is quite specific to humans because of their linguistic
ability and or because of their tendency to what tomasello calls a shared intentionality so the
ability to collectively define and like plants um so basically this is something that enables a very
deep very um profound and robust transmission transmission of cultural knowledge and transmission
of norms this is what enables the construction of norms uh but it's quite heavy cognitively uh and
it is predictable that if you're busy comparing what you do to what an idealized idealized version
of yourself is doing you're gonna invest less cognitive energy in actually doing the thing
that you would if you just you know did a thing so i'd say you have a pretty direct entailment of
the uh this flow thing uh from this model
yeah yes this is my question sorry um i think so we've run uh almost 30 minutes over time
and i know uh marks marks had to go and i'm gonna have to go very i think i'm pretty much have to go
so um i just wondered if anybody has any final kind of quick questions or comments maybe we
can move towards wrapping it up um i'll i'll i'll make a few comments but then you you're
welcome to leave and other people welcome to stay um if they would like so thank you for
yeah yeah well first um just on a on a on a logistical note there was a little bit of lag
so i'll encourage everyone who's listening as well as who's participating that we eventually
plan to as with all of our live streams develop a transcript which will be curated and published
and eventually not so far away in the future that'll be enabled with speech modeling to generate
podcast quality audio so the future will be smooth we promise um but a few really interesting
pieces that i that i picked out while i was embodying and listening
um so Regina you you opened the discussion with the discussion with uh surprise and creativity
and indeed it sounds like it's going to be attention how how can a framework who's imperative
is bounded surprise as opposed to say maximized reward how can a framework who's imperative
is surprise minimization and bounding be used to generate novelty and i felt like
people provided a lot of really cool answers and one other thing it reminds me of is uh
doug hoffstetter's notion of spec spec dishnish i don't know how do you pronounce it but sph
ex ish n e s s and it's the specs wasp and so he says well forget this whole creativity thing
because when we talk about creativity it's like some sort of you know pantheon like
divine status the muses have to be uh you know called in and so then oh that's not real creativity
and this isn't real creativity so instead he says well let's just focus on what would be the opposite
and that would be the road procedural following even when there's an opportunity for what we would
call creativity and then there's a continuum so why does somebody paint that painting well why
didn't they invent a new genre well why didn't they invent a new media and so all activity is
existing within this continuum of creativeness which has many features such as generativity
and productivity but also novelty but a bounded novelty it's not creative to knock the chessboard
pieces off in a way that there might be an elegant chess move who only somebody in a
certain cognitive setting could detect the aesthetics of but i think that that was awesome
um and then the second uh piece that really was was powerful was what mark uh mark's train
the i guess the trains don't run on time where mark is but but that's okay because he was able
to rather than treat that as an undigestible surprise that was able to be basically cognitively
metabolized into like an opportunity for friendship through language as a social medium and then
he connected that to cognitive flexibility and coaching and then I thought about self-talk
and our inner monologue inner voice and then Darius that that was very um provocative that
like we aren't having self-talk potentially not even having a self in the flow manifold
experience of a self or the the speech self self-talk or again potentially even the total
actual self as a technology and so then like wealthy self-talk would guide us to the flow
and be kind of like a self-limiting technology because it would be like used in order to not
be needed to be used which is kind of how we would hope adaptive technologies would be
versus a maladaptive technology would be something that um entrenches its own utilization
potentially at the expense of the functionality kind of like doom scrolling status but that's
internal rumination and those are the kinds of things that people have simulated in active
