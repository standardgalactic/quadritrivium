of VFE and EFE. However, I think it's a little bit of a map territory situation. And one that's
going to come up, I am sure many times in our course. Great. Well, I'll just remind people to
go to the course website to review the syllabus and also encourage everybody to submit questions
through the course website. All of the teachers will review the questions and will give the best
answers we can. And also please, from all backgrounds, we would love to hear your voice
in the discussions. So thank you again, Ben and Avel. See you next week. Bye.
