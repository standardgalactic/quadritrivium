and then the social organizing question yeah and and the way like technology is also in that
tangle and yeah someone pointed out like this is not a new problem and uh but then it's like well
what parts are new and then what's our model by which we're saying that it's like new or two
individualists or two collective on what scale what if they're like really collectivist at this
scale but not at this scale or another an example of an ambiguous or at least like um poly poly
submits phenotype of colonies is in some colonies there's partial reproductive activation
of like non reproductive nests and that has often been modeled from like a position of like
zero is the law and how are they cheating above this but it's also been approached from a
colony level strategic bed hedging so without super deep knowledge of really some of the specifics
of the regularities that that colony algorithm had to persist for so long and to have gotten swept
off the table if it was even it's like that's that's a very integrated problem so it helps you
approach collective systems and and learn about them but it's like there's a lot to say about
humidity loss in foraging and humidity loss isn't even the whole picture and human foraging is a
lot more sophisticated from just like a perception cognition influence perspective
so those are just some ant related thoughts but it's it just centers a lot of discussions that
really matter and I think the really interesting piece is not always in the way that they're
thought to by some yeah and it's and it's very hard to get any kind of
cross pollination or to see cross pollination uh studying one agent it's it's quite for at least
in my mind very difficult to kind of generalize things across different agents and it starts
getting a bit uh yeah tricky to infer one collectives and uh how and why and and how
they survive and how another agent does it's tricky so I'm almost just kind of an agent
human beings as hard as they are to study and just try and run with it as far as possible
yeah otherwise it's just information overload
body's a complex place too and digital technology virtuality these are such um
richly developed topics in the social sciences I only know the tiniest amount from
but I think that through participation and inclusion in collaboration and in conversations
and everything there's going to be a lot of interesting connections and paths um and
and it's being approached seemingly uh multiple layers like within the the two layers that just
we can focus most narrowly on it's like within the realm of science what is science which is
kind of like playing this other um role with inertia in some people's minds and in systems
what is science who gets to decide what social sciences I don't know I'm I'm not in social
science but it's system of interest in society and certainly I'm a part of that um so it's like
what is the what is good technically what is social scientific and then what is that social
scientific how does that going to interface into the the metaphysical questions and and the normative
ethical and um decision making with trade-offs and the real reflexive complex decisions that matter
also while recognizing this increasingly nuanced way of thinking about different social intelligences
what's any other random thought or curiosity about collective behavior
one point that I would have added into the uh lecture was just that in distributed systems
whether as modeled or as such all behavior is arising from interactions local to individuals
even if it's sent through some wireless mechanism it's like all about the local interactions
and so that is a an arising type process that gives the modeler like one hands-off layer
at least if not much more another nice feature about them um they are in a way
waiting to be composed because they intrinsically contain like at least two layers of consideration
now whether there's kind of like a forcing function of one layer and just sort of dangling
a bottom layer or whether there's a lot of what we would call emergence or discussive in in that way
like that more arising function can be modeled but in either way then you can kind of wrap
that two-layer system and then compose them so that's like what enables in certain situations
like parallelization or at least you know that's obviously a big area but that's what allows multi
agent simulation frameworks to do well on certain very challenging
sense making and action selection problems not by guarantee or default because any given
slicing and dicing of any given um prompting of information may not help you adapt
but there are paths that do and don't help persist or not and that's this kind of persistence
starting place that we began with Sasha um can I really resonate with what you mentioned about
the local interactions that even if information is transmitted over long distances then the agents
behave in a way that is locally relevant and integrates that information and it actually
makes me think a lot about the like psychology therapy angle that while you try to get information
about persons like um sort of local environment and behavior um or like perhaps you know demographics
and age that um their informational environment and like wealth of what kind of information they
consume might also be really telling about their uh psychological and like behavior interactions or
pathologies um and then to bring it kind of full circle back to um that the researcher is part of
the ecosystem that they are uh studying um yeah I I think it's just um such a difference in
perspective to see that as like a positive and a gift that um the way that you would design and
run an experiment today is not the way that you would do it two years from now with more experience
and so um that is a a a benefit and like a bonus in the system and not um like a negative
perspective of bias that it's detracting from some underlying uh truth or reality
so just a few thoughts
oh very interesting anyone want to add something
I think we didn't fully resolve this early question about the umvelte um term from ethology
behavioral research observation science uh using the term to describe the world as its experience
by a particular organism I think a few different pieces and there's a lot of discussion in discourse
or just just to give it like a super short overview the world we might connect to world
modeling and there's a lot of interesting work in all kinds of different like pros focus on
qualitative systems as well as some artificial or synthetic intelligence world modeling as it
experienced as it is experienced is one of the sticky and deep ones because this is the area
phenomenology and so this is like a kind of semi-eternal discussion point so whether whether
active inference delivers on world modeling is kind of empirical and just plain whereas as it
is experienced is going to be a philosophical question and then by a particular organism
that specificity we get by actually making the generative model even if we're just speculating
about it it's like talking about experience without an experiencer would be like talking about um
some agent's behavior without reference to its niche and then where there is like that complex
negotiation I think the humanities and a lot of the social sciences have identified a lot of the
structural top down and also the personal bottom up motifs of of things being
blurred and made complex and so I think part of the social and the scientific as
coming only from scientific side is like to to meet in a third space and or at least make it work
to have a mutual compromise where it's like
certain social science social oriented claims based upon this scientific measure
that is going to be a judgment call but understanding that conversation where is it a
mutual compromise and like what dimensions not simply along the kind of like rigor accessibility
or implications axis there's just very many things in play in these iterated relationships in ecosystems
like having a researcher as part of the ecosystem well what is it here's here's the forager question
you see the nested on the ground it's a forager but then we step back it's like okay well it's foraging
and then that's the allocation of the forager then it's foraging is still part of this sense
making is generative sense making with like process understanding even of a trace which is something
that Bruno Latour and others have have explored with like following a trace in a social setting
and using that to to trace networks so in our digital ecosystems though our information ecosystems
is not research happening and so what what does that really mean and then what what are those
social normativeities there's going to be like a meeting or a handoff with with where that really
is happening or maybe it's a knocking on the door that's ignored or it could be whatever
metaphor in that setting it actually is there's no general metaphor because that'd be like oh what's
the general metaphor on this experiment which experiment just the general action that we play
the sake oh hard to say
okay well in our last like actions I guess if anybody types a question live chat we'll look
at it otherwise what are any other thoughts or like what what can we learn more about about
collective behavior or what will it mean for our sense making decision making if we understand
collective behavior better
you
what else are people excited about for the rest of the course
like based upon the sections that we've done so far
and and how we can even even start to approach this in an acknowledged limited finite way
yeah Sasha then than anyone else
I just added a question to the very bottom of the notes and it makes me think about
how working on this document collaboratively throughout the last hour we're able to
kind of leave a stigmatic trace of things we've discussed and what sort of traits or practices
should individual humans I guess I should specify humans should be embodied in order to improve
cohesion in collective behavior it makes me think of certain psychology
traits or descriptions of like openness or conscientiousness
what will make individual humans better participants in collective behavior
yeah I think to to add to that to just emphasize the importance again only with human agents
specifically who have the capacity to think and reflect and the only ones that have that those
really advanced capabilities that we know of as yet but to really kind of leverage
in order to make the collective better there's a responsibility on the individual
despite being part of a collective and on many different on many different fronts to be able to
leverage and utilize their own internal states and what they have learned and to be able to think
to retain the individual the individual's mind and think about the collective I think is so
important if the collective is to become healthier Sasha to your point and to improve its
you have to become more conscientious and become more responsible or whatever that might be
so to always try and maintain a thinking
self is crucial in words you can very easily be usurped into the collective as is
if you just go on any social media media platform you will see
individuals rarely thinking
for themselves and seemingly kind of just purely in each other and that causes massive problems
so an individual mind is strikes me as being just the most important thing in the future going forward
yeah this dialectic with individuation and collectivization as these like ongoing
negotiated compromises that can be also viewed many ways however they are
cognitive science coming into play
maybe historical processes or philosophies were
used in many settings for
even approaching these kinds of social questions and now with computer science and technology
it even like is a discussion more about the capacities of measurement and action
not that those are new in and of themselves like but thinking like a state like the development
of the apparatus the development of the social social systems that can be run on on open source
hardware open source software things like that so I don't know if something's generalized across
all such groups but understanding what environments at least initially things are beginning at
is just a realist starting point probably no guarantee since most things slash all things
are swept off the table in their specifics anyway so and how to deal with that kind
of like skin on the line type of decision making is very interesting how it's pursued
in the in the sciences because often like many runs are presented or that kind of like like
catastrophic failure mode of models is is not considered just like part of the training starting
naive so just the way that different social considerations are converged upon it's never
it's not like reduced to one feature of the social because the social is such an open space
as a scientist always impressed by how that writing could kind of open up
the um situations which are like mundane but also of course very deep and meaningful
also though mundane
you
any other thoughts or otherwise uh on on collective behavior or on the social sciences
course or anything otherwise people can have any last words if they want
yeah awesome thank you all for participating David want to add anything
yeah well i look forward to uh more questions being asked on the course
website and everybody's um engagement with the course is very much appreciated
so keep up the collective thanks for my scale learning and it's it's a fun course really happy
that we could have done this session and very happy to have concluded the session
all right thank you bye bye bird ciao
you
