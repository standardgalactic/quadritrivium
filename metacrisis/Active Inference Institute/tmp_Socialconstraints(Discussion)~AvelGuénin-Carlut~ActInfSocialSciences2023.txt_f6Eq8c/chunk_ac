they were asked weeks ago so there is a relatively low likelihood that going
over that again would be very helpful why do you think we can cut the discussion
cool but the important things that are not treated now can be treated in conclusion anyway
okay so what are the next steps then for the course
next step is a lot of people register for the presenting in the conclusion session
I haven't gotten any specific responses or like titles yet
okay so we see people do that
yeah we can write write another message
um including even a short video message or just a written one and then also ask specific people
also if anyone is like interested to present something but they're not really sure the format
or they want pre-recorded or just kind of exploring and seeing what the people who are
following along live want to do and also trying out things that we think futures will want to do too
so if someone has an idea on that we're definitely open to it
any last thoughts
nope i'm good cool all right thank you then see you have all
so bye
