nature is good and then you have a recursivity in accounting what is good and what is not
and I do not see um straightforward analytical way to resolve the semi-quity
I said circularity or equity both apply
yeah so I think Evan Thompson has worked nuts and may have a much better
answer to how we relate theories of being entries of ethics oh very loud did actually
yeah I guess my sort of short answer would there there would be first just
we would have to hear a lot more even possible perspectives but without even hearing them can
at least maybe say that there is an articulation and a meter stick as an instrument and this kind
of goes actually to that question about the base spaces and what is precondition so
in what ways is the meter stick um
articulate with downstream
ethical frameworks what ought to be done it was just normative more broadly
um there's downstream decisions that the meter stick is agnostic to
and then the meter stick is also a social result that is itself downstream of other
norms and constraints biotic abiotic constraints regularities of space time
would say there is um what we can do with a theory of sensemaking be it active in
France or in activism is to um like just describe what we mean by normativity and ethics what are
the underlying natural processes when I say natural it would mean the opposition to social
those processes are biological and social at the same time and
that that may bring reflexivity or distance to account of normativity that may prove
prove some of them incoherent or ill advised that will not give you a solution to what is
ethical and what is not notably because like the most natural way to derive ethics from
something like an activism or something like it in France is that you both those framework
are centered around the biological individuation so you may say that logical individuation is
good actually that sounds sensible but then the question is biological individuation for whom
because you are the right I guess our desire will at least to exist but so does cancer cells
within your body who trumps who I don't know not from a pureness with your content there is no
like there is no way you can straight forwardly and magnificently derive a prescriptive notion
of good from any physics any descriptive account of the world you will have when you do when you
make normative claims you have goals because you are living thing and because of active inference
slash activism we know that cognition is a very no activity in the autonomy in the biological
activity of the agent so the theory that you are framing is in some way motivated even if you
don't know how or at need that it is and then I'd say from there it does not quite destroy the
project of an objective system of ethics but it makes it much harder to defend
so yeah I'd say you can derive a lot of negative results from descriptive theory of
like I would not say ethics because ethics are not descriptive but descriptive theory of how
ethics come to be I would say that it is hard if not impossible to derive
um like positive results if someone tried to do it I I'd like to see what this is
wow thank you Advil that last piece was very interesting many results many
many ant colonies with their behavior to model many real situations to understand social constraints
and norms in instrumentally with descriptions that are then in the discussion section of the paper
and the data are the data and those are the descriptive aspects it's a different kind of
data in a slight way but there's already enough to describe and interpret from what would be
merely described and it is very hard to derive positive
results first it's a hard domain to make positive results in not not just ones that make people
feel good but by positive like positivism like um justified true assertions about a
metaphysical space so it's hard to derive positive results about normativity and the
kind of areas that this person asked these are all areas that are um
and it's hard to use a quantitative theory which is almost it's an abstraction or it's just one
language it's hard to use that to make positive results external to the system harder to make
external to the system positive results internal to the system are dime a dozen but then to really
make that reflexive loop that you described between the um the what is and what what we expect and
prefer which is actually woven up in an interesting way in act inf rather than two kind of diverged
timelines like what we quote expect to happen like a prediction of the likeliest future
and then a second timeline that's like well what what I would really prefer to be doing
in act inf the agent just has one expectation slash preference
which loads up on the pragmatic value but that gives a unified approach towards
one's expectations of how things will be and what they expect slash prefer them to be
I would say that that uh vibe check level uh active in France flows well with the idea that
empowerment is good actually but make it a formal relation would be uh quite hard
you could say that uh in France vibes well with the notion that everyone knowing their place is
good which is quite the opposite so I don't see uh an ambiguous relation between active in France and
any um ethical framework I can think of I would say again that it uh like flows well with uh
virtue ethics framework because of the relation between uh one's action and was nature according
to active in France nature being here in a certain term that is like maybe not the best term but like
I'm literally using a production of uh before christ texts so yeah nature is not that bad
just not what we mean uh in the context of 1920s discussions
yeah that's a very complex topic with definitely a lot of rich work on like
our cities and people nature are humans animals and uh that sort of
homo sapiens type discourse and then how does active inference frame the relationship with the
niche in terms of entanglement or communication or co-action intra-action communication and
influence through blanket what where does that go beyond just describing
it doesn't have to I think a sort of base level and what you refer to here is like
that artifact the product of the work which is what the work is about can be a jumping off point
or other directions and so the work of active inference modeling can be in what it leads to
it's not always internal to the model that the improved awareness or better decision is realized
I can see one quite straightforward and I don't think it is entirely broken
way to relate ethics to active inference is uh ethics
like not ethics normativity as a social phenomenon it is a collective phenomenon
about social relationships and you could apply a descriptive theory of human behavior
and like human social aggregated collective behavior to find out what traits in us organization
are prone to survival or adaptivity and you could say that those traits are good actually
by construction of what we mean by ethics that could be a coherent claim
and then you could be interested in what traits make organization
durable but I this is the only logically straightforward way I see but that would like tend to
identify as good things that I would not see as good like feudalism it leaves quite a long time
well feudalism let us say
old school empires with no claim to representations or power by the what do you say populace
and you could integrate
you could basically um renormalize this theory not around uh clock time but around
I don't know a metric of lifetime how much things happen within the organization
and then you'd start having something that is less obviously wrong
and you could have basically ethics be
about optimization of specific parameters that can be addressed by a descriptive framework
but you'd have to make a lot of jumps to get there and while I do not see an obvious problem to that
it is very possible that we would not like the conclusion of such optimization thing
and again if you want to model something you have to decide what are the parameters of interests
and you can be wrong about that so here again you do not have an ambiguous even at a purely
descriptive level you do not have an ambiguous application of anything to anything
would say that more empowerment is good actually
and I would say these goals at a many nested scales of organization
and I would say it has somehow something to do to the physics of biological inviduation but
only in a vibe check way
nothing wrong with that um yeah especially with some of the recent work
like the variational synthesis with eco evo divo
and the connections between the statistical concepts of persistence or thickness
from free energy principle related to to remeasurement of the observer or the organism of themselves
that concept of repeated measurement being compatible in our work and and in other related
works basically with fitness if there's a height distribution of trees in the forest
and then a certain time point later the height distribution is the same
that was stabilizing dynamics we could say stabilizing evolution or stabilizing selection
and if it moved it moved
and so how do since there is such a coupling between things being as they are and basically
what the distribution of what is there is described both this stoic way but also this
kind of evolutionary biology way so does active inference offer any
other or complementary perspective other than just the kind of strengths and weaknesses of the
of using fitness
phenotypic fitness or memetic fitness as its own justification
to say that is to say that something is good because it exists this is not a strong position to take
so this is why you'd have
quite high level of difficulty to
derive anything prescriptive for anything descriptive but the function is not the same
you can make relation between the two no ethics is purely
blind about nature no third of nature is purely ethically
unmotivated but to have a formal relation between the two is probably not possible at least highly
non-trivial
okay so to kind of close on this question
how does a free energy principle as a principle for everything and active inference as an implementable
framework for applying free energy principle systems how does that articulate with these broader
very
deep and fundamental human social contexts short answer seems to be
it's a lot like other scientific ideas inherits a lot of their
challenges and frictions and and situations also there appeared to be some interesting
promising routes or themes to weave in however even with a very charitable or optimistic interpretation
there seem some in principle challenges with these areas that make certain kinds of claims perhaps
not even within the proximate understanding we have of active inference
but people should totally write in the live chat or add comments and stuff I mean it's just
interesting question okay
or higher order beliefs about doing better than expected at PEM probably prediction
error minimization integrated into the architecture of the agent's internal model of external dynamics
and itself in those dynamics my thought here is that we have prior beliefs to fulfill
certain self-evidencing expectations e.g. homeostatic predictions but how do those interact
with these higher order predictions which appear to my mind to deny or negate the fundamental
priors insofar as they predict the agent to go over and above the levels of prediction error
minimization which otherwise might be achieved by fulfilling those fundamental priors
they gave their thought let's return to the original question
I do not know how like I know that
comparison to a baseline homeostatic level of prediction error minimization is a
quite important thing in a traditional psychiatry let's say in the work of Parxomes
I do not know how that's implemented actually in computational models
so I'd rather not answer personally Ben White should be more informed about these things
yeah maybe you know well
I mean the word that seems to be doing the work is integrated
so higher beliefs about doing better than expected at prediction error minimization
or we can just say free energy minimization so this was explored in the affective inference
work so if the free energy was decreasing as expected it was associated with neutral valence
if things were improving better than expected it was associated with positive valence
and if things were doing worse than expected it was negative valence
so because of the ability to make hierarchical active models and just hierarchical Bayesian
models in general it is possible to talk about these beliefs about beliefs metacognitive beliefs
so it is possible to make models that have expectations about how well even an optimization
process is going to go and then a computational psychiatrist or whatever may associate that
with the affect how is that integrated into the agent's internal model of external dynamics
well the shortest answer is to sketch it out how one sees it and then it becomes either there or
not but just in general if the internal model includes these higher order beliefs about doing
better than expected then that's the agent's generative model that then interfaces or articulates
with external dynamics so you could have some environment that has a environmental regularity
or dynamics or that are influenceable or or not and then you could deploy two agents one of them
that has the baseline generative model and the other one has this doing better than expected
layer that the questioner is asking about and then they can do parameter sweeps and
maybe adding this higher order belief increases the state's base a lot and so it increases the
computational costs a lot but some interesting pockets of behavior are found or the behavior
in that setting ends up looking the exact same but in another setting it would have been different
a lot of these questions point towards very important modeling questions which can basically
only be pointed at because so much is going to depend on what the actual model is
okay um
where can I find the recommended reading list mentioned in the lectures
um
so where we have the um slides from the lecture they're in live streams just go to the big table
and find the slides if you find a lecture that doesn't have slides just let us know we'll we'll
add it um where things were just mentioned in the lectures that's a great question and our
goal at the active inference journal beyond just transcribing and publishing and adding
captions and translating and everything of these live streams we would like to also do
more bibliographic work so that the books that people mention we can also have in that open
source versioned journal so we generate the first version of the transcript people update
and improve it oh what was the name of that author what book are they talking about here
and then we can actually have a unified bibliography section or the streams so
if that sounds interesting to you and you'd benefit from it then surely many many others
will too so if you're excited to do that kind of active inference journal work
I highly encourage slash recommend it
about what else will you add
same what I kind of nothing to other yeah
yeah okay well
we can look at some of the other questions that were added that others
wrote people in live chat can add question or they can go to the course website and
ask a new question
do you want to
look at one of the previous ones or
do you have any other just thoughts you want to bring up
not really the first ones were un-squared so I don't like and they are they were
