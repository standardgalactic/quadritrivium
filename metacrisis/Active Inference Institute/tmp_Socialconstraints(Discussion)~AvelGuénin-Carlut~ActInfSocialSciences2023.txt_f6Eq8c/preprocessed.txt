Hello. Welcome, everyone. It is October 25th, 2023. We're in active inference for the social
sciences. And today we're in a discussion section. It is Avel and I. And we'll start off by just
saying hello and kind of reflecting on where we're at with the course. Then we have the
questions form that is on the course website. It's in the video description. Feel free to submit
questions via this form. And then today, we're going to look at the questions that have been
submitted and not answered yet. And we'll just give some thoughts on them. Also look for more
questions to arise in the live chat. So with that, what do you want to begin with? Avel, feel
free to give any kind of overview or statements. And then we'll jump to the specific questions that
have been submitted before today and during today. The only statement here that I want to make is
the last presentation I did. So prediction cause constraints to exist would be our wealth.
Sorry about that. But I really don't have anything to
say that she's more specific right now. All right. Well, this should be pretty fun. Let's
jump into some questions. Okay.
What are the challenges and potential solutions in using active inference to model
collective behaviors with various environmental constraints?
So the challenges first is that in any model, you have to pick what you include and what you
did not include. So when you talk about boundary conditions, when you talk about including the
model, you have to make hypotheses. Like if I tell you model, I don't know country that is under
sanctions like North Korea or Russia. Okay. How do you model that? Do you make a set base for
every possible product? Like every dimension accounts for a specific product or a type of
product and you have zero if you have access to it. Sorry, zero if you don't have access to it and
one if you have access to it. Okay. But what if we have new things that happen that is not very
useful if you're interested in innovation or something. So we'll have to make specific
points that we'll try to specific questions that you want to ask the model and using active inference
has no like does not change a thing to that. And where it is relevant is that
you can have endogenous evolution of constraints using active inference. I
think in a more meaningful sense than you'd have with a pure, let us say, Hebbian or like
non representational framework or framework that is presentational, but where the space
presentation is like hard-coded. So there is a space of models, let us say, of evolution of
certain norms where I think active inference would have an edge because active inference is
built to represent normativity and intentionality and it is not the case to my knowledge of other
like either dynamicist or cognitivist frameworks for modeling.
Could you maybe restate and go into a little more detail? Was it non representational or
indirect specification of what? Of the beliefs of the system. So what's being directly specified?
What's directly specified? And then what is being indirectly specified?
In active inference, you have at least in a sense
correspondence between dynamical constraints like information over where the system is
and belief that the system holds that are akin to norms or like international states. So beliefs
or intentions are things that are going on inside and to my knowledge there is no framework that
makes an explicit formal connection between the two. You'd have dynamicist framework where you
have stuff that happens and there is no presentation or intentional states and you have things like
utility theory where you have to specify preemptively what are the intentional states of the agents.
Which are not very relevant to represent like the endogenous solution of
social constraints within a collective system. So
situation where active inference would be useful is to model. I will try to remember the term that
Kofman used. Kofman is filling and filling.
So I will share the, can we both share the screen? No we can't.
You can add it directly in this code page.
Probably a little easier than I'll just go to the back end course code page
and then follow the token. Yep and then go to the questions table and pop it out.
I don't have the questions that is on your screen.
Just click on this little expression. Challenges and potential solutions and then pop it out.
Pop out what?
Just like next to the row. See this expand row and then you'll be in the same place.
What is the row? See there is no letters. No no no just look visually at the expand row.
Look visually at the expand row. Just click the expand row
on the question that we're addressing and you'll pop into this campus.
The question that we are addressing is not on the page at least on my terminal.
Are you looking at the public front end or at the course back end? I'm looking at the back end.
Okay and I don't have the question what are blah blah blah.
Oh it is a sub question. What are the challenges? Okay. Okay cool all right fun.
You were talking about Kaufman though what was it? Yes it's a paper that he cosigned
who's monitored his topophiline critique of economic like I say rationality but now they say it's
balling rationality. So the dictionary of cognitive biases approach to
modern human behavior and basically the point of the paper as I understand it is that you have an
evolution of the goals and norms that shape a social ecology and this kind of
opponented evolution of the intentional states of the legend I think is can be addressed in a
more meaningful way with acting in France than with any other formal framework kind of.
There are several other aspects I think so first to kind of restate the challenges and then go to
the potential solutions and the advantages like the advantages in principle and in practice.
You started with identifying like the major any kind of modeling challenges so active
inherits from all of these modeling challenges or areas that are difficult to step aside from
and then yes depending on the resources of the group and whether it's 2023 or 2000 you know
future time when there's different tooling so that is just about the the challenge of active
inference sometimes compared today with more off-the-shelf approaches which also may or may not
work but in an academic field be spending your time making something that may or may not work
may or may not be orders of magnitude more just sophistication of a modeling setting
than the team is ready to again that's a general modeling point but it's also very easy to get
into with active and to jump the gap between something that is pedagogical and helps show
something like intuitive or cool and making something for example that can be used in
high reliability settings and that's a jump that hasn't been necessarily conveyed in the open source
setting so it's difficult to see examples of whereas there's kind of like production type
machine learning algorithms that can at least be no that's just a little general point so what are
some advantages there's some really interesting concepts related to this like indirect specification
so like let's just say that we were talking about the mountain car example
or a social variable that seemed to be moving within a certain range
then the direct encoding of that constraint would be basically made outdated okay now the
landscape changes and then all of a sudden the mountain car can go twice as far to a different
direction so if that constraint had been explicitly encoded about cognitive um variables or about
the exposition of the mountain car then the model goes stale but if what's encoded is somehow
a relation with the agent and the environment so the mountain car has 10 horsepower and it
can go left or right as its affordances and everything that builds from there and then
here's the laws of physics or mechanics such that here's the weight of the car and and then
if the landscape changes or as model is changing then you get oh yeah now it can go
further or shorter in this direction but that's like an outcome of the relationship between
the agent and the environment explicitly represented as such versus just looking at the outcome
and then putting constraints on the outcome
yes to say we have historically the concept of explanation that we have inherited from the
19th 20th century is that we're explained by having a lawful relationship between variables
and to do that we have to prespecify what are the relevant variables
and this is not a thing that exists with open-ended evolutionary dynamics this is all in the
Genakalu cognitive agency something something paper so
and so when we ask questions to a model we don't want to have the answer where yeah
it will evolve and seriously we don't really know this is not what is expected basically so
we tend not to look at open-ended evolutionary dynamics I would say that active influence has
some leverage to represent that that all the framework would not have because of the relationship
between constraints as an inical thing and beliefs as an intentional state
yeah one thing that makes me think of so when we're when we're doing modeling based
uh outcome based modeling whether for hobby or for grad school for job like we're often
in a setting that either expects or rewards or accepts only a converging answer because
because it's being you know does insulin in Drosophila change their circadian this or that
it's like that's it's very it's very converged of a question already and it's something where
we're looking to reduce our uncertainty about so then that
closes off I mean to the extent that it converges it closes off divergent routes
not just of like doing and addressing that question that's more of a methodological point
but it then we we don't make models that can see a more open-ended horizon of what could
actually happen in the system because that can always adds more
state spaces that can be broken and unfolded so I guess again to the kind of kernel of the question
you've written these very interesting sequence of papers about symmetry breaking and and
all of this so how do you use that in a way that goes beyond just stating larger and larger
state spaces or feeling less and less confident when it seems like a large piece of this is that
certain aspects of systems are unprestatable sorry confident but what precisely unprestatable
unprestatable yes I'm confident that
you cannot pre-state the space of possibilities or space of belief that an agent can have and
model of an evolution something that could like that is by definition of the terms
something that could be argued is that there is no such thing as open-ended evolution but that would be
that would be a very bold thing to claim and most people would not say that explicitly ever
because it's kind of obviously not the case if there is no one for it I'd like to hear it
but the argument that
are stated against the open-ended evolution thing are
but basically you have I would say all rely on a confusion between the fact that
the law of physics work which they do and the idea that the specific language that physics
talks is a full and objective presentation of everything there is or could be which is
like it's a possibility we can discuss about it but this is the distinct possibility that the
statement that the law of physics work which again they do
okay cool well then just to sort of close on this
octave advantages many interesting conceptual advantages we hope
analytical and more uh transdisciplinary or more holistically and also another huge piece is
it's connected to an always improving open-source computational environment
we expect and prefer but in that case linking a system in year x social system or model it's
kind of like using a linux system that there could be some developments like in message passing
algorithms or interoperability of different generative models or category theoretic
augmentation of models that are connected to the active inference ontology
all these different kinds of synthetic technologies which we can basically already imagine and to
some extent already have it becomes a way to map systems to a lot and that that is not as far as I
understand um plausible without kind of a first principles and the ecosystems of share
intelligence and all these other kind of memes and themes that we talk about all the time
surprise minimization things doing as most likely for them to do paths of least action
Bayesian mechanics then there's a continuity of explanation with the rock just being there
and the investor trading with this strategy an instrumental unifying account that makes relatively
minimal claims about the territory that includes the rock and the investing activity
what's you add in
but um like what you said message passing is interesting to me because you have a broad
coalition of physicists mathematicians or scientists people in academia who basically
think there is one language to nature and what we do a scientist is to discover it and I I don't
think that holds water not only because of any evolution is a thing which is a sufficient
element actually but if you look at message passing if you look at quantum mechanism if you
look at category theory open formally and conceptually the possibilities that there are different
languages in the world and they may be more or less interoperable and they may be non-reducible
to each other and then you start to ask even questions I'd say especially when
implicitly or explicitly you are interested in what determines the fact that a specific language
works in a specific context why is um yeah I'm not gonna go further down the math road but
you have an important compatibility slash interoperability result between major fields of physics
I will give a reference by John Bayes I don't know if you pronounce it I never said this out
actually Bayes
so you have important interoperability results in fields of physics and formal science
and we don't have a proof however that you know
all the possible presentation of physics are interpreted or operable
how do you say that interoperable interoperable okay so they said it's wrong
notes it's a great point and what's really interesting is like the relationship between
Bayes graphs first off Bayes graphs being analytically described and then computationally
implementable is on the order of decades old and then as we kind of explored just yesterday in
live stream 55.0 the relationship between the Bayes graph and for any graphs which enabled
message passing to be done procedurally to optimize a Bayes graph which just brings all
of these computational all these analytical connections but that wasn't understood until
it was and that was only slightly over two decades ago so then in fact those kinds of
results and developments reflect
the the changing social and scientific niche so I don't know maybe this is a different question
but science as a social activity and then I don't know does that how does that ground our
work or give us more what so
about the whole language thing I don't know where it's at now but at least 10 years ago
it seemed that you can have message passing you can have well you can have Bayesian coherence
of state of observable that does not rely explicitly on probabilities as in a
dispersion that is embedded in a specific set space you can have Bayesian coherence that pre-exists
to the representation in which probability is embedded and if there was a way to cross
this and a message passing you'd have a pretty straightforward straightforward
road to
a straighter account of contextuality and social construction I say this with the scan quotes
great note exciting for quantum context and quantum social and scripts and constraints and
norms let's close that question for now though nice okay um
how can oh yeah great question thank you to whoever asked and again video description you
can ask it'll appear and we'll see if anyone writes more questions during the stream
how can or does a framework slash theory slash principle of everything
articulate with moral normative ethical deontic considerations
so I think it is addressed in
a good amount of detail by an activist how you relate a theory of biological individuation
to a theory of ethics I do not have a good grip on this literature so you have like
of say high level intuitive opinion on that but this is not like state of the art and
okay basically I'd I'd say this flows well with stoic
virtue ethics things act according to the nature so you might as well work so that your
nature is good and then you have a recursivity in accounting what is good and what is not
and I do not see um straightforward analytical way to resolve the semi-quity
I said circularity or equity both apply
yeah so I think Evan Thompson has worked nuts and may have a much better
answer to how we relate theories of being entries of ethics oh very loud did actually
yeah I guess my sort of short answer would there there would be first just
we would have to hear a lot more even possible perspectives but without even hearing them can
at least maybe say that there is an articulation and a meter stick as an instrument and this kind
of goes actually to that question about the base spaces and what is precondition so
in what ways is the meter stick um
articulate with downstream
ethical frameworks what ought to be done it was just normative more broadly
um there's downstream decisions that the meter stick is agnostic to
and then the meter stick is also a social result that is itself downstream of other
norms and constraints biotic abiotic constraints regularities of space time
would say there is um what we can do with a theory of sensemaking be it active in
France or in activism is to um like just describe what we mean by normativity and ethics what are
the underlying natural processes when I say natural it would mean the opposition to social
those processes are biological and social at the same time and
that that may bring reflexivity or distance to account of normativity that may prove
prove some of them incoherent or ill advised that will not give you a solution to what is
ethical and what is not notably because like the most natural way to derive ethics from
something like an activism or something like it in France is that you both those framework
are centered around the biological individuation so you may say that logical individuation is
good actually that sounds sensible but then the question is biological individuation for whom
because you are the right I guess our desire will at least to exist but so does cancer cells
within your body who trumps who I don't know not from a pureness with your content there is no
like there is no way you can straight forwardly and magnificently derive a prescriptive notion
of good from any physics any descriptive account of the world you will have when you do when you
make normative claims you have goals because you are living thing and because of active inference
slash activism we know that cognition is a very no activity in the autonomy in the biological
activity of the agent so the theory that you are framing is in some way motivated even if you
don't know how or at need that it is and then I'd say from there it does not quite destroy the
project of an objective system of ethics but it makes it much harder to defend
so yeah I'd say you can derive a lot of negative results from descriptive theory of
like I would not say ethics because ethics are not descriptive but descriptive theory of how
ethics come to be I would say that it is hard if not impossible to derive
um like positive results if someone tried to do it I I'd like to see what this is
wow thank you Advil that last piece was very interesting many results many
many ant colonies with their behavior to model many real situations to understand social constraints
and norms in instrumentally with descriptions that are then in the discussion section of the paper
and the data are the data and those are the descriptive aspects it's a different kind of
data in a slight way but there's already enough to describe and interpret from what would be
merely described and it is very hard to derive positive
results first it's a hard domain to make positive results in not not just ones that make people
feel good but by positive like positivism like um justified true assertions about a
metaphysical space so it's hard to derive positive results about normativity and the
kind of areas that this person asked these are all areas that are um
and it's hard to use a quantitative theory which is almost it's an abstraction or it's just one
language it's hard to use that to make positive results external to the system harder to make
external to the system positive results internal to the system are dime a dozen but then to really
make that reflexive loop that you described between the um the what is and what what we expect and
prefer which is actually woven up in an interesting way in act inf rather than two kind of diverged
timelines like what we quote expect to happen like a prediction of the likeliest future
and then a second timeline that's like well what what I would really prefer to be doing
in act inf the agent just has one expectation slash preference
which loads up on the pragmatic value but that gives a unified approach towards
one's expectations of how things will be and what they expect slash prefer them to be
I would say that that uh vibe check level uh active in France flows well with the idea that
empowerment is good actually but make it a formal relation would be uh quite hard
you could say that uh in France vibes well with the notion that everyone knowing their place is
good which is quite the opposite so I don't see uh an ambiguous relation between active in France and
any um ethical framework I can think of I would say again that it uh like flows well with uh
virtue ethics framework because of the relation between uh one's action and was nature according
to active in France nature being here in a certain term that is like maybe not the best term but like
I'm literally using a production of uh before christ texts so yeah nature is not that bad
just not what we mean uh in the context of 1920s discussions
yeah that's a very complex topic with definitely a lot of rich work on like
our cities and people nature are humans animals and uh that sort of
homo sapiens type discourse and then how does active inference frame the relationship with the
niche in terms of entanglement or communication or co-action intra-action communication and
influence through blanket what where does that go beyond just describing
it doesn't have to I think a sort of base level and what you refer to here is like
that artifact the product of the work which is what the work is about can be a jumping off point
or other directions and so the work of active inference modeling can be in what it leads to
it's not always internal to the model that the improved awareness or better decision is realized
I can see one quite straightforward and I don't think it is entirely broken
way to relate ethics to active inference is uh ethics
like not ethics normativity as a social phenomenon it is a collective phenomenon
about social relationships and you could apply a descriptive theory of human behavior
and like human social aggregated collective behavior to find out what traits in us organization
are prone to survival or adaptivity and you could say that those traits are good actually
by construction of what we mean by ethics that could be a coherent claim
and then you could be interested in what traits make organization
durable but I this is the only logically straightforward way I see but that would like tend to
identify as good things that I would not see as good like feudalism it leaves quite a long time
well feudalism let us say
old school empires with no claim to representations or power by the what do you say populace
and you could integrate
you could basically um renormalize this theory not around uh clock time but around
I don't know a metric of lifetime how much things happen within the organization
and then you'd start having something that is less obviously wrong
and you could have basically ethics be
about optimization of specific parameters that can be addressed by a descriptive framework
but you'd have to make a lot of jumps to get there and while I do not see an obvious problem to that
it is very possible that we would not like the conclusion of such optimization thing
and again if you want to model something you have to decide what are the parameters of interests
and you can be wrong about that so here again you do not have an ambiguous even at a purely
descriptive level you do not have an ambiguous application of anything to anything
would say that more empowerment is good actually
and I would say these goals at a many nested scales of organization
and I would say it has somehow something to do to the physics of biological inviduation but
only in a vibe check way
nothing wrong with that um yeah especially with some of the recent work
like the variational synthesis with eco evo divo
and the connections between the statistical concepts of persistence or thickness
from free energy principle related to to remeasurement of the observer or the organism of themselves
that concept of repeated measurement being compatible in our work and and in other related
works basically with fitness if there's a height distribution of trees in the forest
and then a certain time point later the height distribution is the same
that was stabilizing dynamics we could say stabilizing evolution or stabilizing selection
and if it moved it moved
and so how do since there is such a coupling between things being as they are and basically
what the distribution of what is there is described both this stoic way but also this
kind of evolutionary biology way so does active inference offer any
other or complementary perspective other than just the kind of strengths and weaknesses of the
of using fitness
phenotypic fitness or memetic fitness as its own justification
to say that is to say that something is good because it exists this is not a strong position to take
so this is why you'd have
quite high level of difficulty to
derive anything prescriptive for anything descriptive but the function is not the same
you can make relation between the two no ethics is purely
blind about nature no third of nature is purely ethically
unmotivated but to have a formal relation between the two is probably not possible at least highly
non-trivial
okay so to kind of close on this question
how does a free energy principle as a principle for everything and active inference as an implementable
framework for applying free energy principle systems how does that articulate with these broader
very
deep and fundamental human social contexts short answer seems to be
it's a lot like other scientific ideas inherits a lot of their
challenges and frictions and and situations also there appeared to be some interesting
promising routes or themes to weave in however even with a very charitable or optimistic interpretation
there seem some in principle challenges with these areas that make certain kinds of claims perhaps
not even within the proximate understanding we have of active inference
but people should totally write in the live chat or add comments and stuff I mean it's just
interesting question okay
or higher order beliefs about doing better than expected at PEM probably prediction
error minimization integrated into the architecture of the agent's internal model of external dynamics
and itself in those dynamics my thought here is that we have prior beliefs to fulfill
certain self-evidencing expectations e.g. homeostatic predictions but how do those interact
with these higher order predictions which appear to my mind to deny or negate the fundamental
priors insofar as they predict the agent to go over and above the levels of prediction error
minimization which otherwise might be achieved by fulfilling those fundamental priors
they gave their thought let's return to the original question
I do not know how like I know that
comparison to a baseline homeostatic level of prediction error minimization is a
quite important thing in a traditional psychiatry let's say in the work of Parxomes
I do not know how that's implemented actually in computational models
so I'd rather not answer personally Ben White should be more informed about these things
yeah maybe you know well
I mean the word that seems to be doing the work is integrated
so higher beliefs about doing better than expected at prediction error minimization
or we can just say free energy minimization so this was explored in the affective inference
work so if the free energy was decreasing as expected it was associated with neutral valence
if things were improving better than expected it was associated with positive valence
and if things were doing worse than expected it was negative valence
so because of the ability to make hierarchical active models and just hierarchical Bayesian
models in general it is possible to talk about these beliefs about beliefs metacognitive beliefs
so it is possible to make models that have expectations about how well even an optimization
process is going to go and then a computational psychiatrist or whatever may associate that
with the affect how is that integrated into the agent's internal model of external dynamics
well the shortest answer is to sketch it out how one sees it and then it becomes either there or
not but just in general if the internal model includes these higher order beliefs about doing
better than expected then that's the agent's generative model that then interfaces or articulates
with external dynamics so you could have some environment that has a environmental regularity
or dynamics or that are influenceable or or not and then you could deploy two agents one of them
that has the baseline generative model and the other one has this doing better than expected
layer that the questioner is asking about and then they can do parameter sweeps and
maybe adding this higher order belief increases the state's base a lot and so it increases the
computational costs a lot but some interesting pockets of behavior are found or the behavior
in that setting ends up looking the exact same but in another setting it would have been different
a lot of these questions point towards very important modeling questions which can basically
only be pointed at because so much is going to depend on what the actual model is
okay um
where can I find the recommended reading list mentioned in the lectures
um
so where we have the um slides from the lecture they're in live streams just go to the big table
and find the slides if you find a lecture that doesn't have slides just let us know we'll we'll
add it um where things were just mentioned in the lectures that's a great question and our
goal at the active inference journal beyond just transcribing and publishing and adding
captions and translating and everything of these live streams we would like to also do
more bibliographic work so that the books that people mention we can also have in that open
source versioned journal so we generate the first version of the transcript people update
and improve it oh what was the name of that author what book are they talking about here
and then we can actually have a unified bibliography section or the streams so
if that sounds interesting to you and you'd benefit from it then surely many many others
will too so if you're excited to do that kind of active inference journal work
I highly encourage slash recommend it
about what else will you add
same what I kind of nothing to other yeah
yeah okay well
we can look at some of the other questions that were added that others
wrote people in live chat can add question or they can go to the course website and
ask a new question
do you want to
look at one of the previous ones or
do you have any other just thoughts you want to bring up
not really the first ones were un-squared so I don't like and they are they were
they were asked weeks ago so there is a relatively low likelihood that going
over that again would be very helpful why do you think we can cut the discussion
cool but the important things that are not treated now can be treated in conclusion anyway
okay so what are the next steps then for the course
next step is a lot of people register for the presenting in the conclusion session
I haven't gotten any specific responses or like titles yet
okay so we see people do that
yeah we can write write another message
um including even a short video message or just a written one and then also ask specific people
also if anyone is like interested to present something but they're not really sure the format
or they want pre-recorded or just kind of exploring and seeing what the people who are
following along live want to do and also trying out things that we think futures will want to do too
so if someone has an idea on that we're definitely open to it
any last thoughts
nope i'm good cool all right thank you then see you have all
so bye
