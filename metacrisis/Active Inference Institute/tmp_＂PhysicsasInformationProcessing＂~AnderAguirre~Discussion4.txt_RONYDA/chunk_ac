from an operational point of view she's preparing an instrument
and turning it on she's she's creating an initial state
and she's simultaneously encoding a memory someplace
in her head or on a piece of paper of what those preparation conditions were
because it's only with respect to the memory of what the preparation conditions were
that the later measurement is meaningful so
let's let's go back to just preparing a spin
right and at t she may
set the angle of some polarization filter that defines a propagating beam of photons
and at t plus delta t she measures something about what those photons are doing but the
measurement is only meaningful with respect to her memory of what the polarization setting that
prepared the photons was so the effectively what's going on in the quantum channel is an experiment
and it's it's the the classical information that's preserved in this classical channel that
makes the experiment meaningful or interpretable or informative yeah for sure yeah that makes
perfect sense and in preparation of measurement this ties back to an earlier question we had
both happen simultaneously at the same like degree of freedom at the boundary or do we have
preparation at the lower bounds at the top of one yeah one one can one can think of that operator
mi if you remember the decomposition of the Hamiltonian as as preparing or measuring that
it's just a matter of interpretation uh you know effectively is it acting to the left or acting to
the right yeah okay yeah yeah yeah makes perfect and then before we get to quantum error correction as
more of a spatial analysis instead of a time thing I wanted to ask a yet another question
between this one and my classical so the quantum channels that involves some sort of
time evolution you know it's this unitary you know portion that is
sorry this portion that is evolving unitary with no interference from the outside
however as you said for this experiment to make sense you need to have a classical memory
of how that experiment was most prepared so that's that mean that that classical guy on top
is static there's no time flowing in well this actually gets back to the talk by
susan that we were talking about before we started here that you kindly referred me to
part of part of this classical memory is our memory for what counts as a classical clock
and we'll actually get to this again in the september session but if you if you think again
about doing an experiment in which a state is prepared and then it's measured this quantum
process is a process through time with respect to some classical clock that actually provides
the time coordinate for the experiment so this this classical clock is some external
reference frame that that a1 here in this notation is is using as part of her classical memory
right again it's a memory because it's something that's assumed not to change
and and this is this will be kind of the heart of the discussion in september that
that time and memory and object persistence are all different names for the same assumption
that we make about the world thank you chris thank you i i am gonna have to disappear so
only for now though yeah only for now i will i will nonetheless persist someplace
thank you chris so much chris okay awesome see y'all thanks very much well measure you later
um ender if you wanted to drop any other cues or clues or bring us a little bit of a preparation
for where we're going to be heading in lecture five that would be pretty cool
sure so i mean i i'm a little aware of what's coming in lecture five um it's about space and time
and how space may be sorry time may be a little more fundamental than space for reasons that chris
will show um has a lot to do with the notion of how you define a clock i see and we need to think
hard about what what what are the bare minimum ingredients for you to talk about the existence
of a clock uh these are deep fundamental almost philosophical questions that are overlooked
and the good news and that's the saskin talk that chris and i were referring to referring to
is that other people especially in the high energy community are also looking into these
questions which is very reassuring so i'm talking about edwinton saskin harlow etc they are there's
a recent talk on on youtube where they talk about what does it mean for something to be a clock
you know how this how long does the clock last and and then chris will also talk about space
and and the punchline of it will be that um there's obviously a physics approach to
emergent space time which is very very technical and and so on but from what i understood i mean i
have yet to see the talk my first my first myself first um is that there is a parallel biological
approach as to how we learn our space time so from a developmental psychology point of view
influence and i suppose all kinds of animals are not born fully equipped to perceive space time
hence the necessity of things like clay and so on so they can find correlations between
motor inputs and visual inputs right and eventually things like the mirror test
which is non-trivial no no no no no human born is born uh passing the mirror test already
so that implies that at least biologically it is non-trivial and it takes a few steps until
you get to have that sort of space spatial awareness right now the interesting part of this
for me personally is what the what the physics side of it is and uh i i'm i'm no expert by any
means but i think the gist of it might might have to do something with quantum error correction
adseft and so on um there was a bit of a teaser about quantum error correction here
in these slides uh but yeah i mean that's that's about all i can say but very looking forward to
the biology also yeah cool harris any last thoughts or anything you want to point towards
basically i would like to thank everyone for inviting me i really enjoyed it
the whole uh um uh live stream uh i hope uh we have made some progress and uh looking forward to
the next uh uh live streams number five and number six so uh that's about it thank you everyone
thank you anything else under that's it awesome well i encourage everyone to go to the syllabus
page look ahead look back pre-gest digest re-gest ask questions and let's make progress as you
exhort harris so see y'all till next time
you
