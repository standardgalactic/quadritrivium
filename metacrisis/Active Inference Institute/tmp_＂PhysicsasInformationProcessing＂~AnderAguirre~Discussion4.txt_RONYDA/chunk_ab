uh i still won't quite understand what is meant here that this whole classical communication
stuff requires fine tuning
okay i i think a a way to think about it is uh to to think about what it means to say that Alice
and Bob are able to communicate classically um what we're saying is that Alice and Bob
share some sort of language so when they exchange their data we can think of their
data as as written in some binary code in a data table you know Alice says
uh i i set my instrument this way and i saw this spin i i then set my instrument this other way
and i i made this observation so Alice's data table or a one's data table
uh is is just a a long table with two entries in each row uh one entry is how the detector
was adjusted and the other entry is is what the value of the spin was observed
and Bob's data table looks the same and so they they share this information or they share it with
some third party they they communicate it classically and there are two aspects to that
classical communication one is that up to classical noise of their data tables don't change
when they share them so they really are irreversibly recorded they're not evolving in time
uh along with the rest of the universe the other aspect is that we have to assume that
Alice and Bob mean the same thing by their their notations in these data tables so that
they can actually compare them so that they can actually do the statistics and see if they've
violated Bell's inequality so what that means is we have to assume that they actually share
a definition of up and that when they talk about changing the settings on their instruments
they're talking about changing those settings with respect to some shared definition of up
and you know in a in a real experiment that shared definition of up is provided by the
the earth's gravitational field or something like that earth's magnetic field some shared
environmental variable so now it seems like we have a situation in which Alice Alice 1 and Alice 2
should be entangled right because they share this reference frame that enables them to communicate
classically but they can't be entangled if they're going to communicate classically
so so we make an assumption that in just this case they share a reference frame but they're
not entangled they're able they're able to communicate classically while sharing the
reference frame and we can sort of wave our hands and say they only share the reference frame up to
some measurement resolution or something like that but despite the hand waving we're making a very
specific assumption that violates the fact that reference frame sharing induces entanglement
so that's the fine-tuning assumption we assume that the universe is such that in this very specific
kind of case we can have reference frame sharing without entanglement
cool okay let's let's keep it here and just open it up a little bit if um Harris or Dean
want to just give any thought or reflection on what we've gotten to so far
Harris if you want to please yes everything is very interesting
basically I was listening with great let's say focus it reminded me this let's say
elaboration on the previous talk that Chris gave two weeks ago it reminded me something
that Michael Levitt said some time ago it is regarding this amazing ability of cognition
to scale up so it's not only this understanding let's say of the scattering of cognition but
also the scaling up of cognition and when I tried to get inside my head actually that
asked Chris said in in in one of his talks that if a system is a toggle one cannot draw a meaningful
boundary across it so these fine fine tuning let's say elaboration that was made
right now actually helps me understand that even better so thank you Chris for that and thank you
under for this elaboration
well thank you thank you I'm glad that helped
yeah I I think this is intimately related to the question of what cognition is
since if if we have a if we have a purely quantum system there there really is a deep
sense in which nothing is happening because of the time symmetry so to talk about cognition
is something that actually occurs we have to think of it classically
thank you also if you allow me another comment on that basically one of the comments posted
during your last talk in the chat had to do with classical memories and I was thinking about that
and I came to the conclusion that classical memories presupposes a gestation period
and and when I think about it that actually makes sense and it is true let's say
for for both physical and psychological reasons so for example a hard disk needs to write data on
its magnetic surface and a human brain needs to consolidate all those neural connections through
synaptic plasticity let's say however when we start thinking about
quantum quantum information and quantum quantum memories let's say we realize that
such memories will be will such quantum memories basically will be stored in qubits
or in those entangled states that you described so they do not necessarily have the same limitations
and of course quantum information theorists suggest as I understand it that quantum memories
can be created and accessed instantaneously without any form of gestation let's say without any
and gestation period and of course this goes back and it has the potential as I see to revolutionize
computation with in terms of quantum computing computation but also and most importantly
communication and quantum cryptography even and this is something that I am truly interested in
and so yeah I just wanted to shout or saw that
yeah that's that's a very good point and the the flip side is
the the issue of stability which again gets to the notion of of environmental decoherence
which is just the process of observation of the quantum state by
some environment or some observer some component of its environment
and the reason this is a problem in practice is that we don't have complete control of all
components of the environment right so we have to use things like liquid helium
to try to keep the environment at bay to prevent decoherence because any other components of the
environment interacting with our quantum memory will alter the state of the memory
yeah that is that is a great and great answer and basically the reason why I type that question
regarding super selection rules and namely I propose something called fuzzy super selection rules
basically as I understand it those super selection rules the classical ones let's say
they are based on symmetries or on all those conversation laws that actually limit the
accessibility or the our capacity to to measure let's say certain quantum properties let's say
maybe it's parity maybe it's angular momentum maybe it's even charged but if we if we start
thinking like these fuzzy super selection rules in an effort to relax these restrictions
by allowing some degree of coherence or interference between the different super selected sectors
which can be quantified let's say by a parameter called fuzziness I know that in other fields like
in my field that is fuzzy cognitive mapping the introduction of fuzziness from us as it was
propounded by professor Lotfi Zadek it actually helped a lot of our models to become more accurate
let's say so this is what I am proposing maybe of course I don't expect it to
revolutionize quantum information but maybe it can help us understand a bit better what
is going on in the role of these the coherence that comes out of the environment so if we
incorporate it as a parameter of fuzziness a priori then maybe we can understand then even
what we are dealing with
yeah I would refer you to the paper by Bartlett
who are the other there are two other co-authors in 2007 a lovely review of quantum reference
frames in reviews of modern physics and a point that they make that I think is relevant here
is that a super selection rule can always be interpreted let me see if I if I I'm not sure
I'll be able to completely reproduce their argument but they showed that a super selection rule
can always be interpreted as the absence of a reference frame or the the lack of a reference
frame and one of the examples that they give is charge conservation that we never see
super positions of different electric charges and their point is we never see this because we
have no way of measuring it we have no reference frame that we could use that would allow us to
see a state of superposed charges and effectively what they're saying is our reference frames are
all made of matter that is composed of stuff that has well-defined electric charges
so we can't we can't see things that are super positions of charge and it's very difficult
you know for us to see things that are super positions of position
so this question of what is a super selection rule why do we have these rules
at least in their reasoning boils down to the question of why do we have some
reference frames or some measurement capabilities and not others what is it about us
that limits in some fundamental way our ability to make measurements and
I suspect that when you talk about buzziness which is a sense of classical uncertainty
that you may be sort of pointing in that direction but I think it would be worth looking at that
paper and which is which is largely written in English right the the formalism is kept in the
background so it's a it's a very nice paper
you thank you we should get out for sure thank you um enter maybe mute a little bit
Dean on the mountaintop what can you throw down on us
I don't have anything I don't have anything super special throw down I have a I have a question
though and because I am very comfortable in that fuzzy space I kind of see relationships as
and their and their lack of definability as a feature so here's my here's kind of my question
um so you talked about a minimum sort of two different memories to encode something
in time and I think it's it was one of the slides just after the one that's up here right now
which sounds to me like somewhere processing capacity it sounds like we are kind of stepping
back and trying to look at this instantaneous thing from the relative position of even the
things that are classical can be seen as all quantum so that when you mentioned that earlier
Chris that helped me quite a bit which then manifests itself as a classical ability to
process somewhere I I spent a lot of my career self labeling as a wayfinder so not capacity
realization relationship just as a relationship it means that wayfinding is not just an
orienting or a processing where I am and being gripped by the sort of the thing I'm enveloped by
it's also the channel the screen the bound the divide the gap the unentangled potentiator
it's the thing upon which traction can exist as being a gripper as well so if it's I was already
hung up on I wanted to go back like Colombo in that old 70s tv show and talk about z-spin because
I think z-spin is an energy way of describing but I honestly think when I went back and watched the
your presentation a couple of times I'm starting to get a sense that z-spin is also a relationship
it's that affordance that allows us to be able to see up and down but I'm just curious Chris
are we really talking about processing somewhere in the classical sense but because we have
these two ways of encoding different memories we're also talking about somewhere processing
just that that state that allows for that that's my my question is that what we're
really getting are we are we trying to open that up that possibility up
yeah I think that's a nice way to think about it
I think we're trying to at some deep level
come up with a way of describing what it means to be an agent
and I'll say in our case a self-conscious agent
with a sense of time that's embedded in an environment that we depend on to store memories
for us and what I what I mean by that is that we we depend on the environment to change very
slowly at least from our point of view so that we can keep some sense of our orientation within
the environment right we're using everything we see as a memory that allows us to keep our
ourselves fixed which allows us to have a point of view so we're we're using the entire visible
environment as if you will a reference frame against which we can see small changes
but if the environment was constantly change constantly and rapidly changing
we wouldn't be able to do that and we wouldn't be able to use it as a memory and so we would
have no point of view so in a sense I think what we're talking about here is the
kind of the the miracle of having a point of view that gives us a sense of time
that's very philosophical but
it's it's amazing and I wonder if along with the
perspectival visual advancements which you and Shana Dobson have explored in the math art settings
you're almost bringing that kind of a transformative re-understanding or re-quantum
reference framing into a temporal setting where it's not just a static spatial parallax
that we are aesthetically and formally re-understanding but also a temporal one
which in an agent environment system necessitates these questions of communication
which in the quantum information formalism are approached topologically rather than
geometrically which is what we needed for the kind of vanishing point type math art in the spatial setting
well I think they're they're approached geometrically eventually and and that's really what the
session in September will be about it's how to how to start with this very topological picture
where we're only talking about
interactions of in a sense interactions in time but but outside of space
and layer a spatial structure on top of that and this is
I think this is particularly interesting in this active inference context because it
immediately raises biological questions about
the ability of different organisms to layer space on their experience and hence locate themselves
if you will within some sort of perceived world
awesome Dean and then back to Anders last minutes
oh wait I'm mute Dean and then please continue
sorry so Chris is it from from the pure neophyte perspective that I have is it okay to say
that it's not just a flipping of of position of words that somewhere processing that availability
and processing somewhere in the classical sense where am I it's the it's our ability
to fuse those as you mentioned we can we can slow down we can stabilize we can see
that relationship or is it about spin
I think the former writes spin is a very convenient abstraction for talking about
binary encoding
and we have this felt sense of spin but the the sense it's its use in physics is very much an
abstraction I mean the difference between a proton and neutron is a spin variable
awesome under you can in the last minutes take it where you need
also I'm mute and then continue can you guys hear me now well so let's hope that I have a
time for Chris to address a couple things so just to conclude the slides
and then hopefully we get to say a few words on quantum Darwinism so the towards the end the slides
appear to start pivoting towards the next subject which is space and time and here in
particular we see the earlier slide showcasing the log protocol where you can you can you can
notice that half of it has been cut and has has been moved to the future so here we don't have
two sectors of Alice communicating but rather Alice communicating with its future
still you have the classical and the quantum channel now one question that I brought up I remember
and in in the lecture and maybe we can expand on a little more was exactly what is the difference
in this quantum and the classical channel part something I heard Chris say is that it is crucial
for the quantum channel to be to here so this is going to be some sort of unitary scattering
evolution that is completely independent of everything else going on is that correct or
should be in theory and yes yeah and and I suppose just like earlier the classical the
classical channel is is the part that takes time and free energy expenditure now my question
to you Chris is on not not not the not the channels in the middle but the ticks on either
side of the boundaries that have been broken down and separated in terms of an external time
what's what's up with those ticks from one sector to the other of the boundary
so in q1 for example the low the lower qrf sector that's that amount to a state was prepared
the upper one was I made a memory record of that state is that that's what it is right
yeah okay so in the lower sector we both had a preparation and a measurement and a measurement
was recorded classically here that's all there is yeah so so preparation and measurement are
effectively the same process and you can think of in a1 of t what a1 is doing is
