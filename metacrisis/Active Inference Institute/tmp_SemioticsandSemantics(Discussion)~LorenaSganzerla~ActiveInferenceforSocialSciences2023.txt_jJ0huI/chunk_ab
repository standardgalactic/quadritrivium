time in these terms that's a very nice point it reminds me of Bruno Latour's actor network theory
or ants which kind of advocates a similar approach to what you describe which is like enter anywhere
open-mindedly because in an iterated modeling or iterated analysis setting the first proposal
or the first trace detected we know that's not the whole picture there may not be a whole or only
picture so we need to enter and iterate and then with active inference specifically because of the
compositionality that we get within a layer collective behavior and then also the kind of
nesting smaller things inside of bigger things we can always build something and then we can go oh
wow it's like there's a lot of top-down influence maybe there's a higher order factor or slower
factor or a contextual factor we should consider or oh we were abstracting across these smaller
things inside but for a later day or if relevance we can dive in and so then it allows a light hold
or a grasp on the proposed generative model obviously it's map not territory but even
beyond that we always know that we can expand laterally and across scales starting from anywhere
in an iterated modeling process without our first or even 11th model being proposed as like
the accounts of some complex cultural phenomena which we're always going to only ever have our
own perspectives on yeah I think you don't really find that you being so oh all in copas
saying like you have one model that will model them all you can you you can navigate those models
in these more more instrumental terms it raises different questions when you put things like that
in terms of the ontology of models and models and theories and sciences but you they can be also
described as tools for describe tools for yeah tools for for grasping and describing
phenomena in a more non-committal way
how much that how much that smuggles in philosophical or more ontological problems
it's still I think under like debate but it is still
it's still uh it is still a tool to bring insights to think about specific cultural
collective uh phenomena which is not it's it's complicated to because I think what I'm getting
at I'm kind of like going back and forth but when you talk about social sciences and modeling
usually you have like ways of modeling agents or ways of modeling collectives and active inference
is trying to to come up with a a modeling in which you can understand agency and collectives
within the same modeling uh schema and I think the specific specifically for these
cases if you're interested in understanding uh types of cultural phenomena among language users
in uh in specific contexts you can at least partially understand or have or gain some insight
in this agent-collective relationship that that is a little bit more interesting than
we have found so far in the social sciences because you can have like or specific understandings of
means but then how the agent where is the agency in that you you lose a little bit of agency
well when you're trying to understand uh only agents then you don't know how that
kind of scales up because active inference tries and offers this scale free uh modeling tools
that facilitates this this um conversion into agents agents and uh collectives
I would be interested in asking you actually how how do you navigate that when you talk about
social phenomena in ants or termites or
because then yeah you have very specific coding demarcations I guess for for this uh
social environments
yeah it's a great question it's also whether it's a uh open wounds or a dirty closet that's just
shut there's actually a lot of ambiguity and unresolved tension around well is the ant colony
social are they social insects that reifies the nest mate as the individual and then what
they're doing is like when we hang out and talk so reifying the nest mate as individual makes
the colony social but if the colony is individual then what nest mates are doing with each other
is not social anymore than we would describe the liver and the kidney as having like a social
single cellular interaction but we know that would be missing the point and so there definitely is
attention with some of these evolutionary lineages like ants being monophiletically
obligate you social all and only ants are you social they all live in the colonies there's no
free living nest mate whereas other parts of the evolutionary tree there are
life histories that do look a little bit more like social collaboration that can then
dissolve and so knowing what level of lock in makes something social
when are we socializing and what level of lock in goes beyond social and it kind of like makes
when the blanket is so strong around the social that like for multi-cellularity that it it's kind
of losing the social feature again because if we just use social to mean the connective tissue
or the kind of lubricant or the spaces between everything then it means nothing so a real attention
is what space does the social account for and is this going to be a concept with a lot of creep
looking well it's a social relationship between the roots of the tree and the fungus and it's a
social relationship amongst the molecules in the test tube is that too broad of a social conception
are there downsides or are there trade-offs associated with a broader social concept
social concept do we dilute what the social means and then on the other side
might we exclude phenomena that could importantly be considered social
well that's not social they're just talking on a train it's like well that's the other side
if we were to have carving out encounters that we do want to include as social and
and is there a true social does active inference help us sidestep or at least negotiate this territory
because we could develop a generative model or an ecosystem of shared intelligence with
one person and two internet of things devices and a bird and a metronome and just say we made
what we made and then leave it as a second-order interpretation whether that is a social setting
I mean I think you you are pointing at like how I think granularity of those scales right
if you have a model that I want you want to everything that you already have it's probably
not interesting and not informative because you cannot like define those limits of what you're
trying to understand and in the other hand when you do that when you define those limits if you're
too narrow or you're gonna leave out you're gonna idealize also in a way right and leave out many
other parts of the system that you're interested in but if you don't do that if you don't
if you don't make this if you don't make this decision when modeling you think then how
how you can have any access to the phenomena right and and to connect this to the forestry
so in the forestry example the disirata was lumber now that may have been a very narrowly scoped
desire but it's it's a relevant thing to to want this resource and then industrialization
science as a process professionalization those allow the description and and the handling and
ultimately the kind of top-down legibility and control thinking like a forestry company now
with respect to the social sciences by analogy to forestry science so now we're entering an
era of increased legibility and control of social systems and human natural capital and
attention as a resource trust as a resource in a way is being cropped analogous to produce the
content of lumber but now there are social content so as the social goes from being just
only simply the water we swim in not something that's even compared counterfactually to alternative
cultural possibilities per se but falls under the scope of the professional management like
forestry then that's when this discussion of well what's the lumber and what is the weeds that are
being pruned and what ecosystem services when we pay attention to certain parts of human social
culture and when we seek to make more of this kind of lumber what else does that come along with
and what decisions come into play and that comes along when you see
you
or instagram i don't know twitter after what happened to twitter but
but yeah the in terms of attention pruning you do have that very effectively already happening
already you can see how that happens if efficiently in the world in elections for instance it can be
very very easily manipulated and we saw what happened in elections for instance in brazil or in
the u.s and well all over you navigate a system of attention organization that
selects in only what he thinks that you're interested in
in the effects of that in terms of decision making and in terms of trust in terms of
diversity of discourse we have seen that it can be devastating
so the and the question would be like how can you make this a little bit how can you use active
inference and these tools that we have to make this kind of technology a little bit more inclusive
without being super also disruptive is it even like
a possibility i really don't know i think it's an ethical problem that we have when we talk about
social systems and these principles of attention exclusion leaving things out
lot to say on that um with modeling and interpolating and models whether it's large
language model type or linear regression type it is able to interpolate to put data points within
an enclosure of what has already been described and Bayesian statistics and other types of
prediction algorithms are not immune to that either if we have some prior distribution belief
um we believe it's possible for it to be between 20 and 30 degrees outside
then when we get data inside of our bounds we can converge and that actually
tightens our beliefs not always a bad thing of course and then outside of the scope of the
possible those data are just seen as noise and they may not even be integrated so then that
can lead to a reinforcing process not necessarily an adaptive one either where information that's
confirmatory is used to ratchet and increase precision and then information that is not
confirmatory is discarded as not useful
it doesn't yeah in this case is yeah it doesn't even enter the uh the landscape
of attention of the user in
what i what i'm what i was thinking in relation to this no this idea of
uh a forestry is because we have now organizational principles that are faster and
more populated with uh information and attention grabbing kinds of prompts
we transformed the same
we just from the same principle into
a harder to grasp process it's it's hard it becomes more complex it becomes harder to
describe this the process of understanding that in terms of forestry is kind of way more grounded
when you apply that socially to this kind of environment that we're talking like internet or
is highly uh volatile
and virtual in principle in environment it becomes much harder to assess what is being
pruned out or not you just don't know it makes it more clear that
there is a process of pruning you need to have no control of what is being taken out
you have no idea what's being like left away from your perspective of attention
so to this topic of intended or unintended semantic pruning i think um this has helped me
identify attention if we want to talk about the semantics or semiotics biosemionics whatever we
want to call it of the letter e in relationship to letter a we're looking for an account that might
convey letterness but we're generalized above enus or anus so in some ways we've erased or
abstracted generalized away from the particulars of the sign's meaning by taking a semiotic
perspective and so it's like we got into the game to have a semantic account of biological
phenomena or of any phenomena for biological entity yet this process in a sense distances us
from the particulars that actually do grant it that meaning in the actuality like if we
walk into a sacred space and it's like oh well that is just doing that over there and this
architecture is doing this and because of the layout people must use the room this way
that's removed from the actual meaning which is the cause and consequence with the organization and
culture that we discussed but that prima facia account doesn't generalize get any generalization
that we make so that we can talk about multiple places or multiple letters on a common
accounting framework is going to remove those particularities
so it's a very challenging catch 22 whether we want to really
account for the n equals one and maybe even live and act and play and work in the n equals one
versus develop something that might be satisfying and cut and dry but it's always going to be on
the sidelines with respect to what it actually means but what do you mean like is i don't understand
what you what you're getting at like is it you mean like it's generalized or not generalized
i didn't get that like when we have a general when we generalize when we
ask what words mean what what words mean beyond any given word we've lost touch with
what any given word means but words are what they actually mean in a situation
so it's just in this scientific approach to meaning semiotics and semantics
we have these two tensions or a tension to reconcile between actually giving an account
of the meaningfulness of the specific thing
versus taking a more scientific approach which would be
gathering a group of similar things and finding their shared attributes
which out of necessity must abstract must crop out
features that are are empirically or anecdotally taken to not matter like we abstract whether it
was a monday or tuesday that we did the experiments we just combine all of our replicates together
when we do the scientific analysis
you mean you mean if you generalize the practice you lose
what you're being if you generalize it too much you lose everything that's meaningful to it in
terms of like for you formalize it and then you have no yeah you have an empty semantics you
have a semantics with no meaning that can only be meaningful in terms of how you apply that in
terms of specific practices yeah it's like i i have a framework for you know the formal meaning
of letters within words within sentences within paragraphs and then it's like well but now what's
your next n equals one word that you're actually going to bring it's not just about building some
abstract scaffold yeah for bigger and bigger boulders of meaning
at some point through our embodied thought and action
in our experience it is going to come down into the particulars
and it doesn't immediately seem clear that simply generalizing further
brings us there
yeah yeah particularly i don't really believe you can have that kind of generalization i think
we attempt to build whatever what i see that's the interesting aspect of the formal semantics
you try to build this more general
understanding that's just formalizes to model but for that to be meaningful it has to be embedded
in a way of practicing it like in a forestry practice you have to be embedded in a cultural
environment in which that can be actually uh observed in terms of what happens when
a generative model is being updated or not
is that what you mean because otherwise i don't really understand how it becomes too
yeah it becomes too formal it becomes too abstract in terms of some i would not understand
what that is
i'll i'll think of a little more um brand or tj do you want to add any thoughts or questions
yeah sorry i i think like i don't have a lot of context i've been like following some of the
discussion but not attended a lot of these calls i'm like it's all yeah yeah um yeah i didn't know
i think um yeah i'm in general just sort of interested in trying to understand the relationship
between um yeah like sorts of like constructionist epistemologies and um yeah like generative models
and active inference style stuff and um how active inference style like yeah what are the
philosophical commitments that active inference involves with respect to knowledge and epistemology
and there's a sense in which like rational choice models often assume a certain sort of like
objectivity to beliefs and then desires are where most of the degrees of freedom lie or something
um whereas there's a lot of like issue like there's a lot of things that come up once you
start talking about reflexivities where concepts themselves become self-fulfilling prophecies
what you believe about what your beliefs about society and shaping the society itself so there's
the sense in which there's a score dependence between the object of knowledge and knowledge about
that object itself and i think yeah like i'm sort of interested in like how the active
entrance ways of thinking about this offers what perspectives on those questions and stuff like
that um yeah thank you great questions yeah so when you talk about the uh object of knowledge
and knowledge itself and active inference uh
