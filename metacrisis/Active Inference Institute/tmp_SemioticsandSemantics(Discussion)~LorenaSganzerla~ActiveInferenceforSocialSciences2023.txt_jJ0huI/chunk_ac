i think you you you can think of in terms of this
well there's a few ways to think about that i guess
uh the knowledge itself it has to come epistemically from where your agent
is actually embedded and situated in specifically an active inference it's embodied
it kind of needs to have a model the model is modeling a body is modeling a body that is in
the world and it's all the time uh situated is never disconnected to its environment and it's
history and how the history of that environment right yeah uh but if you think if you push that
to the object of that knowledge uh i don't know how how different
that will
how different how can you differ differentiate that so sharply when you talk about active inference
because
if you think of uh in terms of a generative model then what will be updated comes is updated from
a prior that is always directed in this body in this situated realm so they sort of conflated
as i see maybe a maybe a mistaken but they sort of correlate in how you're gonna update your
generative model which it will be at the same time in at the same time what you know and what you
the object of this knowledge still i sorry if i can just like uh raise a question to that
yeah so i think like i think that there is a sense in which like with respect to
something that in epistemology we call self knowledge there is there is a question here
that the the active inference agent has this model of that is like situated in the body or like in
in its like um like structure and is also modeling that structure itself and there is like this issue
of like where where yeah like the belief is not unidirectionally dependent on the object
sort of a thing but has this feedback loop thing comes up there but there's another way in which
i think like uh where this sort of thing comes where even if the object is outside of the body
of the knowledge i think that that could still come up so for instance if i live in it if an
active inference agent lives in a society of other active inference agents where currently all of them
defect on prisoner's dilemma but maybe like on further reflection they would want to like again
like i don't know what further reflection would mean in the active inference sense but i'm like just
saying in the intuitive sense like that what would it mean for them to like go from one fixed point
to another fixed point where they're all cooperating or or or something like that and
that that i think is not clear to me like how that shift can happen in active inference where
it's not just purely using the empirical information to keep running the the the middle of the of your
like free energy equation but also recognizing the contingencies and then identifying those
contingencies to make something like shifts from one state to another like if if i model that the
society is a cruel space and if everyone models the society is a cruel space then we will end up
creating a society that is a cruel space but if only we could recognize that our belief or our
model that society is a cool space is a contingent belief and we could all somehow negotiate or
communicate and shift to a different belief about what society is and society is a kind
place then we will end up creating that kinder society or something and that sort of like a
belief about the thing that society is it's not entirely within the agent like it's sort of
it it has a weird intersubjective character so it's not entirely outside of the agent either
but it's not entirely like internal to the agent either or something yeah yeah you can think of
that like you're talking about active inference action comes first right you have to you don't
have the knowledge like inside your head waiting for you to to push that out of the way action has
to come first so if you if you take that as a principle an organizing principle it depends on
the contingency of your actions the possibilities might be limited by your situated um condition
but they are limited it doesn't mean that you don't have like a range of options from that state
space in which you can go you can navigate so you can navigate it for the good or for the bad
but it starts with the the action perception loop it starts with the action
a lot of few other pieces on that teach a very good point like when we see the pragmatic component
of action as self-fulfilling epistemic component of action having to do with gaining knowledge and
the salience of information but the pragmatic component is about bringing our observations
into alignment with our preferences and then you identified two related settings one of them is like
pure intra subjectivity like I expect myself or I find myself or I habitually think about x well
that's kind of a trivial self-fulfillment because thinking about something is its own
fulfillment and then when we're in this second person or social space we can agree on little
performance art or on a game and games give evidence to that that when people are able to
perform communication or message passing such that new expectations or preferences are set
whether more top down like more seeing like a state or more laterally more like collective
behavior then those regimes can be embodied and then you brought up a very important point about
the awareness of the contingencies or where awareness is of adjacent possibles or of counter
factuals so the body might be we could model its morphology as doing some computation but that
doesn't mean that the the morphology has an awareness or can explore a counterfactual
like bodies are not always exploring every counterfactual because skin is in the game
but again mentally it's very cheap and easy to consider counterfactuals and situational awareness
of social settings especially if it can be not understood but communicated opens up a space
where we're all playing prisoner's dilemma now there's parameterizations of prisoners multi-agent
prisoner's dilemma where tragically we just all defect all day and never learn there's also
parameterizations where you just start all cooperating and never defect and then the interesting
settings are where there might be like phase transitions or where perturbation moves the
system from one attractor into another attractor so there's just a lot of richness and that's the
work of building generative models in that iterated modeling process to unpack and refine
and active inference isn't going to have a stance on the prisoner's dilemma we can use
active inference to to describe the prisoner's dilemma but active inference isn't going to come
down on on literally even a little two by two game theory matrix so we can then extrapolate that
active inference is not going to come down with an opinion on something significantly
more rich and real than a two by two game theory matrix and so that work is what people enact in
applying active inference right and i think like my question is something like but insofar as like
humans try to constantly improve their social games how can we model that sort of a prior
or your actions or policies that enables that sort of like progressive
improvements or something well
you can we are assuming that we're trying to improve right we we don't know that but you
can model them as improving but like following Daniel's lead we're talking about these specific
games and contingencies they they did these these transitions from one state to another
specifically if you're talking about this modeling of social actors and talking about
several actors if you're modeling several of them will not be really linear right you don't
have like a easy smooth transition of improvement you can capture over time as modeling how they
might tend to go towards a direction and understand that as improvement but that takes
specific iterations that will not be fully linear i guess specifically if you want to
understand error and improvement instead of try an error but try and adding up into this
error like error improvement but when you're modeling specifically with dynamical systems
for instance you you you're not going to see a full linear story and i don't think you're
going to see that uh if you're modeling using active inference and multiple agents agents
i'll add one piece there so how can we go about modeling multi-scale social goals so
we could think about you know different citizens in a region and they the modeler is going to
choose what knowledge to realize in the generative model like what you put into the calculator it's
going to calculate upon now this happens to be a elaborate stochastic method but if we only tell
people yeah there's just your personal income optimized for that your preference is to have
that be higher well then the simulation is going to unfold a certain way if we say well there's
your personal financial income and then there's your city and then there's your region then that
opens up through through different mechanisms you know maybe an individual goes flat or neutral
on the personal in service of a larger win at a higher level well now what if the modeler says
it's not just about the financial income now we're also going to have this secondary criterion
well now different agents could attend differently to those two different outcome variables
and maybe there's one simulation where 50 only care about this and 50 care about that and it
works perfect or it doesn't work it's like a broad surveying you know or lego set or or grammar
or or active inference ontology for scoping very broadly and very inclusively but all the work is
in the real simulation developments and sweeping because very little could be said about a game
theory game if you didn't know what the parameters were in the matrix you wouldn't know whether this
prisoner's dilemma was going to be like an always cooperate or which agents with which strategies
would or wouldn't cooperate if you don't know what the matrix looks like so before the values have
kind of been filled in it's just like actually describing the adjacencies and the counterfactuals
and the contingencies of our scientific model but that's still prior to having the model in hand
and the model you know so now we're looking at that tree in the european forest
and it's like well if i had this tool then i could cut it down this way if i had this tool
i could cut it down this way or i could wait it's like that's alternative actions about that tree
now in the social science setting discussion of different scientific methodologies are like
counterfactuals about that social tree
yeah and specifically if you're navigating these kinds of game theoretical models if that's what
you're interested in you can even define in terms of prisoner's dilemma for instance
specific values just see what happens when everybody deflects and in how frequent
modulate those frequencies in terms of specific in multiple iterations how
how how are you gonna build up the weight or the tendency of deflecting again if your neighbor
deflected once and deflected twice or three times or and see how that will accommodate
over time how many times this agent will change its behavior until it stops changing the behavior
but that you don't really
that's that that again you use you might use a bayesian understanding a bayesian model for that
but it not necessarily explain
me
he does not necessarily explain the action fully i mean social you just you're modeling only the
interest of that specific actor i have a slightly meta question if i can ask both of you i'm not
sure how these calls usually go i'm curious what are your interests in active inference what do you
think like what brings you to active inference and like what do you think what do you think active
inference adds to our theoretical understanding and in what ways or something the right now go for it
well
i think i was trying to touch upon that before and how we can if you're navigating for instance
behavior in terms of game theory this kind of modeling if you're talking about like
trust games for instance you're gonna understand how this do addict interactions evolve over time
specifically over interactions but you don't have an account of change because i have very
limited options of actions and you don't have an account also on scales and i think active
inference tries to add a little bit an account on how you can scale that and how
how
how can add more parameters into the game and see how they evolve with a more clear
understanding a richer understanding that for instance when you talk about specific
interactions in game theory so when that's one one aspect that active inference kind of
contributes another point is because we have this parameterization that is
specifically in terms of belief updating and also in terms of dynamics
we are always talking about agents that will be situated and embodied and have a very specific
uh
synchronization with the environment all the time because when you talk about active inference
the action comes always first so you have a less you try to have a less reductive model
specific and when you want to model cultural agents and collective action i think that's
kind of desirable that's what you're looking for is it also your area of interest sorry is it also
your area of interest mine or is that laryna's area of interest laryna's what do you mean oh sorry
like my question was also like what brings you to active inference and i think you answered a lot
of ways in which active inference adds theoretical value but i wasn't sure like if that was also
your subjective interest or motivation it's my subjective interest yeah i'm curious to see how
that pans out right i'm interested in how that helps us to to think of this type of
uh
phenomena and i'm very interested in how this relationship for agents to collectives and back
again work like
and i think it might give us some well it gives us some very insightful way of modeling
these relationships
in navigating is as you want because this this uh feature of being scale free is kind of helpful
to looking things you can you can define your uh mark of blanket in terms of what you're interested
right and see what happens
i don't know yeah i'll i'll i'll just give a few thoughts even though also surely some of these
thoughts are are scattered um you asked tj what does active inference add to our theoretical
accounts of the social it does many things in in my view and that's what makes it so valuable
epistemically and pragmatically it gives us the expressivity within a scale to describe
collective behavior and across scales to describe nested systems so that brings continuity to
discussions of the social with broader discussions of the biological ecological
computational physical and so on so that's a multi-scale transdisciplinary element
active inference provides us with legible first principles which can either be taken
instrumentally as just heretics and also in certain situations can be viewed empirically
as justifiable first principles and then from those legible first principles which are not
english specific they're already in a space that has a lot more
possibility and promise then for example a mere enumeration of important adjectives or nouns
we can develop lists of important adjectives and nouns
when we have a broader cognitive modeling framework and so this methodological turn
then supports just a tremendous diversity of thought and work instead of asking us to kind of
go through the eye of the needle and you know get on board with this one ranking of features
and then try to apply it more broadly that's like an overfit before the cart situation
with active we can expand the methodological discussion connect it to theoretical physics
and mathematics in ways that really haven't been seen before and then that opens up more
than it closes down it brings up more questions than it resolves in and of itself but it opens
the questions that can be resolved like what generative model can I make that will keep the
temperature in this building livable but active inference isn't going to have a stance on what
you should do for that building so we need to in a way take a step in the methodological direction
which I see as moving towards active inference to enable a million steps in different directions
I have a bunch of questions here I think one is probably just a reference question
the three topics that I'll say if you guys have any papers or articles on those things I would love
to like get a reference one is in what ways can we model a collection or an aggregation of active
inference asians as a like super agent or like super like active inference super agent or something
and like how does this like decomposition and aggregation like flexibility work in different
contexts like if there's like work that tries to either make informal commentary or formal
modeling either ways I would love to see that secondly just quick on the first just on the first
check out the previous section of this course on collective behavior where I reviewed many
such works great thanks okay is it on the same notion is it linked from the same notion things
all in the same places and in the same playlist with this course same syllabus yes good okay
the second is is there an active inference account of say markets or economic interaction
