Hello and welcome. It is September 12, 2023. We're here in the Active Inference for the
Social Sciences course at the Active Inference Institute and having a discussion section
on semiotics and semantics here with Lorena Saganzula. We're going to be having a fun discussion,
I hope. If you're watching live, please feel free to write any questions in the live chat.
If you thought about joining and you weren't sure, it's not too late. Otherwise, we're going to
pick up on some key points from the lecture and on the topic and see where we go. So, Lorena,
welcome back and however you want to begin, let's go from there.
Okay. Hello. Thank you, Daniel. So, let's try to recap a little bit where we left off during the
lecture just to remind us where we were. My point, what I was trying to articulate was the idea of
what does it mean to talk about formal semantics in a way that is not really
loaded because it's an interesting thought to have a semantics that is actually only formal.
In principle, it would be relative to meaning. In the notion that
active inference is trying to cash it out. It's more like an idea or a way of modeling how
how we deal with meaningful situations. And she understands that in a more interesting,
more embodied and more concrete way, I was suggesting that we could use bio-semiotics as
as a model and as a theory for leaving creatures like language users to navigate the realm of symbols.
And gave one example which came from James Koch, which is the European forest
trade that comes with a practice. Understanding this scientific understanding of forests as a
practice that allows us to refer to meaningful things in the environment in terms of what is
valuable, what's interesting and what is not. And interestingly, what is more important also
from what becomes valuable, it is what is cropped out from the meaningful perspective. So things
nature, parts of nature becomes left out or understood as something that is not desirable.
And you just understand what you don't want in your articulating principle as weeds or
something that you should get rid of in respect to what is more desirable in terms of crops and
how you understand nature in a more commoditized way.
And I find like this example from Scott kind of very, very elucidating.
In the book he creates this, in the book he's talking about states, how we articulate
life around one specific notion of state. But in this specific example he has
the idea of one official observer and this official observer establishes a principle of
meaning in a way you have to have a handle of nature and that also articulates how
villages and how practices around agriculture and how people relate to each other within these
practices gets organized. Specifically for one interesting point that he makes that is to appreciate
to appreciate the constriction of that is like a vision that notices not
what within the meaningful crops but which is left outside the field of vision.
And I bring that specifically to understand how
the free-knit principle can or could be connected to a generalized synchronization
over time in relation to those symbols and those practices in terms of niche construction and
how those, how this niche construction brings along with the symbolic
use of our language, our predictive value.
Thank you. Bryn, do you want to bring up any thoughts on that or any other
pieces or I'm happy to add a comment.
Okay, guess not. A lot to say there. There was a little bit of a double play with what is cropped.
On one hand what is cropped is the industrial crop that is being prepared and then the other
side of that coin is what is cropped out and what we crop in is the part that we're paying
attention to and we can't pay attention to everything so it's like two sides of the same coin
what we pay attention to what we include in attention in our cognitive awareness
leaves the shadow which is what we exclude and that could be like the weeds or the other ecosystem
services so by highlighting the meaning or one dimension of meaning or one stance on meaning
that only it's like a seesaw that becomes salient to the extent that something else
must be deprioritized so that's how we accentuate these distributions of meaning
and what do we get from active inference and and free energy principle beyond for example
what's provided and seeing like a state. I think there's a lot we could say on that but
one piece is we get a process theory a real procedural approach to how different systems
come to do sense making and cognition and action so just describing the lay of the land
or the history of forestry in Europe or any other state of affairs in the world
merely describing it may not even help us determine what's going to happen
a short time later let alone a long time later or what might happen in a very different ecology
whereas if we understand the processes of sense making and decision making that different kinds
of cognitive agents do certainly humans also those states as cognitive entities which is
what seeing like a state or thinking like a state entails we get a process-based view
on what otherwise might be merely descriptive and along with that process-based view we gain
an increased ability to make unique explanations predictions accounts and so on.
Yeah we can we can also understand it in a different perspective in terms of
realizing what becomes sensitized and what becomes desensitized
along the process so you can you can possibly model that using this kind of tools and understanding
how that happens over time right I don't know how how much in terms of prediction
of things that we're not foreseeing in these descriptions we can we can achieve in fact
you can achieve some some level for sure but like that system should be this side how
how that delivers a very all-encompassing prediction in this kind in these cases they
don't believe it can right I don't think that's the purpose as well but we can at least have
which is might not be as positive as we want but I think we can understand how
we can gain some understanding in this process of being more sensitive or less sensitive to specific
primes and how this organizational principles how powerful they become over time
yeah I'll read some comments in the chat and then Lorena or Brent feel free to just give
any thoughts just upcycle club wrote hello biomimicry can enhance biosemiotics by showing
us how nature solves problems and creates beauty through signs and codes and by encouraging us
to apply these principles to our own creations yeah the idea of coding is an interesting idea
but to talk about codes I don't think we can that's my take right I don't understand
like you have we haven't coded any type of principles within our cognitive ability but
biologically speaking however you can understand these encodings in terms of becoming more or less
sensitive over time to environmental cues as the example in terms of I use the example of
forestry right so in that specific case this what becomes more what you become more sensitive and
the more you organize your life or the social life is organized around specific principles
then you can make sense of these relational stories instead of just leveraging one full
difficult to explain notion of encoding in terms of social cognition because it will be hard to
explain how the brain will be encoding these specific symbols but they can be cashed out
in the environment relationally in terms of those organizational principles
and then you have this idea of biomimicry like this reiterations and how that comes along with
to explain what this mimic or this mean will be then
of it's not so so straightforward they think
well certainly decompiling the source code of nature is somewhere between challenging and
misguided or impossible but that notion of a code script for biology has animated discussions of
life going back to for example Schrodinger's what is life he basically says there's two
aspects of living systems there's their organizational capacity their negentropic capacity
and then there's their code script their aperiodic crystalline informational repository
and then another place that coding comes up a little bit less in the source code space is
predictive coding and that's in a way highly compatible with active inference and gives a
deflationary account on how the semiotics are encoded rather than saying well this is what this
variable in the source code means or this is what this codes for or here's a code switch
predictive coding is like saying we're not even going to touch the semantics of what the sign is
itself we're just going to hypothesize that the way that information about the sign is transferred
is through this maximum information signaling approach called predictive coding because predictive
coding arose out of video compression algorithms and only at the end of the 90s was found to be
increasingly relevant for neural circuitry and so on so it's another example of where like a process
based approach ends up deflating or reframing the otherwise semantically loaded question
it's like switching out the question of like where we're going to be with how we're going to get there
and instead of only focusing on the meaning of the signs first off as if the meaning of the
signs could be discussed outside of their implementation and then even if we could figure
out what the signs were we would then just turn around and want to know how they were transmitted
and so predictive coding or predictive processing in a way short circuits that or
inverse it by first looking to explain how information is transmitted that could support
semiotics and then in the context of biological systems we naturally have biosemiotics
yeah i would ask the question when you talk about information being transmitted right what that
actually means and i think that's a very very big topic and a very large discussion in terms of
uh information information theory when specifically applying that into biological systems i think
there are some interesting people working on information that makes the case that Shannon has
a point and he's really interested not in the semantics or in the meaning or anything else it's
kind of interested in the problem of transmission and when you talk about transmission
it's worth to ask what is being transmitted exactly in the terms of of signals even if you're
capturing specific patterns and you think that the pattern is this thing that will be transmitted
in that sense but that would be a worth
a worth asking question to understand like the this notion of what is actually being
transmitted in that sense like the information probably this information theory is focusing
on this notion of the problem of transmission and then all the the concepts that come along to
explain that in terms of uncertainty or noise and everything that uh impacts this transmission
of processes and if you're saying like we're transmitting information in these things that
is breaking this semantic code apart yes it is because like the problem is not focused on that
it's that focusing on the specific correlations that we have that we call it we're mentioning
as information and how these correlations are an issue from from the cat go from what is being
picked up in one side being correlated to what comes into the other side right how that how do
you lose or gain more information in that but the deeper question here is
how can you say that you are actually gaining or losing that information because you are defining
this correlation that could be transmitted or not from the cat go if you don't have that
you don't have anything being actually actually communicated
so with that in mind you can explain these concepts in terms of function and then there's
a bunch of theories that navigate this sense of uh signaling that is specifically only functional
and then predictive coding tries to
try tries to push that a little further maybe but then you have to explain in
in a deep sense how this information is being actually transmitted and processed and I don't
think that is really really as obvious and as clear as we think it is
specifically when we're talking about this biological
way of nature navigating this process this this signaling
we have to talk about because the correlation if it's defined are being issued like from the
beginning you can only have this kind of transmission for someone specific that can
be able to understand that in the other side right
well certainly whether we're talking about a chemical pheromone that requires some type
of receptor or something more ephemeral like language that requires more of a semantic reference
frame there's no receiving the message without the sender it's like they're kind of the two
sides of the phone call um I'll ask a question from the chat love evolve how about cultural
encoding and principles in contrast to organizational so how do we think about
cultural meaning and is and is that similar or different than organizational
yeah that's that's a good point right I think if you take very seriously the example from
the forestry is a practice then I think it has to be organizational in that sense the meaning
navigates this organizational practice this organizational story that
that impacts not only communication between agents but also how
how the environment will be interpreted so and in this sense it will be transmitted
and repeated over time because it has a history you cannot ignore like the history of this
practices being pushed further and replicated through generations right so
the way like the villages will be
organized in terms of that specific practice for instance can be understood in a meaningful
and cultural way that organizes life in virtue of
some specific principles that sensitizes our agents towards specific directions
and I think
I don't I don't forget my point for instance you can talk about
if you think about archaeological findings and how archaeological
so descriptions of specific villages and how they navigate this mapping out this
this archaeological sites they usually know exactly if you have some kind of history already
from this this communities how this how that city will be likely to be organized
first off like where is the water and if the water is in certain directions probably
there will be certain kinds of relationships with housing and communal housings and where
are they going to place their dead in relation to this kind of specific organization principle
the water is here so plantations will be not so far away from that and this city organizes
like the village organized a little bit in this sense and that builds up cultural practices
at least archaeologically can be explained as such
I thought of something similar organization being the logistical or the operational structural
aspects so those would be the roads that connect the forestry outposts or the circulatory system
that connects the different organs of organization and then the culture is a cause and a consequence
of organization organization is the enabling conditions for culture to arise okay so given
this road network what cultures arise how similar or different are they convergently what are their
practices or their narratives that are shared amongst these different outposts
or in the bodily example okay given the organization of the organs literally the organizing
process or principle then what biosemiotics can arise with glucose and insulin and glucagon
and what culturally can arise maybe even in terms of the generative model of encultured
agents as a function of organization and then what are those encultured agents do
to the extent that they can modify organization and so these kinds of
um unrolling cause and consequence relationships can be hard to disentangle
because there's not like a clean single starting point that can be separated out or because it
unfolds historically it's not exactly a reaction in a test tube
so how does active inference give us an entry point into thinking about this
yeah that's one interesting thing about active inference that you
you don't really need one uh you don't really need an origin point right you can
start start modeling you start understanding that at any any given point and build up from
from that story and see how it unfolds over time i think that's the most beautiful idea that you
you define your parameters and then you see from that parameter that can be arbitrarily defined and
you can navigate how things change within those parameters in the generative model right when
you when you have your like dynamical systems for instance you have your state space they have
some specific range of defining parameters that set the limits of the possible states that you're
going to navigate and if you use this notion that this two densities brings about in terms of
Bayesian modeling you can use these these kinds of tools to understand how from that specific
parameters update why what we narrate in active inference as if belief updating can change over
