to explore it in a more rigorous and practical way, and also practical and a tractable way.
So this is the area that I believe philosophy and science are beautifully intertwined into a coherent
view of not only the phenomenon of interest, but even about the whole world.
Wow. Wow. Pretty cool. Yeah, a lot to say about that topic. After completing chapter seven and eight,
you've seen the kind of two major branches or two major motifs of just one kind of modeling.
But these kind of models have so many different forms that that's why it's such a hands on process
to specify the generative model in chapter six and fit it with data in chapter nine. Those are all
what's required. And that's kind of the last mile of where these discussions about general motifs
gets you. But also playing with these pedagogical models can be really helpful, because it will
help you understand the basic patterns and relationships and start to see see different
patterns in the graphical models and know from there what levels of technical processes can be
kind of coarse grained over. All right. Okay, well, that's it. I guess next time we will do probably
nine, 10, and maybe something else. All right, I'll end it now. Thanks, Holly. Thank you.
