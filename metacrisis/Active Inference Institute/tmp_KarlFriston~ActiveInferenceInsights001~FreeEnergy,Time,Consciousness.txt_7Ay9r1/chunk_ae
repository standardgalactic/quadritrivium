and the same principles applying at each and every scale of the universe so that you would
at a very very fine time scale and a very very fine spatial scale so in the quantum scale you would
have lots of very very fast hot stones moving around where the random fluctuations predominate
and there is very little of this kind of long-term itinerancy now technically that results from
some a certain aspect of the way that you can always decompose any dynamics any gradient flow
so I've spoken about the dynamics exclusively in terms of gradient flows flowing down the
flowing down the free energy landscape say on a statistical manifold being my favorite picture of
that that denies a really another really important aspect of the flow which is the flow orthogonal
to that gradient flow known as solenoidal flow or divergence free flow so the way that I look
that I look at this through the lens of a sort of classical physicist that would predicate
everything on this random dynamical system or large one approach is that you've got a
continuum between the very small and the very big where now we're not talking so much about
sort of the degree of nesting of Markov Planckets but simply the contribution of random fluctuations
to the dynamics and the important thing to bear in mind is that there is any dynamics any flow
has this solenoidal part this conservative part and this dissipative part that inherits from the
random fluctuations so if you're very very small then all the random fluctuations have not yet
been averaged away and the dissipative part predominates over the conservative part the
solenoidal part which means that at the very very small scales you are effectively in the world of
thermodynamics where you're effectively ignoring the solenoidal part so everything is
dissipative you get fluctuation dissipation theorems you know integral fluctuation theorems
and then you can drive generalizations in the second law and all that good stuff
and then as we get bigger and bigger and bigger the course-graining implicit in the
what's known as an RG operator in the renormalization you know I look at this as a grouping and
dimensional reduction a course-graining entails an averaging and as you average the random
fluctuations average out to zero so now the dissipative part disappears and you just left
with this solenoidal flow which is just the conservative dynamics of Newtonian mechanics
and Lagrangian mechanics and the solenoidal aspect is just a description of like the moon
going around the earth and the earth going around the sun it's things that have orbits stable orbits
or quasi-periodic orbits that are approaching deterministic simply because they are very very
big so the interesting thing happens in the middle where you've got a mixture of dissipative
dynamics and conservative dynamics what would the conservative dynamics look like well they
would look like this sort of itinerant oscillation it would look like the same kind of classical
conservative oscillation that the moon does but it will be much more itinerant it'll look like
a biarrhythm it will look like a life cycle it will look it will have that property that we
associate with living movement so you know we talked before about the fact to be autonomous is
to move it is to have active states one would also argue that movement in and of itself is not
sufficient you know the moon moves the oceans move are they biotic in their self-organization
i think you've been looking now for a special kind of movement which emphasizes this solenoid
a mixture of solenoidal and dissipative uh dissipative dynamics um so sandwiched in between
the very big and the very small is a goldilocks regime where indeed you do have this opportunity
for the biotic kind of self-organization that characterizes our existence that is not only
um manifest in terms of delicately crafted solenoidal diversion three dynamics but also
nested at different timescales so just think about all the different timescales that your
body entertains solenoidal dynamics um rotational dynamics from the fast gamma oscillations again
in that hippocampal neuron through to your cardiac cycle through to your respiratory cycle through to
your diurnal cycles through to your slower cycles right through to your life cycle
and so on and so forth and then you take it up to any scale you want but the key thing the point
being made here is that not only do you have this admixture of dissipative gradient flows that
underwrites self-evidencing this is in the context of this solenoidal flow at multiple scales at
nested scales so again we come back to this sort of this deep nesting um so on that view there will
be a goldilocks regime and of course it is only at that in that regime will you ever get systems
that start to self-model and communicate and co-construct their their niches will you get
cultural niche construction will you get the kind of will you get language will you have
conversations like this it's not going to happen at the level of macromolecules or cells and it's
not going to happen at the level of heavenly bodies but it will happen at our level um
um uh and clearly has happened if i can believe my senses yeah i guess the
yes i guess the i mean my follow-up my my inevitable follow-up would be why are there
these different sizes but i don't i don't want to get into that because then it's just turtles all
the way down about why i mean we can bring it to close very quickly but that's it it is turtles
all the way down that's i think a fundamental insight uh and once you once you commit to that
everything starts to make a lot more sense so um you know just in terms of um you know how long
will my markoff blanket last where it will last you know for a long time at my temporal scale but
the um the scale above um will last much longer so i have an environment and a niche
that lasts longer than i do and my body lasts longer than anyone's cell and my cell last
lasts longer than any one intercellular component and you know that component will
last longer than any particular macromolecular configuration so uh so it is all the way down
and you need it at each level you have to have the context being a thing having its own markoff
blanket at its scale in order to um provide the context for the faster coming and going of markoff
blankets at the lower scale but in the same sense because the larger scale inherits from the dynamics
of the lower scale there's a circular causality which people like george ellis would cast in terms
of top down and bottom up causation put simply what that means is i cannot exist well but let's
put it another way my hippocampal cell cannot exist unless my brain is in good shape my brain
cannot be in good shape unless i'm doing good active inference and relating correctly within
my family in my conspecifics my conspecifics cannot work uh exist unless there is um a biosphere
that sustains that kind of life the biosphere cannot exist and and so on and so forth all the way up
and all the way down and every level there are things and those things have to have markoff
blankets and at every level they can be construed as doing some kind of elemental inference uh or
self-evidencing um the the story we're telling though is the special kind of self-evidencing
that comes out at a particular scale but the existence of that scale requires exactly the same
um repeat from the perspective of the renormalization group it requires exactly the same dynamics
or the rodent or functional form of the dynamics um at you know at every level and you know on this
view because the explanatory target or the free energy principle it's basically relational it's
trying to understand self-organization um of a thing that can be individuated um in this context
and in terms of what it is contextualizing it's a very myopic ambition it doesn't describe you know
cosmology or um you know the universe uh you're not going to get electromagnetism from the free
energy principle um um and so it doesn't really have to worry about when does this you know when
what is the largest scale what is the smallest scale you can keep on going all the way down
and if you had to hedge your bets because i guess it is a hedge better bet bet hedger rather
um does it stop does does the does is it or is it just it just goes on marco blankets on marco
blankets yes yes mathematically yes yeah there is yeah it's a little bit like you asked me uh
where's the um um where's the edge of the earth when does the earth stop you know yeah if you if
you're committed to the re-normalization group um now it just keeps on going forever um that um
and you sort of i'm quite comfortable with that because um you know it emerges from a sort of
a question which is what is a state so we've been talking glibly about state spaces statistical
manifolds and states of affairs that were named states and latent states um to have a state space
and particularly specifically to have a um a state space that could be that can be interpreted or
construed as a statistical manifold you have to have states but what where do states come from
and the argument sorry i shouldn't ask you the argument is that they are the states of things
where do things come from oh we just said it's a partition of state space
where did the states come from and if you try to answer that question um then you all you have to do
is basically um determine the mapping between um things or particles and states and the answer
is quite simple it is it is basically one way of looking at this sort of um the or using the
apparatus of the renormalization group but the state of a thing is the state of its Markov
blanket states um and then the the then that state itself now has a Markovian or a a partition into
Markov blankets so you now get blankets and blankets um and so that you can resolve the
paradox or the um the catch 22 you know what's the state of something well what's the thing well
a thing is it is determined by uh condition independence among the states you know you
can resolve that infinite regress just by saying it is just a recursion the you know states at one
level inherit the averages of the Markov blanket states of things at the next level but at every
level there are things so you have this um you know you just keep on going down I should say um
you know there are people who believe that um there is a smallest scale or it is sufficient I'm not
absolutely sure about this but if you ever get the chance in later life if you can talk to uh
again people like Carlo Rovelli or Steven Wolfram um you know from the point of view of quantum
loop gravity or from the point of view of the Ruliad um then the you know there there is this
notion that there is some irreducible um um smallness scale uh beyond which you can't go
and then the game is how do you get a continuous world out of this sort of quantum discrete um
very very small description of things yes yeah yeah yeah strange loops makes me think of
Hofstahler and strange loops also makes me think slightly of the holographic principle
what you just mentioned there about projections onto the screen um this this notion of um reading
off the Markov blanket you said something that I said we had three things that I wanted to talk about
and we covered temporality albeit over a long temporal scale I wanted to very quickly ask you
mentioned um in passing um about celestial bodies being nearly deterministic and my is pricked up um
I've on an internless model of the free energy principle I sense that there's actually a kind
of licensing for free will because we have this internal model and we act upon the world is to
confirm the model that we we wish to we wish to observe on an externalist perspective where
we really are no different from another physical entity except for the fact that we have the
possibility of moving things and and acting to to self-evidence there isn't so much space for free
will but my is pricked up when you spoke about agency and when you spoke about the celestial
bodies being nearly deterministic because it makes me think it seems to imply at least uh
heuristically that being open to the environment being an itinerant being licenses agents agency
but I want to make sure this is true metaphysical agency in the sense of not hard determinism
or whether this is agency in the sense of self-conception as a free agent because those
are two different things um it's we won't be denying that we perceive ourselves to be free
I guess the fun the more fundamental question there is whether that's an illusion or not
and so I was wondering whether free energy principle has anything to say about a kind
of libertarian versus deterministic perspective on free will um well I mean you could certainly use
the the the um the free energy principle to tell stories that speak to those arguments
and I think you picked up on some you know some of the key parts of those stories
so your deterministic chaos that you get with body problems when thinking about so
massive bodies dancing around each other um you know there is still chaos in mix in the mix
so there's an unpredictability and sensitivity to initial conditions in
the good old fashioned way of non-linear dynamical system theory of a deterministic sort
but once you get to um you know things like you and me um you're really in the world of
stochastic chaos say the stochastic bit inheriting from the the random fluctuations where you've got
two kinds of um if you like or two aspects of uncertainty and implicitly then in modeling
that uncertainty um the opportunity to talk about sort of free will and selection um one
interesting twist here is that the um if you watch you want to apply the free energy principle as a
principle of least action to things like you and me um what you have to imagine is that we are
deterministic things in a stochastic and chaotic world um so in making sense of things we only do
so at a particular scale we're talking before about the averaging away but I'm sufficiently big
to average away my random fluctuations under the free energy principle that literally means you
have to take the average of lots of neurons so the kind of sense making the kind of uh dynamics
that you would simulate under the free energy principle applies to and only to the ensemble
behavior where you can average away any of the stochastic estimates so you will not get you will
not be able to deduce evidence or um solicit or find evidence from the free energy principle by
looking at single neural or single synaptic it has to be at the the ensemble level where the the um
well there are sorts of arguments where that has to be the case but um from our point of view
it's when the random fluctuations are averaged away um so um I'm just qualifying what I'm saying
I'm not saying that the brain is stochastic or shows stochastic chaos what I'm saying is
that the brain has to provide an apt explanation or approximation um to explain stochastic chaos
um and crucially um the um stochastic chaos associated with our own behavior um with the
consequences of our own actions so you've got a deterministic system trying to now model a
non-deterministic stochastic chaotic system and and you're in so doing well that's easy to do because
of course we're talking about um that modeling being in terms of belief or probability distribution
so that's absolutely no problem um so um on that view I think you could easily motivate um free will
of a certain kind um in the sense that you when uh when you're planning you have effectively to
select amongst different models of the future technically this will be based on model selection
and selection is an act and so again we have a different kind of agency here but it has it's a
kind of agency inherent in the selection amongst competing plans or policies narratives paths to
into the future um that I think has all the space to um say that this and it's you doing the choosing
remember you can't there's nothing on the outside that can influence directly that choice on the
inside so from your point of view you certainly have free will would it look like you have free will
from the outside um um I think that's a more vexed question uh of course you'll never know but
but uh I think you'd probably you'd be in the game of of a game practically how I spend most of my
day job is inferring to what extent is this artifact or this person
um doing good um planning as inference good planning um you know for example if somebody's
in a coma or in the bedroom or asleep or has a psychiatric disorder um you know you you need
to know to what extent they are um and in what way they are self-modeling um so you know um
this is a slightly sort of clinical and abstract example but it illustrates the point that you
will never know whether something has free will all you can do is infer that they are behaving
as if they had a generative model that entailed a self-model and and thereby a model of the
consequences of action and therefore as if they were a true agent and possibly they may know they're
a true agent they may not you know they may be again um you know that would require another
level of of the Markov blanket is that what you had in mind yes I mean I think um I guess that
the kind of hardline determinist response would always be pushing you to say whether that organism
or particle could have done otherwise so it may have this reflexive quality of okay I'm doing
Bayesian model selection to my sense of self and we will come to consciousness because I think
that's the kind of crux of this issue is why is any of this happening online anyway but it might have
this self um reflexive notion of being a free agent but the hardline determinist from the kind
of external position of physics might always say well could that bundle of atoms ever have done
otherwise in terms of its Bayesian model selection but it's it's again it might just be one of the
these sort of loops that just keep spinning um yeah it's it's all um fascinating I had a question
that I've just popped out of my head when I was talking about free will which was um
I will come back to it I will come back to me um consciousness
I know it's I don't know if it's being considered I don't know if we can call it a red herring yet
in um the academic world because it's become a very hot topic um and people are getting very
heated about us and there's no need to bring up particular examples of when people have got
heated about it but people are very invested in their theories and I guess rightly so it
seems to be this one thing that people can't seem to couch within their theories of everything
if they have one do you let's starting with a very simple question do you consider it to
