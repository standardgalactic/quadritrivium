and this is the thing is just the level of a hierarchical generative model that we're ascribing
to the dynamics of some internal states. I think there's a third story you could tell which is
possibly where you're going which is how it relates to consciousness. In the sense and this is a very
simple story that if I am forming beliefs and doing belief, Bayesian belief updating as prescribed
by active inference about the consequences of my actions then that has to be in the future as we
just said and perhaps certain things think deeper into the future than other things. But notice what
we've done here it's about my actions. So not only have you committed to temporality and temporal
depth and temporal thickness as an attribute of things that plan and more like you and me
but you've also committed to agency. So now you've created from something that was previously not an
agent into an agent where I'm using agency in the sense that one would not say that a thermostat
had agency but you would say that I have agency in the sense that I have beliefs about the consequences
of my action and I will or can be described as using those beliefs to select a particular action
and I'm going back to predictive coding formulations that that selection would basically
I'm going to predict the state of my multiplanet or my autonomic nervous system and provide the
right set points and then the active states will actually reflexively fulfill those
prophecies, those predictions and everything is working properly. I'll be a good alastat
or in Russian terms a good homestat. So what you've done there is bring agency into the game
and I think that again this speaks to the inactive part that you now because you've got beliefs about
the future and specifically the future that you have caused that you have authored you have now
become an agent. So we have I think got this this stage to consciousness and self-awareness
but I think we've got the necessary foundation that there are only certain things that have to be
agents I think to be conscious of themselves as agents as doing things as things that exist
in a world in the sense that their existence is manifest in terms of the consequences of
the way that they act upon that world. If it wasn't you wouldn't need any of this you wouldn't need
this temple thickness you just be you know you just need the apparatus of a stone or a thermostat
to do your sense making but as soon as you've got agency in the game I think then you've got
something which takes a step closer to having a very deep and possibly it's this irreducible
Markov blanket there of the generative model or level of a deep generative model which actually
now starts to entertain the hypothesis I am an agent which you don't need but you could
and you have to ask yourself why would you ever want to entertain the hypothesis I am an agent
so this would be minimal selfhood just a representation that I can be in different
states of mind and those states of mind are something that underwrite or I can condition
on in terms of what I am going to do and that doing could be internal it could be how I deploy
attention in terms of precision weighting in predictive occurring so it could be covert
action or it could be overt action I could now select certain plans at a lower level that would
be then enacted by my motor system or my autonomic system if I was that kind of creature does that
make sense it makes sense and it's opened up a can of worms in my head well inevitably because
we bought in lots of concepts here and I want to try and unpick them for people at home and for
myself but it's fascinating so I'm loving it so let's keep going along this along this road
we've got agency consciousness and temporality as these three things I want to have a little
look at starting with the first thing you mentioned as a response to my question about
temporality that we have a deep hierarchy in which more deeper levels of the hierarchy are
tracking slower fluctuations in the external dynamics and therefore contextualize and constrain
the higher order faster dynamics is it are we in this model are we invoking time as a fundamental
aspect of this external dynamics or is it an inference that the that the that the organism
is making about the nature of reality that it's experiencing well that's again an excellent
question it certainly does not it does not address time perception your in terms of the
psychophysics of time perception does it address time in a more fundamental sense I don't think it
does in a sort of sort of folk psychological sense it's really so the the answer to that question
normally is framed in terms of relative movements in a belief space and so if you think of time as
part of some metric space time then what you're talking about is time as something that can be
measured time that has a a distance a milliseconds or seconds or under like could me could me as
a generative model ever have access to or build hypotheses of time as a metric yes we certainly
could however it would be very difficult you're ignoring sort of internal clocks and the like
well naturally no you have to ignore internal clocks you then ask how do you do it and normally
what what the story the story is it's the the number of moves you make at one level relative
to another level of a deep generative model and the number of moves is quite crucial here in terms
of tying that down mathematically and my favorite way of thinking about the number of moves is
basically something called the information length and the information length refers back to something
we've mentioned before which is information geometry so as if you think of our so one picture
of the free energy principle it's a quite a technical picture but I think it's quite useful
is that our internal say brain states or the internal states of a thermostat
encode a probability distribution a Bayesian belief a conditional belief about some latent states
which means that for every state of the brain there is if you like a point in the state space
of all the physical states of the brain but each point in that space now stands in for a probability
distribution and that means that this is a special kind of space because it is equipped with a metric
what is that metric well it's the KL divergence well the pathological infinitesimally small KL
divergences as I move through this space so this is what this this is what defines information
geometry the information geometry is a very particular bit of mathematics or theorizing
that applies to very very special state spaces or manifolds where every point in that on that
manifold corresponds to a belief or a probability distribution so now what if the metric is the
the KL divergence or you know the information length which is related to the the accumulated
KL divergences as I move from one point to another and what we are saying is that the
the number of moves I make the number of units as measured with the this kind of metric this
information geometric measure which actually technically is this visual information is
basically a description of the precision by which I measure whether I've changed my mind
so if we say that I've made n moves that means I've changed my mind n times and I know that because
I can measure the information length and I've actually moved a significant by a significant
by a measure that is large simply because it is large in relation to the precision that
that provides the distance between any two points on this so what that means to put it very simply
is that time can be measured by the number of times I change my mind at level n in my hierarchy
divided by the number of times I change my mind at the lower level so now you've got a relational
you can gauge time by the relative degrees of belief updating your the information rate which is the
confusingly the the the rate of change of the of the length with with time but where time is now
contextualized by the level above or by the level below so you have this very relativistic view of
time and you could have different levels you know I would imagine if you you attend different
levels of your hierarchy you could get a very different kind of time perception indeed we know
the attentional set and in conditions where say taking psychedelics or in things like Parkinson's
disease where where you get changes in the neurobiological encoding upon certainty and therefore
this fish information metric you can get distortions and different senses of time
so what I'm saying is there are probably as many different
senses of time as there are levels in a hierarchical model and it can only really
be measured in a in a relative sense in terms of how many moves do I make at one level
in for any given move at another level so that what we've done now is if you like
take temporality off the table to the extent now that we're down just talking about movements in
an information space or a belief space that has this kind of information geometry these are really
fascinating issues I think yet to be fully explored my friend Zaf has done probably some of
the best work in in in this area but you know it is it is to my mind a really interesting issue
because you know it really forces you to think about the what you mean by separation temporal
scales and what we are what what kind of cost grading over time is implicit in this kind of
move from one level to to the next level does that address your what you were what you were
yeah I mean as I was saying this is all really interesting and again something I hadn't thought
of before in terms of in terms of this in terms of this contextualization process being about
moves which implies to me that there has to be it's like this sense of time is contingent on
these moves that are being done at the different levels of the hierarchy does that process itself
not imply some dynamic some temporal dynamics how can one distinguish a move of 10 relative to a
move of five without having segmented moves in some kind of space-time geometry yes it is exactly
that segmentation that appeals to the information geometry so you know how would you actually do
that segmentation how how would you measure the amount of belief updating in universal or clock
time at one level of a hierarchy and this is where the information geometry comes in it's
basically the number of different brain states that you have entertained during your movement on
this statistical manifold or which is also you know I think very nicely articulated in terms
of belief updating so you can literally think of this sort of the space that would be traced out
if I were to plot the activity of all my neurons on every axis of some very high dimensional
state space that would be a statistical manifold my belief updating which is a continuous process my
gradient flow is literally moving on this manifold the distance I move is the information length
that literally scores the degree to which I change my mind it's also mathematically the
information gain as measured well closely related to the information gain as measured by
KL divergence between my prior and my posterior after I do my belief updating and I'm moving
on this manifold and the question is you know how far have I moved and can I segment that into
units and that's basically what the information length allows you to do so I love this picture
because if you just think about what kind of flows on this manifold would be prescribed by the free
energy principle because the free energy is a functional of the beliefs encoded at each point
then the free energy is a landscape on this statistical manifold so we are perpetually
falling downhill on this manifold the free energy gradients are themselves and the free energy is
itself changing because my beliefs are changing so I've got this lovely itinerant you know model
or picture in mind where I've got a statistical manifold it is now where I have gradient flows
where I'm flowing on this manifold using a gradient flow on free energy where the free energy now
provides a waddington like landscape chasing minima all the time and of course that chasing
reflects the fact that the free energy itself changes as you move around the manifold because
your beliefs are changing and the free energy is a functional belief and then you introduce this
notion which I think is really important the notion that the high level of a deep model
provides the context and what would the context look like in terms of this free energy landscape
well it means that the landscape would change so you know I've got this gradient flow which is
from on a fast time scale just flowing down the landscape down the landscape but at the slow
level the landscape is itself now changing all the time so I'm perpetually chasing minima
and moving minima because the gradients themselves are contextualized and are changing slowly so you
get this deep structure to the temporal dynamics which has this very non-Markovian aspect so now
we've got this interesting picture where things like you and me that are big where big just means
that there are lots of Markov blankets that constitute my deep generative model that enable
this separation of time scales you've got this picture where each level is now providing the
landscape for the level below with very very fast changes but of course these are now changing the
the landscape is itself changing so that now you've got a non-Markovian model of a universe
that we know is Markovian so we know because we started if you remember right at the beginning
with this notion of a random dynamical system that is usually associated with things like
a launch van equation or you know a Markovian process and so we're starting from a Markovian
universe with effectively no memory and now we've found things inside this universe that look as if
they found a non-Markovian explanation a coarse grained sense sensible and sense making explanation
for their sensory impressions that is quintessentially non-Markovian that has this deep
temporal structure of the kind you find in language yeah the whole point of say for example
your hierarchical Dirichlet process models of natural language right through to the
current focus on transformer architectures in large language models they're all about breaking
the Markovian they're all about finding non-Markovian explanations for what at the end of the day
must be you know a Markovian process and you may ask well where does that come from well
if we spend most of our time trying to model input where that input is generated by things
like us and we are complex deep things that generate non-Markovian actions and in fact our
universe now becomes non-Markovian simply because we have other things in it that are sufficiently big
to have these deep generative models and then you go to language and communication and
you know the itinerancy which is I think quite unique to us you know I don't think you'll find
this kind of dynamics if you get too big and certainly as we've already discussed it can't
exist at a very macroscopic scale so even in your head your macromolar kills in the 16th
dendrite in the ca1 field of your left hippocampus that doesn't do any planning it's too small
it doesn't have that requisite depth of or nesting of Markov blankets
so small stuff can't do can't have this separation temporal scales and this particular
deep itinerancy and sort of your Markovian breaking like property but interestingly when you get too
big you also can't do it either so you go on the motion of the heavenly bodies the the moon and the
sun and the like they don't plan and you know it's interesting to ask well why not well because
they don't have because a lot but effective because they're so big all the random fluctuations in
their world have gone away and you now are left with classical mechanics so you know you could
sort of get termistic chaos in body problems but there wouldn't be a description that would
be usefully interpreted in terms of planning as inference or active inference in the way that
we've been talking about so I think there's a golden lox regime you've got to be big enough
but not too big to do this to do this kind of planning wow amazing yeah I mean it's
it's bringing up all of these existential potentially fluffy questions in my mind
which I I would like to sort of ask at least one which is we could ask why let's take the
macro structures the celestial bodies black hole the universe itself we could ask why why in a
mechanistic mathematical sense do they not have this kind of non-marcovian temporal horizon
so there's a mathematical answer to that which or a physical physical in the sense of being
explained by physicists there's an answer to that there isn't necessarily an existential answer to
that and I guess I do not expect a concrete answer because I'm sure there isn't one but
millennia has been dedicated to the question of the human condition and why maybe that itinerancy is
so fundamentally defining of our nature which is that we can't seem to kind of sit still we are open
and the world is affecting us so we're affecting the world as you said and we're in this constantly
dynamic coupling I guess I would love to just hear intuitive thoughts that you might have on
why the universe would unfold in such a way that you do have a goldilocks own
why why is it the case that things like us
have this wandering openness rather than just being either in the soup or being
firmly rigid forever if you have any thoughts on that
you are yet not well formed thoughts but I mean it is a fascinating thing to reflect upon
I think the answers that someone like me would give you would inherit from a
sort of a classical view of physics as opposed to a quantum information
theoretic view so you may get a very different answer if you ask somebody like
Carlo Revelli or Stephen Wolfram or you know my friend Chris Fields
but if you're happy with a sort of 101 physicists response to that the way that I would look at
that is through the lens of the renormalization group which just says that things exist at
different scales and there is a you are looking for explanations of those that scale
free behavior in terms of laws that are dynamics or Lagrangians technically
that are conserved over different levels and for the free energy principle that is just the
the dynamics the gradient flow on the free energy defined at each level or each scale
and that leads you to then a view of the same kind of things sorry the same kind of processes
