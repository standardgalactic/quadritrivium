licenses there to do that uh you can certainly see how it would work in terms of projective
geometries in metric spaces um but the deep question is why you know you know i can't um
i can't imagine a um you know uh an amoeba really having having a notion of space um i may be wrong
and so knows um um you know if you listen to people like um um steven warfram um you know
the notion of spacetime um itself may the illusion of spacetime itself may be just an artifact of
the fact that our sensory organs respond very very slowly in relation to the speed of light
so if light traveled very very slowly imagine a world in which um um we saw with sound and sound
was very very very slow um would that would that be would that give you the illusion of space um
you know and distance as an action of the kind that you know we sort of implicitly assume when
we're talking about sort of visual objects so i think he has this nice notion that you know in
this kind of world um with these kinds of sense organs um you know when something moves from here
to here is it the same thing anymore because that's what you're saying when you have a metric space
in which objects move um you know some certain symmetries or variances are inherited from the
notion of movement in a metric space but that may well just be be be a fantasy we've gone off
qualitative experience in the hard problem yeah well no i mean by the way it all ties back it's
a beautiful it's a very good question which is why would this why would space and time be a
an in the interface for us i guess that is the deep question um and yet it appears that at least
it it is something at least in conscious awareness i did remember my question and it
actually feeds into the last couple of questions i will have which is you mentioned um that you
spend a lot of your time inferring in the technical and layman sense whether other people have i think
you say good generative models there's an interesting question here i think which which
i may have had intuitively when i started reading about active inference which is is there any such
thing as good self-evidencing in the sense that i may so so a loss of of course you know as you wrote
a lot of papers a lot of psychiatric disorders and psychological disorders have been rooted in
disruptions to precision weighting mechanisms for example can we consider are the words good
bad optimal suboptimal are these useful terms in this context or is it that that individual
has a set of priors which are different from you and i and everyone else and we all actually have
a sense of we all have kind of different priors so all self-evidencing in unique ways and yet
philosophical vagueness allows us to clump us together into a group is there such a thing as
what it is to be a good self-evidence as a human with beyond beyond just a trivial point that we're
not just dissipating into the the heat bath yeah that's an excellent question um so i i think the
answer to that is yes um but as you correctly pointed out they should be qualified by the the
complete class there so you're clearly referred to the complete class so it might be just wise to
um just define what that means and the implications for discussions of good and bad
generative models so the complete class in the way i like to summarize it is that for any given
pair of behaviors and loss functions there exists some priors that render your behavior
base optimal which means that there is always a description of every behavior as base optimal
under some priors so in that sense you can't be good or bad where the thing is basically your
decisions because this inherits from basic decision theory so it's not quite full as
active inference in accommodating information game but within the within the confines of
basic decision theory you can't be you can't be good or bad you just have different priors so
my favorite example is that you know if we were all went to live on um on mars or a much heavier
planet people with Parkinson's disease will probably be much better have better priors
sub-personal priors in terms of dopamine deficits because you know they move more slowly and then
sort of more more cautiously yeah so you know i think from the point of view of the complete
class so i think it's important to bear that in mind you know there are just different priors
but i i do think that you can so just say well hang on a second what about well they're good
and bad prize and i think then we get into this again this hierarchical story because of course
as soon as you have a hierarchical generative model there are no prize you know everything's an
empirical prime everything can be contextualized everything is conditioned for everything else
including your prize and then you're just back into the um into the game of self-evidencing
what is good self-evidencing it's achieving a higher martinal likelihood or model evidence
how would you do that by finding the right priors how would you do that by learning how would you
do that by changing your model with basic model selection or structural learning how would you
do that at an evolutionary scale you do basic model selection with natural selection so yeah
on that view the log evidence as bounded by the free energy
is just adaptive fitness is how well your priors are adapted to this world you are trying to explain
so i think yes absolutely you can you can you can be a good self-evidencer you can be a bad
self-evidencer if you're in natural selection that matters because if you're a bad self-evidencer
that means you won't be around in the in the next generation so the marginal likelihood if you
existing at an evolutionary timescale is low so the your your evidence is also the probability
that you will be found exist you will exist so it's quite important to get to be a good self-evidencer
and because that's your marginal likelihood of existing and i've now slipped in another
synonym for free energy beyond prediction weighted prediction errors or beyond surprise or surprise
or self-information beyond log evidence it's also it's just it's called the log marginal likelihood
it's the the likelihood of your sensory exchanges with your world your eco niche having marginalized
out or averaged away all the unknowns which in this context are all the states out there
you know the hidden causes or the sorry the external states which you model in terms of hidden
in terms of hidden causes so yeah i think it's very important to be good at bad at evidencing
the measure of goodness and badness is just the marginal likelihood of the moral evidence
and the free energy there is nothing else if you're saying does that speak to
some creatures that will be able to actually assess how good they are at self-evidencing
then you see absolutely people like Mattias Joffily looked at this specifically from the
point of view of emotion and developed a whole taxonomy of emotion in terms of
rates of change of free energy and you're going to stories of slope chasing
looking for gradients and gradients and gradients of self-evidencing on the measurement of the
goodness of self-evidencing which is which is which is the free energy and more refined stories
more recent stories would basically be looking at certain kinds of uncertainty being encoded
explicitly in your generative model as underlying affect particularly the the you know the certainty
about what you want to do next for example then we get back to the story that Mark Somes would like
to tell which is the precision of your beliefs is the most you know the most important attribute
that defines you know its valence and that you're you're feeling at this sort of minimal
effective level yeah yeah the complete classroom is an interesting one because
I think it leads people it leads one into a potential these potential strange conclusions
it makes me think of animals that commit suicide oddly so I think sort of
aphids might explode themselves in the context of a predator it ultimately comes back down to
your model evidence I guess so I am the type of creature that will commit suicide if I'm in
the presence of a ladybug of course but then those kinds of examples I sense for me
show that the words good or bad I'm just pushing a little bit back just intuitively
the words good or back in in in the form of continued existence slightly put the cart before
the horse because who said that that's the imperative so if I existed in the world and my
everyone's imperative was to no longer exist you know god forbid then that then I would be doing
bad self-evidencing on that standard if I didn't if I continued to persist so is there a point at
which even the yeah like do you see how well do you see that argument holding any water
or is it just now we're just so dissolving into semantics
well no no I think I think it's an interesting thing to to contemplate
you're you're you're basically I think undermining that particular argument by
a proof abduct to absurd them so if you think you are the kind of thing that will
self-destruct or to evite or commit suicide then you can't exist because you killed yourself
so I will be extremely surprised if there were any common natural
subhuman artifacts that kill themselves I didn't know about the avid example I'm very I mean
obviously Lemmings is the sort of popular culture one but I think they were extremely rare
and then you have to understand the selection at an evolutionary or transgenerational level
in order to apply the free energy principle but in you know I think you're absolutely right
I'm very mindful that a couple weeks ago I was asked to review a paper applying active
influence to suicide and it was a very artful paper and I do remember thinking not to show
whether the point was made implicitly or explicitly in the paper but you know it's it made me think
in the exact other way that you were you were talking about you know the imperatives to survive
and are they the right way to think about the causes of our behavior and I would say absolutely
no not this is not about wanting to survive this is simply wanting to avoid uncharacteristic
sensations and then we put up post hoc hypothesis oh that's because I want to survive then right
and that's a fantasy that's another illusion so you know we do not know what it is like to be dead
so yes it cannot be a but it can be surprising but it certainly can't be the kind of surprise that
you'd register in terms of a free energy so it's not that we're frightened of being dead
we are going to avoid by these pragmatic constraints states that we've have inherited
that portend cessation and dissipation and death death in or itself is not at all frightening
we've got to sleep every every you know suspension of God is going to sleep every every night so you
know I I would I would sorry yeah and the final point I think is I think what you were doing though
you were probably creating a slightly vexed and self-defeating argument by saying by assuming that
we can understand things in terms of imperatives the whole point of the free energy principle is
there aren't any imperatives this is where it starts things that exist must behave like this
and part of that behaving like this means that you can interpret them as optimizing something
and complying with imperatives but that's just an interpretation you'll bring to the table when
you apply to something else if you then apply it to yourself then you know then things might get
interesting you might have hard problems but there are no imperatives you know in fact even
minimizing free energy is not an imperative you can have the free energy principle applying to
things that have very dissipated dissipated attracting sets that have very very high entropy
all it's saying is that there has to be a certain gradient flow that counters the random fluctuations
then you ask yourself well hang on a second so why does it look as if we're always trying to
attain some very precise homeostasis and the free energy principle will return that on its head
and say well look okay in some universes there may be very precise things and these precise things
what would they look like oh it would look as if they were trying that they had aspirations to
evincing a very precise homeostasis and indeed hella stasis so you get this notion of another
kind of natural thing which are precise things and so if precise things exist it would look as if
they're they are compelled to comply to very specific imperatives but from the free energy
point of view it's not saying they exist because they comply with the imperative it's saying existence
implies it looks as if they have this imperative right now and one final point you know I'm aware
that we've we've now approached in three hours well final point though I've you introduced the word
optimization I think that was the right and important thing to introduce because you know
it's only when you bring free energy into the game as a bound on marginal likelihood or self
the negative block marginal likelihood with the self-information or surprise or surprise or
do you convert an existential description into an optimization problem so that's exactly the
move that Richard Feynman made when he introduced variation free energy he had this impossible
marginalization problem that to actually evaluate the marginal likelihood of paths so exactly the
same kind of problem that we talked about in terms of what am I priors over policies and plans and
paths into the future you can't you can't evaluate that exhaustively analytically and practically
physically not realizable so the marginalization problem the true inference problem if you like
the true existential problem if there is one and cannot be solved but what you can do is
introduce this bound and turn it into an optimization problem so just by using free energy
or just by appealing to this teleology that comes from predicate anything on this evidence
lower bound you are actually saying that it looks as if creatures that exist are optimizing
something what does it look as what are they optimizing it looks as if they're optimizing
a bound on their marginal likelihood or their adaptive fitness what does that look like where
it looks exactly like Bayesian inference or if you talk to somebody machine learning it would look
as if you're optimizing your negative variation free energy known as an elbow so this is an
evidence lower bound it is exactly objective function used in sort of high-end neural networks
like variation autoencoders so you know I think that the distinction between just being and optimizing
is quite crucial and you're absolutely right that once you make the move
of framing things in terms of variational bounds using variational calculus or variational Bayes
then you have actually committed to an optimization narrative
you don't didn't have to just to exist your you could
yes yeah I was going to have this funky philosophical argument about
needing to exist to predict but I won't go there I won't go there because we are going to wrap up
all of this philosophical mathematical thoughts and consciousness thoughts has brought to my
mind Thomas Nagel Thomas Nagel has this idea that death is bad because life is inherently good
and we've been talking about life and being and what it is to be and what one needs to do to be
and persist to be if we're going to wrap everything up is there a sense in which that kind of related
to what we were just talking about in terms of imperatives of course there is no imperative to
be in any sense but you said it was an interesting thing you said there was it looks like we are all
being anyway right even if we didn't have to it looks like we are there's no god
granted plan for us to be but we seem to be doing it anyway does any of Nagel's
romantic philosophical idea that life is fundamentally good being is good does any
of that resonate with you yes it does because it's it's it's you know it's nice isn't it
and I think you'd probably you'd probably sort of license that with with phrases of the kind
that you know to exist is to be curious so this speaks to this sort of you know the ability to
respond to epistemic affordances and certainly you know to exist as curious creatures is obviously
the good way to exist in your in any given world and it's your would be mandated I can't resist
saying though of course this only really applies to you it doesn't apply to me so you are good
because you are curious and you exist I wish I could say the same for me but I can't strictly
speaking but you could if you wanted to I could I could abstract to you it's up the
great I can infer that there is a you great um and then I guess we can wrap it up there with
one more question we've just spoken about life being good I'll flip the question I don't think
I've ever heard you talk about death although we briefly touched upon it I won't make it too
personal but if life is kind of good in some sense because of the concomitant parts of
living as we do as I don't know if it's good to be a stone but it's nice to be me having these
conversations would that make death bad is there is there is there is you said we fear dying because
we fear in an affective sense um that which we don't expect to the states we don't expect to embody
and in some sense we don't expect to embody death because it doesn't fit in with our priors
but beyond that free energy principle perspective is there a broader position in which
just returning back to the fabric of the universe is bad is there something to say about
reentering that mark of blanket does do my mark of blankets dissipate um what does that process
look like and does that strike fear in you or strike awe um well more awe but I don't want to
overstate it um so it is it is beautiful um from a from a pure mathematical point of view um so I
I have a very sanguine view of this and we've already said you know you've never been dead I've
never been dead so no one can tell me it's an unpleasant experience um so I I'm not particularly
I'm not going to um avoid being dead I certainly think all the all the paths to being dead are
probably very surprising and unpleasant so I'm going to avoid those um death in and of itself I don't
think is uh is is sort of um quintessentially bad um in the same way that um natal being curious
and being engaged with the world is a good is it is good while you exist um um I think that's
perfectly okay but I think death is you know um the the life cycle that's kind of a life cycle that
