that it's slightly less um um viewed with um morbidity um the life cycle is is is quite important
because um if you just look at um if you just take this um multi-scale um um view of um self
organization cast in terms of this Bayesian mechanics um the you know for example natural
selection being Bayesian model selection um then um if you put that together with what we're talking
about before about um ecosystems and niche construction constantly changing the lived world
then what you need to do is to do constant Bayesian model selection um in order to get
the right structures very much in the spirit that we talked about before where there are good
priors and there are bad priors in the sense of the marginal lighted or adaptive fitness
to learn those good priors you sometimes have to start from scratch again um with a different
structure and of course this is exactly what Bayesian model selection does by structure
learning at an evolutionary timescale will entail death so that picture basically says that we have
to keep keep refreshing sort of sometimes cast in terms of Bayes optimal forgetting so the fact
that we die our base is could be construed as a Bayes optimal forgetting where we are the environment's
memory of what is good for this eco niche but the environment on this natural selection knows
that the environment is changing so what was good last generation will not necessarily be good for
the subsequent generation so it has to forget in the same way that you learn by forgetting you
have insights by dispensing with redundant information so in a sense death for in that
life cycle is an essential part of um uh of the self-evident of the species so it may be
bad for you I suppose you know in a natal-esque sense in that it's denying the opportunity
to be curious and engaged with the olive world but it's certainly good for your children and
your children's children right right right I'm a I'm a forewarning for them that's good
I'm glad I'm glad to be that pawn in that game and a kind of cheery note on which to end
will be a slightly more morbid question Carl this was an absolute pleasure
despite the occasional wi-fi hiccup I think it's um it's gone you know I've been incredibly happy
with it thank you so much for being our first guest um and answering my suite of sometimes
questions it was a real joy on my part right well it was been a real pleasure talking to you
your questions were excellent I have no idea how long you're gonna have to spend editing all this
I thank you again for that opportunity to uh you know to talk about these wonderful issues
and hopefully we'll do it again excellent thank you
