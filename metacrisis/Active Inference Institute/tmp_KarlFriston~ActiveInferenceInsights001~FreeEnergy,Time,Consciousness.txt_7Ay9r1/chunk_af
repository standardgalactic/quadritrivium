be a real problem do you take something like the hard problem seriously or for you is it
more of a meta question or can it all does a deflationary account just do the job in terms of
the hard problem um it really depends who I'm talking to as my friend Jeff Beck would say
it depends which pants I'm wearing so yeah I think I think very much it's it's a question of
um a conversation and you have to you have to infer how much investment the person you're
talking about has in this issue and what position they're taking um and I mean that you know just
in terms of being polite and engaging you know with integrity and scientific uh debate or indeed
philosophical debate but I also mean it uh in a slightly more fundamental way that consciousness
is is an illusion um and but and I think illusions are fantastic they're literally fantasies and I
think that's what makes our brains fantastic organs I think they're hypotheses I think the
illusion is um the thing that we uh that we test it is the thing that generates the predictions
in predictive processing so I think consciousness is another illusion um very much along the lines
that one reading of Andy Clark's basing qualia paper um that even qualitative experience qualia
are just illusions they're just things they're just constructs we bring to the table including
selfhood um they're just hypothesis illusions that are particularly apt at explaining everything
that we sense and making good sense of it as as a a parsimonious hypothesis consciousness itself I think
is exactly that because it only applies the hypothesis is that um is this thing conscious or not
only applies because there are other things in my universe that I'm trying to have to model like you
so it's the question is not whether I am conscious the question is whether you are conscious and of
course we've already said that is an answerable because you have a markoff blanket so it's an
unanswerable question but crucially it's a question about the things I observe that I'm trying to make
sense of um it only becomes I think um only in the spirit of the meta hard problem or the meta
problem um it only becomes um um vexed when you make the mistake of asking am I conscious
I don't think that's what the question is there for that's the illusion is not for me
it's for you the illusion is the consciousness is a construct hypothesis and a very plausible one
all the evidence that I have at hand would suggest that you are conscious and indeed literally
because there is that evidence it is there in the sense of an evidence maximizing illusion
hypothesis or component of my generative model so I I go through that just to make it clear that
the answer depends upon who you're talking to but also who you're trying to ascribe consciousness
so if I was talking to um
well if I was talking to um people like Jacob Howie um you know the first thing he'd say is
that the free energy principle is not a theory of consciousness and in fact he's like saying that
every at every opportunity so there's nothing there's nothing um there's nothing in the free
energy principle that has anything explicit to say about consciousness on the other hand
people have used it in different ways to address the hard problem um uh you could take the view
that Andy Clark takes that there isn't a hard problem and perhaps even with David Chalmers's
work recently on the meta problem the meta problem that's from your more interesting problem
um or you could you could grasp the the nettle and start to talk about it if you were talking to
my colleagues Chris Frith and um and um Adam Saffron and Maxwell Ramstead and
and uh oh oh this and that um certainly um so I think inspired uh by something that you mentioned
earlier on which was the holographic principle in um in quantum information theory where the
holographic screen now plays a role of of the Markov blanket that separates the inside and the
outside in terms of bulk reading and writing to um the um the um the holographic screen um
if you're talking to him um then he would start to talk about these minimal screens these minimal
Markov blankets um and develop quite a quite a sort of nice argument that if you can't reduce
in the sense that we're talking about nested Markov blankets inside a Markov blanket
if there are no more reductions at hand then the only way that the internal states of that
irreducible Markov blanket can know about their own existence is by acting upon lower levels
and therefore there's some um there's something unique that there exists a unique Markov blanket
that that your um maybe um um have the attribute of of consciousness um if you're talking to something
like Vanier Weiss um um he would you know tackle this in terms of um trying to resolve
uh a dualistic position by offering a dual aspect monism um of a Markovian sort
and that rests very heavily upon this information geometry so if you remember before we're talking
about sort of a state space equipped with free energy functionals um on it um um that um plays
a role of a cisco manifold but but there are two cisco manifolds that are jointly sit up sit in this
in the same state space of say neural activity one is that for any given point there is a
probability of being there from a point of view of neural activity and the thermodynamics
so this would be a thermodynamic um kind of information geometry and then the other one
is what the free energy principle uses which is the encode using that point to encode beliefs about
external states so you've got two um information geometries belief structures if you like um that's
super been on exactly the same um material um process one of which is pertains to probability
distributions or beliefs about the internal states and the other one is probability distributions
or beliefs encoded by the internal states about the external states so you could constrain one
as being the mental and one as being the material and then you've got this dual aspect monism where
you're now asking questions about or what are the lawful relationships between the thermodynamic
free energy and the um the um the variational free energy that pertains to beliefs about things
so you've got now a mechanics that talks about beliefs and that may well be one way of repairing
that sort of a dualistic approach and there's another another perspective which you would get
if you were talking to talking to people like um uh julio tenoni and um cereal um well my colleagues
involved in one of the templeton foundation abyssal research collaborations um where you're
trying to find bright lines between the free energy principle and integrated information theory
which is not necessarily the best thing to do because a lot of integrated information theories
exactly conciliate with the free energy principle however if you are going to get funding by
trying to tease them apart then the thing that distinguishes those approaches to
consciousness is really the the active part that we're talking about so uh boiling this down
in a way that something like I repeat jakob how it might might articulate this is it's the
difference between seeing and looking you know to be conscious I have to look it's not enough to see
um it's um you know to be conscious I have to listen it's not enough to hear
so you're putting action into games as active sensing this in this sort of closing the the
loop between the inside and the outside maybe um the thing that um is necessary for consciousness
and simply because you're saying that consciousness is an attribute of agents
and agents have to act what do they act on their sensations what does that mean the they do active
sensing so to be an agent is to be an active sensor yes to do active inference um and you know
if you're saying that things that aren't agents can be conscious then you wouldn't worry about that
but if you are committed to a deep um to the notion that to be conscious um of to have a minimal
selfhood um then you have to have the notion of self if you have to have the notion of self then
you have to be an agent if you have to be an agent you have to um have generative models about the
consequences of your agency your actions uh and that has to have the temp and then we go through
the all of those nice links that we've talked about before with temporality and you know and the
like and indeed the hierarchical structure takes us back to the chris fields um irreducible um
holographic screen or or um or markoff blanket so that would be the way that i would um converse
with that crowd uh and i've run out yes i've run out of people that i might talk about it
uh so i have to find out what you like and then i'd i'd tell a story that you like let you tell
a story that that you like well i guess my question to you would be can you imagine a world
of self-evidencing can you imagine okay let's put it another way can you imagine a perfect
replica world like ours where the lights are turned off entirely there is no consciousness
or is it do you imagine it's a necessary uh consequence of the way that creatures are like
like us are structured that to do deep temporal planning to do planning as inference whatever
it is or self-hooding we need consciousness could there be another way the universe would have
unfolded without us being online um i suspect not um sorry i i'm i'm torn between um um been taken
by you down sort of your philosophical zombie roots versus um another um story that comes out
in a free energy principle about consciousness which is um the um the the the the importance of
self-modeling in relation to other modeling and the fact that we are actually living in a world
of things like us so and one story i didn't cover which is a story you would tell if you
were talking to um my friend chris fifth or people who are much more interested in the sort of social
neuroscience and uh or say attachment theory um and you know neurodevelopmental issues um that are
induced by a sort of evolutionary psychology view or niche construction for example all of these
views of consciousness means that consciousness is just there um which is where i started to infer
um the state the disposition the intentions state of mind of somebody else um why and how can you
do that well you can only do that if that thing is sufficiently like you to be able to use your
generative model um as obviously your physical actions as a model of their physical actions
to infer their intentions and the like um and when one takes that to its limit then um often
what the real problem is is not in terms of inferring the content of some communication or some
um exchange of of um semiotic cues it really is inference about agency again it's did you do that
or did i do that so that ambiguity now requires you to have a model of self versus other so it's
a much more relational um um notion of self so you know sometimes i think people talk about
minimal selfhood um as something which is monolithic i don't think that's necessary as
part of generative model it certainly would be important to have um different um different kinds
of self you know am i embarrassed am i in love you know as we were talking about in you know in the
tmb meeting a few days ago um that would be you know an expressive and very necessary part of
generative model where i have to contextualize my own emotional and pre-social and or autonomic
and motoric behaviors um but there's no one self it's his self you know self like this like this
like this a more fundamental relationship relational aspect of selfhood is in relation to
otherhood you know mom um you know versus me and am i mum or is your um is is mother thing
am i a thing i'm the same thing as mum as you know he's going to sort of climb in um uh um so
arguments there so put simply what that means is it may well be only in universes or worlds
that are populated by ensembles of conspecifics that are sufficiently similar would you need
to selfhood simply to distinguish itself from other in a universe where there's only me i wouldn't
need selfhood so it would not be it would not pay its way in terms of model complexity or model
evidence to have the notion of me being a self if there's only me it only pays its way if i now
have to actually entertain the hypothesis that either i caused that or you caused that
so the question now is is it inevitable that you get a universe with lots of similar things
emerging all disambiguating themselves or attributing agency to themselves in the golden
uh in the golden zone i think it probably is i think that would be i think if you simulated
sufficiently accurately artificial life i think you would you would get the emergence of
populations of similar things and they would niche construct and they would thereby drive their own
um so nest increasingly nested and structurally complicated um only sparsely structured
organizations in terms of their Markov blankets um and this would um this at some point would
inevitably invoke um modeling of others and therefore almost by default um a a minimal notion
of uh of self of selfhood i think that would be emergent you know um but it would require being
in the Goldilocks regime for a sufficient amount of time for this kind of niche construction uh
culturally construction to actually play out so you know you'd have to have this very slow
timescale providing the right kind of context for this this kind of thing to uh thing to emerge
yeah yeah i think my what i have some i think i have some sympathies to the to the argument that
charmers were laid out in or did lay out in 95 in his original hard problem paper which is that
i think i can still ask the further question which is can systems like me make the functional
distinction between myself and others without there being a sense of what it's like to be me
can that just be an offline-ness which is done purely in some algorithmic manner which need not
involve some qualia of my self-ness so yeah there's a point that there's an element in me
where i don't want to say that that in a sense resolves the hard problem because at least i can
hypothetically envision that being done offline um i wonder whether you've given much thought to
mark soames's idea which is that consciousness might be rooted in affect because this seems to
mean to be a bit more of a self-confirming idea which is that feelings must be felt now i think
there's still an open question there which is affect arises at the point of uncertainty
and drives us to resolve uncertainty and when we do so we feel good about ourselves now again
i still think i when i was reading his book i still had this open question well why would that
have to why would why would affect even emerge in that place why wouldn't we just have this drive
to resolve that uncertainty without there being the online-ness so at least for me
although i may be wrong and i'm very happy to be wrong there is still no simple parsimonious
explanation which can get around this um this point that charmers makes which is you can give
me the function but you still you can't give me the explanatory power why it needs to be online
um and i wonder if there ever will be some mechanism which is sufficiently
which isn't just purely tautological or invokes consciousness as some fundamental reality
which makes me which makes me wonder whether you've heard of donald hoffman
whether you're familiar with his work because i sense that in some ways it has some interesting
implications maybe for the free energy principle in the sense of space and time not being fundamental
units of reality we've been speaking a little bit about how um where do space and time come from
how much do space and time overlap in the sense of generating um like we need
expanse expansive creatures like us with embedded mark of blankets inevitably have
a sense of temporal remodeling and there's these interesting interactions does the idea of space
and time being what he would say applications on a desktop does that have any real do you sense
has any real ontological implications for free energy principle or is it a red herring
um well you've introduced two important things i forgot to mention mark so is another friend
so i would say it's all about this irreducible mark of blanket that acts upon the rest of the
brain whereas that action it's going to be in the neuromodulator systems that set the precision
the precision is exactly that fissure metric which tells you about how much you're updating your
beliefs it is the way that you do mental action it is as you intimated um feeling in the sense
that it is quintessentially balanced by increasing or decreasing the precision or uncertainty
so um that's how i would tie in mark's um formulation to which i think is internally
consistent with um say chris fields formulation or um of anus formulation so mark so uh focuses
you know on those i think a key aspect of um of active inference which is uh if you're a
psychologist it will be attention it's basically acting in a way on the inside to um get the an
estimate and deploy the right confidence or the right precision in um um mathematically the curvature
of the of the um the free energy in and of itself um getting that right um and um that has a lovely
you know connection to attention it means that you can't divorce um consciousness from attention
you can't divorce it from agency in the sense of mental action or internal action
you now have a deep connection to um thomas metzinger's um their distinction between
you know um opaque and phenomenal transparency um and uh and the way that mark would tell the story
would be that this is just feeling and feeling is at the heart of of any qualitative experience
so yeah thank you for the for reminding me he was one person i forgot to cover
the the second thing um you know the the space and time being illusions um i mean yeah i sort of
start off there so i i'm not quite sure that it so if you're saying that dolls um and i should
say he's a friend i think i've never met him but i think he's a friend of chris fielder mike levin
so yeah there's a small world here um but if you're just saying that um space and time are
illusions in the sense that we would talk about illusions as being fantastic and the thing that
makes us into fantastic little beings and have beings and um and our brain into a fantastic
organ yeah absolutely i mean you know the question for me is why on earth would you um what what
must be the case for us to have this illusion of spacetime and that we are living in a metric space
and it's practically very important i mean a lot of people spend a lot of time in machine learning
in bedding things in metric spaces um and sometimes it's very difficult to see what
