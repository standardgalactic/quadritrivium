through the through this stage of setting up the generative process this section provides some
helpful criteria or helpful points in order to help us in that stage as well so finally
after going through all of these stages we need to somehow get I mean obviously we need
results and we need to provide our results in a we get our results from our active inference model
and section 6.7 addresses that I mean that very idea of how to simulate visualize analyze and fit
data using active inference because it's not just enough to set up the model we need to get
the model to work so how can we feed the data into the model how can we read the data and finally
how can we analyze or analyze the simulated data through the active inference so this is
in a way a kind of preliminary recipe or preliminary procedure for doing active inference
or active inference modeling or at least suggested way to do those kinds of modeling
but in the subsequent chapters in particular chapters 7 and 8 we'll go through some
helpful cases studies for how to actually use these procedures to model some real world situations
awesome thanks well there's a lot to say on chapter 6
one piece that comes up a lot is what is in the active inference kernel the cognitive kernel
and what are situations that we can model with active inference there's a huge variety of cognitive
phenomena and statistical outcomes that we might be interested to study like counterfactuals and
planning like multi-scale attention and covert action like the complex ways in which memories
might influence decision-making in the moment based upon associations made between different
sensory modalities every amazing real-world situation you can imagine and it's really
helpful to think about active inference as more like a framework of interoperable motifs that we
can compose and indeed even be creative with rather than giving us all the answers at the core model
because the kind of essential minimal active inference model doesn't necessarily include
every single attribute that you might be interested in just like any given linear aggression isn't
going to include every single feature that you're looking for this is happening in a different
type of modeling framework but still there's a lot of customization and development that goes
into adapting or elaborating an active inference type model for your given system or scenario of
interest chapter six gives us some helpful guidelines and things to consider which we've
unpacked and expanded on elsewhere and in the textbook group we work together to characterize
different systems of interest to map different parts or different observables from that system
using the active inference ontology into a unified active inference type model so
chapter six starts the second half of the book which is the more practice oriented part of the
book and the rest of the part two is going to be a lot more about the specific kinds of
generative models that you can use discrete and continuous time and about using them with
empirical data in chapter nine but chapter six just stands alone as a summary of part one of the
book in some ways and a set of four questions which system or modeling what is the most appropriate
form for the generative model how to set up the generative model and how to set up the generative
process so that we can be active inference modelers ourselves
all right well Ali thanks so much for all of these great conversations and cohorts
we will be able to process this video to clip out these first versions of the background and
context overviews and we'll distribute them to the cohort so that people can show up with their
curiosities and passions and we'll see where that goes any last thoughts
thank you it was a pleasure to go through these chapters once again with each time obviously with
a bit more understanding than the previous one so i'm looking forward to the next cohorts
awesome all right thanks Ali very well
you
