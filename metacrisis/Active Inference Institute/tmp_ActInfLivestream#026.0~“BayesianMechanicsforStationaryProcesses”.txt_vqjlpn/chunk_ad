methods used to build adaptive systems implement the same kind of dynamics implicitly so the system
maintains a steady state with its environment so maybe there's this is a totally accurate
classification but there's some algorithms that are being connected on one side to each other
so we have learning and optimization learning is inference all of machine learning etc learning
and optimum optimization and then variational inference being used as an optimization technique
with gradient descent by free energy in machine learning and maybe in evolutionary systems
then there's this question about estimating latent causes in the world and connecting that to
higher derivatives in the integrator chains or as just variables under consideration
that's that mapping of external states which aren't directly seen and then maybe this one
goes on this side but there's this whole other set of algorithms related to adaptive systems
and these are framed variously but we have adaptive systems cybernetic systems
anticipatory systems holism homeostatic slash active learning allostatic agents all these sort of
biologically inspired yes drawing on far from equilibrium thermodynamics but here was like
the flame dissipating like it's about something that just sort of gets to its free energy
minimization just like gets there but with these active systems the question becomes
how do we take this ongoing multi-scale inference side and connect it to this multi-scale action
in the loop niche modifying also action planning biology section
um one friend uh looked at these slides and then made a comment and they wrote
i think it would be good to expand on the differences of the paradigms in section three
which were lettered as they were in the paper a priori a posteriori estimation afterwards
estimation predictive processing and variational base i get the differences formally but still
not at a super intuitive level so this might be good as a pedagogical exercise for ourselves
so that'd be cool maybe everyone can think about that and come to their own explanation for what
the difference is between these three and we'll talk about it in the dot one and dot two
then just a few of the implications and bigger questions that are raised by the paper
so in the section on interacting mark on blankets they write the sort of inference we have described
could be nuanced by partitioning the external states base into several systems that are
themselves mark off blankets such as mark off blankets nested at several different scales
from the perspective of internal states this leads to a more interesting inference problem
with a more complex generative model it may be that the distinction between the sources
systems we generally think of as engaging in cognitive inferential dynamics and simpler systems
rest upon the level of structure in their generative models i.e. the steady state densities
that describe their inferential dynamics so that's pretty cool about maybe this framework
or at least work in this level of analysis mapping just directly to nested mark off blankets
and it brings up this whole discussion about what kinds of systems can we model with active
inference so no one's saying that the stock market is an autoregressive model but people use
autoregressive models so what kinds of systems will we usefully be able to model with active inference
without really just getting into a debate about whether quote is active inference in the system
just how are we going to use variational base methods with modern twists and developments
related to cybernetics and multi-scale systems so that's like the instrumentalism side and then
the realism side is what kind of systems are doing active inference so there's maybe even a
realism of philosophy branch and then even maybe on the applied side like it's a philosophical
debate is the cell doing active inference doing free energy principle is it realizing certain
constraints of nature or how would we know what you know an ant is quote doing free energy
minimization in its brain and then on the engineering side it could be argued that if a robot is
implementing active inference code that it is actually doing active inference so this question
about designing systems within the active inference framework so instead of saying I think all internet
networks are active inference systems it's definitely a claim somebody could make interesting
claim but it's quite another thing to design a computer network that is within an ontology of
active inference then it would be fair to say that that network is quote doing active inference
so that's like realism and maybe for some it's more of an engineering realism others it's a
philosophical realism another implication a bigger question that arises in the paper is
about temporarily deep inference so they write this distinction may speak to a straightforward
extension of the treatment on offer from simply inferring an external state to inferring the
trajectories of external states so again moving from not just the point estimate current estimate
of external state that was what was presented earlier to inferring the trajectories of external
states which is to say decomposing their higher orders of movement this may be achieved by representing
the external process in terms of its higher orders of motion by solving the stochastic
realization problem by repeating the analysis above internal states may be seen as inferring the
position velocity jerk etc of the external process consistently with temporarily deep
inference in the sense of a Bayesian filter a special case of which is the extended common
boosy filter so these are cool things to talk about we could talk about what is temporarily
deep active inference what are the ways that the model deals with internal and external
categories and discrete variables how do we deal with the inference on external states and how
does that relate to our action selection and then what happens when there's a feedback or
some other type of interaction with the niche the informational niche the social niche the
Stigmergic niche so or other questions people can write um well that was
a sort of quick run through the paper and i'm not sure if i got each section 100 correct so it
will be good to have the author's perspective on a lot of pieces as well as a lot of other experts
who i'm sure could have said a ton more and better about some of the math but we can offer up the
same questions that we have for any paper like what might a good understanding enable what are the
unique predictions and implications and the unique developments of this paper what are some of the
next steps for free energy principle and active inference research what are the goals of this
research and then also to the participants and the authors what are they still curious about
learning so uh thanks for participating it was a fun 26 and uh we hope that you'll
join for 26.1 and .2 if you can or comment on the videos or whatever and uh thanks talk to you later
bye
