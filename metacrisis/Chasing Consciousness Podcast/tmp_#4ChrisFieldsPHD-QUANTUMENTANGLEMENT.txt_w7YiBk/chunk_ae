his wife's book, Meditation. If you're doing it, you're doing it right. Have I got that right,
Chris? Is that the title? Absolutely. I'm going to say it again because it's such a good title.
Meditation, if you're doing it, you're doing it right. It's just a brilliant tagline. So go out
and get that, guys, some really interesting and quite diverse takes by the sound of it on meditation
and you can always catch Chris, if I understand correctly, at the Science and Non-Jewelty
Conference. He gives some fascinating presentations there and it just leaves me to say thank you,
thank you, thank you, Chris again. And I hope we get the chance to catch up if there are more
developments on this in the second series and on into the podcast. So thank you for your support,
Chris. Well, thank you very much. This was a lot of fun. Well, brilliant. And good luck going forward.
Thank you very much. I really appreciate it, Chris.
you
