1. **Old Rocks and Earth's History**: The Earth has plate tectonics which means we lose a lot of ancient continental landmass to subduction. As a result, the oldest rocks on Earth are rare and often heavily processed, making it difficult to study the early organic chemistry of our planet. Mars is interesting because it lacks plate tectonics and has older surface materials that could potentially hold clues about early Earth or even signs of ancient Martian life.

2. **Chemical Pathways to Life**: The chemistry leading to the building blocks of RNA (ribonucleic acid) seems to be naturally favored, which is remarkable given that other chemical pathways have been explored as well. It appears that the early Earth's chemistry may have inherently driven towards creating RNA, although it remains an open question whether this is due to the chemistries we've explored or if it's a fundamental aspect of life's origins.

3. **First Peptides and Their Functions**: The function of the first peptides—before the development of a coded synthesis—is still unknown. It's possible that these early peptides could have formed by chance, creating structures or performing functions that gave rise to a selective advantage. This could have paved the way for a more complex and coded system of protein synthesis. Potential primordial functions for peptides include facilitating mineralization, stabilizing RNA structures, interacting with membranes, or enabling aggregation and phase separation. Experiments are needed to determine which—if any—of these roles was the first and most critical in the emergence of life.

4. **Experimentation and Discovery**: The key to understanding the origins of life lies in experimental evidence that can demonstrate how a primitive peptide could have been useful in a prebiotic context. Current theories are speculative, and without concrete experiments, we cannot definitively say what the first function of peptides was or how they contributed to the emergence of life on Earth.

In summary, while there are many hypotheses about the chemical pathways to life and the roles of early peptides, definitive answers require further experimental research. The exploration of Mars and other exoplanets may also provide new insights into these fundamental questions about the origins of life.
