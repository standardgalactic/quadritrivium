planning here so that calls into into action the sort of discrete state space model that we were
dealing with before this this partial observable decision process this set of discrete sequential
timing points and that's often very highly relevant structure of most simple tasks in cognitive
neuroscience. However we also need to actually move our eyes we need to we need to move our eyes
from one location to the next we need to know how to generate forces we need to know how to make
sure the eyes come to rest in the right location given those decisions and that calls into play
this sort of continuous state space predictive coding style model so how do we then how do we
then combine the two how do we deal with the situation where we want to predict a particular
location at a discrete level one of several alternatives but then also map that to a continuous
motor trajectory and this is where generative models get a little bit more complicated so
taking this a bit at a time what we've got at the top here is our mark-off decision process model
this is our discrete state space model in discrete time now at each of those time points we're no
longer predicting data specifically we're now predicting a short trajectory formulated in terms
of our continuous state space models so at time one we're now going to predict a short element of
our trajectory and this is very much like the sort of clustering model I showed you much earlier
that you take a discrete point and you map it to a point in continuous space with some probability
at the next time we then predict the next bit of that continuous trajectory so our priors for our
continuous model are now inheriting from the predictions from the discrete state space model
and then we can do the same thing again at the next time point and and so we can create a discrete
sequence from our our sequential model and at each point in that sequence associate that with a
short trajectory in continuous space that then predicts our continuous data allowing us to then
predict the proprioceptive information we would expect to get from the eyes when we're performing
a task at that sort and you can see that we now develop a hierarchical structure also in thinking
about the relationship between the bits of the message passing scheme so here we've got the
discrete bit of our message passing scheme our discrete microcircuit and a bit of the continuous
microcircuit here and the interactions between the two of those were making predictions from the
discrete one to the continuous one and then passing errors backwards to allow us to to update
the discrete element so interpreting this again neurobiologically you can imagine
that say we have some element of the cortex perhaps the frontal eye field that's making predictions
about one of several alternative locations I could direct my gaze we can then map that
via sort of output of the basal ganglia and the predictions about what policy I'm going to pursue
through to areas like the superior colliculus which then might make use of predictive coding
style networks of the sort depicted here to then generate eye movements as we've seen before
and just to show you that in action we imagine that these are population of neurons that at
each time point are trying to predict one of several in this case three different locations
at four different time points we can then map that through structures like the superior colliculus
and this is supposed to sort of cartoon the idea of a population code in the superior colliculus
but then results in the eye movement to each of those discrete locations
putting it all together we can then formulate exactly the task that I asked you to perform
earlier and see the result of an active infant scheme performing that task
and so here you can see it performs it very successfully by predicting sequences of eye
movements that are conditioned upon the discrete part of the model and the idea of maintaining
this belief about where the stimulus appeared and using that then to direct my policy selection
and eventually the movement I select I want to give you one more example of this sort of hierarchical
scheme in the domain of motor control and appeal to the same sort of simulations we were looking
at earlier in terms of the reflexes exhibited by that arm the generative model we're going to use
here is a slightly complicated one but here effectively involves transitions between different
locations that an arm could be in or a hand could be in which then predicts different locations in
some continuous space and different locations that a target might be in and that will then allow us
to make predictions about about given where some target is in some continuous space which decision
I'm going to make about the alternative points I could move my arm to and so here we have the
simulation where we have the target appearing as the black ball out of the out of the three balls
which is going to change at various points in time and our active infant scheme is now
selecting these locations translating those into predictions of continuous trajectories
and making the appropriate movements such that it reaches each of these target locations
and what's shown in terms of the the graphic here is also an interpretation of the message
passing in terms of the known anatomy of the motor system or part of it
we can perform various lesions to this and see whether they behave in the same way that we might
expect patient populations to so here we've induced a cerebellar lesion which effectively
involves a misestimation of certain precision terms certain confidence or variance parameters
and you see this sort of overshoot and this kind of oscillatory behavior in the way the arm behaves
that mimics what we might expect him as cerebellar attacks here
we can look at the higher levels of the model and actually have multiple
hierarchical levels of the discrete scheme and here what we've done is we've induced a
lesion in what might represent a frontal lobe lesion where now the model is able to perform
all the movements with perfect fluency but every time there's a change of context it takes quite
a while to adjust to that new context to deal with a new situation you'll see that instead of
moving straight there as it was before there's a lot more hesitancy and a lot more difficulty
constructing that long-term narrative because we've broken that slower hierarchical level
and here a final lesion that we can introduce is one that reduces my confidence in policy
selection so here this effectively makes me very uncertain about what I'm going to do next and
here we get a sort of a kinetic type picture and sort we might expect in a Parkinsonian type syndrome
so I realized that was quite a lot and I hope I'm not too far over time but I'll just try and
summarize briefly the key ideas that we've discussed so the first was thinking about this
idea of climbing probability gradients the idea that to maintain some form over time
and to persist we need to effectively be climbing these probability gradients all the time
we interpreted those probability gradients in terms of in terms of Bayes theorem and connected
that to the Bayes in brain and the sort of message passing that might be involved in
forming inferences about elements of some generative model and the role that might have
in cortical micro-circuitry we also discussed the role of action and the idea that that one way to
make our model better fit the world is to act upon it and one way to do that is to simply reduce
any discrepancy between the predictions from that model and the data that's coming in and the
structure of that is very similar to the idea of a reflex arc as is well known throughout
motor neuroscience and the final thing we thought about was how we can then construct hierarchical
models that allow us to produce simulations and theories that deal with much larger scale
networks in the brain and take a full sort of systems level view of how particular movements
and particular behaviors are generated through the inversion of particular forms of generative model
with that I'd like to thank many people who've been involved either directly or indirectly in
this work and I'll mention the book again which was mentioned at the beginning and a lot of this
talk was loosely following some of the structure in a couple of the chapters in the book so if
anybody's interested please do take a look I'm more than happy to answer any questions thank you for
your attention
