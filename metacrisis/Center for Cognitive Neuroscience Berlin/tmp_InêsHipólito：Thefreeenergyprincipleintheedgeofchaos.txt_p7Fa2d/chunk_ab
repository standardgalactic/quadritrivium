this allows us to now think about or bring into the conversation if we want the mechanistic
predictive processing explanation which is derived from the FEP describing cognition as
inference that aims to diminish free energy so then what we have is we have this mechanistic
explanation of a process theory that allows us to explain the activity in the brain in terms of
this coupling between internal and external states being mediated by by blankets and sorry by blanket
states meaning activity being explained by active inference which then it can be very much translated
to the language of the vision brain hypothesis okay next slide yeah which is very of course known
for us as top-down processes that encode predictions from priors and bottom of processes that encode
sensory observations such as prediction errors so there's like two way trafficking
occurring in brain activity and explaining how brain activity works okay next one
now this was the sort of like the high road to the FEP and now I want to make like some or
highlight some points that I find quite relevant and interesting in thinking about things or behavior
within the FEP framework or by putting in the FEP classes so one even in one way we do the whole
top-down approach or the high road approach to FEP where we start with that very very simple
observation that living beings adaptive systems they want to maintain their existence right even
when we start with that and then we find the FEP and active inference as a way of explaining how
they do that and then we arrive at active inference and can translate all the active
inference formalism through a two predictive coding and explain how things work in the brain for
example it is important to note that even when we do all of that trajectory inference is not
necessarily accurate so the optimality of all these mathematics and formalisms is subjective in
the sense that organisms operate on the basis of a subject or a subjective generative model
of how the observer observations are generated okay next one so I find this picture in the
active inference book by Pizzullo and Thomas Carr and Carl very very interesting and useful to
precisely convey the point I want to make about the generative model that I feel that sometimes
we just don't don't see exactly how it really work or his role is so the generative model
may be optimized as a new experience is acquired so think about that slide that I heard of how
there's a system how how would we determine what would be the preference states to a system right
so it's precisely through a generative model that allows us to optimize
model as new experience or new knowledge is acquired right so then we have for example this
picture here where you see the difference between generative model and a generative process I think
I have more things in this slide could you just yeah okay so then we have this distinction that
should be made between a generative model and the generative process and why so well because
the generative model may or may not converge with the generative process and that's sort
of what I wanted to highlight now um next slide yeah so the organism the organism's model includes
a range of hypotheses about a hidden state which does not necessarily include the true value of
the hidden state of the generative process the generative process is as you will see here in
the picture the generative process is the world right is how things are in the world right and
the generative model is how I think that things are right so um it includes the way that I think
that things are in the world includes a range of hypotheses about the world but those hypotheses
do not necessarily include the true value of the world of the generative process right um
there's so many much other. So the models we use to explain our sensorium may include hidden
states that do not exist in the outside world and vice versa. So in short what these means is that
there does not necessarily need to be an isomorphic match between the generative process and the
generative model. So that's the gist here. Next slide. So this is where action becomes extremely
interesting and extremely relevant because action is what is in the middle between generative model
and generative process. So that's where we get active inference and at least I think it's the
most interesting thing in active inference framework as opposed to other competing explanations
or frameworks. So because action is generated on the basis of the inferences made under a
generative model right but we just said that the generative model does not necessarily include the
true states of affairs of the generative process but notably action is generated on the basis of
the inferences made under a generative model. Next slide. So action is part of the generative
process in the sense of it is true action that we make changes in the world. So action is really
that interesting thing that is between the generative model and the generative process.
Action is generated under the generative model which does not necessarily match isomorphically
with the generative process and yet action is what is influencing the generative process.
Action is what is influencing the world. Okay so the interesting point here is that despite
action being selected from the inferences drawn under a model that is not necessarily accurate
as we said it is this action that is going to affect the generative process. Okay next one.
So action can be formulated as the minimization of the discrepancy between the
generative model and the generative process. So it is not only that thing that is sitting
in the middle between generative model and generative process but it is actually what
can be used and is used to minimize the discrepancy between generative model and
generative process. Next one. So this is the point that I wanted to make on the FEP
and now I want to get us back to think about the FEP and the realism debate and see whether there
are some interesting points or things to consider and think about. Next slide. Okay so let's think
about the free energy principle under the realism debate and let's think about the free energy
principle under the option one of realism where the idea was so to say in the definition was that
models are accurate representations. Okay so if we think about the FEP and the realism debate
of the first option then we would have to say that generative models are inaccurate representations
because they do not necessarily hold accuracy about the generative process. So we could say that
okay so then the generative models constructed under the FEP they are realistic representations
with some kind of form of minimal form of realism some minimal form of structuralism and similarity
because well they are generative models are representations of generative processes they're
just not accurate they're inaccurate representations and they work so that could be one way to do that
and this is sort of what I think that Kirschhoff, Kivostain and Robertson
think in their paper but I would be also keen to hear their thoughts about that. Next.
Yeah so the reason that I say that is because once we look at their paper in the literalist
fallacy and FEP model building scientific realism and instrumentalism so we saw before
in one of the slides when I was presenting a realism debate that one way of defining realism
is that the mappings between the model and the target allow to convert
truths found in the model into claims about the target system so in this case would be the mappings
between the FEP model allow to convert truths found in the FEP model into claims about the target
system which be an adaptive system and then we find this for example no sorry let me just yeah
thank you and then we find for example this passage in the paper similarity we have argued for
above between the properties of the generative model and adaptive behavior such that one can
capture real statistical relations in the world which is the generative process as we just said
by means of generative modeling so it seems that in their paper that's precisely where they're
situated in the literature which is precisely on the first claim by realism where there is a similarity
between the generative model and the generative process but as we saw just now the generative
model does not necessarily need to be accurate about the generative process next one
yeah which is precisely what I was saying an organisms model includes a range of hypotheses
about the hidden state which do not necessarily include the truth value or the true value of the
hidden state of the generative process there is not necessarily an isomorphic match of the model
of the generative model and the generative process or of the organisms and the world right okay next
so then the second option would be the anti-realist option so what we said about
generally speaking we looked at three different ways but what we said was that
generative models are empirically adequate so we talked about oh they're viable models
and not really true models about scientific phenomenon of interest they are empirically
adequate to the extent and if they allow us to learn more about the target system and if they
allow us to make predictions about the target system then they are quite viable they're quite okay
so that's the anti-realist view and in the case of this anti-realist view
then representation or matching accuracy is not an issue because models represent in the way that
they are used or we use them to form or generate understanding about a target system
next yeah okay yeah okay so this anti-realism would be this anti-realism about FEP would be
very much in line with for example this brilliant work by Albert Einstein on mathematics and geometry
geometry and experience that will be perfectly aligned because what what he says there is that
well models are empirically adequate and this is more or less and models will be more or less
adequate and this is important to define what we mean by adequacy right that's the next question
then we more and more or less adequate depending not on accuracy so not on how much the generative
model matches the generative process so not on accuracy but on whether or not it minimizes
free energy so it is in the sense of whether or not the model is being used allows the minimization
of free energy and much less on whether the model being used matches the reality
so that's a little bit of a twist there next slide
so then then this non-realist FEP would also be very much in line with for example
complex and dynamical systems theory because as we know it is organisms as complex systems that
persist by seemingly to defy the second laws of course they don't really literally defy the second
law of thermodynamics but they seem to defy that law of thermodynamics that dictates or prescribes
that they should tend to dissipation on chaos but as we observe behavior in the wild and in the world
we see that living organisms adaptive systems they don't do that they don't persist to or they
don't succumb to the second law right so they are extremely complex and dynamic in the sense that
their behavior is quite adaptive and that's what makes them so interesting so in this sense if our
FEP models are virtues not by virtue of them being accurate in the sense that they literally match
isomorphically with generative process but by virtue of whether or not the model allows the
system to minimize free energy then they'll be very much in line with the complex systems theory
it would also be I believe in line with an activism theory which I'm not sure if everyone
in the room is acquainted with but it's without there's been some some attempts to make these
links between the FEP and inactivism and I think that given other work that I've done in the past
I think that the only viable way of really making this bridge logically sound is through a non-realist
FEP a realist FEP is much more harder to argue for in their bridge or connection with inactivism
so by the I'm sure that more most of us are acquainted with it inactivism states that
living beings enact a world to adjust and adapt biologically cognitively and culturally
to the world okay next slide yeah so then this is very much it we've we've covered now the three
points I wanted to talk about next slide and I just want to conclude by by sort of like laying
out what the options are for us in this particular debate that has become very lively debate in the
last one year or so so when we start from the high road and this is important to convey it's not
starting from the low road it's starting from the high road so when we start from the high road to
the FEP so when we start from the observation of how biological systems adaptive systems behave
and then we have two flows we have science options which is how do we model these systems
and how to think the models by which we explain living adaptive behavior okay so we can take
the realist take on it on our models and say well there is realistic representations our models
literally match isomorphically by different philosophical strategies or arguments they
literally match the behavior that we observe and by the same reasoning we can also say that the
organisms behaving in the wild they also behave and adapt by virtue of possessing models that
literally match the world around them so that's one option the other option is the anti-realist
option which is to say that the models that we as scientists have the FEP models as well as the
models that we as living beings have they allow us to interact with the environment understand
the environment because they are empirically adequate not because they accurately represent
the generative process so these are the two options that I just wanted to highlight today
I think this is my last slide yeah okay thank you so much for your time and of course I'm very
much keen to hear your all your thoughts and questions
