this were what the counts were so I've chosen left 100 times and seen 50 wins and 50 losses
and I've chosen the right machine two times and seen one win and one loss the ambiguity
term would be equivalent for both of these so state exploration wouldn't change but the novelty
term would highly favor choosing the right machine again because I've seen so many fewer observations
um so I'll skip that for now um but the idea the final point is is just that in empirical task
modeling um we have these fixed parameters that we can fit to account for individual differences
and behaviors so different people might have different preference precisions or different
precisions of initial state priors or sensory precision or action precision or learning and
forgetting rates and so forth so we can just find the parameter values that best reproduce any
participant's behavior in a model and we can use those parameter values as individual difference
measures um and in the q and a if you'd like I can provide specific examples of that from some of our
empirical studies um but so just uh just to close um so active inference describes perception
learning and decision making all in terms of this approximate Bayesian inference framework
it uses this variational message passing scheme um that's biologically plausible and it can
generate neuroscientific predictions um added includes both this reward seeking and information
seeking drive um drives that can be helpful in um explaining um real human and animal behavior that
does often involve a lot of information seeking um and you can also include this active learning
component um as well as another type of information seeking um so with that I'll stop and just say
thank you for listening and I'm happy to start taking questions
