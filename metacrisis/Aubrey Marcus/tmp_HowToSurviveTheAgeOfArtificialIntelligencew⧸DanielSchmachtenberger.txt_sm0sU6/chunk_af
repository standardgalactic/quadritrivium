chance to reconcile and rectify the wickedness of our ways. And if so, we get some much better thing,
heaven on earth or the reinstatement of the garden or whatever, or if not, we get hell or death or
some kind of bad thing. There's kind of a hard fork and there's like a purgatory choice hard fork.
I think we're facing something that is very much like that kind of literally,
which is we've been kind of shitty stewards of power for a long time. We've used our power to
extinct other species, destroy ecosystems, destroy other cultures and oppress people of lower
classes. We've done some good stuff with it. We've been a very mixed bag, but the mixed bag that we
are has used power destructively enough that and it's continued to select for better coordination
and construction, but also destruction capacities that with the
arms race of that continuing to exponential tech, if you continue to be equally shitty stewards of
power with exponential tech, everything blows up. You ruin the planet and you have wars that nobody
wins and can make it through and so either we continue to be humans like the humans we have been
and the thing self terminates or we are getting so much power through the technology we've created.
We are forced to become good stewards of that power so we don't destroy ourselves and good
stewards of that power means what does it mean to be a good steward of power itself and power means
the ability to influence effect control others, other humans and other non-human life. What does
it mean to be a good steward of those types of capacities? What is the wisdom, love, values,
prudence that would guide that? Either we have to step up into that kind of planetarily to safely
steward the power or we destroy ourselves with it. That's very much a rapture story and I imagine
there's an there's an atheistic version of it which is just philosophically oriented
people, social philosophers in the Bronze Age at the end of a war seeing all of the dead people
that were killed at a much greater distance than before we had the whatever the new weapon was,
the crossbows or the whatever thing and a large area of desert that used to be for us because we
got better access and better saws and whatever has the technology. They could just sit there and
we keep building better tech and we're about to move from the bronze into the Iron Age and
we keep destroying nature and killing each other better with it. We don't get to do that forever
like at a certain point you can't destroy all the nature and kill at that full scale so this
phase is coming to an end and there's a wickedness of our ways and how we deal with power that has
to be reconciled and either we get it and we get this garden or not. To me that story
and very much like the Kali Yuga to Sat Yuga Hindu story or the end of the Mayan calendar,
like they're just decent forecasting of the nature of continued technological power.
If it is driven by the lower angels of our nature, it self-terminates and so if that power continues
it forces the higher angels of our nature to become the basis of culture or we self-terminate,
that's the forcing function.
Yep and then going back to what I was saying earlier, unfortunately as much as I would like to
hope and pray for the and I still do this very smooth transition, this awakening that happens
without the necessity for massive disruption and I still will hold that prayer and I will
add to that prayer with my own belief that that is a possibility and I don't know exactly how.
It seems from my understanding of what is most likely is that there is going to need to be a
little bit of discomfort, a little bit of pain that we probably feel that actually propels us
into taking these threats really seriously because climate change, it's a couple degrees
hotter here, it's not and it's like yeah okay we kind of understand it but until we run out of water
or until it's so hot that people are dying and like shit's getting really gnarly,
are we really going to take it seriously enough and I hope so and I pray so and I pray that this
happens gradually and we wake up with great speed and awareness that happens remarkably and I think
with the psychedelic renaissance there are factors that are coming into play that can accelerate
things beyond what the normal capacity is but it just feels like all right we might need to prepare
ourselves for a little bit of a bumpy road here that's actually necessary for us to make it through
to the other side. Let's think about this for a minute. We already just went through a year and
a half or so of people largely being on lockdown let alone what happened in Nigeria and so many
other places much more violently as a result of effective COVID and COVID response, supply chain
dynamics whatever else. We talk about you know are we going to need some pain to come and climate
change well it's probably the case that climate change was the cause of the droughts in Syria
that made all the subsistence farmers who had been there for such a long time no longer able to
farm so they moved to the cities that led to resource pressures that led to the war there
that already pretty much destroyed what the quality of life in Syria was and almost brought
about a fully armed conflict between the West and Russia right on the border and
we don't have to talk about the planet getting so hot that no one can live on it to talk about
heat waves in areas that destroy crops in areas where there's food instability so you have a huge
population in India and in Bangladesh sharing watersheds with huge populations on either side on
China one side Pakistan on the other side the waters running out of those watersheds the heat
waves in the summer are increasing the supplies of food decreased during COVID because there was
food shock that occurred because not having fertilizer and things because of the shutdown of
transportation so the 50 plus Celsius heat waves that are anticipated over the next few summers
like we already had enough refugees that nowhere wants refugees anymore so what happens when the
next chunk of refugees that are much larger in number than the previous ones came because people
don't just die peacefully and you have very tense political fault lines so the heat wave
turns into human migration turns into resource wars can very easily turn into escalating large
scale wars we're in a situation where being able to say we need some pain like it's already happening
basically depending upon where you are in the world it's already happening so then we need
greater awareness greater awareness of the pain and it can escalate so fast that it goes from like
oh shit that's really here to oh fuck there's nothing we can do about it anyway
our large-scale war and so we need greater awareness and greater action and responsibility coupled to
that um and it's like most people will either be stasis oriented or just personal pursuit
oriented unless pain pushes growth tear to shard on the catholic theologian who kind of after
darwin started incorporating evolutionary theory into catholic theology um if you haven't read him
you'd really love tear to shard on um but he talked about rather than a creator agent god relating
to the creative impulse god that moves everything towards more elegantly order to complexity and
more capability and beauty and um and that that evolutionary process brought about humans that
have enough complexity to think about the evolutionary process to feel all about it and to
decide to consciously help mediate it so that rather than just being parts of the whole we could
step up into being agents for wholeness itself and what would it mean to be local agents for
wholeness consciously aware of all that and he talked about what he called the lure of becoming
rather than have to be pushed by pain because otherwise we're stasis oriented we understand
the inexorability and beauty of evolution and we are drawn to become more and not just in service
of self but in service of all that we wouldn't exist without um and this is the interconnectivity
part of what you were mentioning is as soon as i realized that without plants i don't exist there's
no atmosphere i'm dead so an idea of myself separate from plants is nonsense and without back
soil bacteria and microorganisms plants don't exist so i can't even define myself without
plants and bacteria and fungus in a cogent way because i wouldn't exist but also without all
of the people who make all the shit that my life depends upon where my identity actually is wrapped
up in all this stuff so i'm like well my sense of myself as a separate thing is only because
i take for granted the rest of the universe i depend upon but if i said that which is required
for me to exist has to be included in my definition of self then my impulse of becoming is bound to
the support of all of that right now this is interesting because someone can have the mushroom
experience of oneness but not also have the cognitive model of how all that works and
together both the experience and the understanding of it and then the understanding of okay there's
there is individuality but even when we're talking about individuality as opposed to oneness there's
interconnectivity across the differences right um there's things that are not me in the individual
sense but that i depend upon and that create a world that either i don't exist without or that
i want to see um so yeah there's no question that pain can drive evolution but we need to depend upon
pain to drive it less and proactively be pursuing it in the awareness of the total eminent amount
of pain that will come otherwise more because especially in a world where so many people are
on painkillers and um anti anxiety meds and anti emotional pain meds and whatever else and all the
other forms of distraction from their own inner pain through social media and porn and dating
and whatever else it is like pain doesn't even have the same effect right so we arrive we arrive
at a place where there's a little we need to have a little bit of faith in in this divine creative
process that is going to awaken awaken in a way that's stronger than what we've seen prior and again
as i said i think the psychedelic renaissance is uh potentially uncalculable very incalculable
variable that can assist in this but the optimism that to go back to where we're we're coming from
the optimism is not a knowledge of exactly how it's going to go but requires some some faith
like there is this thing which is true which is an interconnectedness and an understanding of that
and this creative drive to protect and support the whole and the better nature that we have
late you know latent and nascent within all of us and to have a bit of faith that that can awaken
and potentially that you know the awareness of some of the pain could actually facilitate this
let's pray for as little as possible and as much on the affirmative side of the awakening of this
divine creation impulse and it's interesting like i one of the reasons that i think people
take all of the painkillers whether it's the ssri version or the benzo version or the opiate version
or the aqua version is because they don't pain as a signal that something is off they don't know
what to do about it right they don't like they can do anything about so just numbing it is the best
thing um which then allows us to keep doing the fucked up thing um if i if i put my hand in the
fire the pain is an evolutionary signal for me to pull my hand out of the fire if i yeah morphine i
put my hand keep burning off so much of the psychological pain we feel is because we're
living in ways that are really not uh meaningful and not fulfilling and so as to be able to keep
going and doing the cubicle job or whatever the thing is that i'm unfulfilled by now i'm gonna
numb out the pain of the fact that my life sucks so that i can keep doing that thing
i want people i like i want to actually feel the pain but i want to be a powered relationship
to it right so i'm not just broken but i'm taking it as a signal to then be able to say
what is this a signal that needs corrected and then what agency do i have to be able to actually
correct it and move in the right direction and not just my individual pain but also the collective
pain there's only so much i can do about the collective pain if i'm bypassing my own right
because i've got to actually be able to feel it so what do i clean it up and fix an address in my
own life to then be able to feel more of the larger pain to then be able to do something about it
and i think this comes back to the sense of faith that you're talking about you talk about
faith and optimism in empowered ways it's easy to
give up on optimism and be negative or or nihilistic and i'm obviously not going to be
part of any good solutions if i've done that right nor will i have much any meaning much
any fulfillment it's possible to have faith that doesn't require me to act because like i have faith
that some other institutions or other people or god or magic will fix it all and that's also
obviously not useful and it's easy to say i'll have faith when someone shows me a solution
that seems like it makes sense and tells me what i can do about it which is like it's the
it's not faith consciousness of a child yeah right that needs some parent authority figure to
explain to them how to how to live um there's a certain kind of like well how would anyone ever
come up with a solution to something that we don't know how to solve like how does any inventor
or innovator do it is that they have a faith that a solution exists before they know what it is that
doesn't have them just chill it has them work their ass off to figure out what it is right
so there's a certain faith in possibility that orients you to be an agent of it which
orients you to actually work um add things that you don't know exactly how to do right
and so then you end up having a faith in the actual solutions as they're gaining traction
but you get those through a process of a more intangible faith but that orients you to learning
discovery and action yeah you know one of the ways that you could describe mdma is uh as an
empathogen and you know obviously the first time i did it was in conjunction with psilocybin and
that's a very different experience than and i was out in the mountains and i was in a you know it was
guided by a shaman and it was a different scenario than the first time i did mdma which was in
australia with my girlfriend and we were walking around downtown brisbane and i understand the
term empathogen because for the very first time i saw the city life the nightlife past midnight
nightlife of bustling bris vegas as they call it but i saw it in a totally different way that that
woman who was a little bit drunk but crying on the on the sidewalk probably went through a breakup
or a fight with her boyfriend i could feel what she felt and i was like oh my god like that poor
that poor woman and that you know that homeless person who is hungry like i could feel is hunger
and it was a very interesting experience where i felt love for people that were beyond the people
that i normally a lot my love to and so i guess you know to me this a lot of people are going to
be pretty soon here within a within a year or so give or take depending on fda and a few variables
are going to be going into mdma psychotherapy for the healing of trauma but we all have many
of us have trauma so i'm sure the indications are going to increase and then other different
indications are going to be proven it's going to be used off-label there's going to be a lot of
different proliferation of this as an empathogen and so while it doesn't seem like there's going to
be any end to the painkillers although a more stoic philosophy and a different attitude towards
pain could be a culturally relevant story of like no we must feel the pain the pain is a signal
stop numbing the pain so that you can actually solve the pain which is a very empowering message
which i think can carry some weight there will always be a there will always be a market for
painkillers but also at the same time raising people's sensitivity to collective pain through
empathogenic molecules and i think mdma is just the first of potential empathogenic molecules that
actually can connect people to collective pain in a different way i mean if you know i just released
a documentary about my time in the darkness and i take off my my blindfold for the first time and
you see me i mean i'm weeping at the at an unbelievably you know intense depth of the grief
of having taken this world for granted and the the beauty that i'm beholding and you can't watch
that i mean you i guess you could but i haven't had an experience of someone watch that and not
feel a bit of what i felt like we're wired also for that level of empathy and i think it's about
being able to switch that back on whether it's through stories or whether it's through media
whether it's through chemicals or whether it's some technological way in which you know empathy is
being trained i think huberman what andrew huberman was talking to me about different empathy
research that they were doing in the lab with vr goggles where they were having you be a person
of color and going into a racist racially charged situation and then feeling what that feels like
and how impactful that was it seems like there's a lot of different ways you know for the mind
that needs and i understand like the feeling of a solution just knowing that there is a solution i
think that's important but for the mind that needs to say well i need some plausible limb
to hang on to some vine i can grab onto to give me some rational reason i think there's a lot of
shit that's happening that could give at least enough to support your faith and that the solution
is going there is is available and uh and i think that to me leaves me with the sense of optimism
which i don't know exactly how it'll be but i can see a lot of different channels of stories
changing philosophies changing understandings changing different ideas about our spirituality
changing these compounds that are coming online technology being used in beneficial ways all
of that is enough for me to say like all right i believe because i believe but there's a couple
good reasons to believe as well and i guess for me you know that's enough for me to leave this
conversation without going into my dark dark room and just crying softly into a pillow somewhere
i think one okay a couple things i want to say one thing that you said is important is that there
are things that you see that are inspiring in a lot of different areas it's important to recognize the
the basis of hope or solution is not a single thing right because it's like there's some stuff we
see in material science that makes better solar panels possible and better batteries possible and
