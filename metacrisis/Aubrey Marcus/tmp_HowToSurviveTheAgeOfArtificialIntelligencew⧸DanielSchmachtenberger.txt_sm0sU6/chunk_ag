things like that and and better recycling and manufacturing of goods possible and there's
some things in the application of AI to personalizing education that could make completely
better types of education possible and some things that we see in psychedelics and so when
but that also doesn't mean that we can say we don't also see applications of those technologies
that are super destructive and so we can't just say the techno-optimist version it's all happening
it's all good just just let the market do its thing and it'll happen or and tech do its thing it's
not true but it's also not true to say that there aren't the precursors to adequate solutions
but also it's not one thing it's it's lots of things right so then there's a whole ecosystem
of solutions what do they have in common um we can get that like whether we're talking about
tragedy of the commons or arms races there's something in common to uh escalating competition
in for narrow success metrics that externalizes harmful lots of things with that thing has to
change has to change across the scope writ large and that's why we're talking about culture and the
mindsets of people that could build new types of social institutions and even better versions of
what we think of as the market right now um I just I want people to not think about like oftentimes
they'll hear about the crisis be like what is the solution as if there's like some singular
thing someone could say that would make any sense and that's nonsense it's not going to be a the
solution not the second coming or just let the market do its thing or AI will solve everything
so it's like well what are the problems there's a whole scope of things and it's a it's a lot of
stuff that has to happen then seeing how it's all connected is important but it's not going to fit
into a tweet and so expanding your attention span to not say my my hope you've got like 90 seconds
to give me the solution of the thing I'll feel hope about and if I if I don't have that then I'm
going to jump to either nihilism or you know some kind like that's important the other thing I was
going to say is um you were mentioning that people are oriented towards the sensations they want to
have not necessarily the thing the thing is a path to it uh and then you're talking about
the spiritual experience and sensations that were occurring that were decoupled from external
things happening right you are rather than things you needed to get in the world you really you were
even more overwhelmed sensationally by how much you had taken for granted all the little things
in the world even uh like that there is such a thing as color at all right as opposed to
or sight itself yeah um or a reality to see or the fact that reality happens to be as
fucking beautiful as it is um when you're having that experience it's very recontextualizing to
the other state of mind that can really obsess over exactly what stuff your house is made of right
so it's interesting there's something where you're saying like okay I want certain kinds of
sensations those as long as those sensations are based on just what's happening in the external
world I will have the basis to need to compete with the other guy to rearrange my external world
better than his or with those scarce resources one way you can think about what the heart of almost
all spiritual traditions was we're trying to do was deal with that basis of conflict by being able
to say can you find something like peace and happiness unconditional to external can you
find those sensations internally so that you are no longer driven to get sensations
there's this very interesting question it says like okay as long as happiness is really conditional
but I need it I have almost no free will I'm basically controlled by this tyrant of unconditional
happiness to pursue whatever I think will give me those hits of sensation if but if I've already
been able to cultivate an inner state that I'm happy with then what is my basis for what I want
it's probably something other than my own state so it's almost like and this is the
why do you start your day with the right kind of meditation whatever it's actually only when
I have tended to my own state that real virtue can even emerge where I can want something other
than what's in it for me okay and so this is another real deep basis of of spiritual personal
development is virtue can emerge authentically more when I've tended to my own state and I can
tend to my own state independently of rearranging the atoms and the universe to be a particular way
the last thing I was going to say is what you were mentioning about psychedelics and the
empathogens the MDMA so imagine if you had this experience and you feel the hunger of the homeless
guy and you feel the heartbreak of the woman and all the people and afterwards you come journal about
it and you ask yourself how do I tangibly change my life starting tomorrow to be aligned with what
I just realized and you have to come up with some fucking answers otherwise the journey didn't mean
anything right like there's a if if it really changed how I am understanding the world how
does it tangibly change my basis for choice so we don't just do the journey have an experience
and then it's a nice story it's like I'm now inquiring I have a deeper understanding of reality
how do I live differently and then I look at how do I create a community of practice where then I
share that as a commitment I'm held accountable to that right with with other people and then the
next time I journey we I take another step similarly and then the other part is when you're
like okay I would arms race with that guy who wanted to compete with me for the thing that I want
what if the next time I go into my psychedelic experience and I do the
mushrooms or the iboga that's going to let me see myself what if I journal first what are all the
places where I can be shitty what are all the bases where I can go into otherizing people
losing empathy and just going into conflict or let's say I'm going to do the empathogen I say
what are all the places who are the people that are hardest for me to empathize with
and then I go in and I only think about them on the empathogen
and or I look specifically at those places where I can have the lower angels of my nature kind of
take hold the psychedelics start to become much more interesting when the tool is used
consciously where you think about okay all these problems in the world have to do with conflict
theory multiplied by tech so we need to deal with the basis of the conflict theory but we
need to not pretend that it's not there so how do I inventory where that conflict theory arises in
my own life and how do I use those psychedelics to help me transcend how I deal with it like how
do I deal with it better that starts to get very interesting no doubt because there'll be some
benefit that's gained just from the just from the experience itself but it's multiplied you know
it's it's multiplied not added it's multiplied by the intentionality behind it and the structure of
doing those similar things which sometimes can naturally arise in the nature of a traumatic
experience usually there's a perpetrator of said trauma and you will be often invited to go find
the place of forgiveness for that perpetrator which is the ultimate alchemy of the trauma you
know as I've watched this arc I've been in the room during the MDMA assisted psychotherapy I've
been blessed to be a part of these different scenarios and you watch the you know the the
rage which is hiding the grief and then behind the grief is the forgiveness and then the release
of that thing and that's the way that the the process is is guided but it's all it's very
self-guided as well but to do that with intentionality not just in the specific of this person did
this thing to me but in the universal like how do I really it's very powerful and a good and a good
like a little star a little asterisk to put up upon this kind of revolution that we're on the
precipice of and in a community of practice of other people who are doing so if I have a blind
spot I'm missing where I'm assessing where I can be an asshole or go into unnecessary conflict
other people can show me hey you're missing this place I'm like oh okay good that's helpful and
where if I'm really growing or not there's other people that can help assess actually you keep
talking about the same shit journey yeah journey so that we're not kind of narcissistically
deluding ourselves and then just having the journey be another sensation we like to have
yeah like are we actually really growing being able to help each other with that
is very very important part of it well as always Daniel these conversations are some
of my favorite experiences that I am fortunate to have I'm glad we get to share this conversation
with the world and whether it's just us in a restaurant or broadcast to all the people over
the internet it's really a pleasure and I'm just deeply grateful for you and your heart and your
work and your mind and everything you're doing I want people to know too that I'm a you know a
significant contributor to the the foundations that you're a part of and I'm going to continue
to do that because I really believe in the work that you're doing as I believe in my own abilities
to you know play some role in this this cosmic orchestration but uh so if you want to just explain
briefly what those are if people are interested in in supporting your work
as we make our way through this thing together
yeah uh the you being an ally in the way that you have has been hugely helpful
to work that we've been able to do with talking to key government institutions about shifts that
they can make and also work that we're embarking on now and helping education in these areas more
widely culturally uh some of the people can check out now as uh the conciliants project.org
conciliantsproject.org his website uh a lot of the issues we were talking about today regarding
um propaganda social media culture issues there's a whole good series of articles on there we're
about to do a series that addresses a 10 article series that is like the most fundamental things
about what the state of the world is and what it would take to come to a um post exponential
tech viable civilization and uh so uh yeah really grateful you uh have helped us be able to do that
work and would love to have more people check it out and be involved and then in terms of like
where do I find hope I guess the last thing I'll say is there's this model that I like we're actually
about to write a paper on this uh this guy Marvin Harris developed a school of cultural
anthropology called cultural materialism uh really profound insightful work I don't agree with some of
the conclusions but he basically said you can think of civilization as the result of these three
categories infrastructure social structure and superstructure infrastructures all the tooling
energy transportation waste management modes of production uh social structure is like economics
governance law the institutions with which we mediate our agreements and the superstructure
is more like what we think of as culture which is what are the values that we're orienting towards
what is the definition of the good life that we're orienting towards so religion and nationalism
and various various kind of social ideologies live here what he focused on was what we were
starting to talk about at the beginning which was the plow was so much more productive than just
hunting and gathering from the point of calories you could produce that the plow basically meant
anyone who would do the plow thing would get ahead over those who wouldn't so it coded for a pattern
of behavior which ended up coding for a mindset because it meant those who were not animistic
were going to get ahead from those who were animistic even if being animistic made them more
in harmony with their environment so he focused on the way the tools the infrastructure ends up
driving social structure and superstructure uh we can do a deep analysis we'll show this in this
paper of how all three of them inter-effect each other the nature what is being economically
incentive determines which tools take off also what's being regulated the value systems can
orient what we're doing science and exploration of those types of things ultimately the superstructure
the values of what matter to us like the causal arrows from technology to drive our social structures
to drive our superstructure is destructive like most of the destruction we have comes from that
direction this other direction which is what are the values that we then encode into social
structures so how do we basically have a value system become the basis of law and rule of law
that can then bind and direct the technology to be uses of tech that are not catastrophic and not
this topic but actually in service of life so our technology has gotten so powerful and it's
kind of eroded our social structures and our superstructure all that's left of the social
structures of this kind of liberal democracy period is really like money on money returns and
some very limited stuff and mostly what's left of superstructure is like fairly self-centered
nihilism and narcissism and nihilism but so the development of culture to then have people
of four by the people create new institutions that we can actually trust put faith and have
rule of law that can then bind guide and direct the tech so that we can have a future that is
high tech and high meaning high nature is kind of the only path and I see that what you've already
been doing with your podcast and where I see it going conversations we've had being how do we
really help the cultural revolution to be the basis of rebuilding social institutions that
can have the power to be able to guide this this godlike tech that we have where we're good stewards
of it is yeah of all the place of all the things where I feel hope it's not the tech the question
is what's going to guide the tech and it has to be people that have evolved in these ways
para bien de todos as Don Howard was fond of saying for the good of all and may we be put to
good use and I'm honored to walk this path with you brother as as we said when we were walking
from the restaurant we've all lived in such a rich and beautiful way in which there's been
moments of our life that have been so phenomenal and stunning that you know we've we've lived well
enough to be able to really dedicate ourselves truly to service and sure there's moments of
selfishness and there's moments where you know I I lose my hunger for service but I do know
that when I'm deeply in service and I know I'm in service there's no better drug on the planet
there is no better fucking drug than service when you're taking it pure and I think we both tasted
that drug too and I'm looking forward to a lot more of that drug however and which way ever
it takes me in this life likewise all right I much love my brother thank you so much everybody
for tuning in much love embrace what you know from direct experience what you know right now
what you know from having gathered here together you know something can you even put it into words
maybe not but it happened here we are look you felt things those are real and you'll go back to
routines social surroundings that are at odds with what you have experienced and what you've
known here the more deeply you enter into that the more it seems like this wasn't real this is just
some games we were playing I didn't feel those things I didn't see what I saw that's gaslighting
yourself the bad news that I'm going to tell you is that force of will alone is not enough to stop
that from happening you can set the intention I'm going to remember I saw something here I felt
something I experienced myself in a different way something of me was expressed I saw something of
what life is revealed I'm gonna hold on to that I'm gonna do a practice around it if you are able
to hold on to it may be because you tried hard but it won't be only because you tried hard I'm not
telling you not to try but what I'm saying is something else is required to hold on to that
and what I'm talking about actually is to hold on to sanity sanity is to believe what you know
doesn't get any simpler than that it's real to live as if something that is real is not real
that is insanity and the bad news is you can't hold on to it through will alone
how do you hold on to it with a little help from your friends that's why I say sanity is a group
project you need something to counteract the reinforcing circumstances of the default society
in order to stay sane you have met people here you trust they will not betray you
they will not lie when you ask them is it real even if they are in despair
they will be called by your trust into truth because your trust is authentic
the story that we tell about another person the way that we see another person
is a powerful invitation to them to be that that's the essence of coaching it's I see you as who you
can be I'm not making it up even if in a month or two months you may be again in a place of despair
where the reality of this moment is a distant memory even so you will come back to this
and more you will come to what this promises and by sitting a moment in gratitude for it
you establish it more firmly its own base these three four days will never happen again you cannot
hold on to it something of them is in you maybe you have doubts but at the same time along with
those doubts you know that it is true you know that the world can be built on this you know that
there is a future that has sent even its bare shadow
which is already so beautiful to the present
staying sane means that you stay in the knowledge of this and it is true
and I don't think anybody here is going to stay sane
but there's an island of sanity and
to establish it more firmly
take a little more time
