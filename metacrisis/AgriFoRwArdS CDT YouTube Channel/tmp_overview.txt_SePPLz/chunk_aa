1. **Free Energy & Belief Emergence**: Professor Friston introduced the concept of free energy as a measure that can explain both the emergence of beliefs and the organization of biological systems into non-equilibrium steady states. In these states, the system partitions into 'inside' (physical) states and 'outside' (environment) states, leading to an information geometry where physical states parameterize probabilistic beliefs about the outside states. This allows for a Bayesian interpretation of beliefs within the framework of free energy minimization.

2. **Planning & Deliberation**: The distinction between simple planning driven by minimizing expected free energy and deliberate planning was discussed. While they seem different, they are related in that expected free energy planning inherently incorporates both resolving uncertainty and aligning with personal preferences or goals.

3. **Agent Interactions**: Free energy minimization can lead to cooperation and generalized synchrony among agents within a group, promoting agreement and shared beliefs. This is because predictability between agents reduces surprise and thus lowers free energy.

4. **Language & Cultural Niche Construction**: The principles of free energy can also be applied to understand the emergence of language and cultural practices as a means of reducing surprise across groups by finding common ground or shared narratives.

5. **Question about Group Beliefs**: Yes, free energy minimization can lead to a high degree of agreement within a group, potentially reducing exploration of the environment in favor of conformity with the group's beliefs.

6. **Overall Impact**: Professor Friston's presentation provided a comprehensive and integrative view of how free energy principles can explain a wide range of phenomena from biological systems to social dynamics, including belief formation, planning, and inter-agent interactions.
