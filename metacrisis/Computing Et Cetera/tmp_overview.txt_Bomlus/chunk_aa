Checking Computing Et Cetera/Computer Chronicles - 06x18 - UNIX (1989).txt
 This week's episode of the Computer Chronicles covers various topics in the world of computing, including a comparison between OS/F and TOPS-20, insights on software vendors' market influence, and news from the Spring Comdex show in Chicago. Here's a summary:

1. **OS/F vs. TOPS-20**: The hosts discuss the differences between OS/F and TOPS-20, two operating systems used primarily in Unix environments. They emphasize the importance of understanding the nuances between these systems when making decisions about which to implement for a business.

2. **Market Influence of Software Vendors**: The hosts suggest that the competition between OS/F and TOPS-20 will largely be determined by which software vendors gain more application support in the market. They advise keeping track of application numbers for both systems to gauge their popularity and market penetration over time.

3. **Spring Comdex News**: The episode also covers news from the recent Comdex show, including:
   - Intel's introduction of its 8486 microprocessor with more than a million transistors.
   - New PC models from various manufacturers using Intel's 386SX chip and other advancements like Motorola's 68040 chip.
   - Sharp's demonstration of a color LCD laptop, the PC8000, which they claimed would be available for under $10,000 by year's end.
   - Toshiba's announcement of new 4Mb D-RAM chips allowing more memory in laptops like the T5200.
   - Traveling Software's upgrade of its Laplink program to version 3 with enhanced cloning capabilities.
   - Motorola's release of a 50MHz version of its 68030 chip, the fastest in the industry at that time.
   - Commodore's new Angus graphics chip for the Amiga, which significantly increases memory usage for graphics.
   - MacMotion's use of HyperCard to program a new 9-axis robot system at a much lower cost.
   - The development of chips by the National Security Agency that can self-destruct.
   - Stanford University's conducting of a computerized election, monitored by state and county officials.
