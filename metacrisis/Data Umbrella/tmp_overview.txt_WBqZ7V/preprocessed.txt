Checking Data Umbrella/[74] Bayesian Data Analysis with BRMS (Bayesian Regression Models Using Stan) (Mitzi Morris).txt
1. BRMS can be used for both hierarchical and non-hierarchical data structures, including for multi-level models that are not strictly hierarchical.

2. BRMS is capable of handling a wide range of analysis types beyond just regression, although it excels at regression-type analyses due to its Bayesian framework.

3. To view the trace of parameters in BRMS/STAN, you can use plot functions within the R environment, which provide visualizations of the MCMC sampling process.

4. Model assumption checking is an integral part of using BRMS/STAN, and it is done through prior predictive checks and posterior predictive checks. These checks help ensure that the assumptions made about the data are consistent with the observed data.

5. The default priors in BRMS are a student t distribution with three degrees of freedom, which are chosen to be robust for a wide range of models. However, users should carefully consider their choice of priors based on their specific data and research questions, as the optimal prior can vary depending on these factors.

6. Priors in BRMS are specified using an argument within the brms function, and detailed instructions on how to do so are provided in the BRMS documentation, supplemented by vignettes and examples from academic researchers.

7. The discussion also touched on the differences between Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) and Gibbs sampling (Gib), with HMC being the algorithm used by STAN's mcmc sampler, which has different implications for prior selection compared to Gibbs sampling.

8. Resources, including slides and notebooks from Mitzi's talk, are available on github for further exploration and learning about BRMS/STAN.

9. The video of the entire presentation will be made available soon after the live event concludes.
