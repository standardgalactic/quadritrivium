um things are are moving around uh and what we see is that the the regression now is pulling
ever more closer to uh the the center of the the the means now are pulling more together
so you're getting more and more pooling especially uh down here and finally uh we can add in
one more predictor the log uranium which is really which is the same across all observations
in the county we can see what adding log uranium is going to do to this model
so this is a varying slope varying intercept model adding in another predictor the log uranium
and we don't need to um to do anything on the county uh level for log uranium because log
uranium is already on a perp county level although you know play around with it by all means don't
take my word for it um see what happens if you add uh log uranium into this um into this uh
group level effects and um adding log uranium does uh does it change things
it uh yes it pulls things way more towards the center so that is um that's pretty much it
hey mitzi we have a question which is how do you compare the different models oh yes perfect
question yes great so am i still sharing my r screen yes okay so now we've got well we'll just
go over here we're done with the notebook so this is this is thank you you this is the last this
should be the last um cell in the notebook so you're going to add it yourself so we've now
got these various fits right now if we say
um
now we're going to run the um lou function and uh oh yeah um so what this is saying is um that
oh you you've asked me the right question um but we're all going to have to together read the
documentation for the lou package to understand what these um estimates are doing and what it
is saying um is that um you know what i'm not really sure i um let's try a simpler one
the lou function is designed specifically to compare your models so the the short answer to
your question is you run lou
hey mitzi another question is um is this rmd available on git i did i i did link to your
github um is this the same exact um our markdown file that that people can oh yeah i put it on my
git i put it on my github repo yes okay got it um and then another question that came up is can
brms be used for non hierarchical data structure and non regression type of analysis um
it can definitely be used for non hierarchical data structure so there are plenty of multi-level
models which are not hierarchical um and a non regression what do you mean by a non regression
type of analysis the answer there is no the package is about regression um
and how to view the trace of the parameters um to view the trace of the parameters we can do
something like plot and i think this will give you yeah
oh what is that doing that's so bad
there you get some nice trace plots
another question here is uh does brms have options for checking model assumptions
um what do you uh yes definitely that is all about the prior predictive checking
so your model assumptions essentially are your priors and uh brms has functions uh for
prior predictive checks and it has posterior predictive checks and yes um checking your model
assumption is very very very important and that's really part of the cool stuff of the generated
stand code for brms it anticipates that you're going it generates a stand program that has
everything you need to do the model checking and the posterior um oh thank you uh thank you
richard montez i know it's not in scope but curious what priors were used um these are the
default priors the default priors are um the default priors here are a student t distribution
with three degrees of freedom and paul berkner works a lot with akibitari one of the key stand
developers uh key key contributors uh co-author of bayesian data analysis and he's very interested
in the effect of the priors um and so um you can specify whatever prior makes sense and
there are a lot of different theories about what a good prior for a model is the prior
really depends on your data so it's it's you shouldn't rely on the default priors but the
default priors are chosen to be very robust and over the course of the time that the stand project
has existed we've learned so much more about how these models behave because we can fit more complex
models with more different kinds of data and with larger data sets and we've learned a lot about the
behavior of what priors are good and the difference between hamiltonian monicarlo the
hmc algorithm that is used by the stan mcmc sampler and the previous generation of mcmc
samplers the gib samplers is that for gib sampling you had to choose certain kinds of priors
just so that the gib sampler didn't fall over and the hamiltonian monicarlo algorithm behaves
very differently so there was a lot a lot of discussion and uh and investigation that's gone
into what makes a good prior and what is recommended as a good prior for a model
has changed a lot from say 2007 when gelman and hill use all sorts of interesting priors in in that
text to now and the priors are specified the carlos wants to know how the priors are specified
laura i'm really sorry i don't know how you can use this in excel but carlos wants to know how the
priors are specified the priors are specified via an argument to the brm function and you create
something called a brms prior object so the brms documentation will tell you everything you need
to know about how to specify your priors and there's um several examples and vignettes
in the brms documentation that should help you they're written by academic researchers they
have a certain flavor but if you if you look around and ask questions on the stand discourse
you should be able to do just fine any uh anything else
last call for questions if anybody has um any questions meanwhile i'll read some of the comments
which is thank you for the great talk thank you mitzi this was an incredibly approachable introduction
so so glad to hear it thank you all great questions
all right so um oh oh i want to share one more thing go ahead my final slide i think i i i
i need to go to slide of 13 because these are everything that you should read next
so uh yeah um take a screenshot and uh check out some of those URLs and um the slides and the
notebook are up on github for you
mitzi thank you so much for the excellent talk um everybody thank you for joining us
and the video will be available very soon have a great um evening morning wherever you are bye
everybody and thanks darona darota
