1. **Voice Imitation**: We currently have chatbots that can mimic the writing style of specific authors, and with advancements in deepfake technology, these could evolve to simulate real-life conversations, including video interactions that look and sound authentic.

2. **Educational Applications**: In the future, students could interact with AI versions of historical figures like Socrates or modern thinkers like Van Neumann to learn subjects like formal logic in a personalized manner. This transmedia education would adapt to the student's level and type of questioning.

3. **Ethical Considerations**: There is a significant difference between the symbol manipulation intelligence of AI and human organic intelligence. Students must be taught to discern these differences and understand the implications of AI responses that may not align with the actual thoughts or statements of historical figures.

4. **Role of Teachers**: Educators will need to guide students through these interactions, helping them understand not just the content but also the limitations and nature of AI intelligence compared to human intelligence.

5. **Medical Advances**: AI could revolutionize medicine by identifying complex causal relationships that are difficult for humans to visualize or understand, translating these into more comprehensible models for education and research.

6. **Exponential Growth in Learning**: As AI tutoring becomes more sophisticated, it could lead to an exponential growth curve in human learning and intelligence, with recursive thinking about the nature of intelligence itself.

7. **Future Outlook**: The potential for AI in education and medicine is immense, but it also necessitates a deep understanding of the ethical and practical considerations of using such technology. It's crucial to ensure that these interactions enhance human learning rather than replace it, and to foster critical thinking about the nature of intelligence.
