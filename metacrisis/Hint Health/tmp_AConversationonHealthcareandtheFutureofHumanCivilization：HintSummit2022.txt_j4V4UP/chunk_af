and the terrible thing still happens
then even the people who want to be ethical
say fuck I've got to go as fast as I can to do the thing
so at least I then have the ability
to do the right thing later
so you end up having everybody racing on AI
even who know the issues
I'm a good guy I'm going to control the AI
so I can stop all the bad guys getting AI
and then ultimately you end up with
AI taking over everything
and it's a really hard problem
if you're like okay
we can kind of see if people are making nukes
because you can see uranium enrichment
from space but you really can't see that
even if we make an international agreement
they agree that they're not
have to assume they are and they're lying to us
so we're going to do it as well
and we're going to lie to them
and we're going to spy on them
and so either we don't make the international agreement at all
because everyone knows it's unenforceable
or we all make the international agreement
and I'll break it
and so that multi-polar trap
that's a legitimately hard thing
and this is why you start to feel the intractability
of it what can I do
so one of the things
we obviously have to do
that is deeper than climate change
or AI or bio risk or anything
is solve that kind of underlying issue
solve multi-polar traps
more categorically
so
our research organization
and a handful of other organizations are launching a project
the orienting questions project
where we're basically saying
more than the sustainable development goals of the UN
the
things that humanity should orient around
as it's kind of primary planning
and problem solving
are these underlying dynamics
that give rise to all the problems and catastrophic risks
and basically the questions
of how to progressively find better solutions
and the first one we're starting with
is progressively
better solutions to multi-polar traps
and I can give you examples of partial answers
there's a company
that we're in conversation with
that has the largest private satellite network in the world
for imaging
they have a very high resolution
real-time imaging of the entire surface of the world every day
it's getting better and better
and moving towards basically like
real-time video of the surface of the world
and who's that company?
Planet Labs
and they're very interested in the application
for these types of things
now if we see
areas of
a bunch of plastic in the ocean
or dead zones in the ocean
high quality imaging
can we trace back where it came from
to actually be able to identify attribution
and as a result the transparency
even though
this country couldn't go monitor the other country
because it wouldn't get the permission
the satellites actually don't need permission
they're in international space and they have the
allowance to do that
means anything that is visible on the surface of the earth can be monitored
and now we have the ability to say
because of transparency
we can actually do a better job of creating
and keeping international agreement
can we see the movement of
military activities
and logging and all kinds of things that way
and fishing boats, yeah
so forced transparency is an example
and you'd say well but what about the deep underground military bases?
Why don't we transition to
an example of a multi-polar trap in healthcare
and maybe talk about ways to solve that
so I think one example
of a multi-polar trap is
you've got the insurance carriers on one side
and their incentive is to
effectively to and continue to increase
the total cost of care
because their profits are
effectively a fixed percentage
at scale on top of that
so their incentive
is to kind of deny claims while
we're possible while pushing
the cost of healthcare up
on the provider side
in a fee-for-service model the incentive is to drive
as much role in as possible
so that you can submit as many claims
and drive as much revenue as possible
and you end up in this sort of arms race
where both sides
in order to win both sides
need to continue sort of on that
game until you end up in a situation
not too dissimilar to what we're
in today so would that be an example
in healthcare or did I get the idea of a multi-polar trap wrong?
That's not exactly a multi-polar trap
the multi-polar trap would be more like
say
competing providers
or competing pharmaceuticals
where if any of them figure out
how to lessen the regulation of clinical trials
then all of them are oriented
to do a similar thing
so it's more specific within a domain
but what you're talking about is the same type of thing
it's a
where you have individual perverse incentives
in relationship with each other creating attractors
that are not the global optimum for anybody
and obviously
you're picking this one because
you built a business and a conference
to address this one in particular
which I think is really cool
Do you want to speak about that?
Well actually one of the things I'd like to do is
I'd love to
maybe jump into
how you
tend to think about what healthcare
could be long term
so if we could fast forward
to very long term
because I get it
you are quite good at thinking about
where we end up very long term
I think if we can get to that then
and what the world may look like
if you sort of tend out a long way
then we can maybe start talking a little bit
about what are
things in the short term that could maybe impact
that long term view
So obviously thinking about
all of the sectors, future of economics
future of governance, future of defence
future of judicial system
future of medicine and healthcare and education
are part of this type of analysis
have been interested in
I don't know
if you can send that
interview ZDogg and I did
because we discussed that quite a bit
so I won't talk about those parts
I'll talk about some other parts that I think are
The ZDogg interview I thought was really awesome
so I recommend going and listening to it
if you found this interesting
I'll actually give an example
of the very positive applications
of both
AI and biotechnology
to the future of medicine
what that portends for the role of the doctor
and the GP in primary care in particular
and how I think the direct payer model
kind of fits in very nicely
I was thinking about this last night
on the way here after you and I talked about the direct payer model
One of the trends that we can see
over the next few years and few decades
is increasing technological
automation of
most jobs
pretty much
anything that is proceduralisable
being able to make a robot
or an AI that can do better
or at least competently enough to displace much of the job
like that thing is happening
will happen
