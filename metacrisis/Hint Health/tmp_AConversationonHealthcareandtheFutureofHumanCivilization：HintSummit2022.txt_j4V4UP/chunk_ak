the few tech companies
that are doing that also make up
most of why our stock market works
Following that
China did something very different
they actually made sure
that Tiktok only
showed
educational and patriotic material for minors
that there was a limit on the amount
of video gaming time
they stopped live streaming like they did massive
pertalments of the harmful aspects
now this is very concerning to people
who think about civil liberties
and doesn't that seem like a very
um
patriarchal top-down
kind of control system
that's true
on the other side
what are the harms of letting it continue
and this is why we say catastrophes and dystopias are the two twin attractors
that you have to avoid
but
when you look at ant group or whatever
the government actually regulating
market and general technological development
I would say China is probably doing that
better than anyone I can think of
associated with their ability for long term
planning and we know why we did
term limits here which was to not
have you know despotic rule
long term but one of the problems of term limits
means nobody ever tries
to do anything that has more than a four year
return horizon and mostly three year return
horizon which means long term planning is mostly non-existent
and especially since you know whatever you do
will be undone in the next
administration
and you just can't
do things that have long term effects
without the ability for long term planning
and continue to be a viable civilization
especially in the presence of anybody who can do long term planning
these are really deep governance changes
that have to occur
so one thing I can say that has to change
about regulation is so far
the nature of the relationship between the state
and the US has been
the market can advance new technologies
bring them to market pretty unregulated
in terms of new things right because
it has to work with an existing regulation
and if that thing causes
some social harm
then it's up to whatever
groups to try to lobby to address that social harm
and then of course the for profit lobbying
will work in its own interest and eventually
maybe the social harm will be seen
as severe enough that cigarettes
won't be allowed to be sold to minors after how many
lung cancers or whatever else
or DDT will finally get banned
to then be replaced by another thing that is just
as lethal but we just don't have long term trials
on how bad it is yet and then we sell it to Mexico
and buy the produce back or whatever things like that
so
we have to move to a situation where
the new technologies
have to actually get
regulatory approval before going to market
and we don't
like this idea because we don't trust our government
which is why we have to fix that
because if you either
you say
we don't trust our government so there shouldn't be one
or fuck we actually
a market does not solve these issues well enough
there are perverse incentives
we do need something like a state and rule of law
so we have to figure out methods for addressing
the corruption
and trustworthiness because of course the idea
is that the market will do a lot of things
well in terms of innovation distribution
of resources in a decentral way
but it also has incentive for a lot of fucked up stuff
and so since we don't want all the trees cut down
we'll make national parks and we'll have
rule of law backed up by a monopoly of violence
which is what the police force is
that will back up nobody logging the national parks
the state is supposed to be
what can implement
rule of law which is the collective value
systems of the people right which is why you need
a educated citizenry
that can vote on
the jurisprudence the basis of what becomes law
that monopoly of
violence is supposed to support
to check the predatory aspects
of the market allow the productive ones
and check the predatory ones but that only works
if the people are checking the state
in a of four and by the people
government system if the people can no
longer check the state because of the complexity
of it and because of every
topic being a national security issue
and things like that then of course that entire system
breaks down and rather than the state check the market
the market captures the state
and the people whatever
and so there are really fundamental
changes that have to occur to that entire
apparatus so that it
and the question of what would it take
to create trustworthy institutions
given that climate
change is pretty complicated and
a risk is pretty complicated and grid security
and medicine are pretty complicated individuals
can't make all those senses on their own
to just like buyer be aware be the only
answer for everything so we need institutions
that can process that complexity we have to
trust them right now there's pretty much
no universally trusted institutions
the left right polarization is so
severe and things like that so the question
of what would it take to create trustworthy
institutions in a population capable
of doing the epistemology
and sense making to determine the trustworthiness
of them it's a big
set of topics we have to do that there are
no answers without doing that that are at all
competent
and so assuming
the ability to make a state that is at all trustworthy
then with
new categories of tech that can produce
externalities
that are truly catastrophic
at rapid scale
you cannot release them into the market wait
for the catastrophe and then regulate afterwards
because it will be too late you actually have to be able
to do the externality
assessment up front
to be able to ensure that the version of the
technology that's going to market is actually
okay to go to market and then
you have to ongoing
be monitoring for early indicators
it's going in the wrong direction to be able to change
that regulation that is a very
very big change
that the speed and potency of exponential
tech absolutely requires
mark we had a question for mark
can you hear me
can you hear me
can you hear me
my question for you
have you ever been to a conference with
no AV issues Daniel
pretty common
okay can you hear me
great
question for you is when I think about
healthcare and AI
specifically do you see
a tension between the value
that it can provide
and yet its ability
to explain how it got to that value
so
I would think that
in its most valuable form
when AI is using
you know going across different information
that's out there it could identify
something that it's actually hard
to explain in the example of
the healer patient to the healer
why this could be the right decision
and the
if you take it
along that lines
the maximum value from it
it will be that much harder to explain
