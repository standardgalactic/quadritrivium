what that portends for
general health promotion, preventative medicine
I think is amazing
the problem of
that everybody's focused on their problem
and they will try
and their problem seems
so catastrophic
that they'll put all of the resources
into that without looking at resource allocation
writ large and all of the other problems
like that's a governance issue
it is a
holisticness of perspective
and so
talking about how many of the determinants
of health issues are outside of just
medicine and access to medicine
so
my perception is that the future of medicine
and healthcare has to involve
the future of
civilization design writ large
and all the things that end up affecting human health
so when we
the lead example is a great example
and obviously we've banned
lead and gasoline except still for
piston planes and a few things
but there's
there's something like
50 million chemicals
in the chemical database
human generated chemicals
the VOCs
and the paint in here
those same type of petrochemicals
can be found in the snow in the top of Mount Everest
and most of them are
either endocrine disruptors
neurotoxins or carcinogens
we can find them in human mother breast milk
do we need to be designing paint
differently with regard to the VOCs
involved do we need to be doing industrial manufacturing
of all things that out gas differently
totally
if we think about
so
I personally think the topic of
subclinical toxicity
subclinical pathogenicity
and subclinical deficiency are huge
topics that functional medicine
pays attention to and I think
the rest of medicine
will start to pay more attention to
obviously there's a level of vitamin C
that is so low that we would diagnose
it as
deficient meaning you have scurvy
but there's a big range
between I don't have scurvy
what is the optimal level of vitamin C
in a human body
and I think that range
when people are at the lower end of the range
it is still considered you don't have a nutrient deficiency
in the formal sense
I think those types of things make a huge difference
so
when we look at an agricultural system
where you remove all of the trace
minerals from the soil
and then you just put back NPK fertilizer
and then continue to remove all the trace minerals
and you see things like
the low chromium and vanadium levels
in agricultural soils
and then increase type 2 diabetes
when chromium and vanadium have key roles
in insulin sensitivity and you see
that the
decrease in selenium in soils
and the increase in heart disease had
similar correspondences like
can we and that's
just at the level of like
top soil management and agriculture
of the productive food stuff
not even getting into of course animal husbandry
and the way more serious issues there
or then turning it into hostess or McDonald's
so
can I have a world where
the
economics make
commercials for McDonald's
and easy access and availability
to that starting in childhood
and have optimized health
for the whole civilization
not really so like the future
of the food system and the agricultural system
and regulation around that
and the future of manufacturing
I think those are all
examples of really critical things
to the future of health care
to be dealing with the underlying cause
of
not acute disease but
the onsets
of early aging and chronic
complex disease
yeah I don't know if that
addresses the question
those were a couple thoughts came to mind
Any other questions
is one of the back there
gentlemen right at the back
Happy to talk to you at a break
Hey, while that mic's been
is that mic working? Can we just have this
we'll have Mark's question because he's going there
Mark, you're next. Are you able to hear me now?
Yep, we can hear you
and speak up nice and loud for us
so I'm the founder of
a health care AI company
so
after your talk I'm at least happy
that I'm not the founder of a horse drawn plow company
my question for you
is we're trying to be very
intentional about the way we're building
what we build
oversight committees, feedback cycles
but it is difficult
a lot of people even academics push us
to do more complicated things
that are easily explainable to clinicians
Have you seen a framework
have you seen an international policy
an international standard that you like
that builds in that feedback cycle
in an ethical way that's
maintainable so we're not speeding up
bad decision making
No
Dan
That doesn't mean that you can't
in knowing that
do various kinds
of advocacy to try to help increase
that happening
if you want to understand
the issues of AI safety
and the acceleration of AI causing risks
you can read Superintelligence
by Nick Bostrom it's a good book
but specifically
Yudkowsky just wrote a new article
Eli Aizio Yudkowsky
Eli Aizio Yudkowsky is maybe the
top AGI risk expert in the world
and just published a new one a couple days ago
on the current state of
scenarios of AGI risk
I would say it's the best
current overview there is
and then what you can see is
the various categories of tech
development that contribute to those scenarios
I can tell you a few of the things
that don't yet exist but need to
and they sound
Oh, it's not true
Do I see any countries that are working on it
China
is
I would say
from what I can see
paying attention to the
existential risks, exponential technology
portends and trying to find solutions
because they have
more
top-down capability
and so you can see that
the social dilemma came out
and
we could see everything from
teen suicide and body dysmorphia
to breakdowns of the family
unit to increasing polarization
and everything from
January 6 and whatever
we can see all those issues and just no competence at all
to do anything about it because
