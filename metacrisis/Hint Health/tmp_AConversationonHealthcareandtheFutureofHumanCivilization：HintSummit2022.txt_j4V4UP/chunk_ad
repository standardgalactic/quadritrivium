looking at how to address
perverse incentive in healthcare
and that you felt like was kind of the
central and highest leverage area
and that underneath all of the
problems in the metacrisis
there's perverse incentive driving
AI to go much faster and less safely
than it should
driving biotechnologies to go faster and less safely
and it's not just economic perverse incentive
it can be things like a military perverse incentive
where it's like
it's pretty understandable
hey they're going to develop this weapon so we have to develop it first
otherwise
and so because we can't be sure
that they aren't going to develop it
we all have to race to develop it as fast as possible
even though most likely we all die from it
so that's a
perverse incentive where what is good for me
in the short term and what is good for everybody
in the long term are exactly opposite
but if I try to do the thing that's good for everybody
in the long term I'll probably lose in the short term
so I guess I mean there's a lot of
um
you know
when I sort of listen to you I
get pretty nervous about our future
so how do you
are you all
um
so are you
you know is there
you know how do we get through this
what is it that you're working on
and how do we sort of start to think through the solutions
and maybe paint a picture for that
I didn't answer your
short term AI question
oh yeah let's jump into the short term AI question
I'm fascinated like
three years are we in trouble if we don't
make some big changes
as we say AI and actually maybe also
address how
some sectors that are
say developing AI for good purpose
actually maybe
partially responsible for the acceleration
of the AI that could be used for the wrong reason
so
we could easily
read the books about how society
is getting better and better whether we're talking about
Pinker or Diamandis or Hans
Rossling's work and
heaps of statistics on
things that are getting better and it's true
like nobody wants to go back to a pre-novacane world
or a pre-antibiotic
world or a
but they cherry pick the
stats to focus on the things that are getting better
and not the things that are either getting worse
or moving closer to catastrophic worse
and other people focus on those
things that are both true simultaneously
and this is kind of a complicated thing to hold
did antibiotics
solve a whole lot of
easy mortality
totally
that's awesome
did inappropriate
and overuse of antibiotics as opposed to a more
nuanced approach to the human relationship
of the global kind of micro organism
community create
really nasty
antibiotic resistant bacteria
increasingly accelerating
and
effects on the human microbiome that have
effects on genetic transcription
and all kinds of health issues
that's also true
you might say you're being a perfectionist
every tech is going to have some costs
we can actually do a better job
of identifying
all of the interconnected things rather than
this kind of single element
reductionism and being able to develop tech
that has more positive externalities
negative externalities
if we talk about AI
of course AI can be advanced
for a very positive purpose and medicine
is one of the very best purposes and also
both AI and biotech are advancing
largely for purposes in medicine
image recognition on medical files
and then big data
on medical information for AI
pattern recognition to be able to start
to identify early
disease indicators
that's awesome everybody here wants that
but
it's
those types of applications
where the both
kind of public support and regulatory
support and money going into the
development in the for profit and academic
world
create the advancement of the technology
that can then just so easily
be repurposed for any kind of purpose
and
so if you want to ask like
what are some of the near term risks
if we see the extreme polarization
that happened around the fundamental beliefs
about COVID
like did it come from a lab
did it not come from a lab is it even a virus
or is it an exosome is it real or is it
not real should we
wear masks or not vaccines
hydroxychloroquine whatever it was like
the most foundational just
assessment of base reality
had almost completely polarized
perceptions on almost everything
and we can look at the media landscape
and talk about this and there were obviously
forces driving polarization
before the internet but
social media in particular
radically accelerated these as a result
of a particular type of AI application
so
if you haven't watched the social dilemma as a
documentary that covers this it's a really good one
to watch the very brief
gist is I can't see
all of the news that's out there it's billions
of new pages uploaded to Google every day
and so I go to Facebook or whatever
my kind of social media feed is
I'm going to scroll it's
curating from all of the information
on the internet a subset of things to put
in front of me and the things that I see end up
affecting the because I'm not perceiving
the world directly I'm perceiving media meaning an
intermediated world or an intermediated
perception of the world and
the AI gathers data
about me gathers data about my mouse hovering
patterns my click patterns my friend network
and all those types of things and it empirically
optimizes for making me spend the most
time on site and engage with the content the most
it happens to be the things
that scare me piss me off and appeal to my bias
make me spend more time on site most of the
time than the things that challenge my bias
and make me do complex hard thinking
so it ends up optimizing for click
baby titles and over certainty
and over sanctimony and villainization
of the other guy but it does it
for everybody's existing bias set
so whatever your current views are
you're likely to feel more righteous more
certain more sanctimony is more villainizing about
those things simultaneously and this is a true
for climate change and true
for social justice and racial
inequality and every possible thing you can get
so this is a
the opposite of a fourth estate which
was supposed to be a prerequisite of democracy
that we all had the same information to do
collective decision making this is actually making
sure that everyone has maximally
polarized information a polarized
electorate
elects a polarized representative class
that creates gridlock that can't do shit and
when that is in geopolitical competition
with China that doesn't have that issue
doesn't have term limits etc
we'll just lose it long term planning
and so
