and so where is the role there
and if I was just to extend that a little bit
that was a healthcare example
but if you put it in a sphere
where time is of the essence
like in defense or something like that
the governance piece
that you mentioned while valuable
it actually seems like
it doesn't quite fit
and something else has to be figured out
there, thanks
I'm sorry I can only barely hear you
what I'm hearing is
if the AI can identify patterns
that they won't be able to explain the causation of
how do we deal with that
how do we deal with that
because
the most valuable
the value from AI might be
when it gets to the point where it can't explain patterns
and then the secondary is
outside of healthcare
that would seem to be exacerbated
when speed of decision making
based on the results is of essence
right
there are super tricky issues here
this is where we're talking about the infosingularity
that we want to
not
have the decisions limited
to what an individual doctor
or a small group of doctors know
because there's some new stuff being published today
and there's some red that might be useful
and there's stuff that's published in other languages
that none of them have read
so we want to be able to have access to all that
simultaneously
we don't want a system that is saying what to do
because of what's in a magical black box
that nobody can understand
and so what we're interested in pioneering
is a kind of symbiotic intelligence
between
human, individual and collective intelligence
and artificial intelligence
it's neither a artificial intelligence
decision making system
nor is it a
purely human
run system
I don't believe we want to disintermediate
humans in deciding most things
there's of course cybernated things
like you start
the system notices a particular seismic reading
and automatically pulls the train over
there are certain types of things where once we have
already engaged
in a decision making process around
that's the right thing to do
is simply automate that process
where speed really matters
but where we're deciding things
that have not already been decided
even though speed matters
the accuracy and quality
of the decision process really matters
then we want to be able to
have the computational systems
provide information
that the people who are making the decisions
maybe didn't have access to
and not just provide information
but provide the processing of that information
on the topic of
but then the people are ultimately
still responsible for making the decision
that's where the
as far as like malpractice
and adjudication and all those issues go
the technological system does not
actually become the responsible party
the people who are the responsible party
now the people who are developing
and implementing the technological systems
have responsibility for the effect of the systems
which is
different than the people who are using the system
who have responsibility for the choices they make
so where the responsibility goes is important
the AIs that can process big data
are not that different
from the AIs that can also be personalized
tutors so when we talk about
the future of healthcare
I think doctors
move towards a much more human connection
high touch orientation
I think this is also
very true for the future of education
is that
there will be AI tutors that are
incredible and yet we still need
human tutors
teachers interfacing
between the kid and the AI because the AI
does not actually have a relationship
a teacherly authority
relationship of care and love
with the student so but let's say
for instance GPT-3
is already at the place where I can not
just say you know make me
an article that says such and such I can say
make it in the voice of
you know this particular author give them
all of the writing of that author and it can actually
copy the voice of that author
now you imagine
the deep fake technology of
being able to generate
animations and
videos in real time
and so we already have chatbots
where I can talk to the chatbot
and it talks back to me that I can't tell
isn't
a person in many domains that's getting
better very rapidly that chatbot will move
from text chat to a video
to somebody I'm talking to
you can go to thisfacesnotreal.com
and see a bunch of faces that look totally
real none of whom are real they're all AI
generated faces and some recent studies
actually show that
without knowing not only did the humans
not know which ones were AI generated in real
in general they trusted the AI generated
ones more which was
interesting
but
let's say that I can go into
the metaverse through whatever mechanism
and I can go to the academy
and
have a conversation with Socrates
and it has all of
Socrates' thinking
and biographical information programmed
in so I have a chatbot of Socrates
that is trying to answer in ways
that are logically and semantically
congruent with the answers he would have given
or anybody right
I could go and ask
Van Neumann and Kurt Gerdel and Einstein
to all sit around the table with me and talk about formal logic
that will happen
and that's
so mind-blowingly amazing
for the future of education
that every kid could get something
where the AI is actually
personalising, modelling their theory of mind
so not only communicating in English versus Mandarin
but at their level of education
so it is doing personalised
trans media
bespoke education for them based on
their questions of this type
like that's amazing but it's also super dangerous
because that
Van Neumann
or that Socrates is going to say stuff
that is not exactly what the actual one probably
would have said and there is a difference between
the type of intelligence that is creating
that symbol manipulation AI
and the type of intelligence that we have
so now imagine the role of the teacher
in the future understanding those
AI as well and understanding the topics
and understanding pedagogy
so the student just went in and had this
conversation with Van Neumann on formal logic
and then I'm talking with the student saying
what do you think the AI Van Neumann said
that is different than what the actual
Van Neumann might have said and why
based on what is the difference
between how this artificial intelligence
system works and how you think
human organic intelligence works
now of course not only does the kid have
that amazing kind of
