so the fact that it's solving problems
it betters human life in some way means technology is net good
that's kind of certainly the idea
that the industrial revolution ran on
then when people start to see
well the same technology that can give us to the moon
is pretty similar to the technology
that makes nuclear weapons and the same
computational system that can
or AI system that can do protein folding
for cancer stuff can also do it for bioweapons
then it's like okay well technology is not good or bad
it's just this inert thing
and it's the value systems with which we use it
that are good or bad
neither of those are
right
technology affects human value systems
inexorably in ways that we have to understand
for the design of it
specifically technology only
catches on if it confers advantage
in some way if using it creates some
advantage which ends up meaning power
which means that if some group
uses a technology that confers power
and another group doesn't that other group will probably
lose when it comes to an economic war
a political war a kinetic war
and so the first thing is that any technology
that confers a lot of advantage becomes
obligate you use it or you are not part
of defining the future the next thing
is that
to get the advantage of it you have to use
it which is a different set of behaviors and it also
obsolete some previous set of behaviors so
technology changes patterns
of human behavior and doing
that means that it also changes the basis
of what we are experiencing like the sensory
experience of the world and as a result
human value systems and cultures
and there is
such an important topic because
when we are building the tech that is in turn
building our minds and we are not thinking
about it you get things like facebook
having this effect of kind of radically
destroying democracies and creating polarization
or whatever as an unintended
effect of like a messaging app
so the plough is a very great example
when the plough was
first implemented
a number of things that historians
of technology have looked at is that
whenever the plough was implemented in an area
they didn't have the plough before they were hunter-gatherers
or they did small scale horticulture
using a kind of human used digging stick
to go from a digging stick to an ox drawn
or a horse drawn plough
required obviously yoking
an ox or a horse and then beating it all day long
that was something that hunter-gatherers never did
so pretty much every hunter-gatherer
society was animistic
they talked about the spirit of the buffalo
the spirit of the water the spirit of all those things
so they had some idea of the cycle of life
and man's relationship to it
as soon as the plough conferred so much
advantage because it did mean you could create
a lot more caloric surplus
which means that your tribe could make it through
famines and grow
which meant whoever used it was going to win over
when it came to tribal warfare and making it through famines
you kind of had to rationalise
beating an ox all day long
so animism had to go away there's no spirit of the ox
they're just done animals that are here
man's dominion over so the change
of human value systems followed
literally a change in tooling
and then things like the plough created massive surplus
were there had not been massive surplus before
because it allowed us to get much more grain product
a massive surplus meant that some people
could have a lot more ownership than others
and started to get radical wealth inequality
you also started to get much faster
growth of populations
you also got pretty much the end
of female gods in most cultures
because previously
in hunter-gatherer cultures you had male
and female gods associated with the fact
that men and women were both supplying food
stuff or the stuff of life and involved
in that mythos obviously we moved from hunter-gatherer
mythos to agrarian mythos but now men
were both doing the hunting and the ploughing
because the upper body strength needed
and so the thing that is called the patriarchy
followed a tool there's a thousand
more examples of now you have inheritance
because of the amount of surplus
and because of inheritance institutions on marriage
change so literally like
economics, religion
core spiritual ideas, ideals
about nature, male, female
all changed with a tool
and so it's a
it's a very important topic
as we see the
exponential rate of technology development
and that it doesn't just produce physical externalities
like leaded gasoline
having an effect on human brains that made us
both dumber and more violent at scale
but it also has these psychosocial effects
OK and so
one of the things
that we think a lot about
at Hint is the sort of
this idea that within
the health care system there's just perverse incentives
kind of everywhere right
and I think one of the things
I've found quite interesting is sort of listening
to you talk about kind of the alignment and this alignment problem
and maybe just
before we sort of parlay into health care
can you just share
some of your thinking in terms of
how you think about the alignment problem
and perhaps how it may relate
to kind of health care
Yeah so the term
perverse incentive in economics
means anytime that some
agent whether it's a country
a company or a person
somebody in a company has some incentive
to do something
that is going to harm some other agent of the commons
so there is a alignment gap
between the well-being of everybody
and the incentives of everybody
it's very hard
to prevent people from doing things that you're
simultaneously incentivising them to do
which also means disincentivising them not to do
and so
we try to create a system of law
that prevents people from doing things where they have
economic incentive but it causes enough harm
we think is problematic but then of course
if there is
a
aspect of the market
that law is preventing from doing a thing
that would be profitable
one of the most significant things
the market can do to advantage itself
is to try to change regulation
and so thus lobbying gets entered
and campaign finance support
and the whole host of incentives
that come in and you get regulatory capture
perverse incentive is a very deep topic
because you can say
it's possible to have a for-profit military
industrial complex
as one of the most profitable
sectors of the global economy
and have enduring peace
if there were solutions for enduring peace
that were able to de-necessitise most of that
that would actually collapse the global economy
like is there some problem in the incentive landscape
obviously there is
and we see this with things like the perverse incentive
in for-profit prisons
healthcare as a heap of examples like this
and the reasons why
global GDP is not a good measure
of the health of the world
because GDP
goes up during war in military spending
GDP goes up with more sick people
and more healthcare spending
it goes up with addiction and purchasing associated with addiction
so
the reason that I responded when you reached out
and the reason that I'm here is because
you said that you were
