I found your sort of vision
for where healthcare goes next
to be quite fascinating
just the only big question
and I'm sure you think about this question all the time
is how do you
marry this world
where we have all this multimodal data
on our patients and we're able to use AI
with
people in research constantly talk
about which is the curse of dimensionality
and what is the role of the
physician in helping fight
that problem?
Say the last part again how do you balance
the big battle? Curse of dimensionality
so all this multimodal data
and does the physician
have a role
in helping because that's at least
dogma in the AI world that there is
an oracle that can help with this
and there are a lot of thoughts on that.
So there's a
problem called the infosingularity
that we're already in a situation
where there is more information
relevant to inform most decisions
than any human can competently process
and so if you look at
how many peer reviewed published
journal articles in any topic there are
no expert can actually keep up with all of them
which means no one is actually an expert
in anything
and to try to be an expert in anything
it has to be increasingly narrow domains
expert meaning knows
the extent of human knowledge in that
space and
so insofar as there are
consequential decisions to make
and there is a lot of relevant info
we don't necessarily want people making it
who don't have the info so the idea there is
okay we need AIs to make the decision
of that info so there's
there are a lot of people who are proposing
cybernated systems of governance
AI governance of various kinds
to try to make benevolent
super intelligent AIs that
run shit
I think the dystopic scenarios
there are almost certain
and that we don't need
the AI to make
the decision to be a decision informing system
that is able to take all that
multidimensional data and process it
into something that the human can keep up with
and so it is informing
human intelligence and groups of human intelligence
human collective intelligence
this is true for how we make democracy work
as well as how we make any specialty profession work
is that
I don't want to
search on google or google
scholar and get websites
I want to see
bespoke presentation
of the summary of all of the world's
information relevant to the particular situation
I'm looking at this is where
that same type of AI technology
like GPT-3 that can make compelling
deep fakes can also do this
like literally today can also
can already start to do this if we're programming it
where rather than
have to look through
hundreds of research articles
many of which we'll find out later
or wrong the ability to be able
to look at those together identify
where there is
information that looks like it is conflicting
versus self-reinforcing be able to give confidence margins
and then be able to
um
give the actual decision informing
meaning which is usually a second or third derivative
of the total amount of data
so it's
it's true that humans cannot
keep up with all the information it's not true
that we need to know all the information we need
to know the patterns of the information that are
important to informing decisions
and so we can have a symbiotic intelligence
of better
trained human intelligence
with better systems
of human collective intelligence
i.e. better than peer review
and democracy systems by which
shared intelligence can operate better
which we could get into augmented
by computer intelligence
and so what we're looking for
is AIs as decision informing
more than decision making systems
that are able to take that massive dimensionality
and show you the patterns
at the risk of
sounding overly pessimistic
that has been the theme so
do you think
that we
that it's too late
to develop
this model where the sacredness
of the healer
and the patient
can be restored
because so much damage has been done
that the majority of
users of health care
don't put any value
on having a relationship
that
building a model that would
that would
honour that sacredness that it's too late
because too much damage has been done
definitely not
thank you
obviously
when you're trying to pioneer
something very different you're going to appeal
to fast adopters first
and the fast adopters might be
a tiny percentage of the population
but if the thing is much more
effective then other people who
wouldn't have been fast adopters but see it
now have an on ramp into something
so
I wouldn't look at population
wide implementation
it's like before you do scale
you've got to get product market fifth
and then you start figuring out the way that scale occurs
you don't need
a lot of people
I mean let's talk about
a hundredth of a percent
of the population
engaging in a system of medicine
where
diseases are being found earlier and being
prevented where
they actually
feel like their doctor remembers
them, cares about them, they want to go
they feel like they
are making
growth in their own care of themselves
as a person by going
and then
those people both because they're
getting less diseases and having whatever
talking to other people of course then brings
the next group of people in
so prototyping
fundamental prototyping major changes
never happens wide scale
first it happens
small enough scale to do proof of
concept and then catch on and it's totally
not too late for that
I also agree
I mean
the way I tend to think about it is that
you're not going to change
a system
by trying to change the whole
system all at once
and I think
that's why we started this company
is to support this community because we see that this
is the kernel
that's like the seed with which
the kind of pearl can form around
and that you can take that
and scale that
and feel like we're still in that
pre-scale mode
