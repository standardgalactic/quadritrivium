of making sure that the kernel of what we're doing
is sound
but I think we're getting close to the point
where enough people are starting
to take notice of these types
of models that eliminate all the
bad stuff and bring in all the good stuff
I think there's enough people
that are seeing this
that I think you'll start to see a tipping point
and that's when we can start to think about scale
and so yeah
I'm actually incredibly optimistic about the future
as it relates to healthcare
I just think that we need
to keep charging
so
any other questions
so we've got, I think
a gentleman right here
and then up front
then we've got one up front, Dino is up front
yeah thank you, great discussion
before you
got the discussion of around
healthcare
can you hear me?
great discussion
before you got to the discussion around
healthcare
in the current healthcare
you discussed the global
the different issues that are more global in nature
now
this is really a unique
mostly a US
unique to the US
that we are discussing about
the patient
the healer
patient interaction
problem
would you say that it's unique
to the US
in the context that we are talking about
or is there a
or what influence does
the global
community have in this
with the increasing
globalization
increasing interaction
among the different
societies
do you first see
what influence do you
first see
in the improvement of our
patient
healer interaction
I don't know
country wide statistics
on
satisfaction levels patients
have with the feeling of care
of their doctors
to be able to rank them
I don't have
a clear sense of that
there are obviously
pretty significant differences
based on
the wealth of a country based on
social services available
things like that
but there is also a lot of global standardization
and we saw that
so potent leader in COVID
because of course
let's say that we take a major nation
like the United States and it decides
that its approach is something like a
mandatory vaccine
or at least a
requirement of it for travel
or things like that if it decides that
then anyone else that wants to have a travel relationship
with the US is now going to have to do
a similar thing which means
that even though there was not a
international regulatory body
market type dynamics in that
meaning that whoever
the leaders are
those processes now
become widespread and that I think has been
true in many areas of medicine
in terms of this
question about
the quality of the human contact
I would guess that somewhere
like Bhutan probably has
a much better version of that
that doesn't mean their system of medicine
as a whole is better
in general I think that's a part of medicine
that was often better previously
and while medicine advanced
and got better technologically
I think one of the biggest
externalities has actually been the patient
doctor healing connection
for
all the reasons that you guys know
I think the positive side
of this question of
the global influence is that
if a
good enough prototype happens
anywhere I think it does have the ability
to influence and scale everywhere
We've got a question up the front
for Dino
and keep it quick Dino
no long run on questions
You know that's not going to happen
I don't want to sound like
a therapeutic nihilist
and I don't know how to
ask this question
without sounding like one
but you know
background in clinical epidemiology
so when I look at the numbers I find
a problem with the idea
of the social determinants of health
Social what? Social determinants
of health which posit that 90%
of health outcomes
or maybe well-being
or welfare broadly
are not related to medical care
90% is related to access to health care
and I would posit
9 of those points are primary care
and only one from specialty
so the question becomes
do we have a problem
with resource allocation
that they're going to this
technological and industrial foundation
of medical care
as it has evolved
and is not focusing on other
larger metacrisis
maybe even meaning crisis kinds of issues
that are going to end up
be more positive for the rest of us long term
Maybe actually Daniel
maybe address the kind of how medicine
one of the questions I had
I think it's maybe related to this
is how kind of medicine has to
involve addressing other sectors
so I think you know like manufacturing
and agriculture and things like that
so I think that could be maybe a good combo
One of the things
for me is
the benefits of this particular model
you all are working with here is
how many more things
can be done through telemedicine
because of the financial system
and so I think the ability
for things like continuous blue coast
monitoring and better and better
biometric systems at home
and things like metabolomics
and image recognition
being able to make
preventative medicine and early diagnostic medicine
way better, cheaper, more ubiquitous
like I think that's extremely
interesting and exciting and the idea
that the primary care physician
could have
access to those
computational diagnostic tools
and a telemedicine process
so that things that someone doesn't want to go
to the doctor for but they would actually
hop on a quick phone call or
FaceTime and increasingly
the doctor can actually
just say yes upload my daily metabolomics
or glucose monitor or whatever it is
here so that the moment
I see a pattern the doctor can actually reach
out to the patient and give them input
