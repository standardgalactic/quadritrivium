AI tutoring capability but it also then gets
to think about the difference between different types
of intelligence and different types
of theory of mind and when that happens
the recursion when you start thinking about
intelligence recursively
intelligence has a kind of exponential growth
curve so what this portends
for the future of human learning intelligence
is so amazing so imagine
now that you have that kind of tutoring
ability also in medicine where that AI
that identified a causal relationship
that it can't show you very easily
just from the way that it learned it
because it learned it through some
very complex topological assessment
it can translate
into a set of causal mechanisms
that you can't understand
and so we're looking
at both in this situation
the AI being a pattern
identifying tool
as well as a educational tool
So we've
actually come to time so thank
you all for sticking around
with us and asking questions and thank you Daniel
and I really hope my next conversation
with you isn't with a deep fake
so thank you so much for being with us
Thank you
