and we can see that in medicine too
we can already see that
machines like the Da Vinci
are going to replace
surgeons for a lot of very technical things
and obviously
the ability to take
like
the evolution of diagnostics
to be able to run a lot more
biomarkers a lot more cheaply
so that you get really kind of big data on an individual
mass spec is getting cheaper
and home devices
like continuous glucose monitoring
are getting better and better to become like telemedicine type things
so you take the intersection of those
and you get something like
really high quality at home metabolomics
where you can take urine or saliva
run an entire metabolome
and be able to upload that to a cloud
people can't make sense of that
like the total amount of data
is unprocessable
can big data both to
monitor the individual over time
but also to monitor all people to notice
all these people who got this kind of cancer had these
as the earliest markers way before
any cancer indicator we currently had
is a lot of
diagnostics going to become
the intersection of much better
diagnostic technologies
plus big data and
processing plus AI totally
and
obviously even things like image recognition
on much larger databases than a doctor
can hold in their mind
so then the role of the doctor in the future
will become largely
what are the things the AI does not do well
that are still the things that the doctor does well
and the interface between the patient
and the technologies
and so
there will still be a role for a surgeon
in relationship with the surgical
AIs
but it's a different role
and the same thing with diagnostics
so I see that a huge part
of what the doctor becomes
is related to
deep human connection
which is the thing the AI is not going to do as well
and
being able to really
take enough time with the patient
and ask enough questions to be able to find out
what is being started after
a micro head injury
that might have created a subclinical TBI
that doesn't show up on a
MRI but maybe would show up on a spec scan
or if it happened after
some mold in their house that again
they didn't notice as an acute thing
but all the things that can be
delayed causation, chronic causes of things
emotional dynamics, whatever
for the doctor to ask enough questions
to really get a sense of those things
you had on your website the example of this doctor
giving the TED talk
Dr Robb
where he
had the time
to say hey if she broke her foot and doing this thing
does she have a bone density issue
as simple a thing as that is to think about
you need a little bit of time
to be able to think about your patients
to put those things together so I think
the increasing
high quality connection
relationship with the patient
and
the specialization things actually will become
increasingly
automated
I think that is a trend that will probably happen
and probably should happen and so then
I really like the idea of a direct payer
starting with primary care model
that is increasing the amount of time
the doctors and the patients are able
to spin together and trying to emphasize
the patient working with
a primary care provider that can pay attention
to them, track them, care about them more
I think that's very much aligned with
some of the key technological advances
in the future of medicine
so basically
I think
by the way I didn't tell him to say that
but basically restoring
the patient-physician relationship
restoring the integrity
of that primary care
almost like the spirit of primary care
restoring that
and reconnecting the patient to the doctor
as AI comes online
as kind of exponential tech
kicks in further and further within healthcare
the sort of the last
thing
that will be automated, maybe never
it's hard to tell
if we get general intelligence then
anything's impossible but up until
that point the last thing that will
be replaced is that primary care
relationship and actually if anything
in order to ensure that that is
a successful sort of
non-dystopic future
we need to basically restore the integrity
of that primary care relationship now
such that we can
move forward into the future and then leverage
these technologies in such a way that makes
sense for everyone involved so
I agree
There's something that I found really inspiring
several years ago
I was invited to this conference called
Heart-Based Medicine
and
it was mostly traditional medical doctors
there not like
naturopaths and herbalists or whatever
but they were contemplating what the future of medicine
should be that created
the doctor-patient
healing relationship at the centre of medicine
if they're going to rethink it
and there were some breakout groups where everyone
got to think about what is the future of medicine
that they would most like to see happen
and the thing that the most people said
and I was really inspired by this is that
they would like to see hospitals that are more like temples
or sacred spaces of some kind
with a particular denomination
but the idea that this is a space
where people are going to die
and this is a space where people are going to be
born and this is a space where people are going to be
near death and watch their family members
and those experiences and have
really hard conversations around
you have to make these deep life shifts that
involve addiction in your early trauma or you'll die
like there's no space
that addresses
the sacred things of life more potently
and that everything that
decreases the potency of that sacred connection
should be removed
and I
I also hold that
being as
central as the technological
and you know better
institutional advances
in medicine.
So just to repeat that
everything that decreases
the sacred connection between
the healer or the physician
should be removed.
I actually think that would be good
maybe a good opportunity to
would you be open if we take some Q&A
from the audience?
So we've got some mic runners
for those of you who want to go get a drink
feel free to do so.
We're going to stay up here and continue the conversation
and we'd love to have any audience questions
and if you don't have any I've got a bunch more
so you know don't
worry about that.
Thank you so much this was
incredibly interesting.
