200,000 or 300,000 years of homo sapien history and the couple million years of hominin history
we always lived in tribes there was no such thing as not living in tribes until extremely
recently but we've been this way long enough that it seems like the nuclear family household
was the most obvious thing and the only thing that could ever be and we can't really imagine
anything else and yet it evolutionarily we evolved to fit in tribes so we so all the
shit about attachment theory we we evolved to have attachment to like 150 people like strong
attachments and where our life literally depended upon them we couldn't get our the the person who
knows medicine it's the only person who knows medicine i'm not going to interact with other
people so i can't just have a market opportunity to go to anybody so i actually need people and
they need me so i can't be a shithead to them so i and everybody's going to see what everybody
does so i can't lie and get away with it so like everything about psychology attachment theory
bonding the ideas of codependence and interdependence we're totally different and we evolved in that
setting right so then we get birth control and we're like oh sex doesn't have to equal reproduction
anymore even though forever sex always equals possibility of reproduction we evolved to have
our neural chemistry means sex equals the possibility of reproduction we put in birth
control our neural chemistry and our evolutionary value didn't just change overnight but now we're
acting in a way where it's like as if it doesn't mean that thing but a huge part of our whole
being is responding that way so the reason i bring this up is if we were to try to comprehensively list
all of the things
that are conditioning our psyches in ways that they did not evolve
to process and that are not optimal for us at an individual thriving a community thriving
or a global thriving would be this podcast would take days um and so that's a big topic
i just want to yes um if and i say that because if i say anything else first i'm
concerned that people over norm on that as the thing and then again lose observation to all
the things and complexity of all things so if i wanted to speak to something as the thing it would
be the nature of mind that makes us lose orientation to the complexity and the interconnectivity of
all the things um so if i if i was going to try to say what is the psychological generator function
of the metacrisis one i think as good a way of saying it as i could is kind of
not exactly the way david bone said it but it's derived from the way i heard him when he said the
problems of the world result from a fragmented consciousness that sees the world as a bunch
of parts and doesn't see the wholeness of things and he talked about wholeness in the
implicate order and can we perceive through that wholeness and obviously we know he was a student
of einstein's and einstein said it's an optical delusion of consciousness to believe there are
separate things there is one thing that we call universe and that we have to work to develop our
perception um so some of the problems in the world happen by be by intentionally advantaging
some things at the expense of other things we know it'll cause an expense so we're advantaging
our country at the expense of another country in a war which means our people our land our
riches or whatever at the expense of that for those people um that obviously means we're able to
separate the world enough to be able to think about this trade-off of good for these ones
and even though we know it's bad for these ones okay because we separate the interconnectedness
of everything and whether it's a country doing that to another country or in a relationship
of a person doing that to another person thinking they can possibly win a fight and someone they
love actually not get their needs met and that equals a good life for them somehow which is
fucking ridiculous idea um uh or at the level of corporations or anything else or humans with
regard to the biosphere or other animals we can advantage ourselves at their expense which
obviously a factory farm and an uh uh industrial fishing fleet are not good for those animals
are not good for the oceans are not good for the people working on them in poor conditions
the other problems in the world is where we didn't know that we're causing the harm right so we can
either benefit something at the expense of something else knowingly or we can benefit
something at the harm of something else not knowing so conflict theory and mistake theory
um and the real politic assessment of humans is the problems in the world are because we are
dumb and nasty right like roughly if you want to make it very simple dumb is we cause problems
that we didn't anticipate and nasty as we cause problems that we knew we're going to happen and
so the how do we enlighten humans has to deal with both the dumb and nasty part right if we're
talking if we're talking about how do we have the not not just how do you affect human behavior
through different rewards and deterrents and social norms and systems of law but through people
wanting something different having an internal motivational basis it would be can we expand
the circle of care where they care about more that's the even the nasty part and can we expand the
complexity of process where they can actually calculate their effects so that they are not
unintentionally harming things more that's the deal with the dumb part um but similarly there if I'm
thinking about
co2 and how critical it is to get it down but I'm not thinking about ocean dead zones
from nitrogen effluent using nitrogen fertilizer to grow more crops that will sequester more co2
seems like a good idea even though it's going to cause this other externalized issue
so again my ability to separate the ocean dead zones and the co2 is what's causing that unintentional
right or thinking about that facebook will be some cool system for people being able to tag photos
and get to know each other not thinking about what its effect on democracy will be with that particular
ad model I would say all the problems look like people all the problems come from harm happening
somewhere as a result of human choice but the choice was motivated by someone trying to benefit
something so they're all based on tradeoffs so it's either I'm trying to benefit myself now at
my own future expense addiction and compulsiveness I am uh so the parts conflict can even be within
oneself right um I'm trying to benefit my people my religion my nation my political party whatever
at the expense of the other one so great you get your political party elected you polarize the
population worse next time they'll swing back harder and you're actually not progressing anything
other than increasing polarization um or I am seeking to benefit things and the harm I'm
causing elsewhere I just didn't know I didn't know that leachate was going to cause that pollution
over there or whatever the other thing is so when bone was talking about the fragmented
consciousness it was both at the level of aware of the connectedness and care about the connectedness
and so really the key is seeing reality as parts right seeing reality as a bunch of separated parts
leads to being able to care about a part and seek to advantage it in a way that causes harm to
other things and then cascade effects of other agents doing this similar stuff and so you get
cumulative harm effects and you get escalating arms races so not being able to perceive stuff as a
bunch of separated parts but perceiving everything in relationship to everything else perceiving
everything as a part of an interconnected whole where your ability to benefit that thing had to
mean both caring about everything that it's connected to and being able to think through
everything that's connected to come up with a strategy that is omnibeneficial or as close to
that as possible and that where you made a mistake in it you're also ongoingly aware and working to
correct it I would say from the psychological perspective that's probably as deep a thing as
we can say and even stuff like but aren't people wouldn't wouldn't we say impulsiveness and selfishness
and addiction are even deeper than that because obviously all of the environmental harm is happening
because people are buying too much shit to get a keep up with the Joneses or get a hit of something
well it's still the same thing right like it's it is still the thing of that their future self is
being harmed for their momentary self because their momentary self feels fucked up enough that it
thinks that it means to get ahead of it so the parts conflict the the theory of tradeoff starts
within the self between the parts of itself the Jungian parts reconciliation then would be the
basis for being able to also have a wholeness of self in relationship with the wholeness of world
um
yeah let me let me um a couple of things uh given that and I've listened to you talk about these
issues a lot and sometimes I'm just left with just oh we are so fucked you know but given that
the solution of survivability as our current species on this our home seems to be ignorance
and just uh being bad actors uh do you feel that enough of us that there's any kind of hope or
sense that enough of us can evolve to a level where we can recognize this fractured and recognize
what we're doing enough to keep us together as a human family connected to the whole so that we
can survive this this choke point in our evolutionary history
I don't think there is much of a human family to keep together that is anything other than
an abstract idea at this point that some people hold and many people don't even hold
that's an ideal I think
the question of is it possible
to make it through the issues that the world is facing today the whole plurality of issues
that are unprecedented historically because we hadn't had centuries of industrial tech bringing
us up to planetary boundaries and we hadn't had exponential tech or even small number of actors
could fuck everything up so quickly and we didn't have a world that had so much fragility
given that we could have massive catastrophic harm from so many different vectors from synthetic
bio created pandemics and from AI autonomous drone weapons and from climate change and from
chemical planetary boundaries and from scaling war is there to make it through we have to avoid
all of those to fail we only have to have any of them happen and our crack record doesn't look good
right if you look back at the history of empires at all the history of war and environmental
destruction is a pretty big part of that story we don't seem to be really noble stewards of power
so as we're getting exponentially more power and we've usually used our power to
do power games with each other meaning destroy each other and in ways that harm the environment
is there any way that we can steward exponential power in a finite space I would say it takes a
step function like it will take something significant that is more than just the continuation of
whatever good aspects the enlightenment created or something like that
in the huge shift after world war two it was a big shift we made a whole new world system
but the answer was still
extract more from nature even faster make more money and make more tech like it the
Bretton Woods world system was a world system but in more increase for everybody was still a
somewhat easier thing to do than when you're hitting planetary boundaries and you have to say
no we actually have to reduce consumption across everybody where a lot of people are like no I
would rather not reduce my consumption go to war and have less people and I think I can win like
this it's hard the situation we're in right now is unprecedented at a global level in such deep ways
right so do I think it is possible to make it through I think the question is it possible to
make it through without great harm doesn't even make sense because we're in species extinction
and war today like great harm is happening today people are being killed in Ukraine people are
being killed in Armenia and Azerbaijan people are being killed all over because of these issues
and species are going extinct today so we're already in the great harm phase I almost know
adolescents don't have body dysmorphia in the Instagram etc world like that's
so we're already in that right now do I think we can make it through without catastrophes
where hundreds of millions of people die is one question do I think we can make it through where
there are any humans left I think we make it through where there are humans and something
that isn't just a totally scorched earth these are all different questions the answer
can we make it through without the catastrophes intensifying no no no chance so so
so given all this the the question comes up how then should we live given the truth of
well this next part is critical can we make it through without the catastrophes intensifying
no they're going to intensify because no matter what we do today there is no inactable path
to preventing the extreme weather events that climate change alone is going to mediate there's
a lot of things like that and then the human migration that's going to come from that we can
if we do the very best things we can make it less bad but there is also no we there is no we that
is a unified acting group right um the what china's interests are and what the us's interests are
what the individual with the left and right within the us's interests are what the individual us people
versus the elites in it they're not the same and so the whole like one of the biggest mistakes I made
growing up was I always thought in this royal we that like humanity thoughtfully was all reading
bucky's operating manual for spaceship earth and we're all you know thinking about un charters and
looking at the earth and the astronauts perspective and carrying carl sagan's pale blue dot and of
course we want to do the right and smart and good thing for everybody uh the thing that some people
think is really good the other people think is really horrible and when you realize that
the enactment gets really hard right is is the legality of abortion protecting women's freedoms
and rights or is it murdering infants um you'll see the most severe uh ideological differences
on what is good they create a basis for massive conflict and you see that across so many things
right so um that's why I said there isn't a human family to hang together like that's
that's an aspirational thing um do I think that if there is already a trajectory of some people who
care about not just their own political party or their own nation or their own race or even
their own species but care pretty considerably and are working in service of that that there are
increasing number of people who have both more care more capacity and more interconnectivity
and they cannot then also work with other people who maybe don't care about all of that but in
increasingly good coordination for the things they do care about yes that's happening right
there's a good thing in emergence that is happening do I think that that could be sufficient
to make it through without total extinction or scorched earth yes totally do I think it
can make it through without the catastrophes intensifying no they will intensify before even
on the best course do I think that it's a given that we make it through no which means we are no
matter what in a phase of increasing intensity ahead and with I think both the what it takes to
avoid all the catastrophes is deep enough change to the world systems that it's like that Bohmian
thing that we are neither harming each other on purpose or accident which means a kind of
more universal on the consideration or things like a human family is actually a real thing
so I think in order to not have a get much worse changes have to happen at a deep enough
level that it gets much better so I do think there's something like a pretty hard fork
and I think it can go either way and I think it is not determined and I think it is increasingly
potent and hard over the next while on in figuring that out so with that then the question how do
we live as the frame is I can't imagine a context in which one's choices could matter more
than that
indeed it gives a whole another level and depth and dimension to
the choices we make and the priorities we serve and the
how we live our lives and offer our lives and so what what are some of the parameters for an
effective contributing life that you see
a few more resources that I'll offer here another short little blog I wrote on how to live a meaningful life
which was intentionally not answering the question what is the meaning of life which we discussed
earlier but it said had a meaningful life and it's just
it's a way of talking about it there's lots of ways of talking about it that's not particularly
better than lots of other ways but I there's something that is kind of comprehensive and
kind of elegant about it so I'll offer it and it was looking at the mode of being
the mode of doing and the mode of becoming all being relevant and defining all of them in terms
of beauty and that thing we said earlier that truth and goodness matter because beauty is
so there it says the mode of being at its essence is about really deeply taking in the beauty of
reality and appreciating it giving gratitude for it honoring and loving it you know all those things
it's the essence of what the mode of being is really about
and that the mode of doing is about being in service to the beauty of reality protecting
it adding to it and the mode of becoming is deepening the capacity for being in doing
that I can appreciate ever more fully and that I can add to it ever more fully
and that a meaningful life is a recursive relationship between those three
and if what I'm doing isn't arising out of everything's fucked up so I have to fix everything
