appreciation of the whole and a desire to optimize service. And it seems like what I'm
hearing is that those two things led you to this in big picture integrative approach to
understanding and responding to the great issues of our time. Yeah, I'll share a few other things
that I think were significant influences that I'm grateful for and that I think are interesting
for everybody to look at is... I think there's a good bit of evidence that the
people that many of us find to be some of the greatest exemplars of human potential
were the result of developmental paths that are more accessible to everyone than lots of people
or think. Not just some weird genetic or situational anomaly. And I'm not saying that genetics plays
no role in aptitude, of course it does. The height is a real thing that's going to affect
aptitude, size, whatever, and maybe does it do that for neural connectivity? Sure. But
I believe his name is Eric Hoel, who was an academic who started a very interesting blog recently,
published this article that then has gotten a lot of traction and debate around where
of all the super genius has gone. And it's a resource I think is really interesting and worth
people paying attention to. Of course, there are problems with what we think of as super genius
because might a aboriginal tracker who doesn't solve Rubik's cubes particularly well or do the
normal IQ things be a super genius in a totally different set of dimensions on things we can't
even perceive with our normal cognitive science kind of models, sure. But if we just take what
he was meaning here, he was saying it seems that the Isaac Newton's and Einstein's and
the people that contributed novel insights to many fields that specialists in those fields
appreciated and hadn't done, that we are seeing less of that recently than we have in a long time.
And this is a whole fascinating debate. I know I'm a bit off topic, but I find this an interesting
topic and maybe relevant. Some people think the idea that there is less super genius now is just
wrong and some kind of romanticizing the past, but there's pretty meaningful data in here in
terms of how quickly do new scientific insights happen or philosophical insights or legal insights
happen that are paradigm shifting that would change a Cooney and paradigm or something like that.
Some people think it's that there's just so much more fucking knowledge now than there was that you
just can't be a polymath that you could have been a polymath before and all the stuff and
nobody can now that it takes all of your life to be a specialist in a tiny discipline and that the
only thing that can make breakthroughs now is huge teams of specialist scientists with big data
processing AIs. There's a lot of different ideas about it. Feynman famously said that he thought
he would be in the last generation of great physicists for some time based on what he saw
happening in the direction of physics and the direction of education and there have certainly
been some developments in physics since but maybe not of the type from modern physics to him.
I think there is some truth in this that has that we are actually developing people of that type
less globally independent of the increasing complexity of the world as also a factor.
I think there's a few reasons for it but one of them that seems to be pretty compelling and so this
this article about where the super genius has gone puts forth that there is a lot of data
that points to the idea that most of the great polymaths the super geniuses if you want to call
it were have one thing really clearly in common obviously not a hundred percent correlation but
a higher correlation than anything else which was that they were the result of aristocratic tutoring
high quality aristocratic tutoring and that post the kind of modernity and democratic
reformation of the world there was no aristocratic tutoring of the same kind and that it really makes
a difference so if you think about it this little boy in Tibet identifies certain bulls
in pain so we say he's the Dalai Lama from a reincarnation perspective but then how does he
get educated right yeah right the top llamas in Tibet who are the top meditators and oracles and
philosophers and historians and scholars and mathematicians are all privately training this
boy with the investment of their entire culture is the Dalai Lama the result of an educational
paradigm that doesn't really scale because how could you have the best teachers of a whole
peoples you know for everybody and is the Dalai Lama's type of consciousness and capacity
actually something that could be trained if people had access to that it's a fair question
when you read meditations by Marcus Aurelius which is also a great philosophic text the first
chapter he dedicates just to his tutors right the intact like he writes the book of stoic philosophy
as the emperor of Rome and the first chapter is just a dedication to his tutors because when
you're being raised to be the emperor of Rome during Rome's high period the best mathematician
in all of Rome is your math teacher and the best historian and there was another study I had seen
I find this theory of education stuff so deeply fascinating there's a study I'd seen that was
looking at world class or what were considered first rate mathematicians and they had some way
of defining what a first rate mathematician was and it wasn't just a field's medal it was something
some set of things but the highest statistical correlator they could find across everyone who
became a first rate mathematician to see like is there some trait that where we can predict this
is that when they were young they started to study with a first rate mathematician
and of course someone could do a correlation causation question and say was it only because
they had such exceptional ability that a first rate mathematician paid attention to them when
they were young but it does not appear that that is the direction of causation that they
got exposed to a first rate mathematician was teaching at their particular school for a while
at the time whatever because there are certain classes where a whole bunch of them came out of
that class where that teacher was and it makes sense because your average first grade or 12th
grade math teacher at a high school is not a first rate mathematician they're not even a second or
third rate mathematician the the brilliance of mathematical thinking the love of it the insight
the passion they don't have it they have something else right they study to be an educator they study
in a country that couldn't pay you all that much to be an educator so they aren't even a first
rate educator so can you learn how to think like a first rate mathematician from a normal math teacher
who is themselves someone who has never even had thought like that probably not and the same would
be true for spiritual insight or for anything else and so when you look at Marcus Aurelius you're
like it was who he was actually just the result of a good educational model and
when the modern democracies were forming the idea of feudalism was so disgusting and
were pregnant for many reasons and had to be shed away that anything that was a remnant of
feudalism had to be put away but in democratizing education to raise higher education for so many
people you also lowered the highest version of education to where the wealthy people whose
kids are getting tutoring today is to keep up with the normal scholastics of a curriculum based thing
it's not a personalized tutoring system for the most part and so I do partly why I was bringing
this up is that you know I didn't have a whole field of tutors but I had parents that were doing
that with me and then because I saw how valuable it was to have invested people be in that level
of dialogue I started seeking out tutors before I even knew this and this is like maybe the highest
thing I can recommend to young people or for parents what to do with their kids I somehow
knew because I also had stuff like think and grow rich and the kind of like tenacity of a
Carnegie to be self-directed as part of the thing but hopefully along a different set of goals than
just monetary accumulation but if you have the tenacity of a Carnegie associated with other
developmental goals which would be a really good thing whenever I found a teacher that seemed like
they knew something I really wanted to learn I figured out what I could possibly do to be useful
to them and that looked like cleaning their house and changing babies diapers and learning skills I
didn't have they needed electrical done I would learn electrical to those like whatever the fuck
it is this is where I want to study from so I'm going to figure out how to be around them and be useful
to them and so much of my learning was not what I studied in university that was cool or even just
in books on my own it was people who were really really fucking brilliant spending time with me
directly because I figured out how to partly I was a gift and partly I figured out how to make that
happen and Daniel is part of what you're saying as far as the tutor also a mentor relationship
having older people that can not only just download information but somehow impact your soul and your
being and you know it's all together see in a mentoring relationship they're not just topical
artists right they're who have because they're teaching to a whole class have to teach a curriculum
you're the kid is asking them questions that they're interested in the range beyond their
subject matter and the and the teacher in that relationship actually cares about them and loves
them and gets invested in their education so they ended up getting the benefit of something like good
parenting but multiplied by a lot more people a lot more capacities that error correct each other
and so the cognitive education shouldn't be limited to one domain separate from others it
should go across the domains but it shouldn't be limited to just cognitive education it should be
that the you know and so first the various domains of ontology need to integrate it you need to be
able to think about biology and chemistry and physics and etc together next is you have to
integrate a cross ontology and epistemology whenever the kid is learning something it's not
just here is how it works it's why does it work that way how is that discovered that this is one
of the next key insights is I never wanted to know a formula in math I wanted to know how long
people knew that that problem was interesting and didn't have the formula who discovered at first
what novel thing about their life gave them that insight what other new things they discovered
afterwards because of that you know like I wanted to know the epistemology and I find that when you
get that and you start to get what is the generator function of novel insight what is across all the
domains the the people who discovered the most important thing what was happening in them that
made them discover the most important thing you can start to develop that in yourself rather than
just a huge knowledge set in which case we're just shitty computers and so you want to integrate
all the ontologies you want to integrate ontology and epistemology and then all of that in the
cognitive domain you want to integrate to why do you care at all why do you care to want to learn so
the ethics the aesthetics the pragmatics also come in and the identity of the person in relationship
to it comes in and and and is there a developmental sense of responsibility that's transmitted it's
like I don't want to let my dad down my mom down these people that taught me I want to live up to
the the quality of the love and the gifts and the knowledge that they're imparting to me
you know
people being motivated to care about
people and animals and life forms that they will never meet and will never give them credit
like it takes some work it takes some developmental work to get there enough that
you'll make real sacrifices to care where you don't get any obvious credit for that it takes
having some sense of your identity expanded beyond your own individual self where you're
looking through their eyes right and you're and you get that they actually matter to you
reality but at first if somebody believes in a sky god that is all knowing all seeing and
internal punishment if you fuck up and they know your thoughts so you can't just virtue signal
because you can't virtue signal the god that knows it and eternal reward if you get it right so
even if you're really just a shithead who just doesn't want to get punished and wants to get a
reward you still have to be good all the way down to the level of your thoughts that's kind of awesome
right like from the point of view of just how do you get a lot of people who might still be
narcissists in a low degree of truly ethical development to do the right thing that kind of
like sky god judicial system is kind of awesome and another now it's also terrible because then
of course everybody's terrified of burning in hell forever and has to think that someone else
who's not getting it right is and they have to terrify their kids of burning in hell but
but in the same way the idea that many many traditions had that when I die I'm going to be
with the ancestors and I'm going to like and there's some glory of my of the great teachers
and will and they're still watching me right and and when I go to be with my forefathers
with the teachers in eternity and afterlife do I actually deserve to be with them
there's something in noble that can do right there's something powerfully ennobling that
old tradition can do of course we also find out that our great teachers are people that have their
failings and weaknesses and we have to wrestle with that and we're going to have our own failings
and weaknesses and we might get intellectually congruent enough to have some doubts on the
metaphysics of that thing but there is there is definitely something even if you don't go to
the metaphysics the afterlife version there is something about feeling that you received
something that you don't get to take credit for that you're fortunate that someone else was born
into a situation that if you were born into you'd be doing less well and that you were fortunate to
get to have these experiences and that you owe something to them and to the future world because
of that fortune I think that's really important anyway I've got to bring this up preparing for
this I went to your websites and I came across a blog article you've written things that I learned
from my dad I was deeply moved by this I halfway through when we got to the part how to treat women
I think I started weeping and immediately I like your father but I like you because this is what
you remembered from your father and it was so incredibly powerful and basic and I see such a
need for young men to be initiated into some sort of positive manhood and what your father laid out
I got a lot from my father but obviously he was not as articulate as your dad
that he lived a lot of these principles that you were talking about and can I read one of them
I love this the highest value for men is serving women nature and children future generations
the highest value for men
you should shout it from the rooftops that's incredibly profound
yeah my dad would say things all the time like you're either serving your family or the family
of mankind or your off-path those are the only two things that you can be doing that are not off-path
and the family of mankind was the term used but inclusive of life not just human life
yeah I mean I wrote that because my dad's health was very delicate at the time and it wasn't clear
if he was going to be around much longer or not and so often people write a eulogy of all the things
that they appreciated from their parent after they're dead and they don't get to experience it
directly and I thought that that would be a loss and so I wanted to write it for that reason
but I also wanted to write it that particular one is definitely not a full expression
of what I learned from my dad it was called things I learned about being a man from my dad
and so it was it was definitely oriented to the
principles that have to do with transfer of masculinity as opposed to just would be equally
true for all people some of them are of course that and part of the reason that I wrote it at
that time was I think I had had in conversations a rise in the week or two before of
men young men so boy into man phase who had just clearly never been fathered in important ways
and were causing pain to women they were in relationships with to people around them were
being or leaders and it was just I was like there are so many people that didn't have so many men
that are in their masculine role not having the fortune of having had a good role model of
teaching in that way and I wonder if some tiny little bit of vicarious element of it can come
through by writing about it so that's why I wrote that one in that way I think it came through for
me brother thank you for that and one of the things he said is like on your time off what you
do is you get in your pickup truck this was before cell phones and all and you drive around and find
people are having trouble with their cars getting them started you you fix their cars and send them
on their way and he said that's a good time that's the way to spend your day off and it's all
his orientation noble disinterested service and it's just anyway but it was so funny because
yeah this was before cell phones and so when someone broke down on the side of the road
pulling over to pick them up was an important thing and you know my I think part of teaching
someone about how the world works in general and also part of the ideas and I understand this is
normative like by gender normative thinking on the thing that is how it was given to me
was that for a boy growing into a man knowing how to solve problems and fix things
was a particularly important thing so anytime there was construction to do he always involved
me and it even were involving me and it took a lot more time than doing it without me because
he was not just trying to fix the thing he was also trying to raise a child who would someday
not just be an adult but would themselves be a parent and a teacher and how to
do that thing properly and whenever there was something to fix on the car it took
10 times longer to show me how to do it and you know then then not and so but then it was also
