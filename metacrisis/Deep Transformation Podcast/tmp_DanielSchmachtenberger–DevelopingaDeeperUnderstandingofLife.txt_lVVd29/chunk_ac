while we're fixing the car there were so many things like if a job is worth doing it's worth
doing well and well begun is half done and see the job do the job stay out of the misery these
kind of idioms and the if the job is worth doing it's worth doing well meant just no half-assing
the thing like we and so like I'll give you an example that was so beautiful I remember the
first time we're building a building from the ground up we laid the studs and then we drilled
to the studs to run the wire for the outlets and it was very important to my dad that the way the
wiring was in the wall before the drywall went on was beautiful that the holes were at the same
height that the Romex was not twisted and that it was beautiful and no one would ever fucking see it
we're about to cover it in drywall and you're like why and he's like you know you know you know
it's an incredible teaching that's and there's something where it's like the if you can do it
any of the ways do it the way that is the most integrous the most awful the most beautiful
and you will feel better about it and you'll feel better about who you are and then your
unconscious default in the moments where it matters and other things will be to do the
thing in the highest way you possibly can as opposed to asking the corner cutting questions and
um so the if it's worth doing it's worth doing well see the job do the job stay out of the misery
meant uh don't even ask if it's possible and definitely don't bitch about it just if it needs
done figure out how to do it and do it with the best attitude because you have choice over your
attitude and why would you do it any other way um and well begun is half done meant have you
cleaned the space first have you set out the tools do you know what the workflow is going to be
because the problems that are going to come up when you've opened everything up it's up on the
jacks and you realize you're missing something and you have to go to the store like that's where
the danger happened that's where someone gets hurt that's where the inefficiency happens that's
so think through the process pretty well first um and anticipate where the mistakes and the
problems and the challenges are going to happen there's so much of my work in the
metacrisis that is anticipate where the unanticipated externalities going to happen
and then internalize those future externalities into the choice making process better and uh yeah
yeah like I can see now how you are basically uh self-taught and coached and mentored into
uh into the ideals which would lead you into a life of service into a way of thinking
which would bring you into a big picture approach and into a planning mode that would allow you to
anticipate second third order complications and to think through those to uh you were honed for
the work you're doing now wait there's something that I was starting to say it's important please
remember your thought because I don't want you to forget it but I don't want to forget this
but you were you had um mentioned John the um that a fun time was to load up the tools
and go looking for people who are broken down and fix up their car because
AAA wouldn't necessarily come all the time especially if it was snowing outside they
could actually be in danger um so obviously that meant you know there I had to know some
how to fix a car type skills so I was mentioning that my dad would take a lot more time to do the
thing than pay someone else to do it and to do it with me than do it on his own because he was
wanting me to learn learning these other deeper psychological spiritual integrity lessons along
with it like well begun is half done and if a job's worth doing this worth doing well but then
also um learning the mechanical engineering of why was the screw threaded this way rather than the
other way and why was the sting built this way and then the history of internal combustion engines
and when the transmission came out and the um you know like and and then the physics of how
the explosion happens inside of the piston and so there's a very integrated set
of knowledge that was happening and that takes just a lot of investment right takes a lot of
care and a lot of investment and but then when we would do that it was like sunday father son
let's have fun um he wasn't into sports so we didn't throw a ball uh that's my my
anti-coordination at the level of ball throwing didn't develop all that much but we would uh
load the load the truck up with tools and go look for people who are broken down and fix it
up and the interesting thing was it didn't feel like some dreadful sacrifice of service that we
had to do the way that a lot of people um feel when they're doing some church activity as kids
they don't like it felt like the most fun thing we could possibly do like it was just actually
really enjoyable because one i'm getting this high quality time with my dad right he's not
trying to get me to go do the thing on my own who we're getting to be learning in the process
and then helping people where there's this immediate you know expression of these people
being delighted and surprised and so there was absolutely it wasn't just like an ethic of service
it was like a like a way to condition that as that the what i want for myself personally and
who i want to be for the world there wasn't even a distinction yeah beautiful yeah and
another thing your dad said and i'll stop parping on your dad i could go on and on this but he said
and this is so simple but so profound he said forgive just as a given you've got to forgive
and the second part is help them do better so you just don't forgive okay i'm okay i'm clear
you know i didn't bother anymore because i forgive him but the other part is help them
do better i just think that's one of my and i was a kid and there's a period where my
parents were in the tm community and built this beautiful community called lake view
estates out in fairfield and we're working on on the kind of enlightened theme park and
and a development business and there was someone that was an extremely close friend of the family
and um kind of employee and partner who had for whatever reasons um decided that he was going to
come into our house and steal a bunch of the artwork and uh because he you know had the
key to the house and all like that and uh you know but the trail like that oftentimes very easy to be
like want to be vindictive or at least totally cut ties i remember my dad intercepting him
not letting him do that and then taking him out and having this conversation like dude what the
fuck like what happened inside your head is this who you want to be and and there was still to like
help them do better um and one of the ones that really stood out to me and you know i there's
something where i feel torn about this first just as a caveat i must say the reason i didn't
write one about my mom at the time was because i don't think there is as gruesome a deficit of
mothering in the world as there is fathering currently and so i didn't have as many women
in sharing with me just like kind of abject failures of fundamental things as i had guys so
i was a little bit more motivated for that reason also her health is better but my mother is also
everybody's important in in my life and childhood and who i became and uh was the one that got me
into activism and had me going door to door with and had all the protests with pita and greenpeace
and all those things as a kid and got me studying art and introduced me to dolly and picasso and
jebron and blake and you know brought me to all the world religions churches and
but going back to my dad here my dad had a strong patriarchal line that taught him some
of these things his dad was first generation green beret and so that you know taught that way
but he also had a really fucked up childhood with a humongous amount of trauma
his dad commits suicide his sister commits suicide is many of his family members were in
and out of incarceration in mental institutions and and the violence of the childhood he was in
he's covered in physical scars from weapons you know like he had a rough go of it and so
some of what he got he got directly but a lot of it was his way to not kill himself was to say
maybe he's not crazy the entire world is crazy because the whole world he was exposed to seem
completely crazy to him and he'd rethink everything from scratch and so when you do that you come up
with a lot of good and interesting things and also are going to make a lot of mistakes and
their painful parts in the process and I didn't emphasize those in that letter because it wasn't
the purpose of the letter the article but you know my path benefited from all the extreme
gifts and it had some like quite interesting hardships as a result of the complexity of
who he was from transcending his life all those other things is what got me into therapy young
and which I'm also very grateful for because then I ended up getting a huge amount of
you know basically parenting from the therapeutic traditions
the reason I say that is so that people don't think oh well I can't do well because I had trauma
because I didn't have some of these gifts I everybody's life has some gifts and has some
fucked up stuff and the difficult stuff the healing of it is what catalyzes their gifts
and I just want to say that and some of the gifts that he had were really
fairly rare and unusual I'm very grateful for that some of the issues he had were somewhat
unusual but when it comes to one of the things on the forgive he definitely had the gift of being
physically heroic and there are military men who are trained in that a lot of people are not
in this age physically heroic in previous ages that was much more common
and there was a time here in Encinitas when I was like 20
where which is usually not a violent area my dad was in the
parking lot on thoroughfare here El Camino Real gunshots rang out handful of gunshots
from a blind store and everybody who was in the parking lot ran the other way or dropped my dad
ran straight at the blind store he figured the shooter was still alive and in there turned out
the shooter after killing the other person killed himself so by the time my dad got in there the
shooter was dead it was a husband who was going in there to suicide homicide his wife
and the but he shot himself he stabbed her and when he thought he had finished killing her
then he shot himself when my dad got there she was bleeding out but not dead and so he started
to put compression and turn the kits and whatever on you know all the areas where the ambulance
and police came but then he went to the hospital to be with her and then followed up with her
afterwards and in addition to like she would have bled out if he was not there saving her life
was him wanting to make sure that she could forgive her husband for that because of knowing how
fucked up he was and that he's no longer you know in pain himself or a risk to anybody else
but that was like it was his default mode and I mean almost too fast that it can be a bypass
but in that moment it was both and you know just a very interesting thing about him is like
thinking the shooter was still alive he thought I can keep my body moving long enough if I take
shots that I can take him out and more civilians won't get killed which means he was willing to
risk his life for people he had never met didn't even couldn't even see to know what color they were
a race or whatever this is very noble very beautiful and then the moment the harm of the
dying was out of the way the harm of her holding on to that grudging sentiment was the next one he
was focused on. What a gift to be exposed to and live with someone like that and not only an education
but a transmission of normal values and priorities and to take up a theme a question I began with a
little while ago as you've described this it's getting more and more clear how your life has been
self-developed and honed and gifted by multiple people to bring you to your life's work which has
been the metacrisis and how we as a species and a civilization can continue because clearly we're
in danger right now and presumably will be forever after because the technology is probably only
going to get more developed and greater capacities etc so you've been you've been you've had these
ideals of service transmitted to you've had attitudes of handling them schoolfully looking
for complications thinking ahead etc you've also had the multidisciplinary education so how does the
how does the to these depths the spiritual depths that and self-inquiry you've gone through not
only in spirituality but in psychotherapy and philosophic inquiry how do these how do these
depths inform you about our contemporary crises and what do you see lacking that these
these steps when these depths aren't appreciated what do we miss
I was speaking with a friend recently who does conservation work and she's a brilliant conservationist
who has kept huge important areas of high biodiversity intact and has done so at a
significant devotion including expense of her own personal life and in other areas
we're talking and she had just been in conversation with some of the world's wealthiest people
and she asked me when someone asks why should we protect nature how to answer it
because that was obviously their question and I said well there's a lot of answers that we can give
that from a you from the utility perspective of helping them get why they should care we
we look at what they currently care about and we show a rationalized argument between why
the harm that would come to nature would harm something they would care about right we draw
those connections but before getting there the fact that someone has to ask that question in
earnest speaks to something broken in them at minimum something pathologically underdeveloped
and if they had had a life where they grew up in any real contact with their own embodiment
their own kind of biology and experience of being in a body being and in any real contact with
nature and other sentient beings that question just wouldn't even arise
it would be prima facie right it would be it would be obvious and the question would simply be
how do we do a better job with it and I saw one of the in the brief look one of the questions
that you sometimes explore with guests of like what are the questions that orient their relationship
to the sacred and I think at the at the heart of it it's not even a question right it's a
something more like a perception I think if someone is perceiving somewhat clearly
then the sacredness of life is prima facie just is and I don't remember the exact quote but it was a
Joseph Campbell quote that was something to the effect of
that we think what we want is to know what the meaning of life is when what we're
actually seeking is the experience of being fully alive and I don't think that is the whole
because someone can experience being fully alive in fairly self-centered ways just doing
you know extreme sports and whatever but it is also true that in the moments where someone is
experiencing feeling fully alive they're not an existential angst about what is the meaning of life
and I think that oftentimes the actual intrinsic sacredness and meaningful of
meaningfulness of life that happens through a deep enough bandwidth of connection and sensing
the longing for that it's filtered through the mind as a desire to understand what is the purpose
of all of this what is the meaning with a whole bunch of bad assumptions about like what thing is
it building to that seems like a terminal value that then I can't then that will be a satisfying
answer where if we say well the purpose is love then I say well what is the purpose of that or
the purpose is learning well what is the purpose of it it's so we can the first the concept of
purpose and the concept of meaningfulness are not identical but the reality of them and the
concept of them are not the same either and so how to develop a deeper connection to the
a deeper connection to life and deeper ability to perceive the innate uniqueness of everything
and the interconnectedness of everything at the same time right the interconnectedness of it all
but not it's not it's not a homogenous oneness where because if it's a homogenous oneness
it doesn't matter how many of these ones die it doesn't matter if the species goes the oneness
is still oneness if it is just uniqueness but not interconnectedness well then in the service
of this one I can damage these ones it's every part unique and every part radically interconnected
in which case it is all an expression of the whole so I whatever I care about I also have
to care about all of it because it's connected and also each part is irreplaceable and those
totally precious right and it's not that is the thought it's that is the perception
from there from that base state of perception I think the right other questions and analytics
more naturally arise yes so the to the extent we can open ourselves to
the totality of experience to to life the world and to ourselves to that extent in some ways
and so in one sense one could say the questions fall away because the questions are conceptual
and we're you're now speaking to an experiential openness and directness
that give birth to understandings or intuitions which can flower into concepts
obviously I'm obviously into concepts right I'm obviously into work
you're a good company um I wrote a blog piece a while ago called the dance of the
Tao and the 10 000 things and maybe that one can be linked I'm specifically talking about that because
you know there's this concept in Taoism that every day in the practice of knowledge something is
added every day in the practice of the Tao something is dropped and but I think they are
both meaningful and I think that not only there's a way in which learning more about the 10 000
things the field of conceptuality and interfere with one's connection to the Tao there's a way
that it can also enhance it yes you don't know how they can dance together if you don't know how it
can enhance it then you have to just avoid intellect mind past future mostly the things
that are uniquely sapient uniquely adult sapient and say look at the lilies of the field look at
