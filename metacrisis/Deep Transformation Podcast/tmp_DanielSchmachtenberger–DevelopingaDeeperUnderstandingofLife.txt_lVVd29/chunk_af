but it's arising out of perceiving working on this hunger issue because we're perceiving the
utter meaningfulness and beauty of these kids or these people in their life and the importance of
it and the and so then the doing the desire to serve and protect arises not from the perception
of all the badness but actually arises from the perception of the beauty from which the good
which also means the bad is framed at all right so the thing that really is terrible and pisses us
off is because something that is beautiful and sacred is being harmed which then brings us back
to there's something that we actually love and have devotion to so we trace it back to that and say
how do I be in service there so the doing must arise from the being
and the becoming is I don't just want to perceive the beauty I currently see I want to perceive
ever deeper dimensions of things that I had missed you know I want to ask what aspects of the
of reality are important and beautiful that I'm missing that other people are noticing that I'm
not honoring as fully as I could and then similarly with our doing where do I have frameworks for what
I'm where is what I'm doing coming from ego and trauma and wounding where have I been running a
strategy so long if I stopped and thought about it from scratch and I come up with something better
you know like I want to be deepening the doing as well so I think if one relates to appreciating
the beauty of life adding to it deepening the capacity for both that's a nice framework to start
and then there was another resource but on there called Dharma inquiry which is more personal
because that's obviously true for everybody the Dharma inquiry it's more into specific
things one is bothered by and is inspired by and has aptitude at and is called to to have a sense of
what is your unique relationship to that is your own Dharma with it I realized that
there's something both very beautiful about the kind of bodhisattva direction and something
that is incomplete about a certain direction of it I was I was incredibly influenced by
the value of the bodhisattva and the may I become whatever is needed and
when you look around and try to perceive what is needed and try to develop within yourself
what can offer something there I remember the the first time I actually read it was in Alex Gray's
art book the sacred mirrors and he had the heavy look page for the painting and then he had this
poem next to it it's so beautiful and it said something like where there is
thirst may rain fall upon the people and may I myself become that rain or there is hunger may
I be transformed into the food but near them where there is illness may I become the medicine
you know wherever there is need of any kind may I become what is needed I think that helps one to
recognize that what they love is deeper to who they are than who they think they are
beautiful because I think I like these things and I don't like these things I'm good at these
things not these things but oh I can't help with that because I'm not a legal scholar or I'm not
a construction worker or I'm not a whatever it is and yeah it's like but if that's the thing
that is most needed and would help what you care about most can you can you become something that
you are not and I've had many times where there was something that I was not good at that I actually
really identified as a thing I would never want to be good at and realized that it actually
mattered what I cared about enough that if I held that limited identity I was not in maximum
service to what I claimed to care about and I had to get like well I I care about what I care about
so long as it fits with my identity easily or I've got to transcend the identity so that's
what I like about the vow of the bodhisattva but where it's missing something is
I really am not equally good at all the things that are needed nor can I do all of the things
even if I try there's a lot of people have to do all the things so if medicine work is needed and if
economics change is needed and if care of the individual people and animals is needed as well
as macro systemic thinking about systems to do that not only what is most needed but what is most
needed that my being is well developed to be able to be in service to is important and so the
Dharma questions are trying to help hone that for people. Beautiful and and you're pointing to
the kinds of questions we need to ask ourselves in order to in order to orient ourselves
to be most effective instruments of service or for the and in the bodhisattva aspiration for
the welfare and awakening of all and I really think that probably that bodhisattva aspiration
may be one of the highest ideals in mind as human mind has ever come up with and such a beautiful
thing and you're pointing now to the questions we ask which the first question that emerges is
well what what can I do but then you're pointing to the idea that there's a there are questions
deeper than that what's the most effective thing I can do and along with that the question or the
colon actually what am I called to do and deeper still in your implication is is a question how
can I live my life so as to be an optimal instrument of service and each of those is I think better
thought of as a as a colon or a wisdom question and I would draw the distinction saying a conceptual
question is you know is it raining outside take a look no end of question but wisdom questions are
more like columns every time you ask them they have the potential for taking you deeper into the
question deeper into life deeper into yourself and so you're pointing us towards the real the
wisdom questions of our time. I would also say that almost every value or principle
lives in a dialectical relationship with another value or principle that is complementary but
they might seem almost opposite and that without holding them together the full version of just
that one thing the reducto ad absurdum of it actually becomes evil and so this is the everything
can be a medicine or everything can be a poison topic so what is
what is my unique self calling what is that which I can offer the world based on the unique
set of experiences and capacities I have that no one else could offer that if I spend my life doing
things other than that that other people could do the most novel offering that I have doesn't occur
that's a deep and important and beautiful question but taken to its extreme it'll make
you a total shithead because fucking do the dishes when you need to do the dishes no it's not your
unique self the only thing that you can do like anybody can do the dishes or take out the trash
but like damn though a lot of life is just doing the dishes out of the trash and maybe the unique
self that you have is is unexpressible infinitesimal qualities with which you show up to those things
you know so the what is uniquely mine to do that no one else can do and what fucking needs done
that nobody wants to do I'll just show up to you got to hold those together right because also on
the other side if you always just say what is nobody what is the shittiest job that nobody
wants to do let me show up to that which is an incredibly ennobling question incredibly beautiful
question you can also end up uh failing at some unique self darmism capacities you could have
because of only orienting that way and so uh every every principle and every virtue needs held in a
dialectical relationship and not over normed as absolute yeah and this is the ancient concept
of the interdependence of virtues that that they require require each other and complement one
one another and I think you're also pointing to the contextual nature of our inquiries that we
have to keep the context as well so again beautiful beautiful reflections and deepening and expanding
uh that I see you're pointing us to yeah and I've I've just felt that we've been spending
I don't know extra amount of time in the heart of philosophy and I feel a connection with
fidgety triathlons and all of that stuff has started long ago in another land and it's still
it's still churning and a universe that can produce um a you and a me I can't be all bad
and I feel deeply moved and deeply uh renewed in my commitment to do my little things you know
whatever that calling might be and I think I pretty much found that but also to shampoo my dog
and take out the trash and you know wipe the counters and that sort of thing you know and
you say it can't be all bad it's funny because so I focus on the meta crisis which is like all the
most fucked up stuff that could be all together um it kind of seems like that but it's not really
what I focus on I mean it's in appreciation and love of this world and life there's the desire to
protect it and uh so paying attention to things that need protecting but where does the motivation
come from the motivation doesn't come things being fucked up the motivation comes from the
wonder of it right from the beauty of it like I've had I know you you both talk about bringing
the philosophic concepts into daily practice on this um show a lot and you know I've had a lot of
practices throughout my life in terms of types of meditation types of inquiry and whatever
but like I wake up in the morning and the first thing I do pretty much every morning is I just
look out the window at the trees and I just watch the trees move in the wind for a little bit
and I don't I don't have to try to care about them or try to find them beautiful they're just
fucking beautiful and there's a happiness that comes just watching that and then there's a
gratitude to be alive and consciousness you know arising again and there's a happiness to be on this
planet and then there is a because of the happiness it comes from just the perception of the beauty
of it I don't need that much for myself right there's not an unhappiness it needs me to do a
bunch of stuff and then there's this gratitude that I like I was sleeping this con this Daniel
consciousness wasn't here and then it boots again and now it's here and I think about when Daniel's
dead the consciousness that will be perceiving the world and falling in love for the first time and
climbing trees and reading hafez and rumi for the first time it's all the things and I can't
not feel connected to those consciousnesses a hundred and a thousand years from it like I can't
not feel what it feels like to perceive through those eyes and I'm actually not trying to get it
to go anywhere I just want that kids get to keep experiencing falling in love with trees for the
first time and mothers get to keep falling in love with their kids and people get to fall in love and do
poetry for the first time and get heartbroken and all the things the pot like it is intrinsically
already meaningful without going anywhere and it's already beautiful and you know one of the other
things I know you'll have talked about is peak experiences and one of the things I always felt is
once you have had one of them
like for me I remember I remember discreetly I've talked about before there was this one time I
was watching a sunset and writing poetry to nature and watching a sunset as a teenager
and I remember the sunset was just so incredibly beautiful and I remember thinking
if I had the choice if there is a spirit before this life if I had the choice to come here and
incarnate and go through whatever painful things that I've went through my whole life just to get
to have this one experience of color and vision and the wind and the insects in this moment would
totally do it like I would take every pain in my whole life to have had this experience as opposed to
no experience and then I'm like I've had that I've had so many of these experiences and one of
them is worth incarnating for I've had so many of them and so it's like the fact that I will probably
have more of them is gravy and it's like a ridiculous beauty and abundance but that every
that future life gets to keep having those and that other people get to have more of those is kind
of more what I'm motivated by and they make us better persons when we experience those things
that it shifts you know something happens maybe just a little bit but something happens in a
positive thing and shifts in our soul and our interiors and maybe we behave a little a little
better or a lot better I'm not sure I think the what's in it for me thing chills out
you know and it's not that it doesn't reboot because we're complex people with lots of parts
and there will be a pain body that reboots and so it's not like enlightenment is a static thing
and you have a satori and then you never have a pain body boot again it does but there's something
about even just thinking about it and just being like I there could have been no I no experience at
all and there's experience and there've been such amazing ones and
and and I feel this pretty much with every difficulty or trauma too is like when you've
done the healing work with it you don't still feel messed up by the trauma or the pain but you do feel
ongoingly benefited by the lessons and it's kind of like a lot of people don't have the
resources or know how to do the healing so they never get the lessons and they're just always
affected by the pain and that's a bummer but if one kind of has the resources knows how to work
on it then the pain is temporary and the gifts are lasting and it's like this just beneficial
asymmetry like this beautiful asymmetry where it's like yeah I just am a yes to the whole thing
let's say yes to the whole thing and there's there's a beautiful couple of lines that came out of
San Quentin prison uh there's a project uh grip guiding rage into pain which uh the people work
very intensely with with people many of them life as many of them have been murderers and
work on life transformation their ideals the body sight for aspiration the commitment is
even if I stay in my in the prison for the rest of my life I'm going to do what I can to help people
and one and one of them after after and there's a very intensive exploration of their pain and
the trauma they've both caused and received and these are very traumatized people and there's a
video of one of these sessions in which one of the one of the prisoners some suddenly lights out
lights up and says oh I get it hurt people hurt people and healed people heal people
it's like oh oh it's so beautiful yeah they're both self-propagating
yeah I would love to explore that with you Daniel uh we've gone long and far and deep or maybe that's
the wrong word uh to explore the the darkness and the addiction and the way out of that and just
what you said um Roger uh hurt people hurt people and heal people heal people and that's uh
maybe that's a good place to wrap it uh for this evening I really enjoyed the conversation with
both of you I think that the this podcast where you're exploring these topics and sharing it with
people is uh a really beautiful service and I'm honored to be here with you oh it's such a delight
Daniel and it's such a such a gift to be able to investigate at this depth and co-explore so
thank you so much for this gift to to everyone who listens to the podcast and thank you so much
for your life's work it's truly a gift crisis we get to share this with thousands and thousands
of god knows how many people that's tremendous that's just tremendous if there is a second time
we come back to and explore that hurt people hurt people that there is some
autopoetic trauma force almost and that there is also some kind of autopoetic healing or integrative
force but if you wanted to think of the light and dark sides of the force that's actually kind of a
good way of thinking of it is the autopropagation of those things um and we wanted to explore that
sometime maybe also if the listeners have thoughts or questions or topics coming from this that can
inform it we can get to those next time too right well we hereby extend an invitation to
listeners to let us know the questions you have for Daniel and uh I think you're implicitly
suggesting you're open to coming back and we of course would love that and I know how listeners
would too so that's beautiful and again in regards to your father and mom if they're still
on this plane and if not in regards to them anyway okay tell tell them they they deeply
touch one old guy in Louisiana made a difference for him I'll send this podcast to them when it
publishes Daniel thank you so much take care
