the little children you're like yes the things that don't have the prefrontal cortex yes the
prefrontal adult brain can cause problems but it also has unique evolutionary purposes we just
have to use it right um and two things there Daniel one one is the intention what's the intention
of using the intellect is it to get lost in the abstractions or is it in the service of the solution
and the other is the skill and capacity to integrate into a kind of vision logic say
I think those are both part of it I had a friend that I think you know Samantha Sweetwater
she hasn't been on this podcast she'd be great to be on she just left me a message this morning with
a thought she was saying the way she phrased it was that sapience is in service of sentience
if it is to be rightly guided oh I thought that was a nice way of phrasing it I um
in terms of the Greek the true the good and the beautiful triad I remember writing to an
artist friend of mine on her birthday once uh that the true and the good only matter because
the beautiful is um or no I think I said truth and goodness only matter because beauty is that
the beauty was actually the fundamental thing if reality did not have intrinsic beauty I wouldn't
actually care to be good to it or to know it or to whatever there's something that is intrinsic
that is deeper than the why Daniel I plenty yeah I have a follow-up question to all this
and I know they they threw it at Carl Young so uh I'm gonna throw it at you do you believe in God
I remember many many years ago and I wouldn't phrase it this way
any what more and there's maybe 15 years ago I wrote a poem called uh the atheist who writes love
poems to God and um it was saying do I believe in God not in any God that is believable meaning
that I don't remember where it went but the idea that what the word belief means is
the idea that a proposition about reality actually maps to reality and so belief is a
thing that can happen inside of propositional logic and propositions have to be formed in
semiotics right in in semantics and syntax do I believe that there is some sentences that I can
say that define what God is uh where I would say yes that is a description that I think is both
true and comprehensive and you know adequate and no I don't I think that's why the first verse of
the Tao Te Ching is the Tao that is speakable it's not the eternal Tao so if you believe in the Tao
you missed the whole fucking thing um if you you can have a outside of semiotics outside of
propositional experience outside of propositional knowledge experience of a kind of wordless knowing
in a connection to wholeness but you don't then try to reduce that to propositions about the world
so I think there's a lot of people that will have
real experiences that are numinous and transcendent and then try to make a belief based on that
and I think that's usually misguided so uh if I wanted to speak to beliefs do I think
that consciousness is an emergent property of brains probably not do I think that there
are things that don't have brains including other types of biology and whatever that might
have some quality or there is something that is like to be them probably yes but I'm holding all
this I say probably even though I think there's some pretty strong arguments uh because I I think
too much certainty about any of these things is really problematic um do I think that
it might not just be biology but that anything that self-organizes has some type of interiority
or self-ness in some kind of panpsychic type way yeah sure I do do I think that um
even though each cell in our brain or body is its own self-organizing thing they come together to
make something that is synergistically more than the sum of them taken separately yes do I think
that might be true for say universe as a whole or very large things within universe like galaxies
or whatever yeah I think that's interesting so do I think that um there are types of sentience
and types of intelligence that are more deep and vast by far than our imagination can think about
totally do I think that there is the possibility to in some meaningful ways
connect there and have results come from that connection yes do I think that there is an inherent
sacredness in all that is physically and metaphysically yes I wouldn't reduce all that to saying I
believe in God I rather think of it as something more respectful than the reduction to a proposition
I get that yeah um but but I was actually just talking with um a very close friend the other day
about an aspect of learning theory there are certain things
that when I learn them I have to work to implement them as effectively as I can because
I can't not I just I can't not and uh and there are many people who don't have that they um they
forget like they learn the thing and they forget and they're like oh yeah that was about I forgot
let me get back on path are they there's some different depth of the care about the thing
that is of course the result of all the exposure and whatever and I'm like yeah there is something
where it is like actually like the difference is actually believing there's a god right meaning
but it and that was the term that I used to just kind of make it simple in which if one actually
believes there's a god then they can go they can work to perfect themselves go to happily
die in a holy war whatever it is because there is some superordinate thing that is so fucking
important that everything else falls in line to that so there there is something for me and
belief in karma can do that right there is something that is like believing in a god
that is the coordinating basis of everything for me but it isn't believing in a god
and I can't do better with words no that yes I think that's a very sacred holy answer I think
you handled it really well and thank you for even even doing that means a lot yeah I'm beautiful that
certain that some of the some of the intimations in your response were
about to the uh unknowable mystery of reality bottomless fathomless inconceivable and to the
transconceptual nature of that mystery and actually of life that that the idea so the
doubt that can be named is not the eternal doubt and even more than that we can't any statement we
make is you know in fact it can be valuable but it's never fully adequate to the reality of anything
and to the extent that you think that you even unconsciously even fuzzily think of it as adequate
now it's actually harming you yes because now it deadens your perceptions now it creates
less you don't see the reality you see the frame of the reality that you expect to see it in and
you stop seeing where that model is inadequate which means you stop learning because you're
now filtering reality through that model because it's convenient so in that thing the dance of the
doubt and the 10 000 things there's one part where I say do atoms exist I'm like kind of kind of because
uh and I'm and I didn't play with it from the point of view of is there physicality at all or
is that all just an epiphenomenon of consciousness or is this a simulation I wasn't even playing
with it from that direction I was just saying do atoms exist well the periodic table works pretty
well we can actually uh do atomic level engineering and chemistry pretty well right this is it's about
as good a science as we've got there's a a lot of um good empirical things regarding atoms
but when I define an atom the formal definitions will like we can do it in terms of the Schrodinger
equation or information theory or particle physics or whatever but we'll say okay you've got nucleons
and you have electrons and you have orbitals and whatever um you can just say where in the
periodic table row and column it is and it's an ion or but does that atom exist without the strong
force does it exist without electromagnetism does it exist without the Higgs field does it exist
without the gauge bosons that mediate the connections the gluons and the Higgs boson it
doesn't exist without any of those things and yet none of them are included in the definition
when we say atom we take them all for granted so if I remove those that are not part of the
definition do atoms exist nope so if I want to define an atom adequately that it actually exists
can I do that nope and so I have to take for granted a trans finite amount of reality
to define this thing in a way that is useful but is it real kind of you've walked your way into
the buddhist shunyata and into the why buddhist wayan philosophy of the concealed and the revealed
that any perspective unveils or conceals a universe and simultaneously conceals another one
this is absolutely fascinating we could go anywhere with this but I want to I want to ask you
from this this perspective or these multiple perspectives you're bringing to bear
on your own your understanding of of everything what do you see as some of the deeper
unrecognized usually unacknowledged causes of the metacrisis and I'll just give a little context
and I think one of the beautiful things about the way the way you appreciate the metacons crisis
is you're very aware of the traps of reductionism or what I would call the single focus fallacy
which there are three a single issue fallacy the we're facing global warming that's it
a single cause fallacy it's all due to capitalism and the single solution fallacy so I love the way
you're thinking transcends those limitations and and recognize the traps of reductionism so
in asking you what you see as some of the deeper causes I certainly acknowledge that you don't
these aren't it but they are important elements and they're ones that don't often get don't as often
get spoken to yeah okay so the question as I understood is are are there
drivers or causes of the issues we face in the world and of the thing that
I sometimes call the metacrisis that we haven't defined here but I'm defining enough other places
of someone who is not already familiar they can check it out that are not the ones that we usually
talk about that are somehow deeper and I'm going to translate that to are there things in the inner
landscape of people's experience and psyche specifically just when we were saying are there
spiritual dimensions or interior dimensions the reason I want to make the distinction is because
I don't know that the term deeper makes sense just for quick point of reference I would not say
that I am a physicalist or an idealist in the classic philosophical sense of
physicalist meaning that physics comes first matter and force fields and third person stuff and
that consciousness emerges from that somewhere nor am I an idealist and that consciousness comes
first and all of the physics is an emergent property of consciousness structures of mind or
something I would say that the the subjective stuff and the objective stuff have you want to
think of that all the words have problems we can talk about first person third person we can talk
about the quality and the physics but that they are equally fundamental and co-informing
co-arising facets of an integrated reality and the relationship between them is part of that
fundamentality so I wouldn't say consciousness is deeper than physics to the nature of reality
I think that's a weird kind of dualism still I think information theory affecting physics has
already started to get a lot of people at least in this realm because if you say okay well consciousness
stuff is deeper than physics stuff and like well what is physics stuff well it's like atoms
atoms are subatomic particles and subatomic particles are some weird Heisenbergian Schrodinger
thing which seems a lot like some type of pattern of information that doesn't sound like physics
anymore right and it doesn't necessarily sound as different it's not like just some dead inert
matter it doesn't sound as different from the consciousness stuff especially as you start to
do a similar dive on what the consciousness stuff is because you say well is that information
processing on some information processing substrate what does that mean so in the same way
that I wouldn't say consciousness is deeper than physics or the other way around I wouldn't say that
the psychological drivers of the metacrisis are deeper than the technological or the economic ones
I would say that they are co-informing co-influencing and that to really address it there are necessary
things that have to happen across each of those areas and that sufficiency only happens across all
of them and I won't belabor the point because we've written and talked about it we wrote a
paper in the conciliance project called why technology is not values neutral
and it's worth people looking at and it shows just a brief overview of the work of
Marvin Harris and Marshall McLuhan and so many people in theory of technology of how
technologies change the nature of mind and psychology individually and collectively the
nature of culture in ways that are really subtle and not not obvious so I you know there's always
this question of there's the what technologies the world develops and what social systems it
develops are those the result of the consciousness and values of the people or the consciousness
and the values of the people who are born as babies being conditioned by the world that they're in
and the dominant systems and what things happen to be successful and if the worldview and the
technology creates don't win a war it just gets wiped out and so I'm framing it this way because
I think the deeper thing is actually really problematic it's you mentioned
um Roger the reductionism one type of reductionism is to say there's only one thing the other type
is say there's a handful of things but my favorite thing is the most important one um
and so being able to understand the co-arising and non-reduced process is actually really important
um if I can introduce if I can introduce the concept here Daniel I find I have a neologism
which is omnideterminism everything determines everything and I think that's what you're speaking
to yeah um yeah I might more usually talk about omni influence that everything is influenced
everything but not in a way that is absolutely deterministic because um nice refinement thank
you there are things that are outside of hard determinism still that influence the net result
of what happens also when we say omni we mean in the direction of all inclusive but we can never
actually know we're being all inclusive um so in fact we can know for sure that we aren't being
that's actually important um I can know for sure that I am not being all inclusive because
computationally it would be impossible um so the framing of the metacrisis we often talk about
involves like a frame I'll use often is um from Marvin Harris's work but to understand
its civilization you can think of it in terms of these three areas its infrastructure its
social structures and its superstructure its infrastructures all the technologies the whole
tech stack and all the modes of material development and like that the social structures are all the
collective agreement fields everything from the system of governance the law the institutions that
mediate it and the superstructure is the religion the cultural ideology the values the definition
of the good life so the the superstructure is kind of the spirituality psychology
interiority of the people at the collective level and so of course we're always talking about that
so I think seeing the top level frame of how all those fit together is worthwhile so if people
haven't um I'll just reference talked about in a bunch of places a good friend Nate Hagins who's
very good thinker on um specifically the relationship between the environment and energy and the
financial system he and I just did a five part series on his podcast and then the fourth part
we do a kind of an overview of the metacrisis that covers this the third part unintentionally
just because it came up we ended up covering how does one like emotionally psychologically and
spiritually deal with the reality of the metacrisis given that there's so much to care about beyond
what we feel like we have a sense of agency about those are ones that people might find
interesting the fifth one we talk about frameworks to think through solutions
competently so with all that prefacing I'll say some things here that I think maybe have not said
as much other places that are relevant to what in the interiority of human psyches and experiences
and cultures uh is a key or our key drivers of the problems of the world
I want to mention how many things there are that we probably have no fucking clue about
that are really critical just just to give a tiny couple examples
we know that there are a lot of species that have gone extinct at somewhere between 100 and
a thousand times the background rate of extinction since the industrial revolution as a result of
human activity those species are not just in the world externally there is a similar biodiversity
loss and species extinction in the microbiome of the human being and the microbiome of the human
being produces some of the necessary chemicals for us to work our genome doesn't actually produce
all the things some aspects of the macrophage binding protein and various things like that
are not adequately coated in the genome without a microbiome and and so extinction of some of
those is pretty humongous it's like deleting chunks of our genome right and but if you start
having ubiquitous antibiotics and chlorine in the water and pesticide exposure and all those types
of things so how much when you realize that somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of the
major mono and amine neurotransmitters like dopamine serotonin and gob are produced by the
microbiome in the gut and that how you think how you perceive what you believe how happy you are
what you your orientation towards violence will large to be or the result of that how much of
what seems like a spiritual crisis in the world is the result of the effects of the unintended
consequences of our kind of war on bacteria and biology and actually destroying part of the
code set that makes us able to be us that's not something that people often would think of when
they're thinking of the spiritual drivers of a thing but that is really important and if we
you know if we look at the Anthropocene at the human built world there are so many aspects of
the human built world that built a world we did not genetically evolve in we're not genetically
adapted to that makes us misfit to our own being in important ways um obviously for the
