 In this episode of Brain Inspired, Paul talks with Sam Gershman, a neuroscientist and computer scientist known for his work on brain-inspired algorithms and theories about the neocortex. They discuss the interdisciplinary nature of intelligence research and how various fields like physics, computer science, and neuroscience are deeply connected.

Sam advises students interested in these topics to be open-minded and not shy away from pursuing unpopular or controversial ideas, as true innovation often requires swimming against the current. He emphasizes the importance of a broad mind and exposure to diverse areas of knowledge to make significant contributions in the field of intelligence.

When asked about AI and understanding consciousness, Sam expresses skepticism about overrating consciousness and suggests that most of the computation we find intelligent is happening beneath the conscious surface. He also directs listeners to his lab's webpage for more information on his work.

Finally, Paul encourages listeners to support Brain Inspired through Patreon and invites them to get in touch if they have questions or want to engage further with the topics discussed on the show. The episode concludes with a reflection on the journey of discovery, inspired by a poem by Mary Oliver, and a reminder that the path to understanding is often covered in snow, requiring us to forge our own way forward.
