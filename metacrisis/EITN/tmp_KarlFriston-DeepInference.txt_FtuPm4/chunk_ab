optimizing expected free energies is basically securing the maximum expected value and information
gain as a function of your plan. And I've shown you what that looks like when you apply off-the-shelf
variational message passing based in schemes to geratin models and how to use a markup decision
process and taking you through the, well, although it is a lot like a simple model of a world
generating your data, and then just noting that the remarkable formal similarity between these
Bayesian belief updates under this imperative to maximize free energy and its expected value in
the future, the remarkable isomorphism between the kinds of equations that we use in computational
neuroscience in terms of perception and belief updating neural dynamics and learning the system
process to indeed action selection. I'm going to give you a little work example with a mouse
searching for a little red ball exploring initially and then being compelled to exploit
when it got bored because there's no more information gain and closed with a key link,
which I would have spent hours talking about relating this fundamental or first principle
account of good behavior to thermodynamics by integral fluctuation theorems and then I
have a closed by noting that evidence simply is simplicity plus accuracy. I then thank you,
thank all the people whose ideas I've been talking about and then thank you for your attention.
Thank you very much.
