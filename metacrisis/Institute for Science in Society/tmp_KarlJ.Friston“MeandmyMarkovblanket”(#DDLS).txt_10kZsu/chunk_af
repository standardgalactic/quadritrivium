environment that's what your underwrites your auto poesis and your self assembly and your existence
but it does depend upon having these deeply informed and veridical and realizable predictions
where the perceptual part comes in and these deep charity models um are requisite but at the end of
the day it's just in the service of controlling those sense the sensations um that you can control
right thanks all right any further questions or comments for Professor Friston
we still have some I have just a brief comment if I might okay go ahead uh I I was struck by
how uh your part of your argument not just the kind of ecological uh elements of it with
affordances and whatnot uh resembles uh Samuel Taylor Coleridge's uh idea the perception is
imagination and it's it's seemed like quite a beautiful uh confirmation of that after what
250 years ago it was so it seemed like uh it resembles it in some of his theories in some
interesting ways but then you should write that out for ticks or something then I didn't know that
I in many areas I'm um what Jerry Edelman used to call an intellectual thug so I wasn't aware
that that does sound very interesting um and certainly um resonates with this notion of the
brain as a um a fantastic organ you know so everything is a fantasy it's just those fantasies
that are sufficient explanations for the sensorium that are selected by this process of internal
Bayesian model hypothesis selection um you know so they're all um you know we we basically
waking perception is what people refer to as as sort of um dreaming or hallucinations that that is
entrained or constrained by sensory impressions that that starts to um have a bit more pragmatic
or practical uh traction when you start to uh simulate things like sleep and dreaming
where you do actually talk about sort of um training yourself in the service of a particular kind
of Bayesian model selection which is actually getting rid of um unneeded or redundant parameters
using fantasy data so you generate fantasy data from your geriatric model and then you try to perceive
it and learn from it um thereby acquiring a much simpler a much more efficient and simpler
explanation for it so fantasies and imagination um may play an vitally important role not just
during sleep but also just in terms of introspecting and thinking about things as the device that um
minimizes the complexity of our explanations for things that the road to those aha moments of
simple insight oh it's just one of those or these are the same thing so these do require if you're
like um an updating the structure of the underlying genetic models that one could easily motivate as
necessitating your imagination as you know as the accompanying um the accompanying process
that does that so if that's if that was known several centuries ago you should you should
tell people i'll i'll send you the reference all right um we still have some six minutes left or
maybe less for a quick question maybe
and if not
all right
right uh so yeah sorry may i ask may i ask a quick question still sorry so i was i was
previously here no because i'm just asking about this formalism because it's this longevity
interpretation of things and and and so like on the technical side like the interpretation of
noise or the randomness is a kind of particular one in this and so i guess like you typically
could be like a brown in motion based or or some kind of Gaussian so but but but you could think
of other ways of modeling the noise let's say a bounded noise or this kind of thing and then you
could perhaps like because i'm i'm looking actually at bifurcation theory in dynamical systems perturbed
with bounded noise and you tend to get a different kind of picture and maybe you can overcome some
difficulties that are associated with this let's say the the more prevalent this kind of Gaussian
interpretation so so so do you think that a different kind of formalism could could or
different kind of formalism for the noise in particular could still accommodate this theory
but that would be the question it's a very technical it is i shall give you um as technical
an answer as i can um just to just to frighten off the rest of the audience so they go and
have a cup of coffee in the cigarette so the um so first of all i you know i think that um the
you know the analysis of dynamical systems in terms of bifurcations and the like and and
all the different ways that you can engineer and understand itinerancy is vitally important in this
game because all of the interesting simulations and realizations of behavior under this formalism
at some point rest upon bifurcations or you know deterministic chaos that then becomes
equipped with noise in some instances to give you stochastic chaos simple examples will include
that lotterra heterotonic cycle under right set pattern generators without which you would never
get movement you could never simulate movement so i think i think there's your the the dynamical
systems understanding of the functional forms of internal states and external states as they try
to mirror and predict each other is vitally important for this itinerancy that we'll talk
about before that my eyes between the the frozen crystal and the exploded gas um so the
slightly more technical question is you know you're right with normally treatments of uh
launch van equation um immediately um employ markov norvina assumptions and you can get very
quickly and gracefully to sort of simple focacoplank equations and the alternative formulation in
terms of pathological formulations um however they are not limited to that um the maths gets a
little bit more complicated certainly you know the focacoplank formalism when you want to um
when you want to write down the ensemble of the density dynamics of systems that have
non markovian random fluctuations not impossible but you know it just gets a little bit more difficult
to follow through uh follow through the maths um the way that it's handled um in sort of vanilla
treatments of the um of the particular physics under rights of free energy principle is to use
an adiabatic approximation just say that basically there are states where where do states come from
well we'll assume that states are basically the states of markov blankets and that once we've
done that we can hierarchically compose uh um markov blankets and markov blankets and then
we have an emergence of states but states come into flavors they come in terms of states of the
system and the random fluctuations so what licenses mean to even before I write down
a long drug formalism what what licenses need to actually just write down the difference between
x and omega and then what we normally say is well we'll just assume that these things are really fast
and these things are really slow right but when we generate using um technically a renormalization
group theoretic approach when we generate states from states what we do is sort of just split the
fast stuff and give that to the the fast stuff goes to the fluctuations and the slow stuff goes to
the states and then we get a dimension reduction or course grading for free and then we can sort of
compose states of states of states in that setting um the the random fluctuations actually lose
strictly speaking a markovian or venalite behavior on two counts first of all um they um can potentially
be non-gaussian they can be heavy-tailed because they are now non-linear mixtures of states that
inherit from the from the scale below and second and possibly more interesting from the point of
view of coping with the foc-a-plank part of the story that they have serial correlations so they
become analytic so then they don't have that venal conditional independence property anymore
so that's another interesting richness that you bring to the table when you actually look at real
random fluctuations um at the moment we tend just to ignore that in mathematical treatments
but that but certainly the latter kind of serial correlations becomes absolutely essential
when dealing with predictive coding on the fly when simulating eye tracking for example
you know you really you know the markovian assumptions are just not fit for purpose we use
generalized quads and motion to articulate the the dynamics of the the state the rate of change
the rate of change up to about six orders that usually and then you can recover a venal assumption
in this generalized generalized state space the heavy-tailed stuff um yeah i don't know about
in terms of random fluctuations but i do know in nearly every generative model of interest
for example things like independent component analysis you know you really do rely upon these
non-linear or heavy-tailed assumptions to get interesting stuff out okay all right and this
is exactly the this is exactly on time so it's time to stop and let's all together thank professor
fristen for his wonderful talk and i'd like to thank you all for your very insightful questions
i'd like to say that i'm really pleased that we end this year's run of the lecture series
with such a bang and next year next talk in the series is on 7th of january at 6 p.m. central
european time but that's 6 p.m. Amsterdam berlin paris and our guest speaker will be
professor patricia churchland and i'm also very excited about that and i hope i'll see
many of you that other than that i wish you happy holidays happy new year and so that next year
with the vaccines underway we actually managed to see each other in person so happy holidays
ciao ciao bye bye
