okay so the first question was from Elke Spak he says or she says in this simulation
was the boundary between the internal and external states constructed manually in quotation marks
or did it self-emerge?
So in the simulations of the primordial soup it was an emergent property
so just practically speaking only certain systems actually attain non-equilibrium
steady state so when you write down these equations of motion three things happen either they completely
explode and never converge like a dissipating gas a hot explosion or they
freeze and become a very crystalline uninteresting structure so what we do is we just adjust either
the amplitude of the random fluctuations or the parameters of deterministic chaos that is used
to underwrite this sort of electrochemical dynamics of each of these little particles or
macromolecules to get it into a Goldilocks regime where you have interesting non-equilibrium steady
state when you when you do that when there is a system that has attained some kind of non-equilibrium
then for free you will get a little universe of Markov blankets so it's a great question because
well the answer is no your Markov blankets emerge in the right kinds of systems and usually those
kinds of systems are those that describe the worlds and the eco niches in which we survive by
definition um however that doesn't mean to say there's just one Markov blanket so what we did was
pick the most connected eight macromolecules and just having to define those are the internal
states of interest then you can go in and ask what is their Markov blanket that will always exist
sometimes in certain situations it will be a trivial or an empty set but mathematically it
always exists good good um all right uh so the next question is for us and Hank already
answered but just repeat for everybody else yes this these recordings will be available on our
web page and we will communicate when they're online through the mailing lists and channels
through which you heard about this talk in the first place all right so Juan Felipe Miranda Medina
asks what is the difference between perceptions and sensations sorry the question is still on entry
oh it's not at all I would imagine that there are books written in philosophy about that difference
from my point of view and it's very simple a sensation is just the state of your sensory organs
or the sensory part of your Markov blanket so it's just the the activity or the state of your
um sensory receptors say filter receptors or chemo receptors so the things that you used
to sample the environment the the perception brings a little bit more to the table so
if you look at the process of perception as a process of inference that is one interpretation
of this fundamental gradient flow on the internal states then it's much more of an internal
constructive dynamic process where you are understanding say neuronal dynamics as encoding
or parameterizing beliefs about the causes of the pattern of sensory input so the the perception here
would be if you like associated with the state of your brain or your internal brain state say
in a visual portable hierarchy um you know the the way that you would mathematically talk about
the perception part of it um sorry let me say so if you're a physiologist um and I said um then
then you would be happy looking for the neuronal correlates of perception deep inside some hierarchy
deep inside the brain um that was representing some abstract feature or level or attribute
of some hypothetical object that was the best explanation for your sensory input
if you were a statistician you would be asking um does the state of the brain or neuronal populations
in uh how can you understand that in terms of an information geometry the information of
representation um and so technically um if you and by definition this is the case
associate the state of the brain at any one moment with a probability distribution over
something else and this is the external states then technically what you what you induce is a
statistical manifold over which internal brain states move and that movement has a particular
geometry called an information geometry which allows you to write down things like precision
and confidence and distance and metrics um in terms of things like the curvature of that of
that statistical manifold that's technically very interesting certainly in terms of building
synthetic machines that do perception efficiently um and understanding the key role of confidence
and how it relates to uh curvature and precision and neurochemistry um I was just wondering from
a philosophical perspective it also I think brings something very important to the table that you've
got a mathematical description of physiological brain states that now requires an information
geometry that is only articulated in terms of beliefs about something so it has a um you know
in a layman's sense a representational aspect which you didn't have before if you just look at
correlations between neural activity so that's another important distinction between sort of
perception and sensations you know the mechanics and the interpretation of perceptual dynamics
become much much more interesting vexed and important good good thanks very much uh so the
next in line is uh walker trimble so go ahead unmute yourself and ask your question all right
thank you let me try and unmute my I can't unmute my camera here I'm sorry uh so can this
be used to explain much larger causal relationships that are much more complex
such as the um the relationships that we see between um irregular verb forms in across language
paradigms and individual learning patterns in language so where you can see you have something
that we where we've got patterns that emerge within an individual such as in language learning
and then on a vast scale such as irregular verb forms within the language within a language or
let's say population distributions like that famous paper about the the number of the relationship
between links and uh and and snowshoe hairs where you've got you know vast scales where we can't
really establish very clear causal relationships between these rare things where there are huge
numbers of variables a lot of noise uh can this help us to understand these kind of vast causal
can establish a causality between what would certainly hope for hope so I mean that that's
quite a challenging question so you'll know I mean all I was talking about in in this particular
presentation um was a very sort of particle-centric perspective an explanation of the implicit
self-evidencing and and Bayesian mechanics what you'll bring to the table now is well let's put
lots of particles together and we and um furthermore introducing the notion of um particles of
particles where the Markov blanket is now not at the states of any given particle but actually
a set of particles and so on in any sort of hierarchical nested way to any scale that you
might want to consider so in terms of you know can you scale it up to talk about ensemble dynamics
where you know where you've got a collection or ensemble of sentient particles or in the
surface of trying to minimize their own expected free energy and by implication because free energy
is an extensive quantity collectively doing the same thing what you now have is a mathematical model
of coordination communication cooperation that should in principle conform to exactly the same
mass and I think I think it's an important observation that is being pursued hasn't been
pursued enormously um over you know sorry let me put it off another way it's something of current
interest that is being vigorously pursued by a number of usually young people um in a variety
field sometimes known as um eco niche construction um in terms of theoretical biology um sometimes
taken into the um the cultural domain so when you know one might look at some aspects of language
acquisition in terms of cultural eco niche construction the special twist here is that you
sort of treat the environment and the person as two Markov blankets that are both trying to infer
the other so the environment is just an active player trying to learn about the denizens um
or the phenotypes that that particular eco niche contains and some lovely arguments about desire
paths and elephant paths emerge from that perspective as the environment starts to infer what kind of
agents or phenotypes uh are most suited or most likely to be found in that environment
whilst at the same time the phenotype is trying to learn about the environment and how it works
so there's this sort of collective convergence of a joint minimization of free energy there
but then you get things get even more interesting when you replace the environment with another person
so now you've got two um Markov blankets trying to predict each other and of course the best way
to maximize the mutual predictability to minimize the free energy or the self-information
is to both use the same generative model so the more that you um become like me the more
that I can use my predictions about myself to predict you and vice versa we become mutually
predictable and of course what are we saying we're saying basically our exchange
via our Markov blankets is a form of language and then we get into the game of you know how does
how does that those shared narratives or generative models elaborate themselves with more and more
particles or people in the game um and then you start to think about very deep generative models
sort that you might see in um and computational um language you know hierarchical Dirichlet models
for example and then we get to the very highest level questions which you are intimating
you know the exceptions and the shared exceptions and how they you know are found in and only in
one ensemble that has its own community Markov blanket from another ensemble so a lot of these
things a lot of things I've just mentioned have been written about uh within one or two papers
but my my my my my feeling is that they will um there's a lot of work to be done in these areas
um and the formalism afforded by the sort of um variational um uh account or formalization is
writing down this belief updating this coupling between um um Markov blankets
can take you quite a long way because you can start to simulate these things you can
have to start to simulate conversations and generalize synchronization and exchange of language
or songs um in a computer just to provide a proof of principle you're on the right track
I I have a follow-up is how in that case do you
oh sorry I'm sorry only if it's quick because we have
we have time late okay if it's quick okay it's quick uh how do you determine that the the agents
the individual agents then well if you're um sorry I might rather give a quick answer there
isn't a quick answer uh first of all there are agents at every scale so I think you just have to
determine the scale of you know the explanatory target of your particular study so I could identify
a single uh brain cell or its dendrites as the agent to Markov blanket I could look at a hierarchal
level in the visual hierarchy at a different person I could look at um you know sort of swarm
dynamics and ensemble behaviors of populations I could even look at the you know the biosphere
within each level there will be Markov blankets and Markov blankets all the way down to you know
to small particles so I think you just have to commit to a particular scale and once you've
done that you know the sort of granularity of the generating models in play so if you're into
language then you know that you're going to need quite a deep hierarchal generating model
probably a derisional like processor um uh hit the Markov model if you're interested in bird song
for example you can get away with say um continuous attractor dynamics you know we've used two a slow
and a fast the rents attractor to simulate the exchange of bird song the recognition of bird
song amongst agents so I think it's more a question of just you know what are you interested in
expanding or understanding or perhaps building you know if you're if you're in the artificial
general intelligence and machine learning world thank you all right uh so the next question is from
uh March in C go ahead oh okay sorry so uh he asks he says thank you for a great lecture
and uh I have a question does minimizing free energy guarantee that agents behavior
will be optimal in brackets intelligent or do you need additional constraints
so I'm just trying to find that oh I've got it right so we'll be um no um oh sorry um yeah
the the answer depends um really um on what you would take as a sufficient description of
intelligent behavior it will always be optimal in a rather deflationary sense because the whole
the whole notion of ideal basing observation observers and basing optimality um is sort of um
you're being used here um in the sense that the the basing interpretation of a variational free
energy is just um under um the constraints of approximate basing inference the optimal way
to do things in in fact um it's the only way to do things um but it does beg the good so that's it's
always optimal um but that's deflation the sense it can be no other once you've got some form of
non-equilibrium study state that is optimality defined in the sense you exist um I think the
more interesting question here is um what different kinds of geranium models would look more or less
intelligent um and I guess I was trying to speak to that by comparing contrasting the two simulations
of a very simple agent just using reflexes that was just realizing its internal beliefs about
what was going on by just waving its hand around and and writing with no real sense of the future
as opposed to this um much more sophisticated agent where she was actually thinking about the
consequences of action and planning ahead and going to responding to epistemic
affordances that she had computed in order to resolve uncertainty about what she would see next
I would say that's closer to intelligent optimality but in many senses a virus and a
thermostat are entirely optimal that is not very intelligent so if the question was about
intelligence I think you're talking about the different kinds of geranium models that will be
apt for describing um the world that you inhabit and if you inhabit a world that is also composed of
deep and sophisticated agents like you as we do then of course your geranium model is going to have
to have both a hierarchical depth and what Anil Seth sometimes calls the counterfactual depth
which implies a roll out into the future in order to um model the consequences of of my actions
so I think the intelligence bit probably lies in the structure in the form of the genitin model and
its depth all right thanks uh so the next question is from Zef Fassen he says uh thank you very much
for this talk and for your wonderful insights in general as you say this is the first principled
account of the brain uh how far do these implications reach for example Lisa Feldman Barrett has
created a new theory of emotion based on predictive coding in brackets in short
emotions are predictions close brackets uh do you know her theory and what is your opinion about
this way of using predictive coding in uh other in brackets less uh beta scientific disciplines
all right I'm tempted to ask what a less beta scientific discipline is um but yes and I do
know uh I haven't met Lisa but I do know we have corresponded on email and I know her work
and um I think that it certainly is entirely consistent with the first principle sort of
physicist account that we've been talking about but um is cast in the language of predictive coding
I think quite useful because predictive coding is one of a number of process theories to which
the free energy principle can apply so I'm using principle theory in a very specific way here so
the free energy principle is essentially a variational principle of stationary action like
Hamilton's principle least action it can be applied or it cannot be applied to certain processes
generally I would submit it can be applied to every process that exists but that's not
necessary for it to be a principle but the processes um acquire a theoretical theoretical
aspect so it could be that you could apply the free energy principle to understand
brain processing as belief updating under a whole raft of process theories and they could
include predictive processing they could include belief propagation they could include variational
message passing all of these are well characterized crisp and clearly formulated mathematical
message passing schemes and dynamics under different sorts of gelative models each time somebody
comes along with a new way well perhaps the message passing is like this um that's a new
process theory so predictive process predictive coding I think is the probably the most celebrated
and predominant at the moment what makes Lisa's approach special um it's the same thing that
makes the work of people like Anil Seth and lots of his colleagues at Sussex University
and beyond special it's a it's a focus on accounting for embodied interceptive states
so we were very much talking about predictive um processing active inference and active vision
where we're predicting um the visual consequences of moving um if you now take exactly the same
principles and apply them to our internal bodily states your autonomic sensations
then you can play exactly the same game and now um you have a way of writing down
literally feelings about the embodied self as this perceptual process but it requires some
special attributes first of all it's certainly your body and may underwrite a minimal sense of
selfhood and then you ask them why would you want that and then you get into uh notions of
which we haven't talked about which is um what are the homologues of attention and bias and
sensory attenuation under predictive coding and where the the predictions of um whether to attend
or dis attend or attenuate information from this domain or that domain come from a map come from
a gelative model and then suddenly you have a hierarchical model that's making predictions
not only about the state of the body but about which state the body should attend to um and at
that point you start to um get into the world where it would have the right kind of expressivity
to talk about um gut feelings and emotionality in the sense that there are certain bodily states
that I can explain by attributing them uh constructs or hypotheses such as arousal or fear
