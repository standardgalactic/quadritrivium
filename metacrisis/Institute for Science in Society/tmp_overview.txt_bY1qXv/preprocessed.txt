1. The discussion moved from a technical question about treatments of the van't Hoff equation to a deeper exploration of the math behind the Fokker-Planck equation and its alternatives, particularly in the context of non-Markovian systems with random fluctuations.
   
2. In standard treatments, the Markov assumption simplifies the math and leads to simpler equations like the Fokker-Plank equation. However, real systems can be more complex, involving non-Markovian behaviors and heavy-tailed distributions.

3. To handle these complexities, one might use an adiabatic approximation, assuming that states can be hierarchically composed, with fast fluctuations treated separately from slow state dynamics. This approach can lead to dimension reduction or coarse-graining.

4. In a more sophisticated treatment using renormalization group theory, the fast fluctuations are separated and treated as random fluctuations, which may no longer be Markovian due to their non-linear nature and potential serial correlations. These fluctuations can also exhibit heavy-tails and analyticity, which are crucial for predictive coding and simulations like eye tracking.

5. In generative models of interest (e.g., independent component analysis), non-linear or heavy-tailed assumptions are necessary to produce interesting results.

6. The lecture series has concluded with a "bang," featuring a thought-provoking talk by Professor Friston, and the next talk is scheduled for January 7th, 2021, with Professor Patricia Churchland as the guest speaker.

7. The organizers expressed hope that with vaccines underway, they would be able to see everyone in person next year and wished everyone happy holidays and a happy new year.
