as a whole there's a synergy of those cells coming together that creates emergent properties at the
level of you as a whole thing but if i run all the combinatorial possibilities of a way of putting
those 50 to 100 trillion cells together very few of them produce the synergy of you there's most
of them are just piles of goo yeah right and so it's a it's a very narrow set of things that
actually has the very high synergies and it's lots of things that are pretty entropic um and
entropy is also obviously easier i can i can take this house down in five minutes with a record ball
but it took a year to build yep and i can kill an adult in a second but it takes 20 years to grow
so this is why the first ethic of Hippocrates and of so many ethic systems is first do no harm
then try to make shit better but first do no harm if you if you can succeed at the maintenance
function then you can actually maintain your progress functions um and
and
and connect to where you were going with that well so here's here's what i'm after i agree
with your basic entropic analysis that it is easier to destroy than to build the number of
states that work is vastly exceeded by the organization of the same pieces that don't
but what i'm wondering about is is there
in effect one has to be able to build a system that is resistant to that in other words and
life does this right living creatures manage to fend off entropy beautifully and the fact we need a
governmental structure that has that same trick and we haven't seen it yet
and the question is unfortunately i fear
that it is almost a prerequisite that if you build the the capable structure and you haven't
built the thing that protects it first then it will be captured before the wisdom develops
to preserve it against that force and now i remember why i used the analogy of the body
what i'm going to say here is wrong so let's just take it as a loose metaphor
let's take in the body that the closest thing to top down organization is neuroendocrine system
but there's a bunch of bottom up that is at the level of genetics and
and epigenetics and cellular dynamics and whatever and that there is a relationship
between the bottom up and top dynamics well obviously i can take a cell out of a body and
put it in addition it has its own internal um homeodynamic processes it's dealing with entropy
on its own that they don't need a top down neuroendocrine signal for how they do that so let's say we
tried to make a perfect top down neuroendocrine system and the cells had no cellular immune
systems or redox signaling uh homeodynamics or or anything else you would die so quickly right
there is no way to have a healthy body at the level of the organization of all the cells if the
cells are all unhealthy and that's the comprehensive education of the individual thing we're talking
about can you make a healthy system of government as a system can you just get the cybernetics right
with that is separate than that which develops all of the individuals and the
relationships between them and the answer is definitely not okay agreed but then here's the
problem that i'm i'm trying to articulate okay so we agree that the cells have to be coherent
in and of themselves that there has to be a fractal aspect to this uh this uh organization of
things across many scales from the individual up to the the body politic but if it is true that the
key to making that work is that individuals which are analogous to cells here have to be educated in
the nature of governance the theory of governance in order for this to work how would they end up
that way well they would end up that way because governance will have created the conditions that
would cause that education so are we not now saying that what is necessary in order for the
system to function is that the system is already functional in order that it can generate the
conditions necessary no there's no hole in the bucket situation there is a recursive situation
between bottom-up and top-down dynamics um and so let's take the classic dialectic that relates
to right and left it's not the only one of individual and collective for a moment and
say okay fundamentally the right is more libertarian individual pull yourself up by
your bootstraps we want to have advantage conferred to those that are actually doing uh
they're conferring their own advantage uh and doing well and then the left model the more socialist
model is yeah but people who are born into wealthy areas statistically do better than
people who are born into shitty areas in terms of crime and education and access to early health
care and nutrition and all those things and you can't libertarianly pull yourself up by your
bootstraps as a infant or a fetus and so let's make a system that tends to that well
but then the right would say but we don't want something like a welfare state that makes shitty
people that just meets their needs for them and orients them to lay on the couch all day and
do tv and crack okay i think it's i think it's mind-bogglingly silly that we take these as if they are in
a fundamental theory of trade-offs as opposed to a recursive relationship that can be on a
virtuous cycle what we want to optimize for is the virtuous cycle between the individuals and the
society so that do we want to create social systems that take care of individuals but make
shittier people no do we want to create social systems that condition people that have more
effectiveness and sovereignty and autonomy yes and do we want to condition ones that in turn
add to the quality of society yes so if we don't want to make dumb social systems right
so a social system that is more welfare-like is much dumber than a social system that provides
much better health care and education and orientation towards opportunity for advancement
rather than towards opportunity towards addiction cul-de-sacs and so we already have some people
all the listeners of your show i think we already have some people who are trying to educate themselves
independent of not having a government that is doing that that and this is why i say it has to
start at culture before state or market it has to boot in that direction so those people can
start to work together to say how do we influence the state and two start to then influence better
education for more people better media and news for more people and how do we influence it to
affect market dynamics where the market dynamics are more bound to the society well-being as a
whole rather than extractive oh i like this because we actually do see this dynamic we see people
actually seeking out nuance even though we're told that they won't do it and so the other thing
we're seeing is for various reasons including covid the absurdity of the educational system that we
have is being revealed in a way that it never has been before so many more people are recognizing
that school will flat out waste your time if you give it that opportunity and therefore
they have more license than ever to seek out uh high quality insight and uh exercises or whatever
and to discount the value that we are assured comes along with a standard degree uh et cetera
so yeah i'm i'm favorable to this idea go ahead there's also that you said that's interesting
okay so george washington's quote comprehensive education of every citizen science of government
well how can we afford that when most of them are going to be laborers because them having a
strong background in in history and in political science and social science and the infrastructural
text act does that help them be better farmers not really it helps them be better citizens
and government but not better farmers and so ken how do we afford to pay for all that additional
education and how do they maintain that knowledge when they're just engaged in a labor type dynamic
and so this is why the children of the elite who are actually going to become lobbyists and senators
and whatever go to that private school and get that education well now we have this ai and robotic
technological unemployment issue coming up and it's definitely coming up right well the things
that it will be obsolete first are the things that take the least unique human capabilities
because those are the easiest to automate so labor type things so either this is an apocalypse that
just increases wealth inequality and everybody's homeless and fucked or on the absolute minimum
amount of basic income so the elites can keep running the robots as serfs rather than the
people as serfs and just hook the people up to oculus with a basic income so they don't get in the
way or this actually makes possible a much higher education of everyone so they can be engaged in
higher level types of activities um yeah yeah i agree with that completely and i also agree you
know we should make sure people understand i mean i think it was very clear the way you said it but
we are headed for a circumstance in which a shift in the way the market functions and what
it requires is going to cause an awful lot of people to be surplus to it all at the same time
and that can only play out in a few ways none of them are good if we don't see it coming and plan
for it um it's coming it's not the fault of the people who will be obsoleted um and so
in any case yes uh this makes sense you were mentioned you look at COVID and you look at
how many small businesses shut down and how much unemployment happened and then how much the market
rallied because six companies made all of the money of the market and if you take those companies
out the entire stock market is down but it's cap weighted and you basically have network dynamics
Metcalf law dynamics creating winner take all economies where you have one winner per vertical
the wealth consolidation the wealth inequality has progressed so rapidly that all the that the
measurements of GDP and market success and the measurements of quality of life are totally
decoupled they're moving in opposite directions in really important ways when you combine how
intense that is and that of course the forces with the most money are the hardest to regulate
because they have the best lawyers the ability for offshore accounts and for lobbying and whatever
else so how do you do anything about this combined with the fact that the debt to GDP ratio is unfixable
you realize that a reset of our systems will happen because this system cannot continue
and we can either do a proactive one or we get the reactive one and the reactive one of course
the reactive one is going to inherently be arbitrary and therefore much more violent
in every sense of that term and so yes you are programming some kind of a
unfortunately none of the terms that one would like are still available to us because great reset
has obviously been branded in in somebody's interest but yes we need some sort of a reboot
that takes heed of this dynamic and sets us on a path where it doesn't turn into a catastrophe
or it doesn't turn into a spectacular win at everybody else's expense for some party or other
and unfortunately of course if we circle back to an early part of this discussion
convincing people of the hazard of this the essentially the certainty that something of
this sort will happen if we do nothing that we must do something that that something must be
coordinated that you can't pass it through your inherited lens of is this left leaning is this
right leaning is this for my team is this against my team convincing people of that is
extremely difficult in this environment because for one thing everything we would do to convince
passes through these these platforms that if they haven't flexed their muscle yet as soon as we start
talking about what would need to be done to save civilization in ways that they can recognize it
they will find ways to oppose it and you've had this conversation on here before that
let's say we can we look at a particular group and we can predict how they're going to respond
to something we're going to say with quite high accuracy so we can take a particular woke SJW
group and if we have a conversation of a certain type we can predict that they'll say oh that thing
you're calling dialectic is giving platform to racists when you should be canceling them therefore
you're you know racist by association or whatever you can take a QAnon group and predict that they
are going to say that because we talked to someone that was four steps away from Epstein in a network
that we are probably part of a deep state cabal pedophiles or whatever it is and
to the degree that people have responses that can be predicted better than a GPT-3 algorithm
they can't really be considered a general intelligence they are just an emetic propagator
they are taking in memes rejecting the ones that don't fit with the meme complex taking in the ones
that do fit and then propagating them and I think people should I think if people think about that
they should feel badly about not being someone who's actually thinking on their own and being a
highly predictable memetic propagator and be like I would like to have thoughts that are not
more predictable than a GPT-3 algorithm I would like to know what my own thoughts about this are
and in order to know what my own thoughts about it are do I can I even understand and inhabit
how other people think all the things that they think that so that's that's one thing because
it's not only going through the filters like Facebook it's going through the filters of the
fact that people have these memetic complexes that keep them from thinking and so the cultural value
of trying to understand other people so that we can compromise because politics is a way to
sublimate warfare right and if you don't understand each other and compromise you get war and the
people who are saying yes let's bring on the war they're just fucking dumb they just don't understand
what war is actually like they haven't been in it right well I think you have brought us to the
perfect last topic here now of course I'd like this conversation to go on and we should pick
it up at another date but the point you make about if we can demonstrate that we know what
you're going to say then it isn't a thought worthy of a human right if we can predict you and it's
not by virtue of us having modeled some beautiful thought process of yours it's because your thought
process looks like that of you know an indefinitely large number of other people who are totally
predictable and that's nothing you should be comfortable with I think we this goes back to
the question I asked you at first which is when you engage in what I would call independent first
principles thinking you immediately run into challenges that somebody who's not deeply involved
in such a thing doesn't intuit right and so I'm imagining a person somebody who is decent who has
compassion has all of the basic capacities you would hope they would have who has fallen into
one of these automatic thought patterns and I'm imagining you manage to sit down with them and
show them that their thought pattern is automatic and totally predictable and therefore nothing that
they should be comfortable with and let's say that they walk out of the room and they start
behaving differently and they start thinking for themselves they stay awake right well they're
going to run into some stuff because they are of course going to end up landing on some formulations
that as soon as they say them out loud are going to get them punished right that is inevitable
now those of us who live out here learn how to say things in ways that sometimes the punishments
don't stick we learn where they are best stated we learn what we shouldn't say yet but all of this
speaks to what I think is it's not we don't live in an authoritarian
state but we live in a state in which thought is policed as if we did right not perfectly
but enough that one who wishes to escape from the accepted the sanitized narrative
has to be ready for what happens next and that's something that is it's very hard to
generate that in other words it's a developmental process that causes you to learn how to navigate
that space so somebody who just simply recognizes I don't want to be an automaton and I'm going to
start thinking for myself if their next move is to start thinking for themselves and speaking
openly about it what comes back next is something for which we don't have a good response
earlier you said when you were defining near the beginning of our conversation what you
meant by independent thinker as someone who wants to go wherever the facts and information that are
well verifiable actually leave them I would say that there there's something like the spirit of
science which is a reverence and respect for reality where I want to know what is real and
be with what's real more than I want to hold a particular belief no matter how cherished or
whatever in group it I'm a part of in the the uncomfort of not belonging with the in group
if I want to belong with anything I actually want to have a belonging with reality first
and a belonging with my own integrity and then with those who also share that
and the other belongings that I give up I don't stop caring about those people I care about them
still but I don't necessarily care about their opinion of me enough that I'm willing to distort
my own relationship with reality all right so here's the question I want to ask about this
and I'm basically trying to surface some part of my own process in order to figure out what it is
can it be improved can I teach it to others to the extent that it works
there are so I was on Bill Maher with Heather last Friday and I said something that got an
awful lot of pushback online which I knew was coming I said he asked if I thought the probability
that COVID-19 was the result of a lab leak was at least 50% and I said something quite honest and
shouldn't have been new to anybody who'd been paying attention to my channel which was that I
had said back in June that I thought the chances were at least 90% now I can imagine that that
number would be shocking to many people but I also know that were I in their shoes I would process
it this way I would say all right this person seems intelligent I don't know of a conflict of
interest that number is way off of what I would calculate therefore I need to file this as a flag
do I not know something maybe the person has a conflict of interest and that explains it but
if it's not that how have they arrived at a number that is so far off of what I would calculate and
