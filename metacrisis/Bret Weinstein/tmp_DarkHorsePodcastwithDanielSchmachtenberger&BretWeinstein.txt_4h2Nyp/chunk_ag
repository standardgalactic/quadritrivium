of that thing was able to be used for the power purposes of the time and so now when you start
to have increasing polarization between the left and the right and historically more academics being
left leaning and the social scientists the social sciences being so complex that you can cherry pick
whatever the fuck you want and do methodologically sound and yet still misrepresentative stuff
then you say is that actually a trustworthy source and then we say okay well do we want
a bunch of wacky theories going out over Facebook and Twitter and whatever do we want to censor it
well if we censor it who is the arbiter of truth that we trust if we don't censor it we're appealing
to the worst aspects of everyone and making them all worse in all directions like those both suck
so bad and that's the oppression or chaos right and the only answer out of the oppression or chaos
is the comprehensive education of everyone in the capacity to understand at least three things
they have to increase their first person second person and third person epistemics
their third person epistemics is the easiest philosophy of science formal logic their ability
to actually make sense of base reality through appropriate methodology and find appropriate
confidence margin second person is my ability to make sense of your perspective can I steal man
where you're coming from can I inhabit your position well and if I'm not oriented to do that
then I'm not going to find the synthesis of a dialectic I'm going to be arguing for one side
of partiality harming something that will actually harm the thing I care about in the long run
and then first person can I notice my own biases and my own susceptibilities and my own
group identity issues and whatever well enough that those aren't the things that run me
when I look at kind of the ancient greek enlightenment the first person was the stoic
tradition the second person was the Socratic tradition the third person was the Aristotelian
tradition there's a mirror of all those in modernity we need a new cultural enlightenment now that
where everyone values good sense making about themselves about others about base reality
and good quality dialogue with other people that are also sense making to emerge to a collective
consciousness and collective intelligence it is more than our individual intelligence
and with so that we have some basis of something that isn't chaos but that also isn't depression
because it's emergent more than imposed so it's like it's cultural enlightenment or bust as far as
I'm concerned all right so I don't disagree with you fundamentally I believe this is a place where
when I say my version of this which is much less sophisticated in some ways and focused
elsewhere but when I say my version of it I lose people because my version of it is something like
what we need to do is doable we can see the trajectory from here you can't see the objective
but you can see the direction to head and it will take three generations to get there right
I agree what you're describing you couldn't just simply take that curriculum and infuse it into any
system we've got and have any hope of people learning it or giving a shit about it or whatever
it wouldn't work so you have to build the scaffolding that would allow a population to be
enlightened in this way such that the governance structure you're imagining might arise out of it
could flourish but let's put it this way it's at least at least three generations out before you
had gotten there even if you started doing things right now and so what I try to say to people
in order that they don't completely lose interest in the possibility of a solution because it's too
far out is things can start getting better right away we are not going to live to be in that world
that is the objective and even if we did we would never be native there right our developmental
trajectory will have been completed in a world that doesn't function like that and so
you know you you can be happy as an expat but we would be expats in the world we're trying
to create and that's fine you know if our grandchildren or our great grandchildren
were native there and we could be expats there that that would be a perfectly acceptable solution
but I think in general people have the sense that a solution sounds like something that we
could have in the next few years and I just don't see the possibility of it no you're going to see
things anything that can be implemented quickly you want a red team and say either how does it
fail or where does it externalize harm and also what arms race does it drive if whoever doesn't
like it and if you factor what arms race it drives where it externalizes harm and where it fails
you'll get much less optimistic about most of those things and if you don't go into despair
you'll start thinking long term um and things that converge in long term direction and when
you start to think about that the thesis and the antithesis are both not true they have partial
truth but they are not actually true synthesis is in the direction of more integration of truth
and still not true but in the direction of if I optimize for one of these
it will externalize harm in a way that messes the whole thing up right um and that's why there's
there's a forcing function of the failure modes on both sides that's why it's important to look at
oppression and chaos and say these both create failure modes so what is it that doesn't orient
in either those directions it's not more power to authorities it's not more pure libertarianism
it's something that's outside of that access or it is going to involve the equivalent of negative
feedback right in other words right thermostat works by virtue of not embracing it being hot
or cold but by pushing it in the right direction as it diverts one way or the other so I very much
like your point about synthesis here um just to make it clearer synthesis is two things even
linguistically speaking we can talk of a synthesis right which is an object you could write it in a
book a synthesis between several different concepts could exist in a book um incidentally that's sort
of what I see myself doing in biology is synthesis um but your point is the most important aspect
of synthesis is it is a process or right and so that process is the thing that takes these
competing failure modes and rescues from them something that suffers neither consequence and
heads towards optimality so I agree we have to get good at it yeah so synthesis is an ongoing
process and let's say I have some bits of true information in a thesis and some bits in the
antithesis so the synthesis will have more bits than either of them higher order complexity but
it will still have radically less bits of information than all of reality about that thing the model
is never the thing right it's just it's the best epistemically we can do at that moment
so now I want to go back to the earlier topic around theory of tradeoffs that you said because
I let it go but as soon as you mentioned optimization I have to bring it back because it
comes back exactly here and it also brings back this question you had of that markets can do a
good job with the what with the how but not the what which is the is-ought distinction that comes
up in science right yes it is science can do a good job of what is but not what ought which
means applied science i.e technology i.e markets can do a good job with make with changing is
but not in the direction of ought and so that is ethics which is to be the basis of jurisprudence
and law that's exactly why you bring those things together the and it's because is is measurable
third person measurable and verifiable repeatable it's objective it's objective right whereas
ought is not measurable in a you can do something like Sam Harris does in moral landscape and say
it relates to measurable things but it doesn't relate to a finite number of measurable things
there's a girdle proof that whatever finite number there are some other things that we
end up finding later that are also relevant to the thing that weren't part of the model
that we were looking at and so the thing that is worth optimizing for when you talked about
that the blue and the fast would be part of the same thing the thing that is worth optimizing
for is not measurable it includes measurables but it is not limited to a finite set of measurables
that you can run optimization theory and have an ai optimize everything for us yeah i agree you will
have a long list of characteristics that you can measure and as you go from the most important to
the least important you'll eventually drop below some threshold of noise where you're not noticing
things that contribute so yes you've got a potentially infinite set of things that matter
less and less and you will inherently concentrate on the biggest most important contributors up top
and that's natural it's a it's an issue of precision at some level but one that we we
shouldn't convince ourselves that we're solving the puzzle completely at a mathematical level
an engineering solution is not a complete mathematical solution right okay so now i'm
come back to the waxing mystical thing and it's i don't think it has to be thought of that way
i don't i think the way einstein was doing it and he says spinoza's god is my god i'm happy
to do it that way so the first verse of the day is the dow that is speakable is not the eternal
dow right the optimization function that is optimizable with a narrow ai is not the thing
to optimize for is a is a corollary statement and the and the jewish commandment about no
false idols is that the model of reality is never reality so take the model as this is useful it's
not an absolute truth the moment i take it as it's an absolute truth and i become some weird
fundamentalist who stops learning who stops being open to new input and in optimizing the model
where the model is different than reality i can harm reality and then defend the model so i always
want to hold the model with this is the best we currently have and in the future we'll see that
it's wrong and we want to see that it's wrong we don't want to defend it against its own evolution
and so what we're optimizing for can't be fully explicated and that's what wisdom is
wisdom is the difference between the optimization function and the right choice
oh i love this this is uh this is great obviously it it dovetails with uh the basic sense of what
metaphorical truth is and the recognition that actually metaphorical truth isn't something that
applies to religious style beliefs it's actually the way we do science also you know we have
approximations and you know things get ugly when people forget that that's what they're dealing
with right and they start really treating it as the object itself uh very important example in my
field is the instantiation of the term fitness right which in most cases has so much to do with
reproductive success that we actually just synonymize them most of the time and we speak
as if they're interchangeable which is great except for all those cases where they go in opposite
directions which we are perennially confused by and so anyway uh sooner or later i will
deliver some work that will take the cases that we can't sort out because we've missed
defined fitness and forgotten that it was a model in the first place and shows how you
would solve it differently if you defined fitness in a in a tighter way but uh story for another day
all right so where shall we go you uh you were on a roll
so
so you'll see conversations from really smart people like nick bostrom and max tagmark and whatever of
because of the collective action problem and the multipolar trap race to the bottom
and yet because of the complexity of the issues that we face that are beyond what the smartest
person could manage by a lot is the only answer to build a benevolent ai overlord that uh can run
a one-world government because it can process the information to make good choices so as you
can guess my answer is vigorously no yeah not just because i think the optimization function
that it would run no matter how many variables would end up becoming a paperclip maximizer but
uh i think its own existential risks are bound up in that process these guys know know this um
but it's easy to pick solutions like that compared to the other ones that seem maybe even more likely
to go terrible so then we say okay we don't want a one-world government run by any of the people
we currently have and we also don't want separate nations where any of them that defect lead everybody
into a race to the bottom so that means that they have to have rule of law over each other because
they affect common spaces so how do you have rule of law over each other without it being one-world
government and then capture oppression or chaos at various scales and the only answer is the
comprehensive education and enlightenment of the people that can check those systems now
obviously the founding of this country was fraught with all the problems that we know of
now in particular and it was still a step forward in terms of a movement towards the
possibility of some freedoms from the feudalism it came from and so uh i i find the study of the
foundation of it the theoretical foundation of it meaningful to what we're doing right now
and famously there's this quote from george washington where he says something to the effect of
i'm going to paraphrase it the comprehensive education of every single citizen in the science
of government should be the main aim of the federal government and i think it is fascinating so
science of government was his term of art and science of government meant everything that you
would need to have a government of formed by the people which is the history the social philosophy
the the game theory and political science and economics as well as the science to understand
the infrastructural tech stack and whatever right the hegelian dialectic the enlightenment ideas of
the time but that the number one goal of the federal government is not rule of law and it's
not currency creation and it's not protection of its borders because if it's any of those things
it will become an impressive tyranny soon it has to be the comprehensive education of the people
if it is to be a government of formed by the people now this is the interesting thing now
i remember where i wanted to go comprehensive education of the people is a force is something
that makes more symmetry possible symmetry of power possible it's a increasing people's information
access and processing is a um symmetry increasing function so everyone who has a vested interest
in increasing asymmetries has an interest in decreasing people's comprehensive education
in the science of government and so now let's look at the education changes that happen following
world war two in the us there is a theory there's a there's a story that i buy that the us started
focusing on stem education science technology engineering math super heavily partly because
it was an existential risk because look what happened with the stem that the Germans did and
now we know that a lot of the German scientists that we didn't get an operation paperclip the
Russians got and split neck and so it's an existential risk to not dominate the tech space so we need
to really double down on stem and we need all the smartest guys we need to find every von Neumann
and Turing and Feynman there is all the smarter you are the more we want to push you into stem
so you can be an effective part of the system that's part of the story but also the thing that
washington said the education in the science of government we start cutting civics radically
and i think it was because social philosophers at the time like marks were actually problematic
to the dominant system and i'm not saying that marks got the right ideas i'm saying the idea of
okay we have a system where let's have the only people who really think about social philosophy
be the children of elites who go to private schools who learn the classics and otherwise
let's have people not fuck the system up as a whole but be very useful to the system by
becoming good at stem i think this is a way of being able to simultaneously advance education
and retard the kind of education that would be necessary to have a self-governing system
that's fascinating that's fascinating because of course if you uh have the elites effectively
in charge of governance they can do exactly what you would imagine the elites would hope for
which is to govern well enough that the system continues on no matter what but to continue
to look out for the distribution of wealth and power and make sure nothing upends it right
they'll do it they won't even realize necessarily that that's what they're doing i also love the
fact you know george washington is one of these characters who it's very easy to misunderstand
how good he was because you know he wasn't the most articulate founder or in you know classical
terms the the smartest founder by far on the other hand an awful lot of wisdom buried in in george
washington and uh this idea of you know ultimately he was looking very deeply into the future
potentially to understand why the education of the populace would be effectively synonymous
with the job of government and it's not because the purpose is the education but it's because
that's the only hope that a democratic system will spit out the kind of uh solution that you
want it to generate um which is uh i don't know it's a very it's a very interesting analysis
so it raises something else here which is on my list of notes arising
which is i i notice this pattern all over the place there's a state which is awesome very
powerful in terms of what it can do but it's fragile and so it falls apart right in other
words we will never have a better system as far as i can tell than science for figuring out what's
true and what is possible so it's the most capable state there are measures by which it is the
strongest state but it is also terrifically susceptible to market forces in fact it can't
be in the same room with them right so um we could look for many examples of this where something
marvelous requires a very careful arrangement of conditions in order for it to survive and i'm
wondering what you make of that in light of this discussion i guess it's not hard to make an argument
for why that those two things go together capacity and fragility but what are we to do about it going
forward because surely we're trying to build these states but do so in a robust form they go together
because of synergy which is you have properties that none of your cells on their own have you
