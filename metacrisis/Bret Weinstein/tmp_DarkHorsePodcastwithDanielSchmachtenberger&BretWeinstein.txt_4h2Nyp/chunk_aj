resource would ultimately be destroyed by the nations that didn't participate in that system
and the nation that was most responsible would pay the cost of building a reversibility system
that wouldn't work in the end but other than that I think the principle makes sense what do you think
there's something like sustainability having a consideration like reversibility as one of the
factors to inform choice making and that that is a is a valuable consideration and that it
doesn't matter at all if we don't have collective coordination capacity to be able to make the
right choices period so yes agreed now regarding reversibility I think reversibility is a valuable
consideration that is impossible and important ways but it's still an important consideration so
can I decrease the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere if we realize we need to kind of yes but the
CO2 in the atmosphere went up along with a lot of mountaintop removal mining for coal
and a lot of species extinction in the process a lot of people who died over wars for oil can I
reverse and get those dead people back and those extinct species back and those pristine ecosystems
back no they're gone and then also reversibility over what time frame will new old growth forests
come back thousands of years from now sure does that time scale matter if I ever extinct a species
is that reversible does every species matter what about killing an individual element within it you
know so it's like I can only think about reversibility on very narrowly defined metrics but the thing
that harms that one metric has lots of other effects simultaneously and so we have to understand
the reversibility by its by itself is an oversimplification because we'll always be thinking
upon metrics that are subsets of all that's affected yep I agree it is a it is a oversimplification
as is sustainability but my sense is that you have to instantiate it in some way in order for the
system to be safe and I would say if it prevents you from removing mountaintops as long as it
prevents everybody else from removing mountaintops it's the right idea in other words if we are allowed
to degrade the earth a little bit at a time by removing mountaintops now and you know drying
up rivers next time then eventually you have a world that isn't very worth living in and I do
believe that we have a moral obligation not to degrade the planet right that that our highest
moral obligation has to be to deliver the capacity to live a complete fulfilling human life to as many
people as we can and that means not um liquidating the planet it means a renewal process which is
the very definition of sustainability and it's inconsistent with um removing mountaintops now
lots of species don't matter right there are lots of little offshoots of species
and they can go extinct and they do go extinct and nobody is harmed by their doing so which
it's not the same thing as losing orcas or you know elephants or eagles or whatever so
obviously you need to have a a rational threshold in which you protect against
against degradation and allowed degradation that doesn't have an important implication
but the question is really is it so compromised by those considerations that it's not worth
considering or is it rescuable if one figures out how to apply a threshold
so we said that one of the dialectics that defines the left and right and its most abstract form
generally has to do with a focus on the individual versus a focus on society or the collective or
the tribe or some kind of group another one is an orientation towards conservation or
conservativeness traditionalness with an orientation on the other side towards
progress or progressiveness and again these are confused all over the place and even what we
call left and right have shifted in the last you know a few decades in a number of ways but
it's interesting here because when you talk about reversibility and sustainability another
synonym is conservation what is it that we want to be able to conserve and so the conservative
principle is focused on what has made it through evolution that is valuable enough that we should
conserve it and not fuck it up and yet so interestingly the people who are often called
conservatives are not focused on critical aspects of conservation but if you you're talking about
biosphere conservation right now oftentimes they're talking about sociosphere conservation the
conservation of social systems and you're saying that underneath it is the capacity for humans to
thrive and have meaningful lives and relationships and we would say that that is a function of the
biosphere the sociosphere and the technosphere and the relationship between them and so and we
can say very clearly it's the technosphere ruining the biosphere most of the time and yet if it ruins
the biosphere enough the technosphere goes because the technosphere depends upon the biosphere so we
have to learn how do we make a technological built environment that is replenishing regenerative with
the biosphere and the sociosphere is another really critical one and I think you'll probably
actually have something to add to this that I haven't thought of when I think of what the
fundamental intuition of a conservative is even if they don't articulate it like this
and the traditionalist kind of impulse which is let's go back to the constitution let's go back to
Christianity or European ideas or the free market or whatever it is or rigorous monogamy whatever
social structure lasted for a long time that there there's an intuition even if they don't
formally think of it this way logically that almost everything didn't make it through evolution in
terms of social systems and the few things that did weren't the things that people thought would so
there's a lot of embedded wisdom that wasn't understood it was very hard earned and we want to
preserve that and not break it because we think we understand it well enough and we might not
and that fundamentally the progressive intuition is that we're dealing with fundamentally novel
situations that evolution didn't already figure out and we need innovation and of course the
synthesis of that dialectic is we need new innovation that is commensurate with that which
should be conserved and not everything should be conserved because some things made it through
because they won short-term battles while fucking up the long-term hole and so what things are worth
being conserved what things are not worth being conserved did we understand it well enough that
we didn't say this isn't worth being conserved out of hubris and then what progress is commensurate
with that i think is a good way of thinking about that dialectic yeah i like it and i think there's
the flip side of it as well which is that captured inside the biblical traditions are some bits of
so basically responses to game theoretic hazards that are consistent with things we've talked about
so for example the christian sense that not only is the world here for humans to make use of but
that we are in effect obligated to do it that belief fits perfectly in a world where if your
population doesn't capture a resource somebody else is going to so in other words that belief
structure travels along with a tendency to capture the resources that are available and to the extent
that what that does is it causes the exploitation of a resource the tools with which those resources
could have been exploited in biblical times almost always left a system that would return
itself to equilibrium given an opportunity which isn't true in the modern circumstance so what we
have is a place where there's lots of stuff that is conservative that there's a very good and often
hidden reason that we should preserve and then there are some places where we'd actually have
to upgrade the wisdom because it doesn't fit modern circumstances and the conservation of
the natural world is i think a clear case
just because you mentioned this case when when people realize that christian
spread largely by holy war not exclusively but largely
you need a religion that makes a lot of people that are willing to die in holy war because of a
good afterlife and who you can spare right a lot large population of people that can die in war
and islam and christianity both had this they both had be fruitful and multiply and proselytize
because they both had war as a strategy for propagation of the memes so you needed numbers
whereas judaism didn't have it right and quakerism and some other ones didn't judaism had to actually
make it hard for people to join the religion because you're not going to lose a lot of people
as soldiers you're going to embed yourself as a diaspora within dominant cultures and end up
affecting the apparatus of those cultures so it's interesting to think about how those different
meme plexus had different evolutionary adaptations but it's important for the reason you mentioned
is that those traditions were influenced by politics and economics and war and philosophy
and culture and a lot of things so you can't wholesale throw them out or keep them or like
you have to actually understand what allowed those memes to propagate and what their memetic
propagation dynamics were and so that conservative impulse it says the things that made it through
made it through for a reason yes but some of the things that made it through for a reason won't
keep making it through dinosaurs were around for a long time and then they weren't right so and as
we've mentioned evolution can be blind and run very effectively into cul-de-sacs and yet the other
side is all too often we will criticize a tradition for being dumb when we don't understand what made
it work well enough and we throw something out that was actually worth not throwing out
so how do you do it deep enough historical understanding to be able to decide what should
be conserved and not is is also a really good question it's a really important question because
it's it's chesterton's fence factory effectively right nobody knows what what actually was functional
and what you know had no function but traveled along with it because they were paired very closely
in a biblical text and you know what functioned in ways that we don't want it to function now
these things are all invisible because the whole thing is encoded in myth so it's not in there
right so yeah that's a huge hazard and it's a tough one for those of us who want to build
reasonably and recognize that there's an awful lot that we have to do that's novel because it
hasn't been accomplished before we have to grapple with the fact that it's not like these traditions
are simply backward some of them are very insightful and non-literal and
we need to exercise great caution in approaching them okay so I want to come back to your three
generations least problem it's easy to look at the nature of the problems and just assume that we
are fucked and usually to tie that to the some conversation about human nature
and to say okay well we were able to figure out technology that was extraordinarily powerful to
speak mythopoetically the power of gods the the nuke was clearly the power of gods right and then
lots of texts since then we can genetically engineer new species gain a function whatever
it without the love and wisdom of gods that goes in a self-terminate direction
is it within the capacity of our nature to move towards the love and wisdom of gods to bind that
power or are we inexorably inadequate vessels for the amount of power we have so then I do a positive
deviant analysis to look at what are the best stories of human nature to see if they converge in
the right direction and then also where there are conditioning factors that we take for granted
because they become ubiquitous and think that their nature so if we if we go back to the bible
for a moment we look at jews and we look at was there a population of people that were able to
educate all of their people at a higher level than most other people around them for a pretty long
time in lots of different circumstances yes you look at the buddhists where there are population
of people that across millennia and different environments were able to make everybody peaceful
enough to not hurt bugs yes across all the genetic variants and across all of the economic
factors and the whatever else do we have examples a very high level of cognitive development and
very high level of ethical development of different populations based on cultures we do
and then we say oh well but you know look at how well the founding fathers ideas failed here
well the the comprehensive education of everyone is not in the interests of the elite that have
the most power as we mentioned and so making it seem like that that's an impossible thing is actually
really good to support the idea that there should be some kind of nobility or aristocracy or something
like that there should be elite to control because they're more qualified i would say that we have
not in modern times ever tried to educate our population in a way that could lead to self
governance because there is no incentive to do so or those who had the most capacity had
incentive to do something else even when they said they were doing that so do i think that it's
possible do i think that we have examples historically of people who developed themselves
cognitively and ethically enough that if we did those together right buddhist jews um have we
want to talk about it do i think that's possible within human nature and basically untried
yes yeah i love that and i agree with you it's dependent on something which we might as well
spell out here which is that the capacities the difference in capacity between human populations
is overwhelmingly if not entirely at the software level which i firmly believe i'm speaking as a
biologist i've looked at this i will have to defend it at length elsewhere but the degree to which
its software that distinguishes us and therefore we can innovate tools we can democratize tools all
of that is at our disposal and i agree with you it hasn't been tried and uh it might be our only
hope but at least we've got prototypes now i was saying why i'm grateful for what happened to never
agree is that you wouldn't be here doing this otherwise and on bill mar and your you and hether
are both exceptional educators and so the fact that your tiny little niche for education got blown
up so that you took this quality of education to all the people who were interested uh this larger
scale i'm really happy about because i my friend this exact thing is the thing that has a chance is
a strange attractor of those who are called to a cultural enlightenment starting to be come to a
come together in a way that can then lead them to coordinate to build systems that can then propagate
those possibilities for other people well i really appreciate that and i uh i must say i feel it as a
calling as i'm certain you do and so uh yes and i also love the point that you made earlier about
the fact that the audience for this really is people uh seeking a kind of uh enlightenment
and community and so yes um as much as you and i both focus on uh existential risks there is hope
in that yeah okay daniel well this is uh i think we've gone more than three hours it's certainly
been a great conversation and there are so many threads that are worth revisiting which we should
do sooner rather than later this was super fun i really enjoyed it yeah it was um so daniel schmocktenburger
where can people find you well you mentioned in the beginning we have something called the
consolence project that'll be launching soon via a newsletter in march and then a website in a few
months um so tune back in on that and it's a it is a project in the space a non-profit project
that is seeking to do a better job of news with education built in so we actually make the epistemics
we look at very complex issues that are polarized and we make the epistemics that we're applying
explicit so we're actually teaching people how do you sense make complex situations in situ
and then if anyone ever thinks we missed any of the data about something wrong they can let us know
and we'll publicly correct it and credit them if that's right and etc so um and the goal there is
helping to catalyze cultural enlightenment of this type and recognizing that both education
and fourth estate are requisite structures for open society and open society being rebooted
has to be rebooted at the cultural level first um right now uh you can find me on facebook
or one of those platforms or uh have a blog an old blog everything's out of date on it
civilizationemerging.com civilizationemerging.com and uh are you not on twitter and does that
explain how you're so clear-headed? I'm not on twitter um and I'm on facebook because it uh
because of matcalflaw because everyone is so it ends up being a useful introduction and messaging
tool but yeah I am I'm not part of the twitter crew. More power too yeah all right Daniel this has
been a pleasure and uh I look forward to our next one uh be well and uh everybody else thanks for
tuning in thanks
