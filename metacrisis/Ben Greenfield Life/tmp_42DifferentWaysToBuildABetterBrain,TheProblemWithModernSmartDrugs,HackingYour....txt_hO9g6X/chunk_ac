to three days or you know like you talked about transcranial uh direct stimulation that the the
tdcs which is often done with a headband I actually I've been trialing uh a device called the the
neuroscience made by a company called Halo and it's a pretty intense form of magnetic stimulation
that that massively ramps up the activity in the motor cortex and so it will for example decrease
your sensitivity to discomfort during exercise when you use it prior to an exercise session or
increase your ability to be able to rip more weight off the floor during a deadlift but you also
you're you're supposed to take a good eight to ten hours between any type of sessions or something
like that just because it's such an intense you know ride so to speak for your brain so yeah some
of this stuff is interesting you just have to use it responsibly right
I want to interrupt this podcast to tell you about a few people that you need to follow on
instagram so that I've got I've got a few ladies that you should follow on instagram
whether you're a lady who wants to be inspired or whether you're a dude who wants to see ladies
doing awesome things so here they are jot these down or write them down um or go to the website
that i'm gonna tell you about in a second and there'll be links to each of these girls molly
eledge she is an amazing beautiful specimen of a crossfit athlete who has some really
inspirational posts on instagram and then there's this girl called the calisthenics queen jessica
russian r3d bogdanov bogdanov check her out she has some amazing twirling that she does all over
the place like a parkour athlete on steroids check out kate min wagon that's m in w e g and she's an
aerialist she's also freaking amazing and and her instagram page is off the hook and then finally
there's this girl that is an adventurer who does like a bunch of free diving and deep water and
she's really cool too her name is ashley barrett so all of these athletes are athletes who represent
kamara coffee and kamara coffee is used by so many these crazy people like ufc fighters and
mma artists and and me and professional racing pilots and biohackers and all sorts of people
around the globe including like adventurers who are doing amazing things and they use this stuff
because it's like coffee on steroids without actual illegal performance enhancing drugs in it
so this coffee has alpha gbc torene elthianine d mea you're listening to a spot or a podcast on
on smart drugs uh and new tropics so why not get some in your coffee in the morning so check
him out kamara coffee and here's the deal when you go to kamara coffee k i m e r a k o f f e e dot
com you use code men to get 10 off any of their coffees or any of their cool things that you
can put into coffee and if you score to the bottom of the page when you go to kamara coffee dot com
all four of those chicks that you can follow on instagram along with frankly all of their athletes
on instagram and some of them are pretty pretty cool pretty fun to watch instagram's a great way
to waste time and see cool things and be inspired of course so check them out kamara coffee dot com
this podcast is also brought to you by something i introduced you to last week that i use whenever
i'm traveling when i want to reset my circadian biology so here's the deal every single cell
in your body synchronizes its activity with the sun but it can be hard to get full daylight into
your life meaning that when you're indoors you have shift work or long distance travel like on an
airplane reduced date light time is basically going to restrict your circadian biology from
being normal and a lot of people like will do blue light box therapy which basically means you sit
in front of a bright light lamp for about 30 minutes to two hours every day but these researchers
in finland found that your ears the inside of your ears have photoreceptor proteins in them
and you can target them by shining a bright light into the ear so they developed this device called
the human charger they call it the human charger sun in your pocket it allows you to do things
like fight the winter blues and increase mental alertness and reduce the effects of jet lag and
improve mood but you do it just by sticking this thing in your ear for 12 minutes a day it's just
like headphones these little earbuds fit snugly into your ears and then UV free blue enriched
white light just flows out of the things for 12 minutes then automatically turns off after it's
reset your brain basically it's really cool so here's the deal you can you can check this out
at humancharger.com slash ben and they've got a code a 20 discount code for everybody it's a
little bit complex the code but it's ben g 30 hc as in ben greenfield 30 human charger ben g 30 hc
and you get 20% off i love cool things that you can stick into your body that make your life better
go where you want with that and this definitely falls into that category so check them out human
charger.com slash ben use code ben g 30 hc well when you mention something that increases free
radicals anything that is pro oxidative is going to increase free radicals and so there's you know
a classic kind of relationship between oxidative and antioxidant therapies because you want a lot
of oxidation of glucose within the cell and you know in the particular areas appropriate to increase
ATP and cellular energy and you want to not be oxidizing cell walls and you know other other
structures so are people wanting to increase oxidative bandwidth or increase antioxidant
bandwidth then it's both right it's a very dynamic homeostatic relationship between
both of those and in different areas and different tissues and almost everything works like that
whether we're talking about ph whether we're talking about redox interactions we're not
trying to just move the needle in one direction we're trying to increase system resilience in
both directions simultaneously yeah yeah it's it's it's cool stuff though a total rabbit hole
compared to what i actually wanted to talk to you about today which is neutropic compounds
because i know that's kind of like your your area of expertise and and like i mentioned like i have
i have a bunch of the actual brain nutrients that you helped design circulating in my body
right now i woke up this morning and um and i have these two bottles one called step one
and one it's called step two this stuff is called qualia uh q q u a l i a qualia um
and i was first introduced to this stuff uh and and i might ask your permission for this first
daniel is it completely uh completely off limits for me to mention the god pill the black label
version of this stuff uh obviously it's not completely off limits because it just happened
okay um all right so the god pill is as you were calling it not your name not ours is basically
stuff that we work within the uh research lab but is not available for sale because we haven't gone
through all of the fda and testing we need to for that but is on our product roadmap yeah i kind of
did stuff backwards meaning that i had no clue what neurohacker collective and who you were uh i had
no clue about this qualia stuff that i'll i'll get into in a second but someone at a random
health and fitness conference that shall remain unnamed uh handed me this pill uh and it was in
the in the on the morning of a particularly difficult and rigorous day on which i was to speak
i was to do a whole bunch of of signings and talks i was to be be attending a late night party
that evening and he handed me this pill and he said i want you to try this and i said what is it
he said it was the it's the god pill um there's a little black package and i open it up and i'm
like well you know i'm one of those guys who uh if it's if it's relatively natural i'll try it and
i took a quick glance at the ingredient list which was an extremely comprehensive list of mostly
stuff i was relatively familiar with but i'd not actually taken all at the same time you know all
these different neutropic compounds so i took it and um and i did literally feel like not trying to
be blasphemous um god the rest of the day i mean everything was was firing on all cylinders
verbal fluency memory recall um uh the the ability to form relationships and connections with and
understand and be empathetic to people all sorts of of super interesting effects even like you
know reduced procrastination and reduced anxiety you know unfortunately this this effect stayed
with me until about four a.m. in the morning um which i was like i want to quit writing articles
and go to sleep at some point but uh you know very very similar to almost like modafinil without
actually uh you know kicking my liver into the ditch as modafinil can do and so that was my
introduction and later on i discovered that uh there there is actually uh perhaps a slightly less
less intensive version of this stuff called uh called qualia and so and that that was what i
took this morning for example i want one in the one uh bottle that you take in the morning on an
empty stomach and another bottle that you take uh with with breakfast or with food in your gut
and so um that is what i want to delve into into this qualia stuff so in terms of qualia first of
all why do you call this specific new tropic blend that you make qualia yeah it was a fun process
when it comes to naming uh qualia is actually a term coming out of philosophy of mind which
means the quality of what it is like to be you so your subjective experience is the physical
universe is made up of particles and force fields the subjective universe is made up of qualia
thoughts emotions sensations and so rather than just enhancing memory or digit span or
arithmetic processing capabilities uh we were alluding to the idea of optimizing one's experience
of existing subjective experience of existing so if someone happens to know philosophy of mind
then they're like oh cool they use the philosophy of mind term and if someone doesn't it's just a
cool sounding word that sounds kind of like quality okay got it makes sense all right so you've got
one two three four five six i believe seven different kind of like categories of
new tropic stimulants in in the ingredients of this formulation and that kind of returns to
i guess what you're talking about before how you don't want to just focus on one specific area of
brain enhancement you want to somehow get all the parts to to interact and so um if i could i'd like
to ask you about the difference between some of these things because i think some people may not
understand what all needs to be in a complete brain compound so first of all you know one of
the first categories that you have in here are new tropic compounds what exactly is a new tropic
compound yeah loosely the term is generally used to mean some chemical that can enhance some aspect
of cognitive function beyond someone's traditional baseline without meaningful side effects so it's
in contra distinction to smart drugs which would enhance some aspect of cognitive function but
might have some side effects or brain nutrients which aren't going to enhance brain function
beyond baseline they're going to make sure that you don't drop below baseline or if you already are
helped bring it back up but they're part of the kind of normal process and so of course we're
interested in and neurohacking involves all of those categories but that's a general way to think
about what a no tropic is and that term arose from the scientists that developed paracetam which was
the first racetam and kind of the beginning of the major family of chemicals and then there are other
families of chemicals ampikines and other things that are part of what we usually think of we think
of net tropics okay so so a new tropic in general isn't something like you know vitamin b to replace
some things that you're burning through and you're thinking or or like you know choline or
something like that but these are actual chemicals that would do things like assist with cell membrane
formation in the brain or cerebral perfusion or neuroendocrine regulation or something like that
something like that okay got it now one of the things if i want i want to target in a few kind
of kind of interesting nutrients that i wasn't really familiar with in your compound and and one
of the things that you have as part of the the neurotropic blend in here is called hordinin
hcl am i pronouncing that correctly yes hordinin okay what what exactly is hordinin so hordinin
is interesting it is a barley grass extract so it is actually not synthesized it is an extracted
compound and it is a fairly selective mao b inhibitor and so you've probably used or at least heard
of a saligoline deprenel which is a fairly selective chemical mao b inhibitor that is a
many people have associated with life extension as well as probably one of the the best
no tropic smart drugs and then there are other chemicals in that category that are newer like
resigiline this is a herbal version of something like that less potent in the dosage that we use
and specifically so a mao inhibitor is inhibiting an enzyme that breaks down certain neurotransmitters
so the neurotransmitters can actually get across the synapse more effectively mao a and mao b
are going to protect different neurotransmitters more selectively mao b is an mao b inhibitor
like this is going to protect primarily dopamine and then some of the associated catecholamines
norepinephrine epinephrine and phenolethylamine and the main reason that we include this and we
include a small dose is phenolethylamine which is a a minor mono amine that category of neurotransmitters
it's one of the most it's one of the primary active ingredients in chocolate and in blue green algae
that gives the psychoactive effect that it's usually kind of a euphoric effect but it has an
extremely short half-life and so it usually degrades in minutes and so it's been a very common
stack in the notropic world the neuro happen world to stack something like hoarding there are
many other natural mao b inhibitors but to stack that with phenolethylamine so that it actually
has a longer half-life and some of the positive psychostimulatory and euphoric effects actually
last longer and so it's also obviously going to affect dopamine which we're addressing through a
number of ingredients and pathways so that's the gist with that okay okay got it and in addition
to that that's that's blended with a bunch of other things I think some people may have may have
heard of before like phenolethylamine which is you know like like a neurotransmitter I know it's
also known as the the love drug but it increases like euphoria and and arousal and excitation
phosphatidylserine is another one I think a lot of people know about as a way to like increase
mental processing speed I've talked about one that you have in there before called vinposa
team which they actually had some really interesting research on in in NFL football players to reduce
you know speaking of tbi a lot of the issues with with traumatic brain injury and in NFL players
in a study I think that Dr. Daniel Aiman did a couple of years ago um hooperzine which of course
Tim Ferriss made made popular in in the four-hour body and theobromine from chocolate and and DHEA
which you mentioned um and then another part of that uh that new tropic blend that you have
that I wanted to ask you about uh is that you have a you have a little bit of caffeine in there
it's not it's not a lot of caffeine but I noted that you that you bind the caffeine to something
called uh sarostilbene uh why do you do that yeah so we don't actually bind that we get it from
one of our partners uh called chromadex that makes a patented product called pure energy pure energy
is terostilbene which is a antioxidant that comes from the the primary antioxidant in blueberries
and uh certain other uh natural compounds and they're binding that to caffeine and specifically
there are many companies that make terostilbene this company chromadex has a version of it called
peter pure that they've got uh good clinical trials on showing its effectiveness in um
as a cerebral antioxidant it's very similar to resveratrol terostilbene is a few of the reasons
that it is preferred to resveratrol often is that it has a much longer half-life in the blood
and it crosses the blood brain barrier to be a cerebral antioxidant more effectively
and when caffeine is bound to terostilbene the uh the pharmacodynamics of it are very interesting
so it slows the rate of caffeine into the bloodstream and elongates the half-life pretty
significantly it elongates the half-life of caffeine by about 25 percent and as you look at
you know multiple halvings that means that after about six hours you've actually got 50 percent
more caffeine in the blood than you do from the same number of milligrams of caffeine not bound to
terostilbene which means that you have both more of a delayed onset more gradual uh slower and
longer taper so you've got more consistent peak plasma levels of caffeine and so we wanted something
that had both a longer effect and less of a crash afterwards and less of a you know stimulatory peak
and this particular uh delivery mechanism for caffeine was the best one that we found for this
purpose and you get the additional benefits of the terostilbene which there are many benefits
of it but primarily this antioxidant is the main reason that's interesting i mean i've been
genetically tested for this and i'm a fast caffeine oxidizer which means that caffeine is typically in
and out of my bloodstream pretty quickly um and and that is one thing i noticed about this it seems
to like lengthen the half-life of caffeine like like without me getting like the the up and then
the down i'd never actually had caffeine bound to something like uh serostilbene before but
really interesting effect and and for those of you who have who have tried caffeine all on its own
i would i would recommend that you you see what it feels like when you when you get it bound to
this caffeine especially if you're a fast coffee metabolizer like i am um but before we delve
into some of these other things you know like like neuro vitamins and choline donors that you
have in here kind of a bigger picture question for you daniel what are some little known effects
that something like a new tropic can have that people might not know about i mean i mentioned
for example when i when i took that that god pill all of a sudden i had zero desire to procrastinate
like i just i was ready to jump into to anything you know i know for people who are
you know procrastinating doing taxes or writing that article or cleaning out the desk door or
whatever you know it seems that new tropics may have an effect there but are there other things
besides uh limiting procrastination that are that are lesser known effects of new tropic compounds
sure limiting procrastination is actually a really fun example because it wasn't one we intended
when we were originally developing this formula and earlier iterations of the formula it was one
