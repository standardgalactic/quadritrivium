Hey, what's up?
It's Ben Greenfield.
Prepare to have your mind blown because my guest on the episode that you're about to
hear is basically the world's leading authority on smart drugs and new tropics and how to
maximize cognitive enhancement of your brain, how to upgrade your brain.
So it's pretty cool stuff.
I enjoyed this interview quite a bit.
I think you will too.
However, as you know, it's not just a smart thing to upgrade your brain.
It's a smart thing to upgrade and protect yourself with life insurance.
I've got life insurance, but the fact is what a lot of people don't realize is that you
can actually save a boatload of money on life insurance if you're a healthy person.
So there's this company called Health IQ and they use science and data and research to
get you a lower rate on life insurance if you cycle or waitlist or swim or run or anything
like that because they have all this research that shows that people who exercise a lot
have a much, much lower risk of early death.
I don't have to tell you that.
I'm preaching to the choir.
But what happens is they negotiate with life insurance companies for you based on your
health results.
It's really cool.
So the way that you do this is you go to helpicue.com slash ben and they'll give you a totally
free quote.
If you go to help IQ like health intelligence quotient IQ.com slash ben, you can learn about
life insurance for physically active people, but also get that free life insurance quote.
So it's a good way to protect yourself and also take advantage of the fact that you're
exercising to save some money.
This podcast is also brought to you by some of the best tasting green juice powder on
the face of the planet.
And here's why I like this stuff and this particular time of year.
I usually will do like kale and bok choy and Swiss chard and stuff like that in my smoothie.
It's dense green super foods, but in the winter it's like it's hard to find those foods.
I've got romaine lettuce and iceberg lettuce and cucumbers and some squash, but you miss
out on one of those really dense antioxidants, a lot of the dense chlorophyll rich green
stuff.
So you can make yourself a smoothie with whatever cucumbers and zucchini and iceberg or whatever
kind of like slightly sub par vegetables, sorry cucumbers that you have around.
And then you can throw this powder in to upgrade the nutrient density.
I'm using that word a lot, aren't I upgrade?
So anyways, the way that you do this is you get this green juice powder that's called
organifi.
It's got like 15 plus different ingredients, chock full of just about every green thing
on the face of the planet.
And you put it in your smoothie or your water, your juice or your coffee.
If you're one of those weird people that blends strange things into your coffee.
And the way that you get this stuff, you get a 20% discount on it.

And now onto today's episode with a guy who makes me look pretty dumb.
Not that that's hard to do, but he definitely does it.
In this episode of the Ben Greenfield Fitness Show.
One of the things we realized was that people who are dealing with chronic complex disease
who are going to have to do a lot of things and that have some complication are also dealing
with decreased cognitive function, decreased energy and some, you know, emotional difficulty
that makes it hard to do what they need to.
So being able to support those areas is hugely beneficial.

All the information you need in one place, right here, right now, on the Ben Greenfield
Fitness Podcast.
Hey folks, it's Ben Greenfield and it's probably no secret that I often record podcasts with
all sorts of special things circulating in my bloodstream and today would be a definite
doozy.
I am chock full of Hooperzine, DHEA, Curcumin, Kersetan, Bio-PQQ, Artichoke, Cholius, Ginko,
Thorine, Theanine, Centrophaxine, Cytocholine, Alpha GPC, Zinc Picolinate, Magnesium-3nate
and a host of other variables that are right now lighting my brain on freaking fire, things
called Neurotropics.
My guest on today's show actually thinks there's a pretty big problem with this stuff, namely
that the entire field of, the entire movement of Neutropics or smart drugs that some people
will call them, even though there's a difference, that the entire movement has some pretty extreme
reductionistic tendencies, meaning that even though popping pills and using biohacks and
self-quantification to make your body and your brain smarter and despite the plethora
of scientific findings focused on individual neurotransmitters and mechanisms and cell walls
and receptor sites and brain flow and blood flow, it's all mostly a bunch of isolated
variables, isolated single parts of the cognitive machinery.
In many cases, when we look at all this stuff in isolation, there can be side effects, there
can be drawbacks, there can be some deleterious impacts in other areas.
My guest today has a distinct focus.
His focus is to somehow make all this stuff work together, how to better understand basically
the complex dynamics between the brain and an entire meta theory of cognitive enhancement
as geeky and nerdy and woo-woo and white lab codish as that may seem.
That's exactly what we're going to be delving into in today's show along with a host of
information on what I would consider to be the most comprehensive, neutropic stack ever
made and what actually happens to be circulating in my bloodstream and in my brain right now.
My guest today is Daniel Schmockdenberger, and I just love that last name because any
name that's multi-syllableic that I can say, well, without butchering it, I'll take it,
Daniel Schmockdenberger.
I almost butchered it at that time.
Daniel has actually been studying health and neurology for quite some time.
He was originally afflicted with some neurological and autoimmune illnesses that he'll fill us
in on, but wasn't able to get him fixed with allopathic medicine or with complementary
medicine, and so he really took a deep dive into physiology and pathology and became a
real academic of mind body medicine, a student of mind body medicine, and he has a huge background
now in everything from psychedelics to neutropics to meditation to psychology to all sorts of
different tools for evolving states and stages of consciousness and evolving the human cognitive
experience.
He brings all this together along with a ton of scientific research on his website, which
I will link to in the show notes.
It's called the Neurohacker Collective, and the specific flavor of neutropic that he has
created is called qualia, and so we're going to delve into that and probably take the deepest
dive we've ever taken into neurohacking, hacking the biology of your brain, your cognition,
the problem with modern smart drugs, affecting your neurons in a very positive way, building
new brain cells, and a whole lot more.
So Daniel, thanks for coming on the show, man.
Ben, thanks for having me.
It's good to be here.
Yeah, no problem.
And you are down in Encinitas, California, right?
That's correct.
Yeah, I like it.
The land of yoga pants and also navy seals, I suppose.
It's kind of a weird place, right?
Navy seals and yoga pants.
Is the intersection of both of those things.
You aren't wearing yoga pants and dressed up as a navy seal with a trident, are you?
That's private.
OK. All right.
All right. A little bit awkward, but we'll leave that to everyone's imagination.
Anyway, so Daniel, before we jump into this whole idea of new tropics and cognitive enhancement
and the nitty gritty nuts and bolts of how to do it, I'm curious about what happened to you,
because I know you had some kind of an illness or something that kind of led you down this road,
but what exactly was going on with you?
It's a field that I've always been interested in, the capability for us to develop human
potential in general and cognitive and psychological potential in specific, as well as just kind
of the cutting edge of personalized and integrative medicine, both in the diagnostic and therapeutic
sides, and with my background orientation towards whole systems, complex system science
and integrating multiple disciplines and approaches together that, like I said,
that had always been an area of deep interest.
But several years back, I did start having a bunch of symptoms, and when I went and got
traditional diagnostics, I had both autoimmune rheumatic disease and signs of a neurodegenerative
process. And the specific things that I had going on did not have any kind of adequate treatment
in allopathic medicine, and there wasn't even consistent success anywhere in integrative medicine.
And so the answer for me was to just start seeking to understand what tissues were being
damaged by what chemicals, what was happening up chain in those causal cascades that would lead
to that happening, what could be the tier one deviations from homeostasis that could lead to
those kind of cascade. And so that just meant starting to model out the systems in a more
complex way where we don't silo between neurology, gastroenterology, immunology, etc.
because obviously a gut brain access disorder can be affecting neurologic tissues. And so when
we started to model that, applying complex systems ontology, a lot of really novel insights
started to come about, and it led to me figuring out how to do appropriate diagnostics for myself
of what was going on. I found a number of key, like what you would call original cause, and then
also causal cascade insights, and was able to actually reverse those both the disease pathology
as well as the underlying causes, reverse the autoimmune antibodies, etc., and then was able
to do similar things for many friends that had also had diagnoses that had no formal treatment.
And this led to a series of insights about not just natropics or neuropsychopharmacology,
but the future of medicine as a whole. How do we do a better job of understanding what health is
in terms of whole system resilience and what diseases in terms of decreased resilience and
pathophysiology, and what the future of adequate integrative personalized medicine could look
like. That's a lot of big words, man. I'm curious, in terms of like the specific nitty gritties,
what are a couple of examples of things that you did, like when you're talking about autoimmune
issues or neurological dysfunction, were you just drinking bone broth and following an autoimmune
diet where you weren't eating nightshades and dairy and soy, or were you pulling a lot of fringe
little biohacks, or I know what you call neurohacks out, and if so, we're just a couple of things
that you did that kind of like affected some really significant change.
Well, you know how sometimes you've talked to integrative doctors or biohackers that really
focus on mold, or yeast, or GI parasites, or pathogens, or dysbiosis, or methylation disorders
from genetic predispositions, or HPA axis disorders, or Lyme's disease, or heavy metal toxicity, or
it's like, how do you put all of the parts together of all forms of toxicity, all forms of
deficiency, all forms of pathogenicity, code imbalance, because you're obviously going to treat
Lyme disease in terms of actual Borrelia in the blood very differently than you're going to treat
a mucosal infection, or you're going to treat heavy metal toxicity, and so the key for me was
actually enumerating the entire space of all the things that could be involved, doing complex
diagnostics across the whole space, and then rather than just kind of have a shotgun approach,
have very targeted therapy that factored exactly what was going on for me, that would be totally
different than what was going on for someone else that had the same disease diagnosis,
because you can have multiple different deviations from balance, deviations from homeostasis that
can lead to the same kind of disease disorder. So I was doing specific kinds of treatments
for mucosal infections, weird infections I had in my gut from international travel,
and that was both meds, so Alenia and Ivermectin, and a number of kind of normal and not very common
antiparasitic, antibacterial meds, and a lot of supplements that were both addressing
mucosal function, addressing infection directly, and so that would be like an example of dealing
with GI infection, where we were dealing with other mucosal infection, like things in sinuses,
then there were specific anti-infectious and biofilm-killing, biofilm-breaking things that I
did intranasally, a lot of IV therapies, IV chelation, glutathione, etc., for aspects of toxicity,
and ozone ultraviolet lights for some humeral infections, so lots of things, but it wasn't
just like all of the integrated things, it was very specifically targeted towards what order of
operations makes sense on what things that are here. Right, that makes sense, so you were not
just throwing everything in the kitchen sink at your body in some desperate attempt to fix
yourself, you were actually, I'm assuming, doing blood and biomarker testing as you went along
researching a lot of this stuff? Yeah, I started with comprehensive diagnostics across the whole
spectrum of things that could be involved, and then said, okay, does this make sense? If I look at my
medical history, when certain symptoms started, when I was exposed to certain things, I look at
the whole landscape of biometrics now, and in understanding of how causation could occur,
do I kind of have a story of when these exposures likely happened, when these kind of, you know,
exposures to toxins, infections, etc., injuries, stresses, and then if you can put a picture
together and you can get a sense of, okay, what would a project plan for reversing the speed?
Obviously, if you've got some kind of, say, GI mucosal infection that is causing continuous
inflammation to go into the bloodstream or allowing toxicity to go into the bloodstream,
you're going to want to address that before trying to address the blood side most of the time,
so order of operations, etc., that's just all things you would factor if you're doing kind of
comprehensive treatment. Yeah, and I know that today we're going to focus a lot more on kind of like
the nutrient status of things, right, like nutrients that you could put into your body to
assist with nervous system and with brain health, and with even like building new neurons and things
like that, but in the show notes, I'm putting the show notes over at bengreenfieldfitness.com
slash neurohacker, as in, well, just so it sounds like, neurohacker, but that's a phrase I hadn't
really heard thrown around until I heard you use it, Daniel, and I'm just curious when it comes to
this idea of neurohacking before we delve into the nitty-gritty of what, you know, kind of like a
dream new tropic would look like, what exactly is neurohacking and how do you find neurohacking?
What is it that your company does from this neurohacking standpoint?
Like I said, even though I'd been interested in the field of cognitive optimization for a long time,
one of the things that had me do a deep dive into it when I was wrestling with some of these issues
myself is that some of the symptoms I was dealing with were cognitive decline and my background
and like my whole life work being cognitively engaging things that was more debilitating than
physical issues for sure. And since I was going to have to try and study and figure out an adequate
approach since one didn't exist, obviously I couldn't do that while having cognitive decline.
So my first thing that I applied the cognitive bandwidth I had to was how do I increase cognitive
bandwidth? And so that was a deep dive into the study of cognitive nutrition, smart drugs,
natropics, et cetera. Again, applying complex systems models like, okay, so what really is
being mediated by acetylcholine, what's being mediated by catecholamines, by glutamate, by
how do these systems interface, et cetera, getting a more detailed understanding and then seeing how
to support that whole process. Now, fast forwarding years, one of the things we realized was that
people who are dealing with chronic complex disease who are going to have to do a lot of
things and that have some complication are also dealing with decreased cognitive function, decreased
energy, and some emotional difficulty that makes it hard to do what they need to. So being able
to support those areas is hugely beneficial for the rest of treating their pathology. But then,
of course, that's just relevant for everyone, right? Even at the other end of the bell curve,
people who are looking for real optimization enhancement. And so neural hacking for us is
you could almost think of it as a subset of biohacking, but also kind of a bend diagram
with it where we're looking at hacking the mind-brain interface. What things can we do
that enhance... So we're not looking so much at athletic performance, even though that can be
a positive side effect. We're looking at optimizing cognitive capability and psycho-emotional
state and predisposition. Okay, got it. So when we start to kind of delve into the actual nitty
gritty of especially like the type of nutrients that you can put into your brain, my first question
is before we focus on individual ingredients, the thing that I'm curious about because I kind of
want to know how this works. From an acute effect, obviously, when somebody takes like a handful of
pills, like a neurotropic or some powder or some tincture or extract designed to help your brain
fire better, is there an actual chronic change in brain structure? I mean, is there any evidence
out there that you can do things like build new neurons or reset your tolerance to things like
caffeine or increase the production of mitochondria or cell membranes or anything along those lines?
What can be done in the brain by putting the right nutrients into it?
Yeah, this is a really important question. When we think about smart drugs in general,
oftentimes think about pharmaceuticals that are being used for off-label purposes, like
Adderall or Ritalin or etc., we'll notice that we get immediate lift in certain metrics like
focus or concentration or something that's useful. But those lifts not only usually are not lasting,
don't produce positive long-term effects, but oftentimes are producing negative long-term effects
either because of side effects in other systems or even the system they're affecting,
they're affecting in a way that creates dependence. And the primary way to think about this is if you
have a regulatory system, like say we're looking at Adderall, you have an endogenous system that's
regulating dopamine levels and catecholamine levels. If I override that system through an
external, right, an exogenous stimulus, then I'm going to create dependence upon that exogenous
stimulus and that means down-regulation. One of our fundamental goals was how do we understand
how the body's endogenous regulatory systems work and rather than override them, work through those
pathways where we can increase system resilience and robustness where if someone got off of whatever
it was that they were taking, they would actually have lasting positives because
the underlying regulatory systems have become more robust. So that was a core goal for us and
there's a number of ways of that happening. So you've got obviously the immediate effects that
are usually going to be neurochemical, neuroendocrine kind of effects, changing people's levels of
neurotransmitters, receptor site modulation, things like that. You can affect those fairly quickly.
You've got medium-term effects which can come from things like decreasing inflammation
and affecting say the phospholipid cell membrane to have more integrity and elasticity.
And then you've got longer-term effects like the ones that you were mentioning
where you start looking at things like neurogenesis, the development of new neurons, new neural stem
cells and synaptogenesis, the development of new synapses and both of those as a category of
biogenesis, new biological structural development, increased mitochondria within cells.
These are not going to be permanent because nothing's permanent and it's a continuously
changing environment just like exercise and muscle development is not permanent but it's
lasting, meaning if you aren't then damaging those structures and you're continuing to support them,
there is lasting structural change. So I would say with a notropic or in general one of people's
goals should be how do we create short-term immediate benefit we're looking for without
creating meaningful side effects or down-regulation, how do we up-regulate the regulatory systems for
lasting benefit and how do we up-regulate structure in a way that's going to produce,
again, regulatory lasting benefit. And when you look at things like you've got the company Neural
Stem that is in late-stage clinical trials for their product, NSI-189. What's it called? Neurostem?
Neurostem. They're actually a boutique pharmaceutical company and they were originally
working doing Neurostem cell injections for spinal cord injuries and ALS and they started
figuring out some small molecules that made stem cells proliferate and their most famous one is a
product called NSI-189 and that will probably become a pharmaceutical drug but some people
have already been using it as a natropic and specifically its mechanism of action is neurogenesis,
right, developing more neural stem cells that increase gray matter density in the hippocampus
and then other areas and so it's been treating major depressive disorder.
And is this something that the people like would get prescribed by a physician or is this
like an injection into the brain or what is it? It's not something that someone would get prescribed
yet because it hasn't finished FDA clearance but it probably will. But this is an example of one that
is actually moving down that kind of pharmaceutical path but whether it would be used for say diabetic
neuropathy or anxiety or depression or Alzheimer's if you can help develop endogenously more neural
stem cells that's going to be very meaningful for lots of things. What happens to be that there are
nutrients that are involved in our body's own process of doing that that can help in that
direction and other kind of system modulators so those are all things that we factor in the
natropics that we develop. Interesting so when we're talking about like new brain stem cells
what about for people with like TBI's and you know head injuries and stuff like that I mean I've
gotten orbital fractures and TBI's and concussions like they're going out of style when you're talking
about inducing new brain stem cells or neurogenesis are you actually saying that you could potentially
like heal certain areas of the brain? Yep so when someone has a TBI mild traumatic brain injury or
severe traumatic brain injury the first thing that has to happen is to protect ongoing damage so
ongoing oxidative damage, excitotoxicity, any of the kinds of damage that can start to cascade
and whether we're talking about a head injury or a stroke or that neural protection is a first goal
and then beyond that where there has been actual damage to neural networks then we want to see
what can we do to help regenerate neural networks and you've got natropics like emoxypene also known
as mexidol that have been used pretty heavily off-label mostly for post stroke and other forms
of traumatic brain injury some of the russian peptides so cmax and cell ink and some of the
more common natropics like some of the racitams and the ampikines and newpept in particular
have been found very both neuroprotective and neurogenic and then you've got things like lion's
mane and torene and methyl B12 that are all neurogenic through normal endogenous processes
so even though the field of TBI treatment is only kind of scratching the surface of these areas I do
think in the not too distant future will combine much better scan technologies like
spec scans and better QEG along with the normal fMRI etc have a better picture of what's going on
and then have much better both protection and treatment capabilities yeah it actually is fun
to self quantify this stuff like I've been doing um I went down to Los Angeles and visited this
place called the peak brain institute and spent about a week there learning how to how to do
neurofeedback how to actually attach electrodes to my head and use this software in which you're
you're basically flying a spaceship with your brain but you are being rewarded with audio and
visual cues that encourage for example production of alpha or theta brain waves or you know that
decrease production of like fast stressful beta brain waves and it's really interesting because
I've tried this type of brain training both with and without certain new tropics you know circulating
in my system and there's a distinct difference especially in the amount of like you know up
regulated alpha or theta and decreased beta when you use a self quantification method like that
obviously you know not everybody's going to have like a whatever a $3,000 piece of a you know
electrode and laptop they can do this with but I mean you know there's even there's even phone apps
I don't know if you've played around with them much Daniel but like the cns tap test app or it was
just like test your central nervous system by letting you keep track of how quickly you can tap
in a 60 second time frame or like the uh like the n-back app on the iphone that just just allows you
to test like your your short-term memory recall and it really is interesting that you can see a
distinct difference that kind of goes above and beyond what you might get from say like a cup of
coffee with this stuff well here's a real fun concept there obviously we are starting to get
quantified self devices that are more available which is hugely beneficial because when when we
can link assessment insights with whatever we're doing you know in terms of influence then we get
much better and shorter up regulation cycles in terms of what we're doing but we've obviously
got also hardware that's becoming available so it's not 128 or 64 lead EEG but the muse is actually
pretty neat for people being able to do neural feedback on their own right and there's a few
EEG neural feedback devices that are starting to become commercially available that are good
enough that they're meaningful so these are all part of what we would call the neural hacking
movement the both assessment and then influential tools and you notice I'm not saying diagnostic
or treatment because we're we're not operating within the FDA medical space but these are all
what we call neural hacking tools that are meaningful and that we appreciate but when
you mention that you are doing neural feedback neural feedback is not only helping you learn
how to gain executive control of certain brain frequency states but the reason that that can
be lastingly beneficial is you start having certain states be more common more baseline right and
certain things that were common before say anxiety or whatever become less common less
baseline that corresponds with structural changes and so there but when you're doing
neural feedback even though you have something on your scalp it's not doing any transcranial
stem it's just reading and then you are using your own consciousness right you're using your own
mind brain system to do different things with your attention that actually leads to neuroplastic
rewiring of the brain including development of you know new neural networks and that can happen
also without EEG equipment that can happen and when someone learns how to juggle or play drums or
any new kind of coordination tasks they're actually having to develop new neural circuitry and now
when you start mentioning adding something like no tropics in think about what happens if we're
wanting someone if someone's wanting to do therapy to cure PTSD or they're wanting to do EEG
neural feedback to develop some new capabilities what if we could give them chemistry that actually
made their brain more neuroplastic first so it could change more within per unit time of doing
that therapy and then we gave them other chemistry afterwards that was long-term potentiating that
actually helped lock in that new learning that's an example of sequencing so that could look like
micro dosing psilocybin before and doing something like siltep afterwards and you get to balance that
plasticity make your synapses more susceptible to change and potentiation lock in the learning
in terms of effective synaptic formation this would be an example of thinking through something
kind of in a in a more comprehensive neurohacking way yeah that that whole field of neuroplasticity
is it's it's actually extremely interesting you know how you can strengthen or lessen existing
neuronal pathways or establish new neurons and and new connections which I know is is actually
it's called structural plasticity versus like building new pathways I think that's called synaptic
plasticity but you make a good point right like like you don't have to necessarily go out and
spend thousands of dollars on neurofeedback software you can learn a language you can you
know play the ukulele you can tackle some some difficult interesting subject like like you
know take take an online course of you to me or you know learn how to learn how to code and then
you even mention you know something interesting even even like psilocybin that's that's that's a
really interesting topic I you know I've used psilocybin here and there and I found that that
when I have used it the situations in which I've used psilocybin in moderation with responsibility
and with intention has actually resulted in the formation of intense memories that are far brighter
and more clear and more colorful than memories formed in the absence of something like psilocybin
so yeah I think this this whole idea of neuroplasticity is is very interesting and I want to actually
delve into some of the ingredients that you can put into your body to make it more neuroplastic
but also to do things like you know shut down brain inflammation or provide the brain with you
know uh neuro vitamins etc but before I ask you about that I'm curious just just for fun do you
you know I was talking about you know neurofeedback for example and you mentioned the muse headband
for meditation do you have anything that you do on a regular basis in in kind of like the tech
sector not necessarily like pills that you pop but but do you do like tdcs or electro stem or
anything along those lines to enhance your own neuroplasticity any any special bio hacks that
you use frequently yeah I wouldn't just say for neuroplasticity but for um mind brain nervous
system optimization comprehensively so right where I'm sitting like within just a reach of my seat
I've got the violite intranasal transcranial lasers and I I like that technology quite a lot
it's actually and I'm going to interrupt you super quickly because this is the million dollar
question Daniel do you have the one that that like wraps around your entire head and goes in your
nose or are you an underachiever and you just have the one that goes in your nose no no head and
nose both oh nice you have the you have the noro yes cool that thing is amazing but we have a bunch
of other uh you know fun transcranial laser technologies um so this is primarily focused
on increasing cellular ATP levels through specific frequencies of light um and obviously
transcranial transcranial intranasal for increasing ATP in neurons which are obviously very
energy intensive um and so I think that's a that's a brilliant technology there's a lot of
forms of transcranial stem transcranial direct current is interesting I'm very careful with it
transcranial alternating current is interesting transcranial magnetic deep stem and we've even
got friends who are at the pioneering edge of transcranial ultrasound at the University of Arizona
Stuart Hammerhoff's lab and a number of other places that are pioneering work with transcranial
ultrasound to reverse uh beta amyloid and telphosphorylation involved with Alzheimer's so
there are some of those technologies that I use regularly that are here and there are other ones
that uh I've went and used very specifically for specific conditions um or that wouldn't be
appropriate for me because I don't have the things that they're needed but we use them with other
people that they are appropriate with right right used appropriately they're really amazing you
know for example that that uh vi-light device I was speaking with a really intelligent neurosurgeon uh
and uh a guy I've had in the podcast a few times named Dr Jack Cruz and we were talking about the
use of of things like you know intranasal light therapy and the use of like that head
band that that neuro headband and you know one of the ideas behind that and its stimulation
of the uh the uh the cytochrome c-oxidase I believe is is the specific area that stimulates is it
it creates a little bit of free radical production and so some of this stuff you know it's not like
you're you're hooked up to it 24-7 it's like that device you're supposed to use about once every two
to three days or you know like you talked about transcranial uh direct stimulation that the the
tdcs which is often done with a headband I actually I've been trialing uh a device called the the
neuroscience made by a company called Halo and it's a pretty intense form of magnetic stimulation
that that massively ramps up the activity in the motor cortex and so it will for example decrease
your sensitivity to discomfort during exercise when you use it prior to an exercise session or
increase your ability to be able to rip more weight off the floor during a deadlift but you also
you're you're supposed to take a good eight to ten hours between any type of sessions or something
like that just because it's such an intense you know ride so to speak for your brain so yeah some
of this stuff is interesting you just have to use it responsibly right
I want to interrupt this podcast to tell you about a few people that you need to follow on
instagram so that I've got I've got a few ladies that you should follow on instagram
whether you're a lady who wants to be inspired or whether you're a dude who wants to see ladies
doing awesome things so here they are jot these down or write them down um or go to the website
that i'm gonna tell you about in a second and there'll be links to each of these girls molly
eledge she is an amazing beautiful specimen of a crossfit athlete who has some really
inspirational posts on instagram and then there's this girl called the calisthenics queen jessica
russian r3d bogdanov bogdanov check her out she has some amazing twirling that she does all over
the place like a parkour athlete on steroids check out kate min wagon that's m in w e g and she's an
aerialist she's also freaking amazing and and her instagram page is off the hook and then finally
there's this girl that is an adventurer who does like a bunch of free diving and deep water and
she's really cool too her name is ashley barrett so all of these athletes are athletes who represent
kamara coffee and kamara coffee is used by so many these crazy people like ufc fighters and
mma artists and and me and professional racing pilots and biohackers and all sorts of people
around the globe including like adventurers who are doing amazing things and they use this stuff
because it's like coffee on steroids without actual illegal performance enhancing drugs in it
so this coffee has alpha gbc torene elthianine d mea you're listening to a spot or a podcast on
on smart drugs uh and new tropics so why not get some in your coffee in the morning so check
him out kamara coffee and here's the deal when you go to kamara coffee k i m e r a k o f f e e dot
com you use code men to get 10 off any of their coffees or any of their cool things that you
can put into coffee and if you score to the bottom of the page when you go to kamara coffee dot com
all four of those chicks that you can follow on instagram along with frankly all of their athletes
on instagram and some of them are pretty pretty cool pretty fun to watch instagram's a great way
to waste time and see cool things and be inspired of course so check them out kamara coffee dot com
this podcast is also brought to you by something i introduced you to last week that i use whenever
i'm traveling when i want to reset my circadian biology so here's the deal every single cell
in your body synchronizes its activity with the sun but it can be hard to get full daylight into
your life meaning that when you're indoors you have shift work or long distance travel like on an
airplane reduced date light time is basically going to restrict your circadian biology from
being normal and a lot of people like will do blue light box therapy which basically means you sit
in front of a bright light lamp for about 30 minutes to two hours every day but these researchers
in finland found that your ears the inside of your ears have photoreceptor proteins in them
and you can target them by shining a bright light into the ear so they developed this device called
the human charger they call it the human charger sun in your pocket it allows you to do things
like fight the winter blues and increase mental alertness and reduce the effects of jet lag and
improve mood but you do it just by sticking this thing in your ear for 12 minutes a day it's just
like headphones these little earbuds fit snugly into your ears and then UV free blue enriched
white light just flows out of the things for 12 minutes then automatically turns off after it's
reset your brain basically it's really cool so here's the deal you can you can check this out
at humancharger.com slash ben and they've got a code a 20 discount code for everybody it's a
little bit complex the code but it's ben g 30 hc as in ben greenfield 30 human charger ben g 30 hc
and you get 20% off i love cool things that you can stick into your body that make your life better
go where you want with that and this definitely falls into that category so check them out human
charger.com slash ben use code ben g 30 hc well when you mention something that increases free
radicals anything that is pro oxidative is going to increase free radicals and so there's you know
a classic kind of relationship between oxidative and antioxidant therapies because you want a lot
of oxidation of glucose within the cell and you know in the particular areas appropriate to increase
ATP and cellular energy and you want to not be oxidizing cell walls and you know other other
structures so are people wanting to increase oxidative bandwidth or increase antioxidant
bandwidth then it's both right it's a very dynamic homeostatic relationship between
both of those and in different areas and different tissues and almost everything works like that
whether we're talking about ph whether we're talking about redox interactions we're not
trying to just move the needle in one direction we're trying to increase system resilience in
both directions simultaneously yeah yeah it's it's it's cool stuff though a total rabbit hole
compared to what i actually wanted to talk to you about today which is neutropic compounds
because i know that's kind of like your your area of expertise and and like i mentioned like i have
i have a bunch of the actual brain nutrients that you helped design circulating in my body
right now i woke up this morning and um and i have these two bottles one called step one
and one it's called step two this stuff is called qualia uh q q u a l i a qualia um
and i was first introduced to this stuff uh and and i might ask your permission for this first
daniel is it completely uh completely off limits for me to mention the god pill the black label
version of this stuff uh obviously it's not completely off limits because it just happened
okay um all right so the god pill is as you were calling it not your name not ours is basically
stuff that we work within the uh research lab but is not available for sale because we haven't gone
through all of the fda and testing we need to for that but is on our product roadmap yeah i kind of
did stuff backwards meaning that i had no clue what neurohacker collective and who you were uh i had
no clue about this qualia stuff that i'll i'll get into in a second but someone at a random
health and fitness conference that shall remain unnamed uh handed me this pill uh and it was in
the in the on the morning of a particularly difficult and rigorous day on which i was to speak
i was to do a whole bunch of of signings and talks i was to be be attending a late night party
that evening and he handed me this pill and he said i want you to try this and i said what is it
he said it was the it's the god pill um there's a little black package and i open it up and i'm
like well you know i'm one of those guys who uh if it's if it's relatively natural i'll try it and
i took a quick glance at the ingredient list which was an extremely comprehensive list of mostly
stuff i was relatively familiar with but i'd not actually taken all at the same time you know all
these different neutropic compounds so i took it and um and i did literally feel like not trying to
be blasphemous um god the rest of the day i mean everything was was firing on all cylinders
verbal fluency memory recall um uh the the ability to form relationships and connections with and
understand and be empathetic to people all sorts of of super interesting effects even like you
know reduced procrastination and reduced anxiety you know unfortunately this this effect stayed
with me until about four a.m. in the morning um which i was like i want to quit writing articles
and go to sleep at some point but uh you know very very similar to almost like modafinil without
actually uh you know kicking my liver into the ditch as modafinil can do and so that was my
introduction and later on i discovered that uh there there is actually uh perhaps a slightly less
less intensive version of this stuff called uh called qualia and so and that that was what i
took this morning for example i want one in the one uh bottle that you take in the morning on an
empty stomach and another bottle that you take uh with with breakfast or with food in your gut
and so um that is what i want to delve into into this qualia stuff so in terms of qualia first of
all why do you call this specific new tropic blend that you make qualia yeah it was a fun process
when it comes to naming uh qualia is actually a term coming out of philosophy of mind which
means the quality of what it is like to be you so your subjective experience is the physical
universe is made up of particles and force fields the subjective universe is made up of qualia
thoughts emotions sensations and so rather than just enhancing memory or digit span or
arithmetic processing capabilities uh we were alluding to the idea of optimizing one's experience
of existing subjective experience of existing so if someone happens to know philosophy of mind
then they're like oh cool they use the philosophy of mind term and if someone doesn't it's just a
cool sounding word that sounds kind of like quality okay got it makes sense all right so you've got
one two three four five six i believe seven different kind of like categories of
new tropic stimulants in in the ingredients of this formulation and that kind of returns to
i guess what you're talking about before how you don't want to just focus on one specific area of
brain enhancement you want to somehow get all the parts to to interact and so um if i could i'd like
to ask you about the difference between some of these things because i think some people may not
understand what all needs to be in a complete brain compound so first of all you know one of
the first categories that you have in here are new tropic compounds what exactly is a new tropic
compound yeah loosely the term is generally used to mean some chemical that can enhance some aspect
of cognitive function beyond someone's traditional baseline without meaningful side effects so it's
in contra distinction to smart drugs which would enhance some aspect of cognitive function but
might have some side effects or brain nutrients which aren't going to enhance brain function
beyond baseline they're going to make sure that you don't drop below baseline or if you already are
helped bring it back up but they're part of the kind of normal process and so of course we're
interested in and neurohacking involves all of those categories but that's a general way to think
about what a no tropic is and that term arose from the scientists that developed paracetam which was
the first racetam and kind of the beginning of the major family of chemicals and then there are other
families of chemicals ampikines and other things that are part of what we usually think of we think
of net tropics okay so so a new tropic in general isn't something like you know vitamin b to replace
some things that you're burning through and you're thinking or or like you know choline or
something like that but these are actual chemicals that would do things like assist with cell membrane
formation in the brain or cerebral perfusion or neuroendocrine regulation or something like that
something like that okay got it now one of the things if i want i want to target in a few kind
of kind of interesting nutrients that i wasn't really familiar with in your compound and and one
of the things that you have as part of the the neurotropic blend in here is called hordinin
hcl am i pronouncing that correctly yes hordinin okay what what exactly is hordinin so hordinin
is interesting it is a barley grass extract so it is actually not synthesized it is an extracted
compound and it is a fairly selective mao b inhibitor and so you've probably used or at least heard
of a saligoline deprenel which is a fairly selective chemical mao b inhibitor that is a
many people have associated with life extension as well as probably one of the the best
no tropic smart drugs and then there are other chemicals in that category that are newer like
resigiline this is a herbal version of something like that less potent in the dosage that we use
and specifically so a mao inhibitor is inhibiting an enzyme that breaks down certain neurotransmitters
so the neurotransmitters can actually get across the synapse more effectively mao a and mao b
are going to protect different neurotransmitters more selectively mao b is an mao b inhibitor
like this is going to protect primarily dopamine and then some of the associated catecholamines
norepinephrine epinephrine and phenolethylamine and the main reason that we include this and we
include a small dose is phenolethylamine which is a a minor mono amine that category of neurotransmitters
it's one of the most it's one of the primary active ingredients in chocolate and in blue green algae
that gives the psychoactive effect that it's usually kind of a euphoric effect but it has an
extremely short half-life and so it usually degrades in minutes and so it's been a very common
stack in the notropic world the neuro happen world to stack something like hoarding there are
many other natural mao b inhibitors but to stack that with phenolethylamine so that it actually
has a longer half-life and some of the positive psychostimulatory and euphoric effects actually
last longer and so it's also obviously going to affect dopamine which we're addressing through a
number of ingredients and pathways so that's the gist with that okay okay got it and in addition
to that that's that's blended with a bunch of other things I think some people may have may have
heard of before like phenolethylamine which is you know like like a neurotransmitter I know it's
also known as the the love drug but it increases like euphoria and and arousal and excitation
phosphatidylserine is another one I think a lot of people know about as a way to like increase
mental processing speed I've talked about one that you have in there before called vinposa
team which they actually had some really interesting research on in in NFL football players to reduce
you know speaking of tbi a lot of the issues with with traumatic brain injury and in NFL players
in a study I think that Dr. Daniel Aiman did a couple of years ago um hooperzine which of course
Tim Ferriss made made popular in in the four-hour body and theobromine from chocolate and and DHEA
which you mentioned um and then another part of that uh that new tropic blend that you have
that I wanted to ask you about uh is that you have a you have a little bit of caffeine in there
it's not it's not a lot of caffeine but I noted that you that you bind the caffeine to something
called uh sarostilbene uh why do you do that yeah so we don't actually bind that we get it from
one of our partners uh called chromadex that makes a patented product called pure energy pure energy
is terostilbene which is a antioxidant that comes from the the primary antioxidant in blueberries
and uh certain other uh natural compounds and they're binding that to caffeine and specifically
there are many companies that make terostilbene this company chromadex has a version of it called
peter pure that they've got uh good clinical trials on showing its effectiveness in um
as a cerebral antioxidant it's very similar to resveratrol terostilbene is a few of the reasons
that it is preferred to resveratrol often is that it has a much longer half-life in the blood
and it crosses the blood brain barrier to be a cerebral antioxidant more effectively
and when caffeine is bound to terostilbene the uh the pharmacodynamics of it are very interesting
so it slows the rate of caffeine into the bloodstream and elongates the half-life pretty
significantly it elongates the half-life of caffeine by about 25 percent and as you look at
you know multiple halvings that means that after about six hours you've actually got 50 percent
more caffeine in the blood than you do from the same number of milligrams of caffeine not bound to
terostilbene which means that you have both more of a delayed onset more gradual uh slower and
longer taper so you've got more consistent peak plasma levels of caffeine and so we wanted something
that had both a longer effect and less of a crash afterwards and less of a you know stimulatory peak
and this particular uh delivery mechanism for caffeine was the best one that we found for this
purpose and you get the additional benefits of the terostilbene which there are many benefits
of it but primarily this antioxidant is the main reason that's interesting i mean i've been
genetically tested for this and i'm a fast caffeine oxidizer which means that caffeine is typically in
and out of my bloodstream pretty quickly um and and that is one thing i noticed about this it seems
to like lengthen the half-life of caffeine like like without me getting like the the up and then
the down i'd never actually had caffeine bound to something like uh serostilbene before but
really interesting effect and and for those of you who have who have tried caffeine all on its own
i would i would recommend that you you see what it feels like when you when you get it bound to
this caffeine especially if you're a fast coffee metabolizer like i am um but before we delve
into some of these other things you know like like neuro vitamins and choline donors that you
have in here kind of a bigger picture question for you daniel what are some little known effects
that something like a new tropic can have that people might not know about i mean i mentioned
for example when i when i took that that god pill all of a sudden i had zero desire to procrastinate
like i just i was ready to jump into to anything you know i know for people who are
you know procrastinating doing taxes or writing that article or cleaning out the desk door or
whatever you know it seems that new tropics may have an effect there but are there other things
besides uh limiting procrastination that are that are lesser known effects of new tropic compounds
sure limiting procrastination is actually a really fun example because it wasn't one we intended
when we were originally developing this formula and earlier iterations of the formula it was one
of the positive side effects that we're like well that makes sense and it's cool and particularly
limiting procrastination on things that uh you know people found dreadful and odious and now they
had just much more emotional neutrality and focus etc in them and so there's been a very interesting
process to both hypothesize what things we would expect to be affected and then see
what actually shows up and obviously it's going to depend on the particular notropic
and the person so um say we're looking at something like anoracetam versus phenyl
paracetam they're both going to have increased memory verbal fluency through their effect on
acetylcholine in the nmda complex but anoracetam is going to have more anxiety decreasing
anxiolytic effects and phenyl paracetam is going to have more psychosimilatory effects
based on their effect on other receptor sites so you know it depends who designed A for instance
the acetylcholine esterase inhibition in it can cause lucid dreams and so a lot of people will
take that on their own or take you know something like qualian notice that they start having a lot
more vivid and lucid dreams that some of the i would say positive side effects that we were most
interested by is people feeling less emotional upset less what they would call
drama emotional upset that really is not helpful or warranted without feeling numb so they actually
feel more capable more available to positive experiences and negative feelings like you
know sadness around authentic things but not being upset unnecessarily by stories they're
generating because they're actually thinking more clearly and so much of our emotional process is
not the result of what's happening it's the result of us not thinking through multiple
different people's perspectives and generating negative meaning and as someone simply able to
think more quickly and more clearly then they don't get poor thinking generating unnecessary
emotional drama and so i would say that's probably one of the most fun experiences people have
reported yeah and i should know by the way when it comes to like vivid dreaming and lucid dreaming
i don't recommend at least i personally wouldn't take this stuff in the afternoon because i found
that it really produces a very intense wakefulness effect what i have found is that later on in the
day after it you know you would think it's out of your system i still get a very intense amount of
lucid dreaming and vivid dreaming on the days that i use this stuff so you don't you don't have to
take it right before bed you know for example i know like a alpha brain for example is a popular
neurotropic out there that if you if you take it before bed it can cause some pretty intense lucid
dreaming but this stuff seems to cause it even if you take it in the morning yeah many of the
compounds are gonna you know last in the bloodstream for a meaningful amount of time and or
they're going to affect some processes that last for a meaningful amount of time so this particular
acetylcholine esterase inhibition has a meaningful half-life on it yeah interesting okay so so
you've got new tropic compounds you know like like the like the um the hordinin that we talked about
and the serostilbine bound of the caffeine and the vinpo sapetine and the hooper zinae but then you
also have these things you call neuro vitamins and what's the difference between a neuro vitamin
and a neurotropic yeah so like we're saying earlier neuro vitamin basically we're just talking about
vitamins that have some effect in the nervous system either in converting amino acids into
neurotransmitters so specifically b6 and b6 in the phosphorylated version paradoxal 5-phosphate
and vitamin c are both critical for converting phenylalanine and tyrosine into dopamine converting
tryptophan into serotonin and so these are as per the definition of vitamin these are things that
one has to get dietarily the body can't synthesize them and they serve some kind of cofactor role in
in some kind of process right some protein or chemical synthesis so we've got vitamin d having
so many important roles throughout the whole body but particularly for the brain things like
myelin synthesis and we have a particular version of b1 called a benva timing which has a
very meaningful neuro protective function specifically in peripheral neurons and a
version of niacin which is another b vitamin niacinamide which helps with blood flow and
cerebral perfusion but specifically nad production and b5's role in acetylcholine and adrenal hormone
production etc so these are all vitamins in particular forms and doses that are oftentimes
the limiting factor in some of the key processes that we're seeking to support okay gotcha so
so a lot of like the vitamin b compounds and in specific forms that i know are designed
for their their neural protective effects or their anti-inflammatory effects for neural tissue
or cognitive impairment but in addition to the vitamin b complex i know as you've got the vitamin
d complex in there but it's not just vitamin d it's vitamin d in a form called micro encapsulated
colocalciferol what is that so colocalciferol just means vitamin d3 that's the scientific name
for vitamin d3 and micro encapsulated micro encapsulation is a process in which you have
some kind of chemical payload that is put in some kind of encapsulation that's designed to only
break down or release at some target so maybe it's trying to get through stomach acid like an
enteric micro encapsulation and release in the intestines or you know move through a particular
ph or whatever so it's a delivery mech mechanism and because vitamin d is a fat soluble vitamin
oftentimes it'll be actually in a fat base but because we're these these for manufacturing
reasons these particular capsules are powdered then we need to be able to take the d3 and and
stabilize it and make sure that it would deliver effectively so the micro encapsulation is usually
something like alginate in particular extract from algae or cellulose that's simply going to help
better absorption and delivery of that nutrient so it essentially helps to take a vitamin that would
mostly be fat soluble and allows it to be somewhat water soluble in this particular case yes okay
interesting all right so so you've got your your new tropics and you've got your neuro vitamins
and then you also have something in there like a class of compounds called neuro anti-inflammatories
and antioxidants obviously it's not rocket science to know what would an anti-inflammatory or an
antioxidant would do in the brain and and some of them they're a relatively familiar again like
kerosetin for example which i know has some really cool neuro protective effects and curcumin
which i've talked about quite a bit on the show before in terms of its its anti-inflammatory
effects especially for neural tissue and in dha and green tea extract and even bioperine or black
pepper extract which which i know can help with the absorption and utilization of curcumin there's
one in there also though called bio pqq um what is bio pqq yeah so pqq is a active version of
coq10 and so it has a number of important effects as a krebs cycle intermediary and support and atp
production and you can use coq10 you can use ubiquanol or you can use pqq they're progressively
more potent for certain processes so we're using pqq and bio pqq is simply a patented
brand that has had good clinical trials done on it so in general if there are companies that have
made a nutraceutical and have patented a process on it that has strong clinical trials already done
we will use that so that we know we have you know quality control and can reference the clinical
trials and you know that were done specifically and so pqq does a number of interesting things
it's involved in recycling glutathione it affects some growth factors uh it like a
nerve growth factor synthesis but the primary reason that we're using it does have anti-inflammatory
effects and cytokine modulation primary reason is atp support okay got it so you've got that in
there for specifically for atp support i know for example like uh um that's that's the same
stuff that's in the uh is it called the upgraded upgraded anti-aging formula that that bulletproof
makes a pqq i think that's the one that is it's either upgraded anti-aging or their upgraded aging
formula is oxaloacetate okay that's right then the unfair advantage which is the bio unfair
advantage that's right unfair advantage called bio pqq and speaking of which like i've talked
about this before i mean some of these names you know and and i love you know i love the products
that bulletproof makes i'm a huge fan of their stuff i use their their brain octane and i use
their their chocolate powder and their bars and all sorts of stuff um but also you know when you
look at at words right like catchy phrases like unfair advantage or i mean heck even the the god
pill phrase that i threw around earlier there's definitely an eyebrow that gets raised in the
scientific community with stuff like this with with claims like that so i'm curious um in terms of
like clinical research behind some of these ingredients that specifically like combining
all these greens into into a cocktail like you guys are doing at neurohacker collective
is there actual clinical research behind this stuff yeah great i want to go up for one moment
and describe the process of why we brought these particular compounds together in these
doses rather than other things and is it simply a you know throw in everything but the kitchen sink
because you mentioned a kind of trans reductionist whole systems approach the first thing we did when
we were looking at uh development of a notropic like this because we were doing specific notropic
chemistry with people in integrative medical clinical settings where we had their genetics
and we had a huge amount of blood chemistry on them and could customize things like if they
were under or over methylators and which methylation gene mutations they had and
you know etc this obviously a very different process we wanted to see could we could we provide some
aspect of that kind of benefit at scale that is a formula and there were some things that were
so specific like the way we would address the folate cycle many other examples that we just
really couldn't work with those axes without custom customized input but we found really
happily to kind of our surprise that there were many things that we could work with where the
people who kind of self-selected being interested in something like cognitive enhancement we had a
very high percentage of people that reported and on different performative tests responded very well
and so that's what this is but what we how we started was saying when people are seeking
cognitive enhancement what are they really seeking they they probably don't care about
arithmetic processing or digit span by themselves they care about a whole complex of cognitive
and psychomotional things that come together that lead to a certain set of experiential states
and capabilities so it's like how do we induce creative productive flow states neurochemically
much more effectively and so it involves focus and concentration and task switching and fluid
intelligence and various aspects of memory memory IO and long-term memory short-term memory digit span
etc along with things like drive and emotional resilience without creating irritability and
anxiousness and etc so we're looking at that whole complex of what side effects are often created by
some smart drugs or not tropics when people are pursuing some of the effects and what's additional
effects are actually needed for a synergy of being able to do really meaningful work and
feel optimized in the process and so we started with that kind of cognitive modeling and we looked
at for each of those psychomotional cognitive states or capabilities how they map to underlying
physiology what's known about which neurotransmitters which hormones which underlying aspects of
neural structure etc are are associated and this was from any various field of integrative medicine
or neuroscience etc so we started to model out the physiologic processes that mediate those
capabilities and then started to look at which chemicals affect those physiologic dynamics and
then start to explore synergies between them and etc so we developed a a notropic database of
about 500 chemicals that affected the pathways we were looking at and so when we narrowed it down to
42 in here obviously we're including a lot of things we're also not including a lot of things
we're including very specific dose ratios forms and so most of the ingredients have clinical trials
showing the specific things they do and then we have a specific kind of process of hypothesis
generation of how we are seeking to affect positive synergies and then we've done about
three years of you know preclinical data where we don't have where we haven't had formal placebo
control etc and we're just moving into doing clinical trials right now we have a partner in
the Neurobiology Department at Stanford that's helping with it and a number of other great science
partners outside of Neurohacker as well as the team inside of Neurohacker and so we're just
engaging on our clinical trials we're also developing an online assessment app that can assess
various cognitive capabilities like you're mentioning there's a few apps that do but again
we're going for comprehensivity and that can assess psychostructural and psycho kind of emotional
states so that people will be able to use that app to test how this is working but also that
they could test anything they could take other no tropics they could start meditating exercising
and just really be able to have a available resource for tracking psychocognitive effects
better right right so it's basically like like a whole bunch of ingredients that have pretty good
robust empirical bases for support and you know various degrees of laboratory and clinical research
supporting their safety and their efficacy but in terms of like putting all this together I mean to
to be frank it sounds like it's still you know you haven't actually taken this and put it through
like you know double blind peer reviewed research quite yet you're just kind of going off of each
of the individual as ingredients yeah we're like I said we're in the beginning of doing that but we
haven't got all the results back yet but it'll be soon our first pilot trial will come back soon
what we did in the you know in the preclinical phase was we had several hundred people for
a few years going through the trials where they again this was not properly blinded but they
were using quantified mind or Cambridge's online cognitive assessment or various cognitive assessments
like that as well as structured subjective reporting and so we did get input on and specific
data on what was changing and in what percentage of people and that was enough to develop it to
kind of the place that we have and now moving into a formal clinical process okay got it cool
well and I can speak from an n equals one experience that it seems to work quite well for me
and I suppose anyone else could try it as well oh and by the way again I'll mention the show notes
just so you guys know that I've got a fat discount on this stuff over in the show notes just go to
bengreenfieldfitness.com slash neurohacker that's bengreenfieldfitness.com slash neurohacker
oh go ahead because you just said n equals one this is one of the interesting things when you
ask about clinical trials a clinical trial says does this particular chemical compound process
therapy do something across some randomized database more than the placebo does it's a it's a
meaningful test but obviously some people are on one end of the bell curve effect and some people
are on the other end and there's a whole bunch of variables as to why that are just statistically
averaged into that bell curve and when we're trying to do personalized medicine where we would or
personalized optimization where we would do something different for you than we would for
anybody else then clinical trials are not and they're still an important part of the overarching
process but they're not adequate for n equals one optimization and so qualia is our first
product to go to market but more personalized versions of it moving towards full personalization
and then not just qualia but many different kinds of neuro technologies coming together
our goal is moving towards being able to do appropriate synthesis of all the biometrics
and psychometrics that someone has to gain better insights into what's going on in their system and
personalized optimization recommendation which is an underlying AI problem and so that's really
what neurohacker collective is all about is how do we synthesize the entire space right vet first
and then synthesize the space of everything that's actually meaningful to be able to affect people's
cognitive psychomotional mind-brain interactions and then based on the have about what's actually
going on for them personalized those recommendations got it cool i like it i'm all about mini testing
as you go through the stuff and again like if you've got access to to some of those neurofeedback
software the muse headband or you know in back training or cns tap test or anything like that
it's fun to play with this stuff in that vein as well um neural minerals you have neural minerals
in there as well like lithium orate and magnesium three and eight and zinc picolin eight um one of
the things i wanted to ask you about daniel because i use magnesium you know i've used it in the past
for you know helping with sleep before bed or helping to have a nice smooth bowel movement the next
morning you've got a form of magnesium called magnesium three and eight in there and most
mostly what i've used has been magnesium citrate uh why have you used magnesium three and eight as
your primary form of of a mineral and then kind of a bigger picture question why minerals in general
as as an inclusion in this compound yeah so magnesium three and eight is magnesium bound to
three anine and just like magnesium citrate is bound to citric acid there's many different forms
that you can bind magnesium to that will either have better or worse absorption overall or more
specific absorption targeting some of the many different things that magnesium and this would
be true for any mineral and so uh magteen which is the first kind of patented version of magnesium
three and eight had very interesting and very unique trials showing increased brain levels of
magnesium specifically cerebrospinal fluid levels of magnesium that were tested in terms of double
blind placebo control um and actually for this since we weren't testing subjective effects
they were testing uh specifically cerebrospinal fluid levels in placebo didn't matter that much
but can testing it against other forms of magnesium and found uh increased elevation of
cerebrospinal magnesium levels that no other form of magnesium tested had been able to show
so when we're looking specifically at magnesium's effect for neural health magnesium three and eight
seems to be the best form of magnesium currently known for increasing cerebrospinal and brain
levels of magnesium now that doesn't mean that magnesium citrate or other forms of magnesium
won't have additional benefits we think that topical magnesium magnesium uh oil is really
beneficial because you've actually got rate limiting uh factors in terms of just gi absorption of
magnesium in any form so going through other mechanisms is good but uh this one is is very
interesting and it seems to be from everything we know so far unique and it's neurologic benefits
yeah and so minerals in general are basically to to do things like modulate you know some of the
cytoskeins and the eucosinoids that are created during neural normal neural processing and and I
know there are there are other things that they're necessary for like redox reactions and uh cellular
neural metabolism and a lot of the other things you'd need minerals for I just don't see them in
a lot of new tropic compounds and especially this form of magnesium I'm totally on board with you
I use in addition to the magnesium citrate that I mentioned like a transdermal topical magnesium
especially on sore muscles um but I think it's interesting that you guys have magnesium in this
compound as well now not not to get too too uh nitty gritty but I've got a couple of other
questions about ingredients then like a usage question for you um amino acids you you have a
whole broad spectrum of amino acids in there and I don't think it's it's much of a secret any longer
than amino acids are used as neurotransmitter precursors and so if you're low in protein low
in amino acid especially if you're vegan or vegetarian I know amino acids are crucial
but then you also have something in there called choline donors choline donors why is it that someone
want to include a choline donor when they're taking something like a blend of amino acids and
minerals and and neurotropics and things of that nature right so there's a number of different
things we're trying to affect here so neurotransmitters are one of the significant effects specifically for
uh you know the immediate effects and affecting things like ngf and bdnf for
neurogenesis are some of the longer term effects there's many different pathways we're trying to
affect one of the neurotransmitters that's very meaningfully involved in memory and
cognitive function is the acetylcholine pathway and so we have various choline donors which are
actually providing the choline that gets acetylated into acetylcholine you'll notice we also have
acetyl donors both in the acetylcarnitine and the acetyltiracine where the amino acid has its own
benefit and we're making sure that the acetyl groups aren't going to be the rate limiting
factor for acetylcholine production and then the the rest of that acetylcholine pathway
involves things like you know b5 is involved in the actual production of acetylcholine
the acetylcholine esterase inhibitors like hooperzine a make sure that the acetylcholine
and the presynaptic neuron can actually get across the synapse effectively and then the nmda
modulators so nupept in particular but there's a few other things increase the post-synaptic
neurons ability to receive and process the acetylcholine all of this is part of what we call
a comprehend acetylcholine pathway support and the various different choline donors so you've
got like citicoline and alpha gpc and centrophonoxine but also things like urodine urodine has a
number of interesting effects but one of them is that it does convert into citicoline we have this
blend because you've got various peak plasma times and you when you want a more kind of
consistent peak plasma over a longer period of time you factor that and you've also got
kind of differential delivery where both alpha gpc and citicoline are going to affect peripheral
nerves more than centrophonoxine's effect on central nervous system and so this is all part
of what we would call acetylcholine precursors and support okay got it so so it's the same reason
i mean you you hear about things like choline turnover and about how you can get excessively
fatigued if you try to get your brain to fire too quickly without replenishing it with things like
alpha gpc or with choline and all you've done is you've taken a whole bunch of different forms of
choline like the cytokoline and the centrophonoxine and the alpha gpc and put them all together in
there so you're essentially just like covering all the choline bases all the all the what would be
called the cholinergic bases right now there's obviously many famous forms of choline like dmae
or um phosphatidylcholine or whatever that we're not using in here for various reasons and in the
specific doses you'll notice that the citicoline or the alpha gpc are lower doses than if people
were using those by themselves because we're looking at the entire choline load to not
make people over choline urgic factoring all of them uh so yes this i would say it's
101 of no tropics to look at the acetylcholine pathway and whenever someone starts to do a
racetam of some kind or a racetam like compound that's going to be a nmda modulator for acetylcholine
uptake the first kind of principle of stacking is usually have some form of choline donor
that's bound to it so something like centrophonoxine and nupep together is a very classic stack but
then as you start to add uridine and b5 and hooperzyne a you just get a more comprehensive
effect right and i know in many cases you know people will like to consume you know a neurotropic
compound like this with a fatty rich meal you know to help out with some of those choline precursors
and absorption in general you know like have it with eggs or have it you know like in my case
with a little smoothie with some coconut milk and seeds and nuts but the interesting thing and i
think kind of the unique thing about this qualia supplement is there are two bottles that you get
when you buy it you get a what's called a step one and a step two and only step two is to be taken
with food i'm curious what why'd you why'd you switch things up as far as as far as the bottling
goes and the need for step one and step two yeah it wasn't originally that way in terms of before
it was productized and we were in development but as you notice there there's a lot of ingredients
and there's significant quantity on a lot of the ingredients so there's there's a lot of total grams
so average dose being three of step one and five relatively large tablets of step two
that was just what it actually took to get the kind of effects we were looking for
and so part of the reason that we split it up it has to do with gi absorption specifically
so there's a number of compounds that actually absorb faster without food because they're not
competing for absorption site in the intestines and they're the compounds that are going to start
producing the immediate effects that people usually want to notice quickly so most of those are in
step one and step two are things that either absorb better with food or could otherwise
create nausea if not taken with food and so when the whole thing was combined you either take it all
with slower absorption on the things that are in step one and slower immediate kind of effects
or run a risk of nausea taking it all not with food and decreased absorption on something so
this was the best way that we could support absorption of the whole stack
okay got it so you take basically the the rule is on this stuff and then this is the way that
I've been using works perfectly you know I know that the dosage is very widely you guys have
dosage recommendations on your website and on the back of the bottle but I've been taking
four to five of step one when I get up in the morning and then later on with breakfast anywhere
between depending on the day's level of activity three to five of the step two with actually I
think it took four this morning because I knew I'd be talking to you and when I talked to smart
people I I need some kind of advantage to be able to keep up with with with you guys so
so yeah that's interesting the one-two combo approach the doses are obviously going to be very
different based on people's sensitivity based on their body weight based on the desired level of
effect they want to have based on if they have used other no tropics or stimulants and in the
past where they've actually you know maybe created certain kinds of dependence so there's a lot of
factors that are involved we have a ratio that is based on if it wasn't split into one and two
if it was one stack what would it be and so three of step one and five of step two represents that
ratio and kind of average dosage and people can either start there and then adjust accordingly
or if there are sensitivity concerns start on the lowest side and then progressively move up
as they feel comfortable with it and one of the reasons you might use less of step two is that
many of the coaling donors are in there and there are some people that are much more sensitive to
getting over coalingergic and so this is one of those aspects where you really want to get into
personalization some people really don't need much and we have coaling donors at all and other
people benefit from higher doses profoundly and so one of the things that we are working on and will
be developing and releasing soon are before we get to full customization based off of genetics
and clinical chemistry we are going to be doing kind of phenotype specific versions that look at
in general under or over methylating under or over coalingergic under or over catecholamine
ergic and this will provide better effects for more people but these are steps. Got it.
Got it. In a couple of the questions is this okay like if somebody competes in like a sanction
organization sport like a WADA sanctioned sport or a USADA sanctioned sport or something sanctioned
by the World Anti-Doping Association or the Olympics or something like that there's a whole
like cocktail you know a whole shotgun of stuff in here is it actually safe like is it acceptable
to take if you're competing in a sport like that? Very possibly not so for instance there's a small
dose of DHEA and I know DHEA is on the banned list for a number of organizations in sports
it's fine for other organizations in sports so this is not something that we keep an updated
list on on our website so I would say anyone who is being tested should look at what the
banned list ingredients are for them and then check to make sure this is right for them.
Again we will in the future have versions that don't have DHEA don't have caffeine but when
we were wanting to release you know an initial product that would be the most well tolerated
and effective across the largest number of people this was the best starting place so this is not
going to as far as we would have any reason to believe show up on any kind of illegal narcotics
drug testing there are no illegal narcotics but as far as anti-doping one should look into that
themselves. Yeah I actually think it's kind of sad because like DHEA is it's not an anabolic
steroid it doesn't act like an anabolic steroid it's free of side effects it doesn't produce any
of the negative side effects of an anabolic steroid and I still don't understand why WADA would
ban something like that that you find in freaking like raw butter and cod liver oil and red palm
oil and pumpkin seeds and ghee I mean it's kind of interesting that they would that they would
straight up say something like that when I know they're trying to keep people from using a cocktail
of potentially dangerous anabolic agents but to me that the DHEA part of things is a bit
silly especially when you know folks can can wander into to Walgreens and get you know enormous
amounts of DHEA just right off the shelf and I think a lot of a lot a lot of folks don't really
realize that sometimes sometimes the the Olympic anti-doping laboratories and world anti-doping
agencies and you know some of these agencies they they they paint with a really really broad
brush an annoyingly broad brush sometimes so it's kind of interesting but but uh oh go ahead
DHEA is the precursor in terms of the endogenous steroid pathways anabolic steroid pathways
the precursor to most of the androgens testosterone and other androgens and so
I don't know what their process in coming up with including DHEA was but if it was simply just
saying this is part of the you know conversion pathway to testosterone you know you can see how
they would come up with it but yeah I agree especially in terms of dose dependence we see
various degrees of adrenal fatigue so commonly and there is this uh pregnenolone steel preferential
shunting of the precursor to both cortisol and DHEA the hormone pregnenolone moving to
cortisol whenever there is a chronic ongoing stress which is almost everyone and so elevated
cortisol to DHEA ratio is common enough and damaging enough that some DHEA was uh included in the
stack for general HPA support yeah yeah interesting I mean I'm I'm all in favor of it as a settlement
but you know like like for me for example because I know and I know now people are like
jumping through the microphones asking you know how how I can be competing and using something
that has DHEA in it you know with good conscience the fact is um I I would never use anything that
contains a bad substance leading up to a race and in many cases you'll see that things that are banned
for in season competition are taking right before a race are not banned for things like like off season
use so there's that that consideration as well um now obviously 42 different freaking ingredients
in this stuff um so it it's it kind of returns full circle to what we talked about in the very
beginning Daniel how a big part of this is to rather than just putting caffeine in your body
or rather just putting say like modethanil in your body or rather just than just putting like you
know coleus forscoli or siltep or oxytocin or any any of these other things in your body
basically you're developing more of like a a full systems approach but one one more kind
of big picture question I have for you is it seems as though neurohacker collective your website
is kind of like poised to go above and beyond just creating some kind of like a like a super powerful
new tropic and if you were to name say like the the biggest one or two things that you have coming
down the pipeline that you think are going to kind of like flip the industry on its head when it
comes to cognitive enhancement is there anything in particular that you guys are developing in your
deep dark secret batman laboratories that you want to let people know about
yeah we're working both internally in terms of our own r&d department as well as externally where
we work with various universities and research labs that are doing things we find really interesting
to both kind of support them in their science development as well as look at synthesizing
multiple technologies together so working on many different technologies our our goal on neurohacker
is to be able to curate the cutting edge of applied neuroscience through a complex systems
framework and progressively support better personalization of that for all kinds of
psychoneuro optimization goals for people and so you know we're working on some some very
interesting things in terms of delta sleep induction right now and how to increase the
efficiency and effectiveness of delta sleep working on some very interesting things in terms of
how to prevent and reverse some of the brain processes that are involved in cognitive decline
and Alzheimer's dementia working on more scalable diagnostics where people can actually be able to
assess more different biomarkers and psychometrics less expensively more often to get much better
quantified self-data you know lots of things lots of things i would say the underlying key thing
that we're working on that we're most interested in is a complex systems AI artificial intelligence
processor that can look at all of people's biometrics and psychometrics not just in
regards to a specific reference range but all of them in relationship to each other and look at
why are these biometrics the way they are in causal relationship to other biometrics and
psychometrics what's actually causing what what are the kind of complex cascades because
you know like when you were asking about tbi earlier someone can have an event where there's some
you know mild traumatic brain injury from a car accident or whatever it doesn't show up on a
PET scan they are told they don't have brain injury because it's not structural right it's
functional right afterwards there are you know there's any number of symptoms that could occur so
say anxiety as one of the possibilities based on which neural networks are affected but someone
could also have anxiety from a gut brain axis disorder from a from a parasite or a pathogen that
affected their microbiome or from a methylation disorder or from excitotoxicity from mold or
and so there's to us there's no such thing as anxiety in a in a meaningfully treatable way
there's many different pathways that can lead into that set of over excitatory neurologic
processes and to be able to have a better set of insights of how would you do differential
diagnostics across all those things to see what is most likely to be most supportive for someone
and we're interested in the non-medical just wellness optimizing direct to consumer space
as well as the integrative medicine you know medical space and we're in in deeper phases of
some things later phases of other things but what interests us the most is not just developing
specific technologies but being able to really curate vet and synthesize the entire field
ongoingly and make that otherwise unmanageable amount of information meaningfully accessible
to people cool i like it well uh the website i will link to in the show notes just go to
ben greenfield fitness dot com slash neuro hacker if you don't know how to spell neuro then you
should probably be taking no tropics uh but it's n e u r o hacker ben greenfield fitness

what i'm including in there is a supplement you can your or a supplement a a discount that you
can use to get 15 percent off of any of these uh these new tropic compounds the the qualia stuff
that you'll find over on um over on on daniel's site and i'll also link to a few of the other
little things that we talked about like tdcs and the the intranasal light therapy and and
meditation headbands and some of that other fun stuff you can play around with um and in the
meantime daniel i want to thank you for for giving your time and coming on the show and
sharing all this incredibly interesting slash mind blowing uh slash uh neuro plasticity developing
information with us ben when i mentioned that we're seeking to not only develop technologies but
to um that curate synthesize them i see that as exactly what you do and do it through an
informational framework and you know also a curatorial framework uh in you know the whole
biohacking and optimized wellness space and uh i just have huge respect for the service you provide
