cerebrospinal magnesium levels that no other form of magnesium tested had been able to show
so when we're looking specifically at magnesium's effect for neural health magnesium three and eight
seems to be the best form of magnesium currently known for increasing cerebrospinal and brain
levels of magnesium now that doesn't mean that magnesium citrate or other forms of magnesium
won't have additional benefits we think that topical magnesium magnesium uh oil is really
beneficial because you've actually got rate limiting uh factors in terms of just gi absorption of
magnesium in any form so going through other mechanisms is good but uh this one is is very
interesting and it seems to be from everything we know so far unique and it's neurologic benefits
yeah and so minerals in general are basically to to do things like modulate you know some of the
cytoskeins and the eucosinoids that are created during neural normal neural processing and and I
know there are there are other things that they're necessary for like redox reactions and uh cellular
neural metabolism and a lot of the other things you'd need minerals for I just don't see them in
a lot of new tropic compounds and especially this form of magnesium I'm totally on board with you
I use in addition to the magnesium citrate that I mentioned like a transdermal topical magnesium
especially on sore muscles um but I think it's interesting that you guys have magnesium in this
compound as well now not not to get too too uh nitty gritty but I've got a couple of other
questions about ingredients then like a usage question for you um amino acids you you have a
whole broad spectrum of amino acids in there and I don't think it's it's much of a secret any longer
than amino acids are used as neurotransmitter precursors and so if you're low in protein low
in amino acid especially if you're vegan or vegetarian I know amino acids are crucial
but then you also have something in there called choline donors choline donors why is it that someone
want to include a choline donor when they're taking something like a blend of amino acids and
minerals and and neurotropics and things of that nature right so there's a number of different
things we're trying to affect here so neurotransmitters are one of the significant effects specifically for
uh you know the immediate effects and affecting things like ngf and bdnf for
neurogenesis are some of the longer term effects there's many different pathways we're trying to
affect one of the neurotransmitters that's very meaningfully involved in memory and
cognitive function is the acetylcholine pathway and so we have various choline donors which are
actually providing the choline that gets acetylated into acetylcholine you'll notice we also have
acetyl donors both in the acetylcarnitine and the acetyltiracine where the amino acid has its own
benefit and we're making sure that the acetyl groups aren't going to be the rate limiting
factor for acetylcholine production and then the the rest of that acetylcholine pathway
involves things like you know b5 is involved in the actual production of acetylcholine
the acetylcholine esterase inhibitors like hooperzine a make sure that the acetylcholine
and the presynaptic neuron can actually get across the synapse effectively and then the nmda
modulators so nupept in particular but there's a few other things increase the post-synaptic
neurons ability to receive and process the acetylcholine all of this is part of what we call
a comprehend acetylcholine pathway support and the various different choline donors so you've
got like citicoline and alpha gpc and centrophonoxine but also things like urodine urodine has a
number of interesting effects but one of them is that it does convert into citicoline we have this
blend because you've got various peak plasma times and you when you want a more kind of
consistent peak plasma over a longer period of time you factor that and you've also got
kind of differential delivery where both alpha gpc and citicoline are going to affect peripheral
nerves more than centrophonoxine's effect on central nervous system and so this is all part
of what we would call acetylcholine precursors and support okay got it so so it's the same reason
i mean you you hear about things like choline turnover and about how you can get excessively
fatigued if you try to get your brain to fire too quickly without replenishing it with things like
alpha gpc or with choline and all you've done is you've taken a whole bunch of different forms of
choline like the cytokoline and the centrophonoxine and the alpha gpc and put them all together in
there so you're essentially just like covering all the choline bases all the all the what would be
called the cholinergic bases right now there's obviously many famous forms of choline like dmae
or um phosphatidylcholine or whatever that we're not using in here for various reasons and in the
specific doses you'll notice that the citicoline or the alpha gpc are lower doses than if people
were using those by themselves because we're looking at the entire choline load to not
make people over choline urgic factoring all of them uh so yes this i would say it's
101 of no tropics to look at the acetylcholine pathway and whenever someone starts to do a
racetam of some kind or a racetam like compound that's going to be a nmda modulator for acetylcholine
uptake the first kind of principle of stacking is usually have some form of choline donor
that's bound to it so something like centrophonoxine and nupep together is a very classic stack but
then as you start to add uridine and b5 and hooperzyne a you just get a more comprehensive
effect right and i know in many cases you know people will like to consume you know a neurotropic
compound like this with a fatty rich meal you know to help out with some of those choline precursors
and absorption in general you know like have it with eggs or have it you know like in my case
with a little smoothie with some coconut milk and seeds and nuts but the interesting thing and i
think kind of the unique thing about this qualia supplement is there are two bottles that you get
when you buy it you get a what's called a step one and a step two and only step two is to be taken
with food i'm curious what why'd you why'd you switch things up as far as as far as the bottling
goes and the need for step one and step two yeah it wasn't originally that way in terms of before
it was productized and we were in development but as you notice there there's a lot of ingredients
and there's significant quantity on a lot of the ingredients so there's there's a lot of total grams
so average dose being three of step one and five relatively large tablets of step two
that was just what it actually took to get the kind of effects we were looking for
and so part of the reason that we split it up it has to do with gi absorption specifically
so there's a number of compounds that actually absorb faster without food because they're not
competing for absorption site in the intestines and they're the compounds that are going to start
producing the immediate effects that people usually want to notice quickly so most of those are in
step one and step two are things that either absorb better with food or could otherwise
create nausea if not taken with food and so when the whole thing was combined you either take it all
with slower absorption on the things that are in step one and slower immediate kind of effects
or run a risk of nausea taking it all not with food and decreased absorption on something so
this was the best way that we could support absorption of the whole stack
okay got it so you take basically the the rule is on this stuff and then this is the way that
I've been using works perfectly you know I know that the dosage is very widely you guys have
dosage recommendations on your website and on the back of the bottle but I've been taking
four to five of step one when I get up in the morning and then later on with breakfast anywhere
between depending on the day's level of activity three to five of the step two with actually I
think it took four this morning because I knew I'd be talking to you and when I talked to smart
people I I need some kind of advantage to be able to keep up with with with you guys so
so yeah that's interesting the one-two combo approach the doses are obviously going to be very
different based on people's sensitivity based on their body weight based on the desired level of
effect they want to have based on if they have used other no tropics or stimulants and in the
past where they've actually you know maybe created certain kinds of dependence so there's a lot of
factors that are involved we have a ratio that is based on if it wasn't split into one and two
if it was one stack what would it be and so three of step one and five of step two represents that
ratio and kind of average dosage and people can either start there and then adjust accordingly
or if there are sensitivity concerns start on the lowest side and then progressively move up
as they feel comfortable with it and one of the reasons you might use less of step two is that
many of the coaling donors are in there and there are some people that are much more sensitive to
getting over coalingergic and so this is one of those aspects where you really want to get into
personalization some people really don't need much and we have coaling donors at all and other
people benefit from higher doses profoundly and so one of the things that we are working on and will
be developing and releasing soon are before we get to full customization based off of genetics
and clinical chemistry we are going to be doing kind of phenotype specific versions that look at
in general under or over methylating under or over coalingergic under or over catecholamine
ergic and this will provide better effects for more people but these are steps. Got it.
Got it. In a couple of the questions is this okay like if somebody competes in like a sanction
organization sport like a WADA sanctioned sport or a USADA sanctioned sport or something sanctioned
by the World Anti-Doping Association or the Olympics or something like that there's a whole
like cocktail you know a whole shotgun of stuff in here is it actually safe like is it acceptable
to take if you're competing in a sport like that? Very possibly not so for instance there's a small
dose of DHEA and I know DHEA is on the banned list for a number of organizations in sports
it's fine for other organizations in sports so this is not something that we keep an updated
list on on our website so I would say anyone who is being tested should look at what the
banned list ingredients are for them and then check to make sure this is right for them.
Again we will in the future have versions that don't have DHEA don't have caffeine but when
we were wanting to release you know an initial product that would be the most well tolerated
and effective across the largest number of people this was the best starting place so this is not
going to as far as we would have any reason to believe show up on any kind of illegal narcotics
drug testing there are no illegal narcotics but as far as anti-doping one should look into that
themselves. Yeah I actually think it's kind of sad because like DHEA is it's not an anabolic
steroid it doesn't act like an anabolic steroid it's free of side effects it doesn't produce any
of the negative side effects of an anabolic steroid and I still don't understand why WADA would
ban something like that that you find in freaking like raw butter and cod liver oil and red palm
oil and pumpkin seeds and ghee I mean it's kind of interesting that they would that they would
straight up say something like that when I know they're trying to keep people from using a cocktail
of potentially dangerous anabolic agents but to me that the DHEA part of things is a bit
silly especially when you know folks can can wander into to Walgreens and get you know enormous
amounts of DHEA just right off the shelf and I think a lot of a lot a lot of folks don't really
realize that sometimes sometimes the the Olympic anti-doping laboratories and world anti-doping
agencies and you know some of these agencies they they they paint with a really really broad
brush an annoyingly broad brush sometimes so it's kind of interesting but but uh oh go ahead
DHEA is the precursor in terms of the endogenous steroid pathways anabolic steroid pathways
the precursor to most of the androgens testosterone and other androgens and so
I don't know what their process in coming up with including DHEA was but if it was simply just
saying this is part of the you know conversion pathway to testosterone you know you can see how
they would come up with it but yeah I agree especially in terms of dose dependence we see
various degrees of adrenal fatigue so commonly and there is this uh pregnenolone steel preferential
shunting of the precursor to both cortisol and DHEA the hormone pregnenolone moving to
cortisol whenever there is a chronic ongoing stress which is almost everyone and so elevated
cortisol to DHEA ratio is common enough and damaging enough that some DHEA was uh included in the
stack for general HPA support yeah yeah interesting I mean I'm I'm all in favor of it as a settlement
but you know like like for me for example because I know and I know now people are like
jumping through the microphones asking you know how how I can be competing and using something
that has DHEA in it you know with good conscience the fact is um I I would never use anything that
contains a bad substance leading up to a race and in many cases you'll see that things that are banned
for in season competition are taking right before a race are not banned for things like like off season
use so there's that that consideration as well um now obviously 42 different freaking ingredients
in this stuff um so it it's it kind of returns full circle to what we talked about in the very
beginning Daniel how a big part of this is to rather than just putting caffeine in your body
or rather just putting say like modethanil in your body or rather just than just putting like you
know coleus forscoli or siltep or oxytocin or any any of these other things in your body
basically you're developing more of like a a full systems approach but one one more kind
of big picture question I have for you is it seems as though neurohacker collective your website
is kind of like poised to go above and beyond just creating some kind of like a like a super powerful
new tropic and if you were to name say like the the biggest one or two things that you have coming
down the pipeline that you think are going to kind of like flip the industry on its head when it
comes to cognitive enhancement is there anything in particular that you guys are developing in your
deep dark secret batman laboratories that you want to let people know about
yeah we're working both internally in terms of our own r&d department as well as externally where
we work with various universities and research labs that are doing things we find really interesting
to both kind of support them in their science development as well as look at synthesizing
multiple technologies together so working on many different technologies our our goal on neurohacker
is to be able to curate the cutting edge of applied neuroscience through a complex systems
framework and progressively support better personalization of that for all kinds of
psychoneuro optimization goals for people and so you know we're working on some some very
interesting things in terms of delta sleep induction right now and how to increase the
efficiency and effectiveness of delta sleep working on some very interesting things in terms of
how to prevent and reverse some of the brain processes that are involved in cognitive decline
and Alzheimer's dementia working on more scalable diagnostics where people can actually be able to
assess more different biomarkers and psychometrics less expensively more often to get much better
quantified self-data you know lots of things lots of things i would say the underlying key thing
that we're working on that we're most interested in is a complex systems AI artificial intelligence
processor that can look at all of people's biometrics and psychometrics not just in
regards to a specific reference range but all of them in relationship to each other and look at
why are these biometrics the way they are in causal relationship to other biometrics and
psychometrics what's actually causing what what are the kind of complex cascades because
you know like when you were asking about tbi earlier someone can have an event where there's some
you know mild traumatic brain injury from a car accident or whatever it doesn't show up on a
PET scan they are told they don't have brain injury because it's not structural right it's
functional right afterwards there are you know there's any number of symptoms that could occur so
say anxiety as one of the possibilities based on which neural networks are affected but someone
could also have anxiety from a gut brain axis disorder from a from a parasite or a pathogen that
affected their microbiome or from a methylation disorder or from excitotoxicity from mold or
and so there's to us there's no such thing as anxiety in a in a meaningfully treatable way
there's many different pathways that can lead into that set of over excitatory neurologic
processes and to be able to have a better set of insights of how would you do differential
diagnostics across all those things to see what is most likely to be most supportive for someone
and we're interested in the non-medical just wellness optimizing direct to consumer space
as well as the integrative medicine you know medical space and we're in in deeper phases of
some things later phases of other things but what interests us the most is not just developing
specific technologies but being able to really curate vet and synthesize the entire field
ongoingly and make that otherwise unmanageable amount of information meaningfully accessible
to people cool i like it well uh the website i will link to in the show notes just go to
ben greenfield fitness dot com slash neuro hacker if you don't know how to spell neuro then you
should probably be taking no tropics uh but it's n e u r o hacker ben greenfield fitness
dot com slash neuro hacker and when you go there i'll link not only to daniel's website but also
what i'm including in there is a supplement you can your or a supplement a a discount that you
can use to get 15 percent off of any of these uh these new tropic compounds the the qualia stuff
that you'll find over on um over on on daniel's site and i'll also link to a few of the other
little things that we talked about like tdcs and the the intranasal light therapy and and
