assist with nervous system and with brain health, and with even like building new neurons and things
like that, but in the show notes, I'm putting the show notes over at bengreenfieldfitness.com
slash neurohacker, as in, well, just so it sounds like, neurohacker, but that's a phrase I hadn't
really heard thrown around until I heard you use it, Daniel, and I'm just curious when it comes to
this idea of neurohacking before we delve into the nitty-gritty of what, you know, kind of like a
dream new tropic would look like, what exactly is neurohacking and how do you find neurohacking?
What is it that your company does from this neurohacking standpoint?
Like I said, even though I'd been interested in the field of cognitive optimization for a long time,
one of the things that had me do a deep dive into it when I was wrestling with some of these issues
myself is that some of the symptoms I was dealing with were cognitive decline and my background
and like my whole life work being cognitively engaging things that was more debilitating than
physical issues for sure. And since I was going to have to try and study and figure out an adequate
approach since one didn't exist, obviously I couldn't do that while having cognitive decline.
So my first thing that I applied the cognitive bandwidth I had to was how do I increase cognitive
bandwidth? And so that was a deep dive into the study of cognitive nutrition, smart drugs,
natropics, et cetera. Again, applying complex systems models like, okay, so what really is
being mediated by acetylcholine, what's being mediated by catecholamines, by glutamate, by
how do these systems interface, et cetera, getting a more detailed understanding and then seeing how
to support that whole process. Now, fast forwarding years, one of the things we realized was that
people who are dealing with chronic complex disease who are going to have to do a lot of
things and that have some complication are also dealing with decreased cognitive function, decreased
energy, and some emotional difficulty that makes it hard to do what they need to. So being able
to support those areas is hugely beneficial for the rest of treating their pathology. But then,
of course, that's just relevant for everyone, right? Even at the other end of the bell curve,
people who are looking for real optimization enhancement. And so neural hacking for us is
you could almost think of it as a subset of biohacking, but also kind of a bend diagram
with it where we're looking at hacking the mind-brain interface. What things can we do
that enhance... So we're not looking so much at athletic performance, even though that can be
a positive side effect. We're looking at optimizing cognitive capability and psycho-emotional
state and predisposition. Okay, got it. So when we start to kind of delve into the actual nitty
gritty of especially like the type of nutrients that you can put into your brain, my first question
is before we focus on individual ingredients, the thing that I'm curious about because I kind of
want to know how this works. From an acute effect, obviously, when somebody takes like a handful of
pills, like a neurotropic or some powder or some tincture or extract designed to help your brain
fire better, is there an actual chronic change in brain structure? I mean, is there any evidence
out there that you can do things like build new neurons or reset your tolerance to things like
caffeine or increase the production of mitochondria or cell membranes or anything along those lines?
What can be done in the brain by putting the right nutrients into it?
Yeah, this is a really important question. When we think about smart drugs in general,
oftentimes think about pharmaceuticals that are being used for off-label purposes, like
Adderall or Ritalin or etc., we'll notice that we get immediate lift in certain metrics like
focus or concentration or something that's useful. But those lifts not only usually are not lasting,
don't produce positive long-term effects, but oftentimes are producing negative long-term effects
either because of side effects in other systems or even the system they're affecting,
they're affecting in a way that creates dependence. And the primary way to think about this is if you
have a regulatory system, like say we're looking at Adderall, you have an endogenous system that's
regulating dopamine levels and catecholamine levels. If I override that system through an
external, right, an exogenous stimulus, then I'm going to create dependence upon that exogenous
stimulus and that means down-regulation. One of our fundamental goals was how do we understand
how the body's endogenous regulatory systems work and rather than override them, work through those
pathways where we can increase system resilience and robustness where if someone got off of whatever
it was that they were taking, they would actually have lasting positives because
the underlying regulatory systems have become more robust. So that was a core goal for us and
there's a number of ways of that happening. So you've got obviously the immediate effects that
are usually going to be neurochemical, neuroendocrine kind of effects, changing people's levels of
neurotransmitters, receptor site modulation, things like that. You can affect those fairly quickly.
You've got medium-term effects which can come from things like decreasing inflammation
and affecting say the phospholipid cell membrane to have more integrity and elasticity.
And then you've got longer-term effects like the ones that you were mentioning
where you start looking at things like neurogenesis, the development of new neurons, new neural stem
cells and synaptogenesis, the development of new synapses and both of those as a category of
biogenesis, new biological structural development, increased mitochondria within cells.
These are not going to be permanent because nothing's permanent and it's a continuously
changing environment just like exercise and muscle development is not permanent but it's
lasting, meaning if you aren't then damaging those structures and you're continuing to support them,
there is lasting structural change. So I would say with a notropic or in general one of people's
goals should be how do we create short-term immediate benefit we're looking for without
creating meaningful side effects or down-regulation, how do we up-regulate the regulatory systems for
lasting benefit and how do we up-regulate structure in a way that's going to produce,
again, regulatory lasting benefit. And when you look at things like you've got the company Neural
Stem that is in late-stage clinical trials for their product, NSI-189. What's it called? Neurostem?
Neurostem. They're actually a boutique pharmaceutical company and they were originally
working doing Neurostem cell injections for spinal cord injuries and ALS and they started
figuring out some small molecules that made stem cells proliferate and their most famous one is a
product called NSI-189 and that will probably become a pharmaceutical drug but some people
have already been using it as a natropic and specifically its mechanism of action is neurogenesis,
right, developing more neural stem cells that increase gray matter density in the hippocampus
and then other areas and so it's been treating major depressive disorder.
And is this something that the people like would get prescribed by a physician or is this
like an injection into the brain or what is it? It's not something that someone would get prescribed
yet because it hasn't finished FDA clearance but it probably will. But this is an example of one that
is actually moving down that kind of pharmaceutical path but whether it would be used for say diabetic
neuropathy or anxiety or depression or Alzheimer's if you can help develop endogenously more neural
stem cells that's going to be very meaningful for lots of things. What happens to be that there are
nutrients that are involved in our body's own process of doing that that can help in that
direction and other kind of system modulators so those are all things that we factor in the
natropics that we develop. Interesting so when we're talking about like new brain stem cells
what about for people with like TBI's and you know head injuries and stuff like that I mean I've
gotten orbital fractures and TBI's and concussions like they're going out of style when you're talking
about inducing new brain stem cells or neurogenesis are you actually saying that you could potentially
like heal certain areas of the brain? Yep so when someone has a TBI mild traumatic brain injury or
severe traumatic brain injury the first thing that has to happen is to protect ongoing damage so
ongoing oxidative damage, excitotoxicity, any of the kinds of damage that can start to cascade
and whether we're talking about a head injury or a stroke or that neural protection is a first goal
and then beyond that where there has been actual damage to neural networks then we want to see
what can we do to help regenerate neural networks and you've got natropics like emoxypene also known
as mexidol that have been used pretty heavily off-label mostly for post stroke and other forms
of traumatic brain injury some of the russian peptides so cmax and cell ink and some of the
more common natropics like some of the racitams and the ampikines and newpept in particular
have been found very both neuroprotective and neurogenic and then you've got things like lion's
mane and torene and methyl B12 that are all neurogenic through normal endogenous processes
so even though the field of TBI treatment is only kind of scratching the surface of these areas I do
think in the not too distant future will combine much better scan technologies like
spec scans and better QEG along with the normal fMRI etc have a better picture of what's going on
and then have much better both protection and treatment capabilities yeah it actually is fun
to self quantify this stuff like I've been doing um I went down to Los Angeles and visited this
place called the peak brain institute and spent about a week there learning how to how to do
neurofeedback how to actually attach electrodes to my head and use this software in which you're
you're basically flying a spaceship with your brain but you are being rewarded with audio and
visual cues that encourage for example production of alpha or theta brain waves or you know that
decrease production of like fast stressful beta brain waves and it's really interesting because
I've tried this type of brain training both with and without certain new tropics you know circulating
in my system and there's a distinct difference especially in the amount of like you know up
regulated alpha or theta and decreased beta when you use a self quantification method like that
obviously you know not everybody's going to have like a whatever a $3,000 piece of a you know
electrode and laptop they can do this with but I mean you know there's even there's even phone apps
I don't know if you've played around with them much Daniel but like the cns tap test app or it was
just like test your central nervous system by letting you keep track of how quickly you can tap
in a 60 second time frame or like the uh like the n-back app on the iphone that just just allows you
to test like your your short-term memory recall and it really is interesting that you can see a
distinct difference that kind of goes above and beyond what you might get from say like a cup of
coffee with this stuff well here's a real fun concept there obviously we are starting to get
quantified self devices that are more available which is hugely beneficial because when when we
can link assessment insights with whatever we're doing you know in terms of influence then we get
much better and shorter up regulation cycles in terms of what we're doing but we've obviously
got also hardware that's becoming available so it's not 128 or 64 lead EEG but the muse is actually
pretty neat for people being able to do neural feedback on their own right and there's a few
EEG neural feedback devices that are starting to become commercially available that are good
enough that they're meaningful so these are all part of what we would call the neural hacking
movement the both assessment and then influential tools and you notice I'm not saying diagnostic
or treatment because we're we're not operating within the FDA medical space but these are all
what we call neural hacking tools that are meaningful and that we appreciate but when
you mention that you are doing neural feedback neural feedback is not only helping you learn
how to gain executive control of certain brain frequency states but the reason that that can
be lastingly beneficial is you start having certain states be more common more baseline right and
certain things that were common before say anxiety or whatever become less common less
baseline that corresponds with structural changes and so there but when you're doing
neural feedback even though you have something on your scalp it's not doing any transcranial
stem it's just reading and then you are using your own consciousness right you're using your own
mind brain system to do different things with your attention that actually leads to neuroplastic
rewiring of the brain including development of you know new neural networks and that can happen
also without EEG equipment that can happen and when someone learns how to juggle or play drums or
any new kind of coordination tasks they're actually having to develop new neural circuitry and now
when you start mentioning adding something like no tropics in think about what happens if we're
wanting someone if someone's wanting to do therapy to cure PTSD or they're wanting to do EEG
neural feedback to develop some new capabilities what if we could give them chemistry that actually
made their brain more neuroplastic first so it could change more within per unit time of doing
that therapy and then we gave them other chemistry afterwards that was long-term potentiating that
actually helped lock in that new learning that's an example of sequencing so that could look like
micro dosing psilocybin before and doing something like siltep afterwards and you get to balance that
plasticity make your synapses more susceptible to change and potentiation lock in the learning
in terms of effective synaptic formation this would be an example of thinking through something
kind of in a in a more comprehensive neurohacking way yeah that that whole field of neuroplasticity
is it's it's actually extremely interesting you know how you can strengthen or lessen existing
neuronal pathways or establish new neurons and and new connections which I know is is actually
it's called structural plasticity versus like building new pathways I think that's called synaptic
plasticity but you make a good point right like like you don't have to necessarily go out and
spend thousands of dollars on neurofeedback software you can learn a language you can you
know play the ukulele you can tackle some some difficult interesting subject like like you
know take take an online course of you to me or you know learn how to learn how to code and then
you even mention you know something interesting even even like psilocybin that's that's that's a
really interesting topic I you know I've used psilocybin here and there and I found that that
when I have used it the situations in which I've used psilocybin in moderation with responsibility
and with intention has actually resulted in the formation of intense memories that are far brighter
and more clear and more colorful than memories formed in the absence of something like psilocybin
so yeah I think this this whole idea of neuroplasticity is is very interesting and I want to actually
delve into some of the ingredients that you can put into your body to make it more neuroplastic
but also to do things like you know shut down brain inflammation or provide the brain with you
know uh neuro vitamins etc but before I ask you about that I'm curious just just for fun do you
you know I was talking about you know neurofeedback for example and you mentioned the muse headband
for meditation do you have anything that you do on a regular basis in in kind of like the tech
sector not necessarily like pills that you pop but but do you do like tdcs or electro stem or
anything along those lines to enhance your own neuroplasticity any any special bio hacks that
you use frequently yeah I wouldn't just say for neuroplasticity but for um mind brain nervous
system optimization comprehensively so right where I'm sitting like within just a reach of my seat
I've got the violite intranasal transcranial lasers and I I like that technology quite a lot
it's actually and I'm going to interrupt you super quickly because this is the million dollar
question Daniel do you have the one that that like wraps around your entire head and goes in your
nose or are you an underachiever and you just have the one that goes in your nose no no head and
nose both oh nice you have the you have the noro yes cool that thing is amazing but we have a bunch
of other uh you know fun transcranial laser technologies um so this is primarily focused
on increasing cellular ATP levels through specific frequencies of light um and obviously
transcranial transcranial intranasal for increasing ATP in neurons which are obviously very
energy intensive um and so I think that's a that's a brilliant technology there's a lot of
forms of transcranial stem transcranial direct current is interesting I'm very careful with it
transcranial alternating current is interesting transcranial magnetic deep stem and we've even
got friends who are at the pioneering edge of transcranial ultrasound at the University of Arizona
Stuart Hammerhoff's lab and a number of other places that are pioneering work with transcranial
ultrasound to reverse uh beta amyloid and telphosphorylation involved with Alzheimer's so
there are some of those technologies that I use regularly that are here and there are other ones
that uh I've went and used very specifically for specific conditions um or that wouldn't be
appropriate for me because I don't have the things that they're needed but we use them with other
people that they are appropriate with right right used appropriately they're really amazing you
know for example that that uh vi-light device I was speaking with a really intelligent neurosurgeon uh
and uh a guy I've had in the podcast a few times named Dr Jack Cruz and we were talking about the
use of of things like you know intranasal light therapy and the use of like that head
band that that neuro headband and you know one of the ideas behind that and its stimulation
of the uh the uh the cytochrome c-oxidase I believe is is the specific area that stimulates is it
it creates a little bit of free radical production and so some of this stuff you know it's not like
you're you're hooked up to it 24-7 it's like that device you're supposed to use about once every two
