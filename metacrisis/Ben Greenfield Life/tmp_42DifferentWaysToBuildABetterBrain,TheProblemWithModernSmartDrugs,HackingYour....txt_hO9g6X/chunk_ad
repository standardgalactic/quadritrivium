of the positive side effects that we're like well that makes sense and it's cool and particularly
limiting procrastination on things that uh you know people found dreadful and odious and now they
had just much more emotional neutrality and focus etc in them and so there's been a very interesting
process to both hypothesize what things we would expect to be affected and then see
what actually shows up and obviously it's going to depend on the particular notropic
and the person so um say we're looking at something like anoracetam versus phenyl
paracetam they're both going to have increased memory verbal fluency through their effect on
acetylcholine in the nmda complex but anoracetam is going to have more anxiety decreasing
anxiolytic effects and phenyl paracetam is going to have more psychosimilatory effects
based on their effect on other receptor sites so you know it depends who designed A for instance
the acetylcholine esterase inhibition in it can cause lucid dreams and so a lot of people will
take that on their own or take you know something like qualian notice that they start having a lot
more vivid and lucid dreams that some of the i would say positive side effects that we were most
interested by is people feeling less emotional upset less what they would call
drama emotional upset that really is not helpful or warranted without feeling numb so they actually
feel more capable more available to positive experiences and negative feelings like you
know sadness around authentic things but not being upset unnecessarily by stories they're
generating because they're actually thinking more clearly and so much of our emotional process is
not the result of what's happening it's the result of us not thinking through multiple
different people's perspectives and generating negative meaning and as someone simply able to
think more quickly and more clearly then they don't get poor thinking generating unnecessary
emotional drama and so i would say that's probably one of the most fun experiences people have
reported yeah and i should know by the way when it comes to like vivid dreaming and lucid dreaming
i don't recommend at least i personally wouldn't take this stuff in the afternoon because i found
that it really produces a very intense wakefulness effect what i have found is that later on in the
day after it you know you would think it's out of your system i still get a very intense amount of
lucid dreaming and vivid dreaming on the days that i use this stuff so you don't you don't have to
take it right before bed you know for example i know like a alpha brain for example is a popular
neurotropic out there that if you if you take it before bed it can cause some pretty intense lucid
dreaming but this stuff seems to cause it even if you take it in the morning yeah many of the
compounds are gonna you know last in the bloodstream for a meaningful amount of time and or
they're going to affect some processes that last for a meaningful amount of time so this particular
acetylcholine esterase inhibition has a meaningful half-life on it yeah interesting okay so so
you've got new tropic compounds you know like like the like the um the hordinin that we talked about
and the serostilbine bound of the caffeine and the vinpo sapetine and the hooper zinae but then you
also have these things you call neuro vitamins and what's the difference between a neuro vitamin
and a neurotropic yeah so like we're saying earlier neuro vitamin basically we're just talking about
vitamins that have some effect in the nervous system either in converting amino acids into
neurotransmitters so specifically b6 and b6 in the phosphorylated version paradoxal 5-phosphate
and vitamin c are both critical for converting phenylalanine and tyrosine into dopamine converting
tryptophan into serotonin and so these are as per the definition of vitamin these are things that
one has to get dietarily the body can't synthesize them and they serve some kind of cofactor role in
in some kind of process right some protein or chemical synthesis so we've got vitamin d having
so many important roles throughout the whole body but particularly for the brain things like
myelin synthesis and we have a particular version of b1 called a benva timing which has a
very meaningful neuro protective function specifically in peripheral neurons and a
version of niacin which is another b vitamin niacinamide which helps with blood flow and
cerebral perfusion but specifically nad production and b5's role in acetylcholine and adrenal hormone
production etc so these are all vitamins in particular forms and doses that are oftentimes
the limiting factor in some of the key processes that we're seeking to support okay gotcha so
so a lot of like the vitamin b compounds and in specific forms that i know are designed
for their their neural protective effects or their anti-inflammatory effects for neural tissue
or cognitive impairment but in addition to the vitamin b complex i know as you've got the vitamin
d complex in there but it's not just vitamin d it's vitamin d in a form called micro encapsulated
colocalciferol what is that so colocalciferol just means vitamin d3 that's the scientific name
for vitamin d3 and micro encapsulated micro encapsulation is a process in which you have
some kind of chemical payload that is put in some kind of encapsulation that's designed to only
break down or release at some target so maybe it's trying to get through stomach acid like an
enteric micro encapsulation and release in the intestines or you know move through a particular
ph or whatever so it's a delivery mech mechanism and because vitamin d is a fat soluble vitamin
oftentimes it'll be actually in a fat base but because we're these these for manufacturing
reasons these particular capsules are powdered then we need to be able to take the d3 and and
stabilize it and make sure that it would deliver effectively so the micro encapsulation is usually
something like alginate in particular extract from algae or cellulose that's simply going to help
better absorption and delivery of that nutrient so it essentially helps to take a vitamin that would
mostly be fat soluble and allows it to be somewhat water soluble in this particular case yes okay
interesting all right so so you've got your your new tropics and you've got your neuro vitamins
and then you also have something in there like a class of compounds called neuro anti-inflammatories
and antioxidants obviously it's not rocket science to know what would an anti-inflammatory or an
antioxidant would do in the brain and and some of them they're a relatively familiar again like
kerosetin for example which i know has some really cool neuro protective effects and curcumin
which i've talked about quite a bit on the show before in terms of its its anti-inflammatory
effects especially for neural tissue and in dha and green tea extract and even bioperine or black
pepper extract which which i know can help with the absorption and utilization of curcumin there's
one in there also though called bio pqq um what is bio pqq yeah so pqq is a active version of
coq10 and so it has a number of important effects as a krebs cycle intermediary and support and atp
production and you can use coq10 you can use ubiquanol or you can use pqq they're progressively
more potent for certain processes so we're using pqq and bio pqq is simply a patented
brand that has had good clinical trials done on it so in general if there are companies that have
made a nutraceutical and have patented a process on it that has strong clinical trials already done
we will use that so that we know we have you know quality control and can reference the clinical
trials and you know that were done specifically and so pqq does a number of interesting things
it's involved in recycling glutathione it affects some growth factors uh it like a
nerve growth factor synthesis but the primary reason that we're using it does have anti-inflammatory
effects and cytokine modulation primary reason is atp support okay got it so you've got that in
there for specifically for atp support i know for example like uh um that's that's the same
stuff that's in the uh is it called the upgraded upgraded anti-aging formula that that bulletproof
makes a pqq i think that's the one that is it's either upgraded anti-aging or their upgraded aging
formula is oxaloacetate okay that's right then the unfair advantage which is the bio unfair
advantage that's right unfair advantage called bio pqq and speaking of which like i've talked
about this before i mean some of these names you know and and i love you know i love the products
that bulletproof makes i'm a huge fan of their stuff i use their their brain octane and i use
their their chocolate powder and their bars and all sorts of stuff um but also you know when you
look at at words right like catchy phrases like unfair advantage or i mean heck even the the god
pill phrase that i threw around earlier there's definitely an eyebrow that gets raised in the
scientific community with stuff like this with with claims like that so i'm curious um in terms of
like clinical research behind some of these ingredients that specifically like combining
all these greens into into a cocktail like you guys are doing at neurohacker collective
is there actual clinical research behind this stuff yeah great i want to go up for one moment
and describe the process of why we brought these particular compounds together in these
doses rather than other things and is it simply a you know throw in everything but the kitchen sink
because you mentioned a kind of trans reductionist whole systems approach the first thing we did when
we were looking at uh development of a notropic like this because we were doing specific notropic
chemistry with people in integrative medical clinical settings where we had their genetics
and we had a huge amount of blood chemistry on them and could customize things like if they
were under or over methylators and which methylation gene mutations they had and
you know etc this obviously a very different process we wanted to see could we could we provide some
aspect of that kind of benefit at scale that is a formula and there were some things that were
so specific like the way we would address the folate cycle many other examples that we just
really couldn't work with those axes without custom customized input but we found really
happily to kind of our surprise that there were many things that we could work with where the
people who kind of self-selected being interested in something like cognitive enhancement we had a
very high percentage of people that reported and on different performative tests responded very well
and so that's what this is but what we how we started was saying when people are seeking
cognitive enhancement what are they really seeking they they probably don't care about
arithmetic processing or digit span by themselves they care about a whole complex of cognitive
and psychomotional things that come together that lead to a certain set of experiential states
and capabilities so it's like how do we induce creative productive flow states neurochemically
much more effectively and so it involves focus and concentration and task switching and fluid
intelligence and various aspects of memory memory IO and long-term memory short-term memory digit span
etc along with things like drive and emotional resilience without creating irritability and
anxiousness and etc so we're looking at that whole complex of what side effects are often created by
some smart drugs or not tropics when people are pursuing some of the effects and what's additional
effects are actually needed for a synergy of being able to do really meaningful work and
feel optimized in the process and so we started with that kind of cognitive modeling and we looked
at for each of those psychomotional cognitive states or capabilities how they map to underlying
physiology what's known about which neurotransmitters which hormones which underlying aspects of
neural structure etc are are associated and this was from any various field of integrative medicine
or neuroscience etc so we started to model out the physiologic processes that mediate those
capabilities and then started to look at which chemicals affect those physiologic dynamics and
then start to explore synergies between them and etc so we developed a a notropic database of
about 500 chemicals that affected the pathways we were looking at and so when we narrowed it down to
42 in here obviously we're including a lot of things we're also not including a lot of things
we're including very specific dose ratios forms and so most of the ingredients have clinical trials
showing the specific things they do and then we have a specific kind of process of hypothesis
generation of how we are seeking to affect positive synergies and then we've done about
three years of you know preclinical data where we don't have where we haven't had formal placebo
control etc and we're just moving into doing clinical trials right now we have a partner in
the Neurobiology Department at Stanford that's helping with it and a number of other great science
partners outside of Neurohacker as well as the team inside of Neurohacker and so we're just
engaging on our clinical trials we're also developing an online assessment app that can assess
various cognitive capabilities like you're mentioning there's a few apps that do but again
we're going for comprehensivity and that can assess psychostructural and psycho kind of emotional
states so that people will be able to use that app to test how this is working but also that
they could test anything they could take other no tropics they could start meditating exercising
and just really be able to have a available resource for tracking psychocognitive effects
better right right so it's basically like like a whole bunch of ingredients that have pretty good
robust empirical bases for support and you know various degrees of laboratory and clinical research
supporting their safety and their efficacy but in terms of like putting all this together I mean to
to be frank it sounds like it's still you know you haven't actually taken this and put it through
like you know double blind peer reviewed research quite yet you're just kind of going off of each
of the individual as ingredients yeah we're like I said we're in the beginning of doing that but we
haven't got all the results back yet but it'll be soon our first pilot trial will come back soon
what we did in the you know in the preclinical phase was we had several hundred people for
a few years going through the trials where they again this was not properly blinded but they
were using quantified mind or Cambridge's online cognitive assessment or various cognitive assessments
like that as well as structured subjective reporting and so we did get input on and specific
data on what was changing and in what percentage of people and that was enough to develop it to
kind of the place that we have and now moving into a formal clinical process okay got it cool
well and I can speak from an n equals one experience that it seems to work quite well for me
and I suppose anyone else could try it as well oh and by the way again I'll mention the show notes
just so you guys know that I've got a fat discount on this stuff over in the show notes just go to
bengreenfieldfitness.com slash neurohacker that's bengreenfieldfitness.com slash neurohacker
oh go ahead because you just said n equals one this is one of the interesting things when you
ask about clinical trials a clinical trial says does this particular chemical compound process
therapy do something across some randomized database more than the placebo does it's a it's a
meaningful test but obviously some people are on one end of the bell curve effect and some people
are on the other end and there's a whole bunch of variables as to why that are just statistically
averaged into that bell curve and when we're trying to do personalized medicine where we would or
personalized optimization where we would do something different for you than we would for
anybody else then clinical trials are not and they're still an important part of the overarching
process but they're not adequate for n equals one optimization and so qualia is our first
product to go to market but more personalized versions of it moving towards full personalization
and then not just qualia but many different kinds of neuro technologies coming together
our goal is moving towards being able to do appropriate synthesis of all the biometrics
and psychometrics that someone has to gain better insights into what's going on in their system and
personalized optimization recommendation which is an underlying AI problem and so that's really
what neurohacker collective is all about is how do we synthesize the entire space right vet first
and then synthesize the space of everything that's actually meaningful to be able to affect people's
cognitive psychomotional mind-brain interactions and then based on the have about what's actually
going on for them personalized those recommendations got it cool i like it i'm all about mini testing
as you go through the stuff and again like if you've got access to to some of those neurofeedback
software the muse headband or you know in back training or cns tap test or anything like that
it's fun to play with this stuff in that vein as well um neural minerals you have neural minerals
in there as well like lithium orate and magnesium three and eight and zinc picolin eight um one of
the things i wanted to ask you about daniel because i use magnesium you know i've used it in the past
for you know helping with sleep before bed or helping to have a nice smooth bowel movement the next
morning you've got a form of magnesium called magnesium three and eight in there and most
mostly what i've used has been magnesium citrate uh why have you used magnesium three and eight as
your primary form of of a mineral and then kind of a bigger picture question why minerals in general
as as an inclusion in this compound yeah so magnesium three and eight is magnesium bound to
three anine and just like magnesium citrate is bound to citric acid there's many different forms
that you can bind magnesium to that will either have better or worse absorption overall or more
specific absorption targeting some of the many different things that magnesium and this would
be true for any mineral and so uh magteen which is the first kind of patented version of magnesium
three and eight had very interesting and very unique trials showing increased brain levels of
magnesium specifically cerebrospinal fluid levels of magnesium that were tested in terms of double
blind placebo control um and actually for this since we weren't testing subjective effects
they were testing uh specifically cerebrospinal fluid levels in placebo didn't matter that much
but can testing it against other forms of magnesium and found uh increased elevation of
