all we have is master but we still have this calc divide
branch on our remote repository so to delete a branch from the remote
repository then it's this syntax here we can do
a git push origin which is the name of our remote repository
dash dash delete then the branch so if we run that
and then we rerun git branch dash a you can see that all we have is our local
master branch and our remote master branch
okay and i know that that was a lot to take in especially if you're new to
something like git but it's really not that bad once you
get the hang of it and this becomes part of your daily routine
now really quick i'm going to run through a faster example here
because i know that that seemed like a very long process but
if i'm not talking through step by step then you'll see
how fast it is to actually make these changes with this
workflow so for example run the master branch here
and say i wanted to work on the subtract function so i can do
git branch subtract and then git check out
subtract so now i'm working on the subtract branch i can come in here
make the changes we want to return x minus y
save that do it get status over here we've modified that
we need want to add that to our staging directory
now we want to commit those changes and you want the commit messages to be
more detailed than that but this is just an example
and then we can do a git push u origin subtract
so now we've pushed that branch to our remote repository
and let's say that all those tests ran well so now we're ready to merge this
with master we can check out our master branch
and now we can do a git pull because we want to pull in all the changes that
have been made so now we pulled in all the changes
now we can do a git merge of the subtract branch this will merge
subtract with master and now
we can push those changes and then you can go through the process of deleting
that branch just like we looked at earlier
but you can see how that process isn't actually
as slow as it was with me going through and step by step explaining it
along the way so that was a broad overview of using the git command line
on local and remote repositories i know that was a lot to take in for one
video but i really hope it was useful for you guys
if you do have any questions just ask in the comment section below
now there's a lot that we didn't get to in this video and i'm going to make
additional videos soon on other topics like if you run
into merge conflicts if you need to undo your mistakes
some other common pitfalls tagging versions in git
and also advanced topics like your git history
rebasing cherry picking and things like that
so be sure to subscribe to the channel to make sure that you catch those later
videos and again i hope this video was useful for
you all and thank you for watching
