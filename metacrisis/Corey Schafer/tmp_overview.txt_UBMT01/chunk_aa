1. **Creating a New Branch**: To work on new features or fixes, you create a new branch using `git branch <branch-name>` and then switch to that branch with `git checkout <branch-name>`.

2. **Making Changes**: In the newly created branch, you make the necessary changes to your code, add files using `git add`, and commit those changes with a meaningful commit message using `git commit -m "<commit-message>"`.

3. **Pushing Changes**: Once you've made and committed your changes locally, you push them to the remote repository with `git push origin <branch-name>`.

4. **Testing and Merging**: After pushing, you test your changes to ensure they work as expected. If all tests pass, you merge those changes back into the master branch using `git merge <feature-branch>` from the master branch.

5. **Pulling Latest Changes**: Before merging, it's often a good idea to pull the latest changes from the remote master branch into your local master branch with `git pull origin master`.

6. **Resolving Merge Conflicts**: If there are conflicts between the feature branch and master during the merge, you resolve these conflicts before the merge can be completed.

7. **Deleting a Branch**: After merging your feature into master and ensuring it's been tested, you delete the feature branch both locally with `git branch -d <branch-name>` and on the remote repository with `git push origin --delete <branch-name>`.

8. **Tidying Up**: Ensure that all changes have been successfully merged into master and that there are no more references to the deleted branch in your codebase before moving forward.

9. **Continuous Workflow**: This process is repeated for each feature or bug fix, with branches being created, pushed, pulled, merged, tested, and then deleted in a consistent workflow to maintain a clean and organized repository history.

10. **Future Topics**: There are more advanced topics like handling merge conflicts, undoing changes, tagging versions, and managing your git history with rebasing, cherry picking, etc., which will be covered in upcoming videos.

Remember to always communicate with your team when working with shared repositories, especially when merging, resolving conflicts, or deleting branches, to avoid overwriting work or causing issues for others.
