Checking Go Wild/Termites - The Inner Sanctum - Go Wild.txt
 Joe and Reinhardt, two scientists, have been working on a project to study termites in their natural habitat in Kenya. Their goal is to observe the behavior of termites, particularly the queen termite, within her chamber. Due to the delicate nature of their work, they must handle the termites carefully to avoid triggering the colony's defensive mechanisms.

The scientists have set up an artificial environment that mimics the termites' natural conditions, including a queen, her king, and various workers and brood. They have installed pheromone trails to guide the workers back to the queen after she is placed in an isolated chamber for observation.

After several attempts over many years, Joe and Reinhardt manage to successfully isolate three queens from their colonies and place them in separate chambers to see how they would behave without their natural nest. They are particularly interested in the behavior of the queen when removed from her colony, as this is a complex and less understood aspect of termite society.

The scientists face the challenge of ensuring that the queens are not stressed or attacked by soldier termites. They carefully transport the queens and their entourages back to their nest within an artificial chamber, hoping that the termites will adapt to the new environment and continue their natural behaviors, such as feeding, egg laying, and tending to the brood.

The project is a success as the queens and their workers seem to adjust to the new setup, with the queen continuing to produce eggs at a high rate. This research has implications for understanding termite behavior and could potentially lead to better methods of controlling termite infestations in human habitats. The scientists emphasize the importance of observing and respecting these creatures, as they play a crucial role in ecosystems and can be both a nuisance and a threat if their behaviors are not understood.
