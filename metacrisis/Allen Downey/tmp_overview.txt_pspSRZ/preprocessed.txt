1. **Myths about Bayesian Statistics:**
   - The term "subjective" in Bayesian statistics simply means that prior knowledge is explicitly incorporated into the analysis, which is not unique to Bayesian methods but is a fundamental aspect of any statistical analysis. It's important to recognize that all statistical analysis has subjective elements, whether they are explicit or not.
   - Bayesian methods are not redundant; they answer different questions than frequentist methods and can be scaled up with computational techniques when dealing with complex models.
   - Bayesian methods can be slower but there are options to make them more efficient.
   - The speaker has an incentive to promote Bayesian methods, as they teach workshops on the topic and have a book titled "Think Bayes."

2. **Handling Priors:**
   - When you don't have a prior, try to quantify any background information you do have. If truly uncertain, consider a multiple model analysis that can help you understand your uncertainty about the parameters.

3. **Communicating Results:**
   - Communicate results in terms of probabilities rather than waiting for p-values, which are often misunderstood by non-statisticians.
   - Bayesian methods allow for communication in a language that people understand, such as the probability that a hypothesis is true or expected returns as functions of actions.

4. **Historical Context and Challenges:**
   - The historical resistance to Bayesian statistics may be attributed to personality clashes between major figures in statistics and the perceived subjectivity of the approach.
   - The "smear campaign" against Bayesian methods might be rooted in these historical conflicts, rather than the inherent qualities of the method itself.

5. **Subjectivity in Statistics:**
   - The speaker emphasizes that all statistical analysis involves subjectivity and that Bayesian methods make this aspect explicit, which is not only acceptable but also beneficial for clarity and understanding.

6. **Resources and Further Engagement:**
   - Additional slides with readings are available, and the speaker will be at the O'Reilly booth during breaks to discuss these topics further.
   - The speaker's book "Think Bayes" and associated resources provide a practical introduction to Bayesian statistics.
