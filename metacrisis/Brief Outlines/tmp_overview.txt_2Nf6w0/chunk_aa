 The passage reflects on the nature of perception and the difference between collective representations (things that can be shared and agreed upon by multiple people) and individual perceptions (like hallucinations or dreams). It uses the examples of a rainbow and a tree to illustrate this concept.

The rainbow is an example of something that exists as a collective representation: it requires both light from the sun, water droplets, and an observer's vision to come into being. The existence of a rainbow is dependent on these conditions being met, and if you were to walk towards where the rainbow appears to end, it would disappear, proving that it is not an independent entity but a result of the interaction between light, water, and perception.

Similarly, a tree is a collective representation because it can be observed by multiple people through various senses—sight, sound, touch, etc.—and it persists independently of any one person's observation. However, even the tree, as we understand it, is ultimately composed of particles at a fundamental level, which themselves are representations or models based on our scientific understanding.

The author argues that the familiar world around us, which includes not just physical objects but also sensory experiences and phenomena like weather and social interactions, is a system of collective representations. This perspective contrasts with the view that might emerge from a purely physicist's standpoint, which deals with unrepresented particles and models at a deeper level.

The passage emphasizes that one must choose whether to accept the world as a system of shared perceptions or to consider the theories of physics (which often deal with unobservable entities) as a delusion. It concludes by acknowledging the importance of accepting one of these viewpoints, as it fundamentally shapes our understanding of reality.
