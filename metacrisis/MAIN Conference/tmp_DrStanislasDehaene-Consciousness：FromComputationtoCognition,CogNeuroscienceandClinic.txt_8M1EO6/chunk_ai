It doesn't come from the external world,
but it comes from the hippocampus being able to replay
and eventually ignite an entire assembly
in a prefrontal cortex and related areas.
So once again, this is not a localist theory.
I think because it is a global workspace,
it needs a distributed system.
And I don't like the idea of reducing it
to just prefrontal cortex.
I think it's very likely
that the hippocampus plays an important role.
Now we know that if you have a lesion in the hippocampus,
you can still be conscious.
Again, this points to the idea
that this is a distributed system.
It's not one node that will knock it off,
but still dynamically these nodes
tend to come up together when they're activated.
Great.
Thank you so much, Stan,
for all these enlightening answers to these questions
and to the wonderful talk once again.
We could go on forever with these questions.
There are many more popping up,
but in the interest of time,
and because we have the panel
to be able to continue the discussion,
I think we will move on.
So thanks once again.
So please, everybody, join me in thanking Stan and Stan
for this amazing keynote lecture at May 2020.
And we will be closing this session
in a few, maybe in about a minute or so,
before we switch on to the next one,
which is going to be the panel discussion.
And just one note,
because we are many people meeting,
we cannot have the panel discussion,
at least from the speaker's perspective,
in Crowdcast.
You all stay on Crowdcast,
but we will be moving to Zoom
and will be re-broadcast through Crowdcast.
So you don't have to worry about anything.
Just the speakers,
this is a reminder to the speakers joining the panel.
You now need to close your Crowdcast window
and switch to the Zooming that we sent you.
But for everybody else,
just stick around.
Everything is going to continue happening
on Crowdcast.
Fingers crossed, everything goes well.
I hope.
So thank you once again.
And one last comment that I'd like to make,
this is out there for the students,
newcomers of the field,
and people who have heard a lot
about consciousness this morning
and who might not have the background
and find it interesting,
or who have some background
but would like to know more.
I would just like to point out
there's going to be an introductory lecture
tomorrow morning,
because tomorrow is our introductory courses lectures
of May 2020.
And there's one tomorrow,
which is going to be given by
Stephanie,
so Professor Stephanie Blain-Morais
from McGill,
who's been working on consciousness
for quite a while
and has a strong expertise in field.
So she will be giving a talk on the introduction
to the basics of studying consciousness
with neuroscience.
So the neuroscientific approaches
to the study of consciousness
and introduction.
That's going to be actually the opening lecture
tomorrow morning at 8 or 8.20.
I think it's 8.20 tomorrow morning.
So make sure you don't miss that.
And so that's all I wanted to tell you right now.
We'll be closing this session
and meeting up again
in a couple of minutes
for the panel discussion.
And just to let you know,
the panel discussion is going to be when we start it.
You will see there will be some questions
that will be sent in the poll.
So down at the bottom,
you'll see appearing a button
where you can press
and we've prepared a couple of questions
because we want to ask you,
make this more interactive.
So there'll be two or three slightly provocative
or confusing questions about consciousness.
So as soon as you see those questions,
the poll appear,
please answer those questions
and we'll have a look at your answers.
Thanks once again
and thank you to all the speakers.
