so um
um
yes yes
yes
we don't think it's like a useful tool or do we see stuff which is maybe not there because our
brain is starting to interpret so that's a that's a very good question our brain does do a lot of
filling in and that you know again there are there are priors about the natural world that are also
instantiated in our computational system that that lead us to lots of illusions the lucary motion
and which you know sort of gives us a cue about about what priors are you know kind of implicitly
sitting there in our brain now you mentioned you mentioned morphogenesis that's interesting
because we are taking some of these video analysis techniques from lots of different fields because
what we want to be able to do is track track objects and have motion trajectories that are
naturalistic and then show those like I just show you a dot moving and I ask I give you sort of a
Turing test for natural motion was this a marker that was on a real object or did I
did I construct it and we'd like to be able to reproduce those kinds of trajectories it works
for a fair number of our movies so I think that if we stick to simple scenarios we can we can ask
these detailed questions but once you get into the kind of cognitive level the cognitive processing
of what do you see next it gets it gets trickier to to tease that apart one final thing I'll tell
you is that there are some evidence that that some illusions that we get are because of the early
processing in the retina that it's not something we have under volitional control at all that
that some of the ways that the retina filters information give us give us illusions
that's it's a very strange thought that we really don't have control about what we sense
you explained that this minimization function can be interpreted in two ways
yes either retaining as much information as possible or having the best compression as possible
and we showed that the brain seems to retain as much information as possible we also see results
so that's a good point so let me just be clear for each beta these problems are equivalent
so what I showed you what you can you can interpret it in the same way so the two
points on that plane on the on the bound curve which I want that
so beta beta is changing as I go along here and this is not allowed this is the information
about the future this is the information about the past for some given amount of past compression
this is telling me how much I can possibly have about the future the other way to say it is that
if I have some amount of the future what's the you know what's the maximal amount of compression
I can do so your question is about the magnitude of the values we see here how much compression is
the retina doing so far we've only been able to answer that question for small groups of cells
because sampling 2 to the n possible output space is very large what we what we do see is that the
retina does throw a lot away at small neuron levels now if you looked at you know 100 100 200
cells that are really representing that whole part of visual space you can imagine that different
parts of visual space are fairly independent so what's the cold cold pool size and what's the
amount of compression that's an unanswered question it's a very interesting one
so if you can go back to the slide we had the two data sets one close to the bound one far
away from the bound I can do that so the one on the left has a much smaller variance in the
velocity and the data is far away from the bound what I'm representing here is what you're optimal
so this isn't the the the prior distribution on position velocity is the same and it's like
a circle in both of these cases and what I'm trying to represent here is is this isn't about how the
stimulus changes this is how your optimal representation of the stimulus changes so if
you think about you know some prior you know on position velocity so position velocity
okay so here's where here's where the bar stimuli live and both of them have this prior
okay so then what this is saying is that to represent the future most accurately you should
squeeze out position information squeeze out position variance and the other one you should
squeeze out velocity variance but there are still there's still the same amount of position
velocity variance in each in each stimulus so would it be feasible to conclude from these two
plots that the retinal systems are significantly better at squeezing out velocity variance than
they are position variance based on the fact that the right plus so much closer to the bound
that's the conclusion we are initially going for and our our and it's different so the this is from
the rat retina the salamander retina did optimal optimally at this one and we'd like to go back
to the salamander retina and ask it about this problem what's interesting now is we're getting
into a comparative approach where the the salamander is a sit and wait predator it's it's
it's usually when it's in its aquatic state it's sitting in a murky pond and it's waiting for some
small tasty fish or insect to to come by within striking distance and then scrapping it so it
kind of makes sense that position is the relevant variable that it's able to represent now rats
they're in a very different situation right they're running around and they're afraid of getting eaten
by predators that swoop in and and munch them right so um what we think is that perhaps if we
looked at the natural scene statistics of the ecological niche of these animals then they would
have they would have more prediction problems to solve where velocity is the relevant variable
versus position that's the conclusion we're beginning to form but it has to be tested a little bit
more completely just there you're talking about behavioral objectives yeah yeah yeah beyond making
predictions yeah so I was wondering uh sort of raises the question of um so the nice thing about
this framework is just about the statistics of the stimulus and you don't have any extra assumptions
about behavior but is it going to be enough do you think at some point we need to add extra
absolutely so the foray we're making into that um which is a very important question uh
is how how your own behavior influences your representation of the world so to to make an
inroads there we are working with the mclean group at u chicago to record eye movements while a mouse
is viewing a natural scene and then what we'd like to do is play now a movie not of the natural scene
but of the movie convolved with the eye movements you know play the eye movements on top of that
so the the whole scene moves with a way the way that the animal is looking at it while the scene
is moving and now ask about about that kind of compression because there isn't a lot of feedback
in the retina so asking how the retina has been primed to handle statistics that it imposes on
motion as in addition to the natural motion world I think is a very interesting one it's a little
step okay yep let's go have coffee and so wait we have coffee in terms of
