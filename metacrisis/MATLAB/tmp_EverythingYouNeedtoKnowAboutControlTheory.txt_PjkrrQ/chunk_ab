more about I hope you check out the links below.
And to make it easier to browse through all of them I put together a journey
at resourceium.org that organizes all of the references
in this video. Again link to that is below
as well. So this is where I'm going to leave this video.
If you don't want to miss any other future tech talk videos don't forget to
subscribe to this channel and if you want to check out my channel control
system lectures I cover more control theory topics there as well.
Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.
