but modern democracies as a whole that is thinking through and you know those followed the printing
press and the industrial revolution and saying whoa we had a change in our techno industrial
base that is actually debasing those previous principles of our social technology so what is
the new set of social capacities adequate to this I'm saying we're at a new place where we have to
actually have a step function in cultures because if our problems need fundamentally
better problem solving than we currently have and we haven't argued that yet but explicitly but
what I'll basically say is this we define problems typically in a somewhat simple to try to make a
tractable way the problem is climate change and too much CO2 the problem is systemic racism and
institutions that have these policies or whatever it is and then
so let's take the CO2 situation we can come up with a solution to that narrowly defined problem
that ends up externalizing harm to some other thing we can say okay well we can get the CO2
down by planting a whole bunch of plants and using nitrogen fertilizer that's going to sequester CO2
but the nitrogen is going to create nitrogen runoff in dead zones in the ocean faster or
we're going to do a carbon tax but only the countries that ratify it are going to do it and so
if the west does and China doesn't and so there's a slowdown in GDP in the west and not in China
and China then uses that for near term advantage geopolitically militarily then in trying to
solve climate change we ceded the 21st century to technologically empower autocracy or whatever
so the problem isn't climate change right the problem is climate change and the dead zones
in oceans and the great game of geopolitical power and its relationship to GDP and they're so
interconnected that either our current problem-solving methods that don't factor that either
solve a problem and externalize harm to another problem often that is
worse or just increasing the complexity of the problem landscape or somebody else realizes
that our solution is going to cause some other problem and so they fight us and now we're stuck
in political infighting where almost all of the energy goes into just heat and we can't actually
implement large-scale solutions if we can't coordinate on them and so how can we find what it
is that everybody cares about and how the different problems connect adequately to be able to come up
with propositions that have the least unnecessary theory of trade-offs are the best synergistic
satisfies that people can coordinate towards I would say that is a that is the minimum set of
problem-solving adequate to the problem-solving landscape that we are coming into I like this
distinction you make between physical tech and social tech and that helps me understand exactly
what the problem is as you stated I'm curious what improved social tech might look like is there
anyone doing work right now concretely that you see and you say well that's a step in the right
direction or are are you still in the stage of only being able to really envision what a solution
would be in the abstract but I'd actually like to give a couple examples of how changes in physical
tech changed social tech both of the better and the worse historically a couple times because this
is not actually an abstract idea it's an idea we have a lot of concrete understanding about so then
we're being able to apply that to the current landscape I'm going to just I'm going to give
simplified narratives of topics that the top academics debate nuances of so there's a lot
of nuance in here but I think the points are at least adequately illustrative
animal husbandry and agriculture was a massive tech shift right the agricultural revolution was
okay rather than doing hunting and gathering we can now create massive surplus of grains which
are the first really storable thing and that means that we can make it through famines we can grow
our populations we can start to get into storage and surplus so we can see that the thing that we
call civilization and the development of the plow are very closely related and there's a lot of
people that have looked at the way that that physical technology proceeded changes in the
social tech because until you had surplus you didn't have to deal with the question of who gets
the surplus and what is the governance system that that mediates this surplus until you had
enough surplus that when someone dies they could actually pass it on the all the laws
regarding inheritance didn't have to come into play the same way in a very different way than it
would have been in a tribal setting so there's lots of things that the physical tech brought
about that were different until you had a lot of surplus there wasn't that much reason to raid
in another culture because or another tribe because they didn't have much stored of value
that you could extract but also the the division of labor roughly around gender that is not absolute
but is a statistically generally accepted thing that men would do the hunting women would do more
of the gathering than women would do men would do more of the hunting women would do the horticulture
with the digging stick as soon as it went from the horticulture and the digging stick to the
agriculture in the plow men's upper body strength on the plow actually made a huge difference over
women doing the plow when women would use the plow they would miscarry and so men moved to
to providing almost all the caloric surplus women moved into the home and you started to see
changes in gender relationships associated with the change in tech and the way that the tech itself
that the idea is that the tech is not totally values neutral the tech ends up predisposing
patterns of human behavior in certain ways and so then some people argued that the rise of feminism
largely followed the internal combustion engine the kind of women's liberation movement because
then for the first time men's upper body strength didn't matter because she could drive a tractor
as well as he could drive a tractor and the tractor could out pull the plow oxen situation so much that
the first wave feminism women can do what men could do was mediated by a change in tech
so we can see those are not complete arguments or a lot of other cultural factors and things
going on but folks like Marvin Harris and cultural materialism worked on seeing and McLuhan specifically
who worked on Marvin Harris was looking at how tech in physical tech in general affects social
tech McLuhan specifically how the information and communications tech ends up affecting
society's minds values we saw obviously that the printing press gave rise to
the Lutheran revolution the idea that everybody could have their own bible and didn't need to
have they could study the scripture directly and didn't need a priest to to mediate it
but also the idea of a newspaper and democracy the idea that everybody could read what was going on
and they could all learn to read have an educational system and then they could all
come to the town hall and debate the thing that was a change in physical tech that made a new
social tech possible right could you have done democracy before there was the ability to get
everybody the news in a way right like that was not at scale you could at a tribal kind of scale
but at a larger scale if the people don't all have access to information how can they participate
and choice me so then as we were mentioning with social media and the you know the conversation
that you'd have with folks like Tristan the change to decentralize rather than kind of
one to many broadcast that both the newspaper and then the news was now the many to many
information proliferation where then there's a billion search results for anything so how do I
decide which ones to look at well whatever comes up in the first three pages of google or on the
top of my youtube search or in my facebook feed is going to be what I look at the ai's that can
comb through all those things and show me a specific subset ends up determining what I'm
going to pay attention to in the information landscape those technologies are actually businesses
those businesses have an agentic motive of their own to grow profitability they do that through ads
they do that through maximizing our time on site which improves ad revenue and our time on site is
optimized by certain types of content over others and it mostly ends up being that it's optimized
through the content that creates limbic hijacks for me emotional hijacks of some kind because if I
stay in a real rational place I usually recognize I don't want to spend that much time on facebook so
hypernormal stimuli things that are outraging things that appeal to my existing biases maximize
time on site so existing biases on all sides get increased and in group out group identity gets
increased not even because facebook wants to do that it's just the nature of the algorithm optimizing
for time on site associated with business model and that thing so that's that's an example of physical
tech now that is a democracy ruining thing because it's actually replacing people reading news where
at least you know two different people's news feed in a in a very red area in a very blue
area in the US might have not a single thing in common and the reporting on each issue is very
very slanted and then it's selecting for the ones that the people are going to pay attention to
and so can you run a democracy where there is no shared reality basis at all no now that's an
example of physical tech changing social tech in a downward oriented direction in some critical
ways that doesn't mean there aren't also upward oriented directions so then the question starts
to become if we want to we can see how the changes in physical tech made possible and even forced
changes in social process social tech historically and not just social tech but the nature of even
how I identify and the nature of you know minds things like patriarchy and religions with male
gods following the plow like these are very fundamental changes
so then what we want to start saying is what are the necessary requisites of social tech
adequate to hold exponential tech what would new types of social technologies need to be
oh this is the thread that we lost earlier if the problems need new problem solving capacities
which they do because we can't keep narrowly defined problems that are this radically interconnected
with this scope of consequence then we need new institutions and social capacities to solve them
those new institutions and social capacities are either enforced by a few people who understand
them or they have to arise from the people if they are to be emergent if they are to be commenced
through with a new type of open society the people have to understand the problem space and what is
needed for it and care about it and be willing to take a responsibility in mediating it that's a
cultural revolution or cultural renaissance or enlightenment that I would say is the necessary
thing that has to happen right now to give rise to new social institutions and problem solving
capacities adequate to the problem solving landscape we're in right now so if we take the
problems and say what would necessary solutions require what would it require well it would
require the ability to have shared sense making it require the ability to take the various values
and actually hold them together and look for propositions that could meet them all better
it would take coordinate processes that coordinate choice making well
then we can start to say well if we need social tech that does that and that also means that can
that develop humans that have the capacity to do that how could we apply the new physical
tech we have to develop people and societies in that way I've reached the end of my a lot of
time for this conversation but there's a lot more we could talk about and I'll have to have
you on again at some point to get to those things but this has been a great conversation I'd like
to point my audience in the direction of your conciliance project could you talk about that
briefly yeah thank you I'm one of the members of a new project called the conciliance project that
is working on these topics working on how do we articulate what is novel about the problem
space today clearly enough and it's not narrowly defined problems and it's not kind of gross
generalizations that don't end up giving rise to adequate solutions but how do we identify
how the problems are interconnected and what gives rise to them the kind of systemic incentives
and coordination challenges like that well enough that we can identify what would necessary criteria
of adequate solutions look like and so there starts to get to be a a whole culture that is
able to think about the problems much better and recognize the need to operate towards them take
responsibility towards them much better and start to prototype new civilizational systems new
collective coordination capacities adequate to the fact that we have fully globalized supply
chains globalized tech existential tech etc and that if we want those new capacities to emerge from
the people it has to be people understanding the issues working to develop the capacities in
themselves and working to develop the right kind of good faith relationships with others that can
prototype these capacities so conciliance project is a place where there's a publishing set of things
we're going to do in a kind of movement facilitating set of things that we aim to do the publishing
thing is there's papers that are basically explaining the fundamental aspects of social
theory that we think are necessary to consider to develop new adequate social systems and the
problem space then there's the application of that social theory to situational assessments of what's
going on in the current world where people can both understand the theory in an instantiated way
and understand the problems with deeper insights that could give rise to more adequate thinking
about solutions and then there's this kind of meta-news thing we developed which is a kind of
forensic method to be able to show where there is highly polarized belief about something
COVID viral origins or climate change or systemic racism or whatever it is how do we identify the
different views and how do we identify how those views came to be both it involves mistakes and
partiality and active kind of narrative warfare and distortion and then what would synthesizing what
we can identify as both the values and the sense making across those look like so this is
if we're going to be trying to do sense making we also have to show where the breakdowns and
sense making occur and help develop in people the capacity to notice narrative warfare information
warfare both intentional and unintentional that messes up the epistemic commons well so that they
can participate more effectively so those are the kind of publishing efforts and movement
building efforts are anyone that is seeking to improve journalism or improve public education
or fix the social media algorithms or try to take what Taiwan is doing in digital democracy and
iterate on it or apply blockchain to government accounting or whatever it is that would be part of
fundamentally new adequate social systems how do we identify the ones that are doing really good
work and and signal boost them and rather than having it just look like a journalism project
or an education project be part of a fundamentally new civilization design movement that is starting
to occur so those are roughly the things we're interested in and paying attention to
so so not the big stuff just doing some casual stuff at the conciliants project
this stuff that i think like you i just don't know how not to think about and so
you know we're we're thinking about similar issues because
i think attention and conscience mandates it absolutely all right well it's been a pleasure
