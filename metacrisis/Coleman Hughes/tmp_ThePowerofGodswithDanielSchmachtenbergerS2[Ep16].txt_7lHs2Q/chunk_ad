even when I was a kid the senators on the floor that would be arguing with each other would go
out to lunch together afterwards and that doesn't happen, it's like what happened in that time period.
Part of it has to do with the social media thing, part of it has to do with things that occurred
in broadcast media, there's a number of things. One of the arguments that many people brought
up is that it intensified after the Soviet Union collapse and the wall came down in the end of
the Cold War because the Cold War created a binding energy for the US to all be on the same
side adequately against a threatening enough external enemy and that when it came down and
China didn't look anything like it does today and Russia didn't even have Putin yet organizing
them in a more strategic way, there wasn't a big enough enemy to unify the US against itself.
The US was the number one biggest force and the number two and number three biggest force that
the left and right turned against each other as the kind of largest source of energy to extract
or predatory advantage to incur and then that has continued as China has moved into a total
different position and that's occurring in other parts of the world. So there's this question of
can people be unified at a scale much larger than tribal without an external enemy or is that innate
to us and we can see Jane Goodall's and Jimmy Carter's and Martin Luther King's and Carl Sagan's
and people that seem to have a more universal ethic and there's a question of is that conditionable
across a population widely or are those people naturally outliers for some reason will always
be outliers and they're trying to think about conditioning qualities like that more widely is
folly. Eric Weinstein and I had a conversation a couple years ago on his podcast and this was
like the heart of the thing that we talked about because he and I had a fairly similar assessment
of the catastrophic risk landscape that exponential tech under current kinds of
rival risk international governance creates and we each had a thought on how to overcome that
and they were different and he made a joke that was fun because he's like well I think your solution
requires changing human nature but I'll indulge you on that because mine requires breaking the
speed of light and his solution was no I think we are too rival risk we have to be able to have
civilizations work that have some intrinsically shared value base if they're too close to someone
else that doesn't have enough shared value base they won't care and if they will end up wanting
the other one's resource at a certain point so we need to be able to inhabit planets that are far
enough a part of the war war is unfeasible and like you can see how someone smart thinking well
about these things could be like well maybe that's the case right maybe that is actually a necessary
thing and I don't know if my sense of it is will end up being right because obviously we don't
we don't have the basis to be able to say that much certainty but I'll tell you why I think it is
one of the postmodern critiques of modernity that was right is that the idea that there is
an unbiased objective assessment of the world is is dangerous that when we're doing
because in a complex situation which things I picked to measure even if I'm measuring and
repeating measurement and getting it right and not messing that up anywhere just by cherry picking
out of the data of a very large set or even cherry picking what I do the science to measure on I can
get something that is quote unquote true but not representative and then argue as if it's
representative or decontextualize the facts or or lay cough frame the interpretation that there's a
pragmatics in addition to the kind of semantics and that we can see this more in the social
sciences where there's increased complexity with the whole early social science in the U.S. of why
why blacks were genetically lower race in the U.S. and thus the declaration of independence
didn't pertain to them and yet we weren't morally corrupt or the science of phrenology or things
like that would be like yeah that was that was just political vested interest gibberish
guising itself in something that sounded sciency and it's not anything like real objective
science well I think the answer isn't you throw out science and say that there is no way to come
to truth because if that's the case all there is is power and then we're actually stuck in that thing
we need to just correct for it so we don't say that anyone can be unbiased but we say we can
seek bias correction we can seek to be able to take all of the perspectives well not just
performatively but really seek to inhabit them and then seek to identify where there's true
signal and seek to synthesize them and so is it possible to do bias correction better toward
shared sense making that never has a hundred percent confidence but an increasingly well
epistemically grounded confidence so the reason I say this is because a lot of the social science
that we have I think is problematic in this way I think it's after the thing called empire and then
even the thing called industrial revolution and capitalism had taken over which was not the
evolutionary history of humans in mostly tribal environments and there it created a source of
conditioning but it was fairly ubiquitous conditioning and since it was ubiquitous we
just said oh this is human nature and then where we would see something like an indigenous tribe
that was different it could be thrown out as a statistical outlier so I'm actually very interested
in studying statistical outliers to something that is not innate but is ubiquitous conditioning to
say what is possible in the in human nature so specifically I'm interested in positive deviance
on the Gaussian distribution thing cultures that have a particular trait that would be desirable
more than statistically average and so looking at things like Buddhism and Jainism and more
non-violence based religions Buddhism is an interesting example of a number of people that
have fluctuated but a lot of people 10 million people over a few millennia over different languages
and different periods of time that had different economics or etc where the majority of the
population all wouldn't hurt bugs and you're like what and didn't mediate war I'm not romanticizing
that there were never exceptions but compared to most other populations it's like something
pretty novel and interesting was happening there and we can see that it's related directly to
the ideas of Buddhist religion and the nature of how they did conditioning of humans particularly
early childhood around non-violence compassion kindness empathy those types of things
and we can similarly look at areas in Liberia or Darfur other places where you have child soldiers
where you pretty much aren't going to make it to adulthood without being a murderer it's just
not a possibility and so I see that human nature makes almost everyone a murderer or almost nobody
hurts bugs both possible under the right conditioning environments I see that conditioning
people you can't not be conditioning people people are going to learn Mandarin or they're
going to learn English or they're going to learn Navajo or whatever language because innate to
sapiens and this is really important to understand the closest relatives to us right like a horse
is up and standing in 10 or 20 minutes and it takes a human a year it's like that's a really long
period of helplessness why are we embryonic or neoteness for so long and even our closest relatives
like chimpanzees they can hold on to their mom's fur while she moves around the first day and we
can't even move our head volitionally for three months and it's like okay so why are we so developmentally
dependent for so long and then why do we also have this abstract language and abstract understanding
of tool making principle that is unique well because we make tools that modify our environment so
much where most other creatures were evolved to be fit to an environment but we would then
change the environment to something we didn't evolve to be fit to we have to be able to change
ourselves pretty rapidly so I don't want to genetically be oriented to throw spears well
if throwing spears isn't adaptive anymore and being able to code or text is so I want to come in with
it not very much code some code but the capacity to imprint the new novel environment we're in
because we're migrating and changing our own environments so conditioning is a bigger deal
for humans than it is for other things it's unavoidable so then the question is and most of the
conditioning that we have studied in social science is post industrialization and all of it
that we've been able to study in the historical period was post empire which was post tribal
warfare and not the actual evolutionary environment of humans long term and so we have to say okay well
within the conditioning environment of obligate warfare humans behave these ways is that the only
way humans could behave under any conditioning environment I think it's a very important question
when we look at the level of education and uh the yeah the level of education on the Gaussian
distribution of the Jewish population it's very different than lots of other populations in the
same country those Jews are inhabiting and it has to do with certain cultural values that affect how
they do child rearing and parenting and culture and school and so then the question of could we
develop higher rationality and a higher universal ethics and the population largely so that people
were actually seeking to understand perspectives other than their own seeking to be able to inhabit
the perspectives and the values of other people and then seeking a solution that we could actually
coordinate towards recognizing that if we just beat the other side unless we beat them completely
they don't exist on the planet anymore they don't go away they're still political actors they're
pissed off and have more enmity and they're gonna reverse engineer whatever political weapon or
economic weapon or narrative weapon or physical weapon we just use and come back so we either
bind ourselves to not just war but escalating war and arms race including cultural arms races
or we say how do we and and if under exponential tech that becomes catastrophic
which i argue it does then either we figure out how to understand each other and coordinate with
each other or we move into escalating rivalry that eventually self-terminates so then i would
say our capacity to do that is obligate so then is it possible i hope so and i think so i mean
the point you make about the importance of culture is well taken
i do worry one thing that's also true which makes it more difficult is that certain cultural memes
have advantages over others right like the you know you know there's a reason that outliers are
outliers presumably in in the case of the buddhas and the the child soldiers while both of those
are possible there must be some reason why the moderate alternative of you know neither being
so nonviolent so as to not want to kill bugs nor being so violent so as to raise your six-year-olds
as murderers there must be some reason why the moderate approach
has out-propagated the extremes in the space of possible ways to raise one's children and presumably
uh you know there's something unscalable about the extremes relative to the
cultural memes that have in fact scaled right okay yes and no the child soldier situation isn't
an extreme that's very short-sighted even in terms of rivalry it's not figuring out how to do
agriculture so the people can feed themselves well enough that they can grow their population or how
to advance their technological capacity to do warfare better long-term or whatever so it's just
not even doing group rivalry well right the nonviolent civilizations mostly made it as long
as they stayed out of the way of the more violent ones and to some degree if they figured out how
to be effective diplomats between them so they could offer some viable service but otherwise
it's actually a very interesting part of the story is that you know we have the history of those
who made it through and those who made it through usually made it through by winning at war some
kind of war um maybe economic war maybe cultural war largely kinetic war and so were there cultures
that actually provided for a higher quality of life for their people and more harmony with
their environment and just didn't make it through warfare but the warfare thing leads to
arms race meaning continuously larger warfare that once you start to get to the verticalizing
part of that curve itself self terminates and this is one of the things we can see in evolution is
that there are animals where evolution is selecting for something that is adaptive to an environment
that's about to end right it's the animal will be adaptive in the immediate term that this one
just survived better in this environment it was better able to reproduce but it's doubling down
on certain genetic capacities that if the environment changes the tiny bit it goes extinct
and so there is a certain short-sightedness and blindness to that kind of evolution
and I would say mimetically even more so than genetically and so there's a lot of things that
win in the short term meaning they are selected for that self terminate in the long term or not
even all that long term and then this becomes one of the big traps that humanity's in is if we want
to do the right long term thing but we can't get everyone to do it and anyone else does the short
term advantage thing that gives them so much advantage that they beat us in the medium term
how do we avoid that right and this is both the arms race and the tragedy of the commons
if I'm not going to over fish because I want to lead fish fisheries but the we're in shared ocean
area and anyone else over fishes I can't actually protect the fish right I can't protect the fish
population of the ocean by not fishing all I'm doing is saying the other people who don't have
the same ethic as me end up over fishing they grow their population faster and use their larger
population in war against us and so fuck it I'm actually going to try and get all the fish even
though I don't need them and I could figure out a better way and actually have to race to get it
faster than they do that trap is the thing we actually have to figure out how to overcome
and it's the same with don't really want to build AI weapons because the idea of autonomous AI
weapons is is a pretty scary bad idea we'll we'll probably all die from that but I certainly don't
want to let the other guy get them first and I can't guarantee that they aren't doing it in
some secret project so I'm not going to sign a treaty to not do it or if I sign a treaty I'm
going to assume that they're lying about it in secret so we're also going to sign it while
lying about it and everybody knows that so then we all race to build the AI weapon it is
increases the risk of existential harm to everybody and this is the
this is the great filter hypothesis on coming into exponential tech why don't we have more
encounters with advanced alien nations one one of the answers to the Fermi paradox is
when they get to this level of tech they pretty much self-extinct everywhere they their rivalry
within the planet has them used the powerful tech that would be necessary to go interplanetary
against each other before they actually get successfully interplanetary maybe that's true
maybe it's not true it's a it's a fun thought experiment I would say if we want to make it
through that great filter then we have to say how do we have the level of technological power
we're developing and be good stewards of it adequately good stewards because
if we look at any previous civilization we'd be like they did a lot of fucked up things with
the power they had in any of them could if we multiply those fucked up things by exponentially
more power is that viable what would it take for us to be to hold the power and so like I'll say it
mythopoetically and I'm not I'm not saying it literally I'm not going to train Jesus mobile
and just mythopoetically if we have the power of gods if you don't have something like the love
and wisdom and prudence of gods to guide that that power ends up leading to self-destruct and
there's a lot of myths that are you know it's kind of looking along those lines and so you
were asking will technological solutions work humans have both the capacity our abstraction
gave us the capacity for physical tech because rather than just using a sharp rock we could
like a chimp would do we could experience that one rock was sharper than the other and
understand why there's an abstract principle called sharpness and we can make something even
sharper right that abstraction of principle allowed us to not just use tools but evolve
making better tools it's also would allow to abstract language and coordination so technique
just ways of doing things abstractly understand better ways of doing things applies to physical
tech but also social tech right a market or an educational system or a culture or religion
government as a social technology of how do we have a better way of doing things together
I'm saying that the exponential tech physical physical tech that we have
mandates better social tech and that we're having more advancement in the physical tech than we are
in the social tech the previous types of social tech are inadequate to hold the power of this
physical tech but this physical tech also makes possible evolutions in social tech that
weren't possible before so it's both possible and obligate and that when the founders of the U.S.
were coming up with this system they weren't having to think about ocean dead zones and
planetary boundaries or catastrophic weapons or Facebook creating a hypernormal stimuli doubling
down on on tribalism and group bias like there's nothing in the constitution that is trying to
think about how to solve those problems there's nothing in the Scottish Enlightenment and the
theory of markets that had to deal with those problems there's nothing in Marx's critique of
it that even had those problems as things or in the Bretton Woods world it just had the first
of the exponential problems not exponential existential so what I would say is we have a
novel problem landscape and as an associate with our physical tech be but our physical tech
directed by our social tech our social tech needs to make a jump to be able to safely guide our
physical tech and the inquiry around what that is there we need something a lot like the Scottish
Enlightenment or the Enlightenment of modernity that was ended up giving rise to not just the U.S.
