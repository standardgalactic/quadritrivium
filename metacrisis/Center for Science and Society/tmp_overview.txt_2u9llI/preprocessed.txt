Checking Center for Science and Society/Prediction： How Forecasting and Prospection Shape Thought - Karl Friston.txt
1. **The Problem of Induction**: The problem of induction is a philosophical issue concerning how we justify inductive reasoning, which involves making generalizations or predictions based on a finite sample of data. Hume argued that since induction cannot be logically justified (as it relies on an infinite regress of inference), our reliance on it is a matter of habit rather than rational necessity.

2. **Bayesian Inference**: Bayesian inference provides a framework for updating the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. It allows for a coherent and principled approach to dealing with uncertainty, by using Bayes' theorem to update prior beliefs with new evidence.

3. **Active Inference and Predictive Coding**: Active inference is a process that combines predictive coding and model-based reinforcement learning to minimize free energy, which represents the expected surprise or divergence from predictions. This approach can explain perceptual behaviors such as attention and exploration.

4. **Epistemic Value of Information**: The epistemic value of information is a concept that quantifies how much a sample would reduce uncertainty about a given hypothesis. In active vision, this principle guides where an agent should direct its attention to maximize the resolution of ambiguity in the visual scene.

5. **Eye Movement Studies**: Research on eye movements has shown that humans and other animals often fixate on salient or informative areas of a visual scene. This is consistent with the active inference framework, where agents sample information to minimize uncertainty about their hypotheses.

6. **Cicatic Eye Movements**: The pattern of eye movements generated by an agent undergoing active inference can resemble cicatic eye movements, as observed in experiments by Yarbus. These movements are systematic and purposeful, reflecting the agent's attempts to resolve ambiguity and update its beliefs about the visual world.

7. **Helmholtz's Insight**: Helmholtz noted that each movement we make to alter the appearance of objects should be considered an experiment designed to test our understanding of the spatial relations of those objects before us. This insight is echoed in modern theories of active vision and perceptual inference, where attention and exploration are seen as methods for refining our perception and knowledge of the world.

In summary, the talk by the speaker integrated philosophical questions about induction with contemporary scientific theories of perception, particularly focusing on how agents—be they humans or artificial intelligences—update their beliefs based on new information and how this process can be modeled using Bayesian inference and predictive coding. The speaker used the example of eye movements to illustrate how these principles play out in real-world scenarios, drawing a parallel between the agent's actions and cicatic eye movements observed in experiments. The talk underscored the importance of addressing uncertainty and the continuous updating of beliefs as new data is acquired.
