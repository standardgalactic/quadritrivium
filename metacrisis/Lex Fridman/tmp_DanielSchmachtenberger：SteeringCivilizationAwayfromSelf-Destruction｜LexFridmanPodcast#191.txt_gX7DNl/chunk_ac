mention which I'm learning more and more about it's not just about the uh the neurons it's also
about the immune system that's somehow helping with the computation so the entirety and the entire
body is helping with the computation so the three bananas they could buy you a lot it could buy you
a lot but on the topic of sort of the greater degrees of complexity emerging in consciousness
I think few things are as beautiful and inspiring as taking a step outside of the human brain
just looking at systems or simple rules create incredible complexity uh not create incredible
complexity emerges so one of the simplest things to do that with is uh cellular automata
and there's I don't know what it is and maybe you can speak to it we can certainly we will
certainly talk about the implications of this but there's so few things that are as awe inspiring to
me as knowing the rules of a system and not being able to predict what the heck it looks like and it
creates incredibly beautiful complexity that when zoomed out on looks like there's actual organisms
doing things that are much uh that operate on a scale much higher than the underlying mechanism
so with cellular automata that's cells that are born and die born or die and they only know about
each other's neighbors and there's simple rules that govern that interaction of birth and death
and then they create at scale organisms that look like they take up hundreds or thousands of cells
and they're moving they're moving around they're communicating they're sending signals to each other
and you forget at moment of time before you remember that the simple rules on cells is all
that it took to create that that's it's sad in that we can't come up with a simple description of that
system that generalizes the behavior of the large organisms we can only come up with
can only hope to come up with the thing the fundamental physics or the fundamental rules
of that system i suppose it's sad that we can't predict everything we know about the mathematics
of those systems it seems like we can't really in a nice way like economics tries to do to predict
how this whole thing will unroll but it's beautiful because how simple it is underneath it all
so what do you make of the emergence of complexity from simple rules what the hell is that about
yeah well we can see that something like flocking behavior the murmuration can can be computer
coded it's not a very hard set of rules to be able to see some of those really amazing types of
complexity and the whole field of complexity science and some of the sub disciplines like
stigmer g are are studying how following fairly simple responses to a pheromone signal do ant
colonies do this amazing thing where the what what you might describe as the organizational
or computational capacity of the colony is so profound relative to what each individual
ants is doing i am not um anywhere near as well versed in the cutting edge of cellular
automatas i would like unfortunately i in terms of topics that i would like to get to and haven't
like uh et's more um all forms a new kind of science i have only skimmed and read reviews of
and not read the whole thing or his newer work since um but his idea of the four basic kind of
categories of uh emergent phenomena that can come from cellular automata and that one of them is
kind of interesting and looks a lot like complexity rather than just chaos or homogeneity or um
self-termination or whatever i think this is very interesting it does not instantly make
me think that uh biology is operating on a similarly small set of rules and or that human
consciousness is i'm i'm not that reductionistly oriented and um so if you look at say santa fe
institute one of the co-founders stewart kaufman um his work he should you should really get him on
your show so a lot of the questions that you like one of kaufman's you know more recent books after
investigations and some of the real fundamental stuff was called reinventing the sacred and it
had to do with some of these exact questions uh in kind of non-reductionist approach but that is not
just silly hippie ism um and he was very interested in highly non-argodic systems where
you couldn't take a lot of behavior over a small period of time and predict what the behavior of
subsets over a longer period of time would do um and then going further someone who spent
some time at santa fe institute and then kind of made a whole new field that you should have on
dave snowden who some people call the father of anthro complexity or what is the complexity
unique to humans uh he says something to the effect of that modeling humans as termites really
doesn't cut it like we we we don't respond exactly identically to the same pheromone stimulus using
stigmer g like it works for flows of traffic and some very simple human behaviors but it really
doesn't work for trying to make sense of the sistine chapel and picasso and general relativity
creation and stuff like that and it's because the the termites are not doing abstraction forecasting
deep into the future and making choices now based on forecasts of the future not just adaptive
signals in the moment and evolutionary code from history that's really different right like making
choices now that can factor deep modeling of the future um and with humans our uniqueness
one to the next in terms of response to similar stimuli is much higher than it is with a termite
um one of the interesting things there is that their uniqueness is extremely low they're basically
fungible within a class right there's different classes but within a class they're basically
fungible and their system uses that very high numbers and lots of um loss right lots of death
the termite feels that way don't you think we humans are deceiving ourselves about our uniqueness
perhaps it doesn't just isn't there some sense in which this emergence just creates different
higher and higher levels of abstraction where every at every layer each organism feels unique
is that possible that we're all equally dumb but at different scales no i think uniqueness is evolving
hmm i think that hydrogen atoms are more similar to each other than cells of the same type are and
i think that cells are more similar to each other than humans are and i think that highly
k selected species are more unique than r selected species so they're different evolutionary
processes the r selected species where you have a whole a lot of death and very high birth rates
you're not looking for as much individuality within or individual possible expression to cover
the evolutionary search space within an individual you're looking at it more in terms of a numbers
game um so yeah i would say there's probably more difference between one orca and the next
than there is between one cape buffalo and the next given that it would be interesting to get
your thoughts about mimetic theory where we're imitating each other
in the context of this idea of uniqueness how much truth is there to that how compelling is
this world view to you of gerardian mimetic theory of desire where maybe you can explain it from
your perspective but it seems like imitating each other is the fundamental property of the
behavior of human civilization well imitation is not unique to humans right monkeys imitate
so a certain amount of learning through observing is not unique to humans humans do more of it
it's actually kind of worth speaking to this for a moment um monkeys can learn new behaviors new
we've even seen teaching an ape sign language and then the ape teaching other apes sign language
so that's a kind of mimesis right kind of learning through imitation and that needs to happen if they
need to learn or develop capacities that are not just coded by their genetics right so within the
same genome they're learning new things based on the environment and so based on someone else learn
something first and so let's pick it up uh how much a creature is the result of just its genetic
programming and how much it's learning is a very interesting question and i think this is a place
where humans really show up radically different than everything else and you can see it in the
in the neoteny how long we're basically fetal um that a the closest ancestors to us if we look at a
chimp a chimp can hold on to its mother's fur while she moves around day one and obviously we see
horses up and walking within 20 minutes the fact that it takes a human a year to be walking and it
takes a horse 20 minutes and you say how many multiples of 20 minutes go into a year like that's
a long period of helplessness that it wouldn't work for a horse right like they or anything else
and and not only could we not hold on to mom in the first day it's three months before we can move
our head volitionally um so it's like why why are we embryonic for so long basically it's like
like it's still fetal on the outside had to be because couldn't keep growing inside and actually
ever get out with big heads and narrower hips from going upright um so here's a place where
there's a coevolution of the pattern of humans specifically here are our neoteny and what that
portends to learning with our being toolmaking and environment modifying creatures which is because
we have the abstraction to make tools we change our environments more than other creatures change
their environments the next most environment modifying creature tusks is like a beaver and then
you wear an la you fly into lax and you look at the just orthogonal grid going on forever in all
directions and you know we we've recently come into the Anthropocene where the surface of the
earth is changing more from human activity than geological activity and then beavers and you're
like okay wow we're really in a class of our own in terms of environment modifying yeah um so as
soon as we started toolmaking we were able to change our environments much more radically we
could put on clothes and go to a cold place right and this is really important because
we actually went and became apex predators in every environment we functioned like apex predators
but polar bear can't leave the Arctic right and the the lion can't leave the savannah and an orca
can't leave the ocean and we went became apex predators in all those environments because of
our tool creation capacity we could become better predators than them adapted to the environment or
at least with our tools adapted to the environment so then every aspect towards any organism in any
environment were incredibly good at becoming apex predators yes and nothing else can do that kind
of thing there there is no other apex predator that you see the other apex predator is only getting
better at being a predator through evolutionary process that's super slow and that super slow
process creates co-selective process with their environment so as the predator becomes a tiny
bit faster it eats more of the slow prey the genes of the fast prey and breed and the prey becomes
faster and so there's this kind of balancing and we in because of our tool making we increased our
predatory capacity faster than anything else could increase its resilience to it as a result we
started out stripping the environment and extincting species following stone tools and going and
becoming apex predator everywhere this is why we can't keep applying apex predator theories because
we're not an apex predator we're an apex predator but we're something much more than that um like
just for an example the the top apex predator in the world in orca an orca can eat one big fish at
a time like one tuna and it'll miss most of the time or one seal and we can put a mile long drift
net out on a single boat and pull up an entire school of them right we can deplete the entire
oceans of them that's not an orca right like that's not an apex predator um and that's not even
including that we can then genetically engineer different creatures we can extinct species we can
devastate whole ecosystems we can make built worlds that have no natural things that are just
human built worlds we can build new types of natural creatures synthetic life so we are much
more like little gods than we are like apex predators now but we're still behaving as apex
predators and little gods that behave as apex predators causes a problem kind of core to my
assessment of the world so what does it mean to be a predator so a predator is uh somebody that
effectively can mine the resources from a place so for their survival or is it also just purely
like higher level objectives of violence and what is can predators be predators towards
the same each other towards the same species like are we think are we using the word predator
sort of generally which then connects to conflict and uh military conflict violent conflict
in the space of uh human species obviously we can say that plants are mining the resources of
their environment in a particular way using photosynthesis to be able to pull minerals
out of the soil and nitrogen and carbon out of the air and like that um and we can say herbivores
are being able to mine and concentrate that so I wouldn't say mining the environment is unique
to predator predator is you know uh
generally being defined as mining other animals right we don't consider herbivores predators
but um animal which requires some type of violence capacity because animals move plants don't move
so requires some capacity to overtake something that can move and try to get away
we'll go back to the juridzing then we'll come back here why are we neoteness why are we embryonic
for so long because are we did we just move from the savannah to the arctic and we need to learn
new stuff if we came genetically programmed we would not be able to do that are we throwing
spears or are we fishing or are we running an industrial supply chain or are we texting what
is the adaptive behavior horses today in the wild and horses 10 000 years ago are doing pretty
much the same stuff and so since we make tools and we evolve our tools and then change our
environment so quickly and other animals are largely the result of their environment but
we're environment modifying so rapidly we need to come without too much programming so we can
learn the environment we're in learn the language right which is uh gonna be very important learn
the tool making learn the um and so we have a very long period of relative helpless of helplessness
because we aren't coded how to behave yet because we're imprinting a lot of software on how to
behave that is useful to that particular time so our mimesis is not it's not unique to humans but
the total amount of it is really unique and this is also where the uniqueness can go up right is
because we are less just the result of the genetics and that means the kind of learning
through history that they got coded in genetics and more the result of it's almost like our hardware
selected for software right like if evolution is kind of doing these think of as a hardware
selection i have problems with computer metaphors for biology but i'll use this one here um that
we have not had hardware changes since the beginning of sapiens but our world is really
really different and that's all changes in software right changes in on the same fundamental genetic
substrate what we're doing with these brains and minds and bodies and social groups and like that
and so um now giord specifically was looking at when we watch other people talking so we
learn language you and i would have a hard time learning mandarin today or it'd take a lot of
work we'd be learning how to conjugate verbs and stuff but a baby learns it instantly without
anyone even really trying to teach it just through mimesis so it's a it's a powerful thing
they're obviously more neuroplastic than we are when they're doing that and all their
attention is allocated to that but they're also learning how to move their bodies and
they're learning all kinds of stuff through mimesis one of the things that giord says is
they're also learning what to want and they learn what to want they learn desire by watching
what other people want and so intrinsic to this people end up wanting what other people want
and if we can't have what other people have without taking it away from them then that
becomes a source of conflict so the mimesis of desire is the fundamental generator of conflict
and then the conflict energy within a group of people will build over time this is a very very
crude interpretation of the theory can we just pause on that for people who are not familiar
and for me who hasn't i'm loosely familiar but haven't internalized it but every time i think
about it's a very compelling view of the world whether it's true or not it's quite
it's like when you take everything Freud says as truth it's a very interesting way to think about
the world and in the same way thinking about the memetic theory of desire that everything we want
is imitation of other people's wants we don't have any original wants we're constantly imitating
others and so and not just others but you know others we're exposed to so there's these like
little local pockets however defined local of people like imitating each other and one that's
super empowering because then you can pick which group you can join like what what do you want to
imitate it's it's uh it's the old like you know whoever your friends are that's what your life
is gonna be like that's really powerful i mean it's depressing that we're so unoriginal but it's
also liberating in that if this holds true that we can choose our life by choosing the people we
hang out with so okay thoughts that are very compelling that seem like they're more absolute
than they actually are end up also being dangerous we want communism i'm i'm gonna discuss here where
i think we need to amend this particular theory but specifically you just said something that
everyone who's paid attention knows is true experientially which is who you're around
affects who you become and as as libertarian and self-determining and sovereign as we'd like to be
everybody i think knows that if you got put in the maximum security prison aspects of your
personality would have to adapt or you wouldn't survive there right you would become different if
you were if if you grew up in dar four versus finland you would be different with your same
genetics like just just no real question about that um and that even today if you hang out in a
place with ultramarathoners as your roommates or um all people who are obese as your roommates
the statistical likelihood of what happens to your fitness is pretty clear right like the
behavioral science of this is pretty clear so uh the whole saying we are the average of the five
people we spend the most time around i think the more self-reflective someone is and the more time
they spend by themselves in self-reflection the less this is true but it's still true so one of the
