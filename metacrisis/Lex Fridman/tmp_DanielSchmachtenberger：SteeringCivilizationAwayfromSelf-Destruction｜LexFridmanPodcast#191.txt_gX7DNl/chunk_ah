and mental illness are the highest and we also see that some of the happiest cultures are actually
some of the ones that are in materially lame environments and so there's a very interesting
question here and if i understand correctly you do cold showers and joe rogan was talking about how
he needs to do some fairly intensive kind of um struggle that is a non-comfort to actually induce
being better as a person this concept of hormesis that it's actually stressing an adaptive system
that increases its adaptive capacity and that there's something that the happiness of a system has
something to do with its adaptive capacity its overall resilience health well-being which requires
a decent bit of discomfort and yet in the in the presence of the comfort solution it's very hard to
not choose it and then as you're choosing it regularly to actually down regulate your overall
adaptive capacity and so when we start saying can we make tech where we're measuring for the things
that it produces beyond just the measure of gdp or whatever particular measures look like the
revenue generation or profit generation of my business are all the meaningful things measurable
and what are the right measures and what are the externalities of optimizing for that
measurement set what meaningful things aren't included in that measurement set that might
have their own externalities these are some of the questions we actually have to take seriously
yeah and we i think they're answerable questions right progressively better not perfect right so
so first of all let me throw out happiness and comfort out of the discussion those
seem like useless the distinction so i because i said they're useful well-being is useful but
i think i take it back i knew i proposed new metrics in this brainstorm session which is
so one is like personal growth which is intellectual growth i think we're able to
make that concrete for ourselves like you're a better person than you were a week ago or a
worse person than you were a week ago i think we can ourselves report that and and and understand
what that means it's this gray area and we try to define it but i think we humans are pretty
good at that because we have a sense an idealistic sense of the person we might be able to become
we we all dream of becoming a certain kind of person and i think we have a sense of getting
closer and not towards that person maybe this is not a great metric fine the other one is love
actually fuck if you're happy or not or you're comfortable or not how much love do you have
towards your fellow human beings i feel like if you try to optimize that and increasing that that's
going to have that's a good metric how many times a day sorry if i can make quantify how many times
a day have you thought positively of another human being just put that down as a number
and increase that number i think the process of saying okay so let's not take gdp or gdp per
capita is the metric we want to optimize for because gdp goes up during war and it goes up with
more healthcare spending from sicker people and various things that we wouldn't say correlate
to quality of life addiction drives gdp awesomely um by the way when i said growth i wasn't referring
i know i'm give i'm giving an example now of the primary metric we use and why it's not
an adequate metric and because we're exploring other ones so the idea of saying what would the
metrics for a good civilization be if i had to pick a set of metrics what would the best ones be
if i was going to optimize for those and then really try to run the thought experiment more deeply
and say okay so what happens if we optimize for that try to think through the first and second
third order effects of what happens it's positive and then also say what negative things can happen
from optimizing that what actually matters that is not included in that or in that way of defining
it because love versus number of positive thoughts per day i could just make a long list of names
and just think say positive thing about each one it's all very superficial not include animals
with the rest of life have a have a very shallow total amount of it but i'm optimizing the number
if i get some credit for the number so the and this is when i said the model of reality isn't
reality when you make a set of metrics they were going to optimize for this whatever reality is
that is not included in those metrics can be the areas where harm occurs which is why i would say
that wisdom is something like the discernment that leads to right choices beyond what metrics-based
optimization would offer yeah but another way to say that is wisdom is uh constantly expanding
an evolving set of metrics which means that there is something in you that is recognizing a new
metric that's important that isn't part of that metric set so there's a certain kind of connection
discernment awareness and this is an iterative game theory there's a girdles and completeness
theorem right which is if the system if the set of things is consistent it won't be complete so
we're going to keep adding to it which is why we were saying earlier i don't think it's not beautiful
and especially if you were just saying one of the metrics you want to optimize for at the individual
level is becoming right that we're becoming more well that's then becomes true for the civilization
and our metrics as well yeah and our definition of how to think about a meaningful life and a
meaningful civilization i can tell you what some of my favorite metrics are what's that
well love is obviously not a metric it's like you could bench yeah it's a good metric yeah i want
to optimize that across the entire population starting with infants um so in the same way that
love isn't a metric but you could make metrics that look at certain parts of it the thing i'm
about to say isn't a metric but it's a it's a consideration because i thought about this a lot
i don't think there is a metric a right one um i think that every metric by itself without this
thing we talked about of the continuous improvement becomes a paperclip maximizer i think that's why
what the idea of false idle means in terms of the model of reality not being reality then my
sacred relationship is to reality itself which also binds me to the unknown forever to the known
but also to the unknown and there's a sense of sacredness connected to the unknown that creates
an epistemic humility that is always seeking not just to optimize the thing i know but to learn new
stuff and to be open to perceive reality directly so my model never becomes sacred my model is useful
my so the model can't be the false idle correct yeah and this is why the first verse of the
Tao Te Ching is the Tao that is nameable is not the eternal Tao the naming then can become the
source of the ten thousand things that if you get too carried away with it can actually obscure you
from paying attention to reality beyond in the models it sounds a lot a lot like Stephen Wolf
from but in a different language much more poetic i can't imagine that no i'm referring i'm joking
but there's echoes of cellular automata which you can't name you can't construct a good model
cellular automata you can only watch in awe i apologize i'm distracting your train of thought
horribly and miserably making a difference by the way something robots aren't good at
and uh dealing with the uncertainty of uneven ground you've been okay so far you've been doing
wonderfully so what's your favorite metrics okay so i know you're not so i have a fascinating
so one metric and there are problems with this but one metric that i like to just as a thought
experiment to consider is because you're actually asking where i mean i know you ask your guests
about the meaning of life because ultimately when you're deciding when you're saying what is a
desirable civilization you can't answer that without answering what is a meaningful human life and
and to say what is a good civilization because it's going to be in relationship to that right um
and then you have whatever your answer is how do you know what is the what is the
epistemic basis for for postulating that um there's also a whole nother reason for asking
that question i don't i mean but that doesn't even apply to you whatsoever which is it's
interesting how few people have been asked questions like it we we we joke about these
questions is silly right it's it's funny to watch a person and if i was more of an asshole i would
really stick on that question right it's a silly question in some sense but like we haven't really
considered what it means just a more concrete version of that question is what is what is a
better world what is the kind of world we're trying to create really i think well have you
really thought okay i'll give you some kind of simple answers to that that are meaningful to me
but let me do the societal indices first because they're fun yes we should take a note of this
meaningful thing because it's important to come back to um are you reminding me to ask you about
the meaning of life noted i know let me jot that down yeah so um well because i think i stopped
tracking it like 25 open threads um okay let it all burn one index that i find very interesting is
the inverse correlation of addiction within the society the more a society produces addiction
within the people in it the less healthy i think the society is as a pretty fundamental metric
and so the more the individuals feel that there are less compulsive things
in compelling them to behave in ways that are destructive to their own values
and in so far as a civilization is conditioning and influencing the individuals within it
the inverse of addiction um oddly defined addiction what's yeah compulsive behavior that
is destructive towards things that we value
yeah i think that's a very interesting one to think about that's a really interesting one yeah
and this is then also where comfort and addiction start to get very close
and the ability to go in the other direction from addiction is the ability to be exposed
to hypernormal stimuli and not go down the path of desensitizing to other stimuli and needing
that hypernormal stimuli which does involve a kind of hormesis so i do think the civilization
of the future has to create something like ritualized discomfort and um ritualized discomfort
yeah i think that's what the sweat lodge and the vision quest and the solo journey and the
ayahuasca journey and the sundance were i think it's even a big part of what yoga asana was
is to make beings that are resilient and strong they have to overcome some things to make beings
that can control their own mind and fear they have to face some fears but we don't want to
put everybody in war or real trauma and yet we can see that the most fucked up people we know
had childhoods of a lot of trauma but some of the most incredible people we know had childhoods
of a lot of trauma whether or not they happen to make it through and overcome that or not
so how do we get the benefits of the stealing of character and the resilience and the whatever
that happened from the difficulty without traumatizing people a certain kind of ritualized
discomfort that not only has us overcome something by ourselves but overcome it together with
each other where nobody bails when it gets hard because the other people are there so it's both
a resilience of the individuals and a resilience of the bonding so i think we'll keep getting
more and more comfortable stuff but we have to also develop resilience in the presence of that
for the anti-addiction direction and the fullness of character and the trustworthiness to others
so you have to be consistently injecting discomfort into the system ritualize
i mean this sounds like uh you have to imagine sycophus happy you have to
uh imagine sycophus with this rock
optimally resilient from a metrics perspective in society so we want we want to constantly
be throwing rocks at ourselves not constantly uh you didn't have to frequently
periodically periodically and there's different levels of intensity different
period of disease now i do not think this should be imposed by states uh i think it should emerge
from cultures and i think the cultures are developing people that understand the value of
it so the people so there is both a cultural cohesion to it but there's also a voluntarism
because the people value the thing that is being developed they understand it and that's what
condition so it's conditioning it's conditioning some of these some of these values and conditioning
is a bad word because we like our idea of sovereignty but when we recognize the language
that we speak and the words that we think in and the and the patterns of thought built into
that language and the aesthetics that we like and so much is conditioned in us just based on
where we're born you can't not condition people so all you can do is take more responsibility
for what the conditioning factors are and then you have to think about this question of what is a
meaningful human life because we're unlike the other animals born into environment that they're
genetically adapted for we're building new environments that we were not adapted for and
then we're becoming affected by those so then we have to say well what kinds of environments
digital environments physical environments social environments would we want to create
that would develop the healthiest happiest most moral noble meaningful people and what are even
those sets of things that matter so you end up getting deep existential consideration at the
heart of civilization design when you start to rise how powerful we're becoming and how much
what we're building it in service towards matters before I pull it I think three threads you just
lay down is there another metric index a year and I'll tell you one more that I really like
there's a there's a number but the one the next one that comes to mind is
I have to make a very quick model
of healthy human bonding say we were in a tribal type setting my positive emotional states and your
positive emotional states would most of the time be correlated your negative emotional states in
mind and so you start laughing I start laughing you start crying my eyes might tear up and we would
call that the compassion compersion access I would this is a model I find useful so compassion is
when you're feeling something negative I feel some pain I feel some empathy something in relationship
compersion is when you do well I'm stoked for you right like I actually feel happiness right
down I like compersion yeah the fact that it's such an uncommon word in English is actually a
problem culturally um because I feel that often and I think that's a really good feeling to feel
and maximize for actually that's actually the metric I'm gonna say oh is the compassion
compersion at access is the thing I would optimize for now there is a state where my emotional
states and your emotional states are just totally decoupled and that is like sociopathy I don't want
to hurt you but I don't care if I do or for you to do well or whatever but there's a worse state
and it's extremely common which is where they're inversely coupled where my positive emotions
correspond to your negative ones and vice versa and that is the I would call it the jealousy
sadism access the jealousy access is when you're doing really well I feel something bad I feel
taken away from less than upset envious whatever and that's so common but I think of it as kind of
a low-grade psychopathology that we've just normalized the idea that I'm actually upset at
the happiness or fulfillment or success of another is like a profoundly fucked up thing
no we shouldn't shame it and repress it so it gets worse we should study it where does it come
from and it comes from our own insecurities and stuff and but then the next part that everybody
knows is really fucked up is just on the same axis it's the same inverted which is so the jealousy
or the envy is the I feel badly when you're doing well the sadism side is I actually feel good when
you lose or when you're in pain I feel some happiness that's associated and you can see when
someone feels jealous sometimes they feel jealous with a partner and then they feel they want that
partner to get it revenge comes up or something so sadism is really like jealousy is one step on
the path to sadism from the healthy compassion conversion access so I would like to see a
society that is inversely that is conditioning sadism and jealousy inversely right the lower
that amount and the more the compassion conversion and if I had to summarize that very simply I'd
say it would optimize for compersion which is because notice that's not just saying love
for you where I might be self-sacrificing and miserable and I love people but I kill myself
which I don't think anybody thinks a great idea or happiness where I might be sociopathically
happy where I'm causing problems all over the place or even sadistically happy but it's a coupling
right that I'm actually feeling happiness in relationship to yours and even in causal relationship
where I my own agentic desire to get happier wants to support you too that's actually speaking of
another pickup line that's quite honestly what I this is a guy who's single this is going to come
out very ridiculous because it's like oh yeah where's your girlfriend bro but
that's what I look for in a relationship because it's like it's so much it's so it's such an amazing
life where you actually get joy from another person's success and they get joy from your success
and then it becomes like you don't actually need to succeed much for that to have a like a
a loop like a cycle of just like happiness that just increases like exponentially it's weird
so like just be just enjoying the the happiness of others this success of others so this this is
like the let's call this because the first person that drilled this into my head is Rogan Joe Rogan
he was the embodiment of that because I saw somebody who is successful rich and non-stop
true I mean you could tell when somebody's full of shit and somebody's not really genuinely
enjoying the success of his friends that that was weird to me that was interesting and I mean the way
you're kind of speaking to it the reason Joe stood out to me is I guess I haven't witnessed
genuine expression of that often in this culture I've just real joy for others I mean part of
that has to do with there hasn't been many channels where you can watch or listen to people
being their authentic selves so I'm sure there's a bunch of people who live life with compersion
