you're saying like technology has a responsibility here but some is better than others i'm saying
that people's use of technology will change their behavior so it has behavioral dispositions built
in the change of the behavior will also change the values in the society it's very complicated
it will also as a result both make people who have different kinds of predispositions with
regard to rulership and different kinds of new capacities and so we have to think about these
things it's kind of well understood that the printing press and then in early industrialism
ended feudalism and created kind of nation states so one thing i would say as a long trend
that we can look at is that whenever there is a step function a major leap in technology physical
technology the the underlying techno industrial base with which we do stuff it ends up coding for
it ends up predisposing a whole bunch of human behavioral patterns that the previous social
system what had not emerged to try to solve and so it usually ends up breaking the previous social
systems the way the plow broke the tribal system the way that the industrial revolution broke the
feudal system and then new social systems have to emerge that can deal with that the new powers the
new dispositions whatever with that tech obviously the nuke broke nation state governance being
adequate and said we can't ever have that again so then it created this in international governance
apparatus world so i guess what i'm saying is that the solution is not exponential tech following
the current path of what the market incentivizes exponential tech to do market being a previous
social tech i would say that exponential tech if we look at different types of social tech so let's
just briefly look at that democracy tried to do the emergent order thing right at least that's
the story and which is and this is why if you look at this important part to build first it's
kind of doing it it's just doing it poorly you're saying i mean that's it is emergent order in some
sense i mean that's the hope of democracy versus other forms of government correct i mean i i said
at least the story because obviously it didn't do it for women and slaves early on it doesn't do it
for all classes equally etc but the the idea of democracy is that is participatory governance
and so you notice that the modern democracies emerged out of the european enlightenment and
specifically because the idea that a lot of people some huge number not a tribal number a huge number
of anonymous people who don't know each other are not bonded to each other who believe different
things who grew up in different ways can all work together to make collective decisions well
that affect everybody and where some of them will make compromises and the thing that matters to
them for what matters to other strangers that's actually wild like it's a wild idea that that
would even be possible and it was kind of the result of this high enlightenment idea that we
could all do the philosophy of science and we could all do the hegelian dialectic those ideas
had emerged right and it was that we we could all so our choice making because we said a society is
trying to coordinate choice making the emergent order is the order of our of the choices that
we're making not just at the level of the individuals but what groups of individuals
corporations nation states whatever do um our choices are based on our choice making is based
on our sense making and our meaning making our sense making is what do we believe is happening
in the world and what do we believe the effects of a particular thing would be our meaning
making is what do we care about right our values generation what do we care about that
we're trying to move the world in the direction of if you ultimately are trying to move the world
in a direction that is really really different than the direction i'm trying to we have very
different values we're gonna have a hard time and if you think the world is a very different world
right if you think that systemic racism is rampant everywhere and one of the worst problems
and i think it's not even a thing if you think climate change is almost existential and i think
it's not even a thing we're gonna have a really hard time coordinating and so we have to be able
to have shared sense making of can we come to understand just what is happening together
and then can we do shared values generation okay maybe i'm emphasizing a particular value
more than you but i can see how i can take your perspective and i can see how the thing that you
value is worth valuing and i can see how it's affected by this thing so can we take all the
values and try to come up with a proposition that benefits all of them better than the proposition
i created just to benefit these ones that harms the ones that you care about which is why you're
opposing my proposition yeah we don't even try in the process of crafting a proposition currently
to see and this is the reason that the proposition when we vote on it gets half the vote almost all
the time it almost never gets 90% of the votes is because it benefits some things and harms other
things we can say all theory of trade-offs but we didn't even try to say could we see what everybody
cares about and see if there is a better solution so how do we fix that try i i wonder is it is it
as simple as the social technology education well no it's that the proposition crafting and
refinement process has to be key to a democracy or part of the government and it's not currently
but it's the isn't that the humans creating that situation so one way there's two ways to fix that
one is to fix the individual humans which is the education early in life
and the second is to create somehow systems that yeah it's both so i understand the education part
but creating systems that's why that's why i mentioned the technologies is creating
yes social networks essentially yes that's actually necessary okay so let's go to the first part and
then we'll come to the second part so democracy emerged as an enlightenment era idea that we
could all do a dialectic and come to understand what other people valued and so that we could
actually come up with a cooperative solution rather than just fuck you we're gonna get our
thing in war right and that we could sense make together we could all apply the philosophy of
science and you weren't gonna stick to your guns on what the speed of sound is if we measured it
and we found out what it was and there's a unifying element to the objectivity in that way
and so this is why i believe jefferson said if you could give me a perfect newspaper and a
broken government or in paraphrasing or broken government perfect newspaper i wouldn't hesitate
to take the perfect newspaper because if the people understand what's going on they can make
build a new government if they don't understand what's going on they can't possibly make good
choices and um washington i'm paraphrasing again first president said the number one aim of the
federal government should be the comprehensive education of every citizen in the science of
government science of government was the term of art think about what that means right science of
government would be game theory coordination theory history it wouldn't call game theory yet
history sociology economics right all the things that lead to how we understand human coordination
i think it's so profound that he didn't say the number one aim of the federal government is rule
of law and he didn't say it's protecting the border from enemies because if the number one
aim was to protect the border from enemies it could do that as military dictatorship
quite effectively and if the goal was rule of law it could do it as a dictatorship as a police
state and so if the number one goal is anything other than the comprehensive education of all
the citizens in the science of government it won't stay democracy long you can see so both
education and the fourth estate the fourth estate being the so education can i make sense of the
world am i trained to make sense of the world the fourth estate is what's actually going on currently
the news do i have good unbiased information about it those are both considered prerequisite
institutions for democracy to even be a possibility and then at the scale it was initially suggested
here the town hall was the key phenomena where there wasn't a special interest group crafted a
proposition and the first thing i ever saw was the proposition to know anything about it and i
got a vote yes or no it was in the town hall we all got to talk about it and the proposition could
get crafted in real time through the conversation which is why there was that founding father's
statement that that voting is the death of democracy voting fundamentally is polarizing the
population in some kind of sublimated war but the and we'll do that as the last step but what we
want to do first is to say how does the thing that you care about that seems damaged by this
proposition how could that turn into a solution to make this proposition better where this proposition
still tends to the thing it's trying to tend to and tends to that better can we work on this together
and that in a town hall we could have that as the scale increased we lost the ability to do that
now as you mentioned the internet could change that the fact that we had representatives that
had to ride a horse from one town hall to the other one to see what the colony would do that we
stopped having this kind of developmental um propositional development process when the town
hall ended the fact that we have not used the internet to recreate this is somewhere between
insane and aligned with class interests i would push back to say that the internet has those things
it just has a lot of other things i feel like the internet has places where that encouraged
synthesis of competing ideas and sense making which is what we're talking about is just that it's
also flooded with a bunch of other systems that perhaps are out competing it under current incentives
perhaps has to do with capitalism in the market is the linux is awesome right and wikipedia and
places where you have and they have problems but places where you have open source sharing of
information vetting of information towards collective building is that building something like
like how much has that affected our court systems or our policing systems or our military systems
first of all i think a lot but not not enough i i think that's something i told you offline yesterday
is uh perhaps there's a whole nother discussion but i i don't think we're quite quantifying the
impact on the world the positive impact of wikipedia you said the policing that i mean i just i just
think the amount of empathy that what could like knowledge i think can't help but lead to empathy
just knowing okay just knowing okay i'll i'll give you some pieces of information
knowing how many people died in various awards that already that delta when you have millions
of people have that knowledge it's like it's a little like slap in the face like oh like
my boyfriend or girlfriend breaking up with me is not such a big deal when millions of people
were tortured you know like just a little bit and when a lot of people know that because of wikipedia
or the effect their second order effect of wikipedia which is it's not that necessarily
people read wikipedia it's like youtubers who don't really know stuff that well will thoroughly
read a wikipedia article and create a compelling video describing that wikipedia article that then
millions of people watch and they understand that holy shit a lot of there was such first of all
there was such a thing as world war two and world war one okay like they can at least like learn about
it they can learn about this was like recent they can learn about slavery they can learn about all
kinds of injustices in the world and that i think has a lot of effects to our to the way
whether you're a police officer a lawyer a judge in the jury or just a regular
civilian citizen the way you approach the every other communication you engage in
even if the system of that communication is very much flawed so i think there's a huge
positive effect on wikipedia that's my case for wikipedia so you should donate to wikipedia
i'm a huge fan but there's very few systems like it which is sad to me so i think it's it would be a
useful exercise for any listener of the show to really try to run the dialectical synthesis process
with regard to a topic like this and take the techno concern perspective with regard to
information tech that folks like tristan harris take and say what are all of the things that
are getting worse and what and are any of them following an exponential curve and how much
worse how quickly could that be and then and do that fully without mitigating it then take
the techno optimist perspective and see what things are getting better in a way that curse well
or diamondus or someone might do and try to take that perspective fully and say are some of those
things exponential what what could that portend and then try to hold all that at the same time
and i think there are ways in which depending upon the metrics we're looking at things are getting
worse on exponential curves and better on exponential curves for different metrics at the
same time which which i hold is the destabilization of previous system and either an emergence to a
better system or collapse to a lower order are both possible and so i want my optimism not to be
about my assessment i want my assessment to be just as fucking clear as it can be i want my
optimism to be what inspires the solution process on that clear assessment so i never i never want
to apply optimism in the sense making right i want to just try to be clear if anything i want to make
sure that the challenges are really well understood but that's in service of an optimism that
there are good potentials even if i don't know what they are that are worth seeking right there's
kind of a there is a some sense of optimism that's required to even try to innovate really hard
problems but then i want to take my pessimism and red team my own optimism to see is that solution
not going to work does it have second order effects and then not get not get upset by that
because i then come back to how to make it better so that just a relationship between optimism and
pessimism and the dialectic of how they how they can work so when i of course we can say that wikipedia
is a pretty awesome example of a thing we can look at the places where it has limits or has failed
where um on a celebrity topic or corporate interest topic you can pay wikipedia editors to
edit more frequently and various things like that but you can also see where there's a lot of
information that was kind of decentralized created that is good information that is more easily
accessible to people than everybody buying their own encyclopedia britannica or walking down to the
library and that can be updated in real time faster and i think you're very right that the
business model is a big difference because wikipedia is not a for-profit corporation it is a
it's tending to the information commons and it doesn't have an agenda other than tending to
the information commons and i think the two master's issue is a tricky one when i'm trying to optimize
for very different kinds of things um where i have to sacrifice one for the other and i can't
find synergistic satisfies which one and if i have a fiduciary responsibility to shareholder
uh profit maximization and you know what what does that end up creating
i think the ad model that silicon valley took um i think jaren laney or i don't know if you've
had him on the show but he has interesting assessment of the nature of the ad model um silicon
valley wanting to support capitalism and entrepreneurs to make things but uh also the
belief that information should be free and also the network dynamics where the more people you
got on you got increased value per user per capita as more people got on so you didn't want to do
anything to slow the rate of adoption um some places actually you know pay pal paying people
money to join the network because the uh value of the network would be there'd be a metcalflike
dynamic proportional to the square of the total number of users so um the ad model made sense of
how do we make it free but also be a business get everybody on but not really thinking about
what it would mean to and this is now the whole idea that if you aren't paying for the product
you are the product um if the if they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholder
maximize profit their customer is the advertiser the user who it's being built for is to do behavioral
mod for them for advertisers that's a whole different thing than that same type of tech
could have been if applied with a different business model or a different purpose um
i think there's because facebook and google and other information and communication platforms
end up harvesting data about user behavior that allows them to model who the people are
in a way that gives them more sometimes specific information and behavioral information than
even a therapist or a doctor or a lawyer or a priest might have in a different setting they
basically are accessing privileged information there should be a fiduciary responsibility
and in normal fiduciary law if there's this principal agent thing if you are a
uh principal and i'm an agent on your behalf i don't have a game-theoretic relationship with
you right if you're sharing something with me and i'm the priest or i'm the therapist i'm never
going to use that information to try to sell you a used car or whatever the thing is but facebook is
gathering massive amounts of privileged information and using it to modify people's behavior for a
behavior that they didn't sign up for wanting the behavior but what the corporation did so i think
this is an example of the physical tech evolving in the context of the previous social tech
where it's being shaped in particular ways and here unlike Wikipedia that evolved for the
information commons this evolved for fulfilling particular agentic purpose most people when
they're on facebook think it's just a tool that they're using they don't realize it's an agent
right it is a corporation with a profit motive and and as i'm interacting with it it has a
goal for me different than my goal for myself and i might want to be on for a short period of time
its goal is maximize time on site and so there's a rivalry that is take but where there should be
a fiduciary contract i think that's actually a huge deal and i think if we said could we apply
facebook like technology to develop people's citizenry capacity right to develop their personal
health and well-being and habits as well as their cognitive understanding the complexity
