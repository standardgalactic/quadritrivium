best things someone can do to become more self-determined is be self-determined about the
environments they want to put themselves in because to the degree that there is some self-determination
and some determination by the environment don't be fighting an environment that is predisposing
you in bad directions try to put yourself in an environment that is predisposing the things
that you want in turn try to affect the environment in ways to predispose positive things for those
around you or perhaps also to there's probably interesting ways to play with this you could
probably put yourself like form connections that have this perfect tension in all directions to
where you're actually free to decide whatever the heck you want because the set of wants
within your circle of interactions is so conflicting that you're free to choose whichever
one so if there's enough tension as opposed to everybody aligned like a flock of birds
yeah i mean you definitely want that all of the dialectics would be balanced
so if you have someone who is extremely oriented to self-empowerment and someone who is extremely
oriented to kind of empathy and compassion both the dialectic of those is better than either of
them on their own if you have both of them inhabiting being inhabited better than you by
the same person spending time around that person will probably do well for you i think the thing
you just mentioned is super important when it comes to cognitive schools which is
i think one of the fastest things people can do to improve their learning and they're not just
cognitive learning but their meaningful problem solving communication and civic capacity capacity
to participate as a citizen with other people and making the world better is to be seeking
dialectical synthesis all the time and so in the hegelian sense if you have a thesis
you have an antithesis so maybe we have libertarianism on one side and marxist kind
of communism on the other side and one is arguing that the individual is the unit of choice and so
we want to increase the freedom and support of individual choice because as they make more
agentic choices it'll produce a better hole for everybody the other side saying well the
individuals are conditioned by their environment who would choose to be born into darfur rather
than finland so we actually need to collectively make environments that are good because that the
environment conditions the individuals so you have a thesis and an antithesis and then hegel's
ideas you have a synthesis which is a kind of higher order truth that understands how those
relate in a way that neither of them do and so it is actually at a higher order of complexity
so the first part would be can i steal man each of these can i argue each one well enough
that the proponents of it are like totally you got that and not just argue it rhetorically but
can i inhabit it where i can try to see and feel the world the way someone seeing and feeling the
world that way would because once i do then i don't want to screw those people because there's
truth in it right and i'm not going to go back to war with them i'm going to go to finding solutions
it could actually work at a higher order if i don't go to a higher order then there's war
and but then the higher order thing would be well it seems like the individual does affect
the commons and the collective and other people it also seems like the collective conditions
individuals at least statistically and i can cherry pick out the one guy who got out of the ghetto
and pulled himself up by his bootstraps but i can also say statistically that most people born
into the ghetto show up differently than most people born into the hamptons and so unless you
want to argue that and have you take your child from the hamptons and put them in the ghetto then
like come on be realistic about this thing so how do we make we don't want social systems that make
weak dependent individuals right the welfare argument but we also don't want no social system
that supports individuals to do better we want we don't want individuals where their self-expression
and agency fucks the environment and everybody else and employs slave labor and whatever so can
we make it to where individuals are creating holes that are better for conditioning other
individuals can we make it to where we have holes that are conditioning increased agency and sovereignty
right that would be the synthesis so the thing that i'm coming to here is if people have that as
a frame and sometimes it's not just thesis nante thesis it's like eight different views right
can i steal man each view this is not just can i take the perspective but am i seeking them am i
actively trying to inhabit other people's perspective then can i really try to essentialize
it and argue the the best points of it both the sense making about reality and the values
why these values actually matter then just like i want to seek those perspectives then i want to
seek is there a higher order set of understandings that could fulfill the values of and synthesize
the sense making of all of them simultaneously maybe i won't get it but i want to be seeking it
and i want to be seeking progressively better ones so this is perspective seeking driving
perspective taking and then seeking synthesis i think that that one cognitive disposition might
be the most helpful thing would you put a title dialectic synthesis on that process because that
seems to be such a part so like this rigorous empathy like like it's not just empathy it's
empathy with rigor like you really want to understand and embody different worldviews and
then try to find a higher order synthesis okay so i remember last night you told me when we first
met uh you said that you looked in somebody's eyes and you felt that you had suffered in some
ways that they had suffered and so you could trust them shared pathos right creates a certain sense
of kind of shared bonding and shared intimacy so empathy is actually feeling the suffering of
somebody else and feeling the the depth of their sentience so i don't want to fuck them anymore
and i mean i hurt them i don't want to behave in a i don't want my proposition to go through
when i go and inhabit the perspective of the other people they feel that's really going to
mess them up right and so the rigorous empathy it's different than just compassion which is i
generally care like i have a generalized care but i don't know what it's like to be them i can
never know what it's like to be them perfectly and that there's a humility you have to have which is
my most rigorous attempt is still not it my most rigorous attempt mine to know what it's like to
be a woman is still not it i have no question that if i was actually a woman it would be different
than my best guesses i have no question if i was actually black it's be different than my best guesses
so there's a humility in that which keeps me listening because i don't think that i know fully
but i want to and i'm going to keep trying better to and then i want to across them and
then i want to say is there a way we can forward together and not have to be in more it has to
be something that could meet the values that everyone holds it could reconcile the partial
sense making that everyone holds and they could offer a way forward that is more agreeable than
the partial perspectives at war with each other but the so the more you succeeded this empathy
with humility the more you're carrying the burden of their of other people's pain essentially
now this goes back to the question of do i see us as one being or 7.8 billion
i think them
if i'm overwhelmed with my own pain i can't empathize that much because i don't have the bandwidth i
don't have the capacity if i don't feel like i can do something about a particular problem
in the world it's hard to feel it because it's just too devastating and so a lot of people go numb
and even go nihilistic because they just don't feel the agency so as i actually become more empowered
as an individual and have more sense of agency i also become more empowered to be more empathetic
for others and be more connected to that shared burden and want to be able to make choices on
behalf of and in and in benefit of so this way of living seems like a way of living that would
solve a lot of problems in society from a cellular automata perspective so if you have a bunch of
little like little agents behaving in this way my intuition there'll be interesting complexities
that emerge but my intuition is it will create a society that's very different and recognizably
better than the one we have today how much um like oh wait hold that question because i want
to come back to it but this brings us back to jarred which we didn't answer the conflict theory
yes because about how to get past the conflict theory yes you know the robert for us poem about
the two paths he never had enough time to return back to the other we're gonna have to do that
quite a lot we're gonna be uh living that poem over and over again but yes how how to uh let's
return back okay so the rest of the argument goes you learn to want what other people want
therefore fundamental conflict based in our desire because we want the thing that somebody else has
and then people are can they're in conflict over trying to get the same stuff power status
attention physical stuff a mate whatever it is and then the we learn the conflict by watching
and so then the conflict becomes a medic so the and you know we become on the palestinian side of
the israeli side of the communist the capitalist side or the left or right politically or whatever
it is and until eventually the conflict energy in the system builds up so much that some type of
violence is needed to get the bad guy whoever it is that we're going to blame and you know jarred
talks about why scapegoating was kind of a mechanism to minimize the amount of violence let's blame
let's blame it a a scapegoat as being more relevant than they really were but if we all
believe it then we can all kind of calm down with the conflict energy it's a really interesting
concept by the way i mean you went you beautifully summarized it but the idea that there's a scapegoat
that there's a this kind of thing naturally still conflict and then they find the other some group
that's the other that's either real artificial as the cause of the conflict well it's always
artificial because the cause of the conflict in jarred is the mimesis of desire itself and how
do we attack that how do we attack that it's our own desire so this now gets to something more like
buddha said right which was desire is the cause of suffering um jarred and buddha would kind of
agree in this way so and so but that's that explains i mean again it's a compelling description
of human history that we do tend to come up with the other and uh okay kind of i just i just had
such a funny experience with someone critiquing jarred the other day in such a elegant and
beautiful and simple way it's a a friend who's uh grew up aboriginal australian uh as a scholar of
aboriginal social technologies and he's like nah man jarred just made shit up about how tribes
worked like we come from a tribe we've got tens of thousands of years and we didn't have increasing
conflict and then scapegoat and kill someone we'd have a little bit of conflict and then we would
dance and then everybody'd be fine like we'd dance around the campfire everyone would like
kind of physically get the energy out we'd look in each other's eyes we'd have positive bonding
and then we're fine and nobody nobody no scapegoats and i think that's called the joe rogan theory of
desire which is uh he's like all all of human problems have to do with the fact that you don't
do enough hard shit in your day uh so maybe maybe just dance it because he says like doing
exercise and running on that treadmill gets gets all the demons out maybe just dance and gets all
the demons out so this is why i say we have to be careful with taking an idea that seems too
explanatory and then taking it as a given and then saying well now that we're stuck with the fact that
conflict is inexorable because human because mimetic desire and therefore how do we deal with
the inexorability of the conflict and how to sublimate violence well no the whole thing might
be actually gibberish meaning it's only true in certain conditions and other conditions it's not
true so the deeper question is under which conditions is that true under which conditions is
it not true what do those other conditions make possible and look like and in general we should
stay away from really compelling models of reality because there's something about about our brains
that these models become sticky and we can't even think outside of them so it's not that we stay away
from them it's that we know that the model of reality is never reality that's the key thing
humility again it goes back to just having the humility that you don't have a perfect model of
reality there's an the model of reality could never be reality the process of modeling is inherently
information reduction and i can never show that the unknown unknown set has been factored
it's back to the cellular automata you can't you can't put the genie back in the bottle like
when you realize it's unfortunately sadly impossible to
to create a model of cellular automata even if you know the basic rules
that predict to even any degree of accuracy what how that system will evolve which is fascinating
mathematically sorry i i think about it quite a lot it's very annoying wolfram has this rule 30
like you should be able to predict it it's so simple but you can't predict what's going to be
like there's a there's a problem he defines like try to predict some aspect of the middle
middle column of the system just anything about it what's going to happen in the future and you
can't you can't it sucks because then we can't make sense of this world you know really in a
reality in a definitive way it's always like in the striving like it we're always striving
yeah i don't think this sucks that so that's a feature not a bug
well that's assuming a designer um i would say i don't think it sucks i think it's
not only beautiful but maybe necessary for beauty the mess so you're uh so you're
you're just a great jordan pierce and you should clean up your room so you like the rooms messy
it's uh it's essential for the for beauty it's not it's not that it's okay i take i have no idea
if it was intended this way and so i'm just interpreting it a way i like the commandment
about having no false idols to me the way i interpret that is meaningful is that reality
sacred to me i have a reverence for reality but i know my best understanding of it is never complete
i know my best model of it is a model where i tried to make some kind of predictive capacity
by reducing the complexity of it to a set of stuff that i could observe and then a subset
of that stuff that i thought was the causal dynamics and then some set of you know mechanisms
that are involved and what we find is that it can be super useful like newtonian gravity can
help us do ballistic curves and all kinds of super useful stuff and then we get to the place where it
doesn't explain what's happening at the cosmological scale or at a quantum scale and at each time what
we're finding is uh we exclude itself and it also doesn't explain the reconciliation of gravity
with quantum mechanics and the other kind of fundamental laws and the so models can be useful
but they're never true with a capital t meaning they're never an actual real full they're never
a complete description of what's happening in real systems they can be a complete description
of what's happening in an artificial system that was the result of applying a model so the model
of a circuit board and the circuit board are the same thing but i would argue that the model of a
cell and the cell are not the same thing and i would say this is key to what we call complexity
versus the complicated which is a distinction davis noden made well in defining the difference
between simple complicated complex and chaotic systems but one of the definers in complex systems
is that no matter how you model the complex system it will still have some emergent behavior
not predicted by the model can you elaborate on the complex versus the complicated complicated
means we can fully explicate the phase space of all the things that it can do we can program it
all human not all for the most part human built things are complicated they don't self organize
they don't self repair they're not self evolving and we can make a blueprint for them
where sorry for human systems for human technologies human technologies sorry it's okay so so
non that are basically the application of models right right and engineering is kind of applied
science science as the modeling process and but with but humans are complex complex stuff with
biological type stuff um and sociological type stuff it more has generator functions
and even those can't be fully explicated then it has or our explication can't prove that it
has closure of what would be in the unknown unknown set where we keep finding like oh it's
just the genome oh well now it's the genome and the epigenome and then a recursive change on the
epigenome because of the proteome and then there's mitochondrial dna and then virus is affected and
fuck right so it's like we get overexcited when we think we found the thing so on facebook you
know how you can list your relationship is complicated it should actually say it's it's
complex that's the more accurate description you uh self terminating is a really interesting idea
that you talk about quite a bit first of all what is a self terminating system and i think you have
a sense correct me if i'm wrong that human civilization as it currently is is a self terminating
system why do you have that intuition combined with the definition of what's of self terminating
means okay so if we look at human societies historically human civilizations uh it's not
that hard to realize that most of the major civilizations and empires of the past don't
exist anymore so they had a life cycle they died for some reason so we don't still have any
the early egyptian empire or inka or maya or aztec or any of those right and so
they they terminated sometimes it seems like they were terminated from the outside in war
sometimes it seems like they self terminate when we look at easter island it was a self
termination um so let's go ahead and take an island situation if i have an island
and we are consuming the resources on that island faster than the resources can replicate
