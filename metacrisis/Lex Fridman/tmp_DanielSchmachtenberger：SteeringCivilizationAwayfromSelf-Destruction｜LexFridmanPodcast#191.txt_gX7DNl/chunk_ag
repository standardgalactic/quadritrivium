track give you the technology to do self-report of what makes you feel good what makes you grow as
a person of what makes you uh you know the best version of yourself the the the the rogan uh idea
of the hero of your movie and just add that little bit of information if you you have people you
have this like happiness surveys of how you feel about the last five days how would you report
your experience you can lay out the set of videos this is kind of fascinating to me i don't know if
you ever look at youtube the history of videos you've looked at it's fascinating it's very embarrassing
for me like you'll be like a lecture and then like a set of videos that i don't want anyone to know
about which is which is which will be like uh i don't know maybe like five videos in a row where
it looks like i watched the whole thing which i probably did i bought like how to cook a steak
even though or just like the best chefs in the world cooking steaks and i'm just like sitting
there watching it for no purpose whatsoever wasting away my life or like funny cat videos are like
legit that that's that's an that's always a good one and i could look back and rate which videos
made me a better person and not and i mean on a more serious note there's a bunch of conversations
podcasts or lectures i've watched which made me a better person and some of them made me a worse
person uh quite honestly not for stupid reasons like i feel dumber but because i do have a sense
that that started me on a path of um
um
of not being kind to other people for example i'll give you uh for my own and i'm sorry for
rantic but maybe there's some usefulness to this kind of exploration of self when i focus on
creating i'm programming on science i become a much deeper thinker and a kinder person to others
when i listen to too many a little bit is good but too many
podcasts or videos about how how our world is melting down or criticizing ridiculous people
the worst of the quote unquote woke for example all there's all these groups that are misbehaving
in fascinating ways because they've been corrupted by power the more i watch the more i watch criticism
of them the worse i become and i'm aware of this but i'm also aware that for some reason
it's pleasant to watch those sometimes and so for for me to be able to self report that to the youtube
algorithm to the systems around me and they ultimately try to optimize to make me the best
person the best version of myself which i personally believe would make youtube a lot more money
because i'd be much more willing to spend time i need to have been given youtube a lot more a lot
more of my money that's a that's great for business and great for humanity because it'll make me a
kinder person it'll increase the the love quotient the love metric and uh it'll make them a lot of
money i feel like everything's aligned and so you you should do that not just for youtube algorithm
but also for military strategy and for the to go to war or not because one externality you can think
of about going to war which i think we talked about offline is we often go to war with kind of
governments with that with not with the people you have to think about the kids of countries
that see a soldier and because of what they experience the interaction with the soldier
hate is born when you're like eight years old six years old you lose your dad you lose your mom
you lose a friend somebody close to you that want to really powerful externality that could be
reduced to love positive and negative is uh the hate that's born when you make decisions and that's
going to take fruition that that little seed is going to become a tree that then leads to the kind
of destruction that we talk about so but in my sense it's possible to reduce everything to
measure of how much love does this add to the world all that to say do you have ideas of how we
practically build systems that that that create a resilient society there are a lot of good things
that you shared where there's like 15 different ways that we could enter this that are all
interesting so i'm trying to see which one will probably be most useful pick the the one or two
things that are least ridiculous when you're mentioning if we could see some of the second
order effects or externalities that we aren't used to seeing specifically the one of a kid
being radicalized somewhere else which engenders enmity and them towards us which decreases our
own future security even if you don't care about the kid if you care about the kids the whole other
thing um yeah i mean i think when we saw this when jane fonda and others went to vietnam and took
photos and videos of what was happening and you got to see the pictures of the kids with napalm on
them uh that like the anti-war effort was bolstered by that in a way it couldn't have been without
that there's there's a until we can see the images you can't have a mere neuron effect in the same
way and when you can that starts to have a powerful effect i think there's a deep principle that you're
sharing there which is that if we we can have a rival risk intent where our in group whatever it is
maybe it's our political party wanting to win within the u.s maybe it's our nation state wanting to
win in a a war or an economic war over resource or whatever it is that if we don't obliterate the
other people completely they don't go away they're they're not engendered to like us more
they're they didn't become less smart so they have more enmity towards us and whatever technologies
we employed to be successful they will now reverse engineer make iterations on and come back
and so you you drive in arms race which is why you can see that the wars were over history
employing more lethal weaponry and not just the kinetic war um the information war and the narrative
war and the economic war right like it's just increased capacity in all of those fronts um
and so what seems like a win to us on the short term might actually really produce losses in
the long term and what's even in our own best interest in the long term is probably more aligned
with everyone else because we inter-affect each other and I think the thing about globalism
globalization and exponential tech and the rate at which we affect each other and the rate at which
we affect the biosphere that we're all affected by is that this this kind of proverbial spiritual
idea that we're all interconnected and need to think about that in some way that was easy for
tribes to get because everyone in the tribe so clearly saw their interconnection independence
on each other but in terms of a global level the the speed at which we are actually interconnected
the speed at which the harm happening to something in Wuhan affects the rest of the world or a new
technology developed somewhere affects the entire world or an environmental issue or whatever
is making it to where we either actually all get not as a spiritual idea just even as physics
right we all get to the interconnectedness of everything and that we either all consider that
and see how to make it through more effectively together or failures anywhere in that becoming
decreased quality of life and failures and increased risk everywhere don't you think people
are beginning to experience that at the individual level so governments are resisting it they're
trying to make us not empathize with each other feel connected but don't you think people are
beginning to feel more and more connected like isn't that exactly what the technology is enabling
like social networks we tend to criticize them but isn't there a sense which we're
experiencing you know when you watch those videos that are criticizing whether it's
the woke antifa side or the QAnon Trump supporter side does it seem like they
have increased empathy for people that are outside of their ideology camp not at all so I may be
I may be conflating my own experience of the world and that of
that of the populace I I tend to see those videos
as feeding something that's a relic of the past they figured out that drama
fuels clicks but whether I'm right or wrong I don't know but I tend to sense that that is not
that hunger for drama is not fundamental to human beings that we want to actually
that we want to understand antifa and we want to like empathize we want to take radical ideas
and be able to empathize with them and synthesize it all okay let's look at cultural outliers
in terms of violence versus compassion we can see that a lot of cultures have
relatively lower in-group violence bigger out-group violence and there's some variants in
them and variants of different times based on the scarcity or abundance of resource and other things
but you can look at say janes whose whole religion is around non-violence so much
so that they don't even hurt plants they only take fruits that fall off them and stuff
or to go to a larger population you take buddhists where for the most part with a few exceptions
for the most part across three millennia and across lots of different countries and geographies and
whatever you have 10 million people plus or minus who don't hurt bugs the whole spectrum of genetic
variants that is happening within a culture of that many people and head traumas and whatever
and nobody hurts bugs and then you look at a group where the kids grew up as child soldiers
in libiria or darfur were to make it to adulthood pretty much everybody's killed people hand to hand
and killed people who were civilian or innocent type of people and you say okay so we were very
neoteness we can be conditioned by our environment and humans can be conditioned where almost all
the humans show up in these two different bell curves it doesn't mean that the buddhists had no
violence it doesn't mean that these people had no compassion but the they're very different
Gaussian distributions and so I think one of the important things that I like to do is look at
the examples of the populations what buddhism shows regarding compassion or what
Judaism shows around education the average level of education that everybody gets because of a
culture that is really working on conditioning it or various cultures what are the positive deviants
outside of this statistical deviants to see what is actually possible and then say what are the
conditioning factors and can we condition those across a few of them simultaneously and could
we build a civilization like that becomes a very interesting question so there's this kind of real
politic idea that humans are violent large groups of humans become violent they become
irrational specifically those two things rivalrous and violent and irrational and so in order to
minimize the total amount of violence and have some good decisions they need ruled somehow and
that not getting that is some kind of naive utopianism that doesn't understand human nature
yet this gets back to like mimesis of desire as an inexorable thing I think the idea of the masses
is actually a kind of propaganda that is useful for the classes that control
um to popularize the idea that most people are too violent lazy undisciplined and irrational
to make good choices and therefore their choices should be sublimated in some kind of way I think
that if we look back at these conditioning environments we can say okay so the kids
they go to a really fancy school and have a good developmental environment like Exeter Academy
there's still a Gaussian distribution of how well they do on any particular metric
but on average they become senators and the worst ones become high-end lawyers or whatever
and then I look at an inner city school with a totally different set of things and I see a very
very differently displaced Gaussian distribution but a very different set of conditioning factors
so then I say the masses well if all those kids who were one of the parts of the masses got to
go to Exeter and have that family and whatever would they still be the masses um could we actually
condition more social virtue more civic virtue more orientation towards dialectical synthesis
more empathy more rationality widely yes would that lead to better capacity for something like
participatory governance democracy or republic or some kind of participatory governance
yes yes is it necessary for it actually yes and is it good for class interests not not really
by the way when you say class interest this is the powerful leading over the
less powerful that kind of idea anyone that benefits from asymmetries of power
or doesn't necessarily benefit from decreasing those asymmetries of power and kind of increasing
the capacity of people more widely and so when we talk about power we're talking about asymmetries
in agency influence and control you think that hunger for power is fundamental to human nature
I think we should get that straight before we talk about other stuff so like
this this this pickup line that I use at a bar off which is power crops and absolute power crops
absolutely is that true or is that just a fancy thing to say in modern society there's something
to be said have we changed as societies over time in terms of how much we crave power that there is
an impulse towards power that is innate in people and can be conditioned one way or the other yes
but you can see that Buddhist society does a very different thing with it at scale that you don't
end up seeing the emergence of the same types of sociopathic behavior and particularly then
creating sociopathic institutions and so it's like is eating the foods that were rare in our
evolutionary environment to give us more dopamine hit because they were rare and they're not anymore
salt fat sugar is there something pleasurable about those where humans have an orientation
to overeat if they can well the fact that there is that possibility doesn't mean everyone will
obligately be obese and I have obesity right like it's possible to have a particular impulse and to
be able to understand it have other ones and be able to balance them and so to say that power
dynamics are are obligate in humans and we can't do anything about it is very similar to me to saying
like we could everyone is going to be obligately obese yeah so there's some degree to which those
the control those impulses has to do with the conditioning early in life yes and the culture
that creates the environment to be able to do that and then the recursion on that okay so what
if we were to uh bear with me just asking for a friend if we were to kill all humans on earth
and then start over
is their ideas about how to build up okay we don't have to kill let's leave the humans on earth
they're fine and go to mars and start a new society is there ways to construct systems of
conditioning education of how we live with each other that would that would incentivize us properly
to not seek power not to not construct systems that are
of asymmetry of power and to create systems that are resilient to all kinds of terrorist attacks
to the all kinds of destructions I believe so so is there some inklings we get of course you
probably don't have the ant all the answers but you have insights about what that looks like I mean
is it just rigorous practice of dialectic synthesis as essentially conversations with assholes of
various flavors until they're not assholes anymore because you've become a deeply empathetic with
their experience okay so there's a lot of things that we would need to construct to come back to
this like what is the basis of rivalry what how do you bind it how does it relate to tech if you
have a culture that is doing less rivalry does it always lose in war to those who do war better and
how do you make something on the enactment of how to get there from here great great so what's
rivalry why is is rivalry bad or good is so is another word for rivalry competition
yes I think roughly yes I think bad and good are kind of silly concepts here good for some
things bad for other things for some contexts and others even that okay let me give you an example
that relates back to the facebook measuring thing you were mentioning a moment ago first
I think what you're saying is actually aligned with the right direction and what I want to get
to in a moment but it's not the devil is in the details here so I enjoy praise feeds my ego I grow
stronger so I appreciate that I will make sure to include one piece every 15 minutes as we go thank you
so it's easier to measure
there are problems with this argument but there's also utility to it so let's take it
for the utility it has first it's harder to measure happiness than it is to measure comfort
uh we can measure with technology that the shocks in a car are making the car bounce less that the
bed is um softer and you know material science and those types of things and happiness is actually
hard for philosophers to define because some people find that there's certain kinds of overcoming
suffering that are necessary for happiness there's happiness it feels more like contentment and
happiness it feels more like passion does is passion the source of all suffering or the
source of all creativity like that there's deep stuff and it's mostly first person not
measurable third person stuff even if maybe it corresponds to third person stuff to some degree
but we also see examples of some of our favorite examples as people who are in the worst environments
who end up finding happiness right where the third person stuff looks to be less conducive and there's
some victor frankle nelson mendela whatever um but it's pretty easy to measure comfort and it's
pretty universal and i think we can see that the industrial revolution started to replace happiness
with comfort quite heavily as the thing it was optimizing for and we can see that when increased
comfort is given maybe because of the evolutionary disposition that expending extra calories when
for the majority of our history we didn't have extra calories was not a safe thing to do who knows
why um when extra comfort is given it's very easy to take that path even if it's not the
path that supports overall well-being long-term and um so we can see that you know when you when
you look at the techno-optimist idea that we have better lives than egyptian pharaohs and kings and
whatever what they're largely looking at is how comfortable our beds are and how comfortable
the transportation systems are and things like that in which case is massive improvement but
we also see that in some of the nations where people have access to the most comfort suicide
