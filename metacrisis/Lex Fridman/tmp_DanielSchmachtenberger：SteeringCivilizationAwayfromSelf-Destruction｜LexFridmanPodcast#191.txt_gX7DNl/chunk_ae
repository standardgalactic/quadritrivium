themselves and there's a finite space there that system is going to self terminate it's not
gonna be able to keep doing that thing because you'll get to a place of there's no resources left
and then you get uh so now if i'm utilizing the resources faster than they can replicate
or faster than they can replenish and i'm actually growing our population in the process
so i'm even increasing the rate of the utilization of resources i might get an exponential curve and
then hit a wall and then just collapse the exponential curve rather than do an s curve
or some other kind of thing um so self terminating system is any system that depends upon a substrate
system that is debasing its own substrate that is debasing what it depends upon
so you're right that uh if you look at empires they rise and fall throughout human history
but but not this time bro where this one's gonna last forever that's
i like that idea i think that if we don't understand why all the previous ones failed we
can't ensure that and so i think it's very important to understand it well so that we can
have that be a designed outcome with some what decent probability so we're it's sort of in terms
of consuming the resources on the island we're a clever bunch and we keep coming up
especially when the on the horizon there is a termination point we keep coming up with clever
ways of avoiding disaster of avoiding collapse of constructing this is where technological
innovation this is where growth comes in coming up with different ways to improve productivity and
the way society functions such that we consume less resources or get a lot more from the resources we
have so there's some sense in which there's a human ingenuity is a source for optimism
about the future of this particular system that uh that may not be self terminating if if there's
more innovation than there is consumption so um over consumption of resources just one way I think
can self-terminate we're just kind of starting here but um there are reasons for optimism and
pessimism then they're both worth understanding and there's failure modes on understanding either
without the other um as we mentioned previously there there's what I would call naive techno
optimism naive techno capital optimism that says uh stuff just has been getting better and better
and we wouldn't want to live in the dark ages and tech has done all this awesome stuff and
we know the proponents of those models and that stuff is going to kind of keep getting better
of course there are problems but human ingenuity rises to its apply and demand will solve the
problems whatever would you put rick or as well on that or in that bucket is there some
specific people you have in mind or naive optimism is truly naive to where you're
essentially just have an optimism that's blind to any kind of realities of the way technology
progresses I don't think that anyone who thinks about it and writes about it is perfectly naive
gotcha but there might play time it's a platonic ideal there there might be a bias in the nature
of the assessment I would also say there's kind of naive techno pessimism and there are
um critics of technology I mean you read the unabomber's manifesto on why technology can't
not result in our self termination so we have to take it out before it gets any further um
but also if you read a lot of the ex-risk community you know boss drum and friends uh it's like our
total number of existential risks and the total probability of them is going up
and so I think that there are we have to hold together where our positive possibilities and
our risk possibilities are both increasing and then say for the positive possibilities to be
realized long term all of the catastrophic risks have to not happen any of the catastrophic risks
happening is enough to keep that positive outcome from occurring so how do we ensure that none of
them happen if we want to say let's have a civilization that doesn't collapse so again
collapse theory it's worth looking at books like um the collapse of complex societies by
joseph tainter it does an analysis of that many of the societies fell for internal institutional
decay civilizational decay reasons um baudrillard in simulation in simulacra looks at a very different
way of looking at how institutional decay and the collective intelligence of a system happens and
it becomes kind of more internally parasitic on itself um obviously jarrod diamond made a more
popular book called collapse um and as we were mentioning the anti-catharia mechanism has been
getting attention in the news lately but it's like a 2000 year old clock right like like metal gears
and does that mean we lost like 1500 years of technological progress um and from a society that
was relatively technologically advanced um so what i'm interested in here is being able to say okay
well why did previous societies fail can we understand that abstractly enough that we can
make a civilizational model that isn't just trying to solve one type of failure but solve the
underlying things that generate the failures as a whole are there some underlying generator functions
or patterns that would make a system self-terminating and can we solve those and have that be the
kernel of a new civilizational model that is not self-terminating and can we then be able to actually
look at the categories of extras we're aware of and see that we actually have resilience in the
presence of those not just resilience but anti fragility and i would say for the optimism to
be grounded it has to actually be able to understand the risk space well and have adequate solutions
for it so can we try to dig into some basic intuitions about the underlying sources of catastrophic
failures of the system and overconsumption that's built in into self-terminating systems so both
the overconsumption which is like the slow death and then then there's the fast death of nuclear
war and all those kinds of things a agi biotech bioengineering nanotechnology nano my favorite
nano bots okay nano bots are my favorite because it sounds so cool to me that i could just know
that i would be one of the scientists that would be full steam ahead in building them without
sufficiently thinking about the negative consequence i would definitely be i would be
podcasting all about the negative consequences but when i go back home i'd be i just in my heart
know the amount of excitement is a dumb descendant of ape no offense to apes uh so i want to backtrack
on my previous comments about uh negative comments about apes uh that i have that sense of excitement
that would result in problems so sorry a lot of things said but what's can we start to pull
it a thread because you've also provided kind of a beautiful general approach to this which is this
dialectic synthesis or just rigorous empathy whatever whatever word we want to put to it
that seems to be from the individual perspective is one way to sort of live in the world as we
try to figure out how to construct non-self-terminating systems so what what are some underlying sources
yeah first i have to say uh i i actually really respect Drexler for emphasizing gray goo and
engines of creation back in the day um to make sure the world was paying adequate attention to
the risks of the the nanotech um as someone who was right at the cutting edge of what could be
there's definitely game theoretic advantage to those who focus on the opportunities and
don't focus on the risks or pretend there aren't risks um because they get to market first um and
then they externalize all of the costs through limited liability or whatever it is to the commons
or wherever happen to have it other people are going to have to solve those but now they have
the power and capital associated the person who looked at the risks and tried to do better design
and go slower um is probably not going to move into positions of as much power influence as quickly
so this one of the issues we have to deal with is some of the the bad game theoretic dispositions
in the system relative to its own um stability and the key aspect to that sorry to interrupt is
the externalities generated yes what flavors of catastrophic risk are we talking about here
what's your favorite flavor in terms of ice cream so mine is coconut nobody seems to like
coconut ice cream uh so ice cream aside what's uh what do you most worry about there's a catastrophic
risk that will help us kind of um make concrete the the the discussion we're having about how
to fix this whole thing yeah i think it's worth taking a historical perspective briefly to just
kind of orient everyone to it we don't have to um go all the way back to the aliens who've seen all
of civilization but to just recognize that um for all of human history as far as we're aware
there were existential risks to civilizations and they happened right like there were civilizations
that were killed in war um that tribes that were killed in tribal warfare whatever so
people faced existential risk to the group that they identified with it's just those were local
phenomena right they it wasn't a fully global phenomena so an empire could fall in surrounding
empires didn't fall maybe they came in filled the space um the first time that we were able to
think about catastrophic risk not from like a solar flare or something that we couldn't control but
from something that humans would actually create at a global level was world war two in the bomb
because it was the first time that we had tech big enough that could actually
mess up everything at a global level that could mess up habitability we just weren't
powerful enough to do that before it's it's not that we didn't behave in ways that would have
done it we just only behaved in those ways at the scale we could affect and so it's important to get
that there's the entire world before world war two where we don't have the ability to make a
non-habitable biosphere non-habitable for us and then there's world war two and the beginning
of a completely new phase where global human-induced catastrophic risk is now a real thing
and that was such a big deal that it changed the entire world in a really fundamental way
which is you know when you study history it's amazing how big a percentage of history is
studying war right in the the history of wars you study european history and whatever it's generals
and wars and empire expansions and and so the the major empires near each other never had really
long periods of time where they weren't engaged in war or preparation for war or something like
that was humans don't have a good precedent in the post-tribal phase the civilization phase of
being able to solve conflicts without war for very long world war two was the first time where
we could have a war that no one could win and so the superpowers couldn't fight again they couldn't
do a real kinetic war they could do diplomatic wars and cold war type stuff and they could fight
proxy wars through other countries that didn't have the big weapons and so mutually assured
destruction and like coming out of world war two we actually realized that nation states couldn't
prevent world war and so we needed a new type of of supervening government in addition to nation
states which was the whole bread and woods world the united nations the world bank the imf the
globalization trade type agreements mutually assured destruction that was how do we have
some coordination beyond just nation states between them since we have to stop war between at
least the superpowers and it was pretty successful given that we've had like 75 years of no superpower
on superpower war um we've had lots of proxy wars during that time we've had you know cold war
and i would say we're in a new phase now where the bread and wood solution is basically over
almost over being described the bread was solution yeah so the bread and woods the series of agreements
for how the nations would be able to engage with each other in a solution other than war
was these igos these intergovernmental organizations and was the idea of globalization
since we could have global effects we needed to be able to think about things globally
where we had trade relationships with each other where it would not be profitable
to war with each other it'd be more profitable to actually be able to trade with each other so our own
self-interest was you know going to drive our non-war interest um and so this started to look like
and obviously this this couldn't have happened that much earlier either because industrialization
hadn't gotten far enough to be able to do massive global industrial supply chains and ships stuff
around you know quickly but like we were mentioning earlier almost all the electronics that we
used today just basic cheap stuff for us is made on six continents made in many countries there's
no single country in the world that could actually make many of the things that we have and from the
raw material extraction to the plastics and polymers and the you know etc and so the idea
the idea that we made a world that could do that kind of trade and create massive gdp growth we
could all work together to be able to mine natural resources and grow stuff with the rapid gdp growth
there was the idea that everybody could keep having more without having to take each other stuff
and so that that was part of kind of the the breton woods post world war two model the other was
that we would be so economically interdependent that blowing each other up would never make sense
that worked for a while now it also brought us up into planetary boundaries faster the
unrenovable use of resource and turning those resources into pollution on the other side of
the supply chain so obviously that faster gdp growth meant uh the overfishing of the oceans
and the cutting down of the trees and the climate change and the uh mining toxic mining tailings
going into the water and the mountaintop removal mining and all those types of things that's the
overall consumption side of the of the risk that we're talking about and so the answer of let's do
positive gdp is the answer rapidly and exponentially obviously accelerated the planetary boundary side
and that started to be that that was thought about for a long time but it started to be modeled
with the club of rome and limits of growth um and it but it's just very obvious to say if you
have a linear materials economy where you take stuff out of the earth faster whether it's fish or
trees or or or and you take or oil and you take it out of the earth faster than it can replenish
itself and you turn it into trash after using it for a short period of time you put the trash in
the environment faster than it can process itself and there's toxicity associated with both sides
of this you can't run an exponentially growing linear materials economy on a finite planet forever
that's not a hard thing to figure out and it has to be exponential if there's an exponentiation
the monetary supply because of interest and then fractional reserve banking and to then be able to
keep up with the growing monetary supply you have to have growth of goods and services and so that's
that kind of thing that has happened um but you also see that when you get these supply chains
that are so interconnected across the world you get increased fragility because a a collapse or
problem in one area then affects the whole world in a much bigger area as opposed to the issues
being local right so we got to see with covid and an issue that started in one part of china
affecting the whole world so much more rapidly than would have happened before breton woods right
before international travel supply chains you know that whole kind of thing and with a bunch of
second and third order effects that people wouldn't have predicted okay we have to stop
certain kinds of travel because of viral contaminants but the countries doing agriculture depend upon
fertilizer they don't produce that is shipped into them and depend upon pesticides they don't
produce so we got both crop failures and crops being eaten by locusts in scale in northern
africa and iran and things like that because they couldn't get the supplies of stuff in so then you
get massive starvation or future kind of hunger issues because of supply chain shutdowns so you
get this increased fragility and cascade dynamics where a small problem can end up leading to cascade
effects and also we went from two superpowers with one catastrophe weapon to now that same
catastrophe weapon is there's more countries that have it eight or nine countries that have it and
there's a lot more types of catastrophe weapons we now have catastrophe weapons with
weaponized drones that can hit infrastructure targets with bio with in fact every new type of
tech has created an arms race so we have not with the un or the other kind of intergovernmental
organizations we haven't been able to really do nuclear deproliferation we've actually had more
countries get nukes and keep getting faster nukes the race to hypersonics and things like that
um and every new type of technology that has emerged has created an arms race and so you
can't do mutually assured destruction with multiple agents the way you can with two agents
two agents it's a much easier to create a stable Nash equilibrium that's forced but the ability
to modern say if these guys shoot who do i shoot do i shoot them do i shoot everybody do i and so
you get a three-body problem you get a very complex type of thing when you have multiple agents and
multiple different types of catastrophe weapons including ones that can be much more easily
produced than nukes nukes are really hard to produce there's only uranium in a few areas
uranium enrichment is hard icbm's are hard but weaponized drones hitting smart targets is not
so hard there's a lot of other things where basically the scale at being able to manufacture
them is going way way down to where even non-state actors can have them and so when we talk about
exponential tech and the decentralization of exponential tech what that means is
decentralized catastrophe weapon capacity and especially in a world of increasing numbers of
people feeling disenfranchised frantic whatever for different reasons so uh i would say where the
Bretton Woods world doesn't prepare us to be able to deal with lots of different agents having
lots of different types of catastrophe weapons you can't put mutually assured destruction on
where you can't keep doing growth of the materials economy in the same way because
of hitting planetary boundaries and where the fragility dynamics are actually now their own
source of catastrophic risk so now we're so like there was all the world until world war two and
world war two is just from a from a civilization timescale point of view is just a second ago
it seems like a long time but it is really not we get a short period of relative peace at the
