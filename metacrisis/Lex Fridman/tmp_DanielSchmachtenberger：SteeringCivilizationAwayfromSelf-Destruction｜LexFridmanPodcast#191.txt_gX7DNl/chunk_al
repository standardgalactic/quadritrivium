with which they can process the health of their relationships that would be amazing to start
to explore and this is now the thesis that we started to discuss before is every time there is
a major step function in the physical tech it absolutes the previous social tech and the new
social tech has to emerge what i would say is that when we look at the nation state level of the
world today the more top-down authoritarian nation states are as the exponential tech started to
emerge the digital technology started to emerge they were in a position for better long-term
planning and better coordination and so the authoritarian state started applying the exponential
tech intentionally to make more effective authoritarian states and that's everything
from like an internet of things surveillance system going into machine learning systems to
the sesame credit system to all those types of things and so they're upgrading their social
tech using the exponential tech otherwise within a nation state like the us but democratic open
societies the countries the states are not directing the technology in a way that makes
a better open society meaning better emergent order they're saying well the corporations are
doing that and the state is doing the relatively little thing it would do aligned with the previous
corporate law that no longer is relevant because there wasn't fiduciary responsibility for things
like that there wasn't antitrust because this creates functional monopolies because of network
dynamics right where youtube has more users than bimio and every other video player together amazon
has a bigger percentage of market share than all of the other markets together you get one
big dog per vertical because of network effect which is a kind of organic monopoly that the previous
antitrust law didn't even have a place that wasn't a thing anti monopoly was only something that
emerged in the space of government contracts so um so what we see is the new exponential
technology is being directed by authoritarian nation states to make better authoritarian
nation states and by corporations to make more powerful corporations the powerful corporations
when we think about the scottish enlightenment when the idea of markets was being advanced the
modern kind of ideas of markets the biggest corporation was tiny compared to what the biggest
corporation today is so the asymmetry of it relative to people was tiny and the asymmetry now in
terms of the total technology it employs total amount of money total amount of information
processing is so many orders of magnitude and rather than there be demand for an authentic thing
that creates a basis for supply as supply started to get way more coordinated and powerful and the
demand wasn't coordinated because you don't have a labor union of all the customers working together
but you do have a coordination on the supply side supply started to recognize that it could
manufacture demand it could make people want shit that they didn't want before that maybe wouldn't
increase their happiness in a meaningful way might increase addiction addiction is a very good way
to manufacture demand and so as soon as manufactured demand started through this is the cool thing and
you have to have it for status or whatever it is the intelligence of the market was breaking
now it's no longer a collective intelligence system that is up regulating real desire for
things that are really meaningful you're able to hijack the lower angels of our nature rather
than the higher ones the addictive patterns drive those and have people want shit that doesn't
actually make them happier make the world better and so we really also have to we have to update
our theory of markets because a behavioral econ showed that homo economicus the rational actor
is not really a thing but particularly at greater and greater scale can't really be a thing
voluntarism isn't a thing where if my corporate if my company doesn't want to advertise on facebook
i just will lose to the companies that do because that's where all the fucking attention is and so
then i can say it's voluntary but it's not really if there's a functional monopoly
same if i'm going to sell on amazon or things like that so um what i would say is that these
corporations are becoming more powerful than nation states in some ways and
they are also debasing the integrity of the nation states the open societies so the democracies
are getting weaker as a result of exponential tech and the kind of new tech companies that are kind
of a new feudalism tech feudalism because it's not a democracy inside of a tech company or the
supply and demand relationship when you have manufactured demand and kind of monopoly type
functions and so we have basically a new feudalism controlling exponential tech and authoritarian
nation states controlling it and those attractors are both shitty and so i'm interested in the
application of exponential tech to making better social tech that makes emergent order possible
and where then that emergent order can bind and direct the exponential tech in fundamentally
healthy not x-risk oriented directions i think the relationship of social tech and physical tech
can make it i think we can actually use the physical tech to make better social tech but it's not
given that we do if we don't make better social tech then i think the physical tech empowers
really shitty social tech that is not a world that we want i don't know if it's a road we want to go
down but i tend to believe that the market will create exactly the thing you're talking about
which i feel like there's a lot of money to be made in creating a social tech
that creates a better citizen that creates a better human being
this this uh the your description of facebook and so on which is a system that creates addiction
which manufactures demand is not obviously inherently the consequence of the market like i
feel like that's the first stage of us like baby deer trying to figure out how to use the internet
i i feel like there's much more money to be made with something that creates
compersion and love honestly i mean i i really from we can have this i can make the business
case for it i don't know i don't think we want to really have that discussion but don't do you
have some hope that that's the case and i guess if not then how do we fix the system of markets
that work so well for the united states for so long like i said every social tech worked for a
while like tribalism worked well for two or three hundred thousand years i think social tech has to
keep evolving the social technologies with which we organize and coordinate our behavior have to
keep evolving as our physical tech does um so i think the thing that we call markets
of course we can try to say oh even biology runs on markets and but the thing that we call
markets the underlying theory homo economicist demand driving supply that thing broke it broke
with scale in particular um and a few other things so it needs updated in a really fundamental way
um i think there's something even deeper than making money happening
that in some ways will obsolete money making
i think capitalism is not about business
so if you think about business i'm going to produce a good or a service that people want
and bring it to the market so that people get access to that good or service that's the world
of business but that's not capitalism capitalism is the management and allocation of capital
which financial services was a tiny percentage of the total market has become a huge percentage of
the total market it's a different creature so if i was in business and i was producing a good
or service and i was saving up enough money that i started to be able to invest that money and gain
interest or do things like that i could start realizing i'm making more money on my money
than i'm making on producing the goods and services so i stop even paying attention to
goods and services and start paying attention to making money on money and how do i utilize
capital to create more capital and capital gives me more optionality because i can buy anything with
it than a particular good or service that only some people want um capitalism
more capital ended up meaning more control i could put more people under my employment i could buy
larger pieces of land novel access to resource mines and put more technology under my employment
so it meant increased agency and also increased control i think attentionalism is even more powerful
so rather than enslave people where the people kind of always want to get away and put in the
least work they can there's a way in which economic servitude was just more profitable than slavery
right have the people work even harder voluntarily because they want to get ahead
and nobody has to be there to whip them or control them or whatever
this is a cynical take but a meaningful take um so people
so capital is a being a way to influence human behavior right and yet where people still feel
free in some meaningful way they they're not feeling like uh they're going to be punished by
the state if they don't do something it's like punished by the market be a homelessness or
something but the market is this invisible thing i can't put an agent on so it feels like free
and so if if you want to affect people's behavior and still have them feel free
capital ends up being a way to do that but i think affecting their attention is even deeper
because if i can affect their attention i can both affect what they want and what they believe
and what they feel and we statistically know this very clearly facebook has done studies that
based on changing the feed it can change beliefs emotional dispositions etc and so i think there's
a way that the the harvest and directing of attention is even a more powerful system than
capitalism it is effective in capitalism to generate capital but i think it also generates
influence beyond what capital can do and so do we want to have some groups utilizing that type
of tech to direct other people's attention if so um towards what towards what metrics of what a good
civilization and good human life would be what's the oversight process what is the
transparency i can i can i can answer all the things you're mentioning uh i i can build i guarantee
you if i am not such a lazy ass i'll be part of the many people doing this as transparency and
control i'll get to giving control to individual people okay so maybe the corporation has coordination
on its goals that all of its customers or users together don't have so there's some asymmetry
where it's uh asymmetry of its goals but maybe i could actually help all of the customers to
coordinate almost like a labor union or whatever by informing and educating them adequately about
the effects the externalities on them if this is not toxic waste going into the ocean of the
atmosphere it's their their minds their beings their families their relationships um such that
they will in group change their behavior and um i think the i one way of saying what you're
saying i think is that you think that you can rescue homo economicus from uh the the rational
actor that will pursue all the goods and services and choose the best one at the best price the kind
of rand von mises hayek that you can rescue that from dan arielli and behavioral econ that says
that's actually not how people make choices they make it based on status hacking largely
whether it's good for them or not in the long term and the large asymmetric corporation can run
propaganda and narrative warfare that hits people's status buttons and their limbic hijacks and
their lots of other things in ways that they can't even perceive that are happening um they're not
paying attention to that the site is employing psychologists and split testing and whatever
else so you're saying i think we can recover homo economicus and not just through a single
like mechanism technology there's there's the uh not to keep mentioning the guy but platforms like
georogan and so on that that make help make viral the ways that the education of negative
externalities can become viral in this world so interestingly i actually agree with you that
got him that we four and a half hours in that we can tech can do some good all right well see
what you're talking about is the application of tech here broadcast tech where you can speak to a
lot of people and that's not going to be strong enough because the different people need spoken
too differently which means it has to be different voices that get amplified to those audiences more
like facebook's tech but nonetheless we'll start with broadcast tech plants the first seed and then
the word of mouth is a powerful thing you need to do the first broadcast shotgun and then it like
lands a catapult of whatever i don't know what the right weapon is but then it just spreads the word
of mouth through all kinds of tech including facebook so let's come back to the fundamental
thing the fundamental thing is we want to kind of order at various scales from the conflicting
parts of ourselves actually having more harmony than they might have to family extended family
local all the way up to global we want emergent order where our choices
have more alignment right we want that to be emergent rather than imposed or rather than
we want fundamentally different things or make totally different sense of the world where
warfare of some kind becomes the only solution emergent order requires us in our choice making
requires us being able to have related sense making and related meaning making processes
can we apply digital technologies and exponential tech in general to try to increase the capacity
to do that where the technology called a town hall the social tech that we'd all get together and
talk obviously is very scale limited and it's also oriented to geography rather than networks of
aligned interest can we build new better versions of those types of things and going back to the
idea that a democracy or participatory governance depends upon comprehensive education in the
science of government which include being able to understand things like asymmetric information
warfare on the side of governments and how the people can organize adequately can you utilize
some of the technologies now to be able to support increased comprehensive education of the people
and maybe comprehensive informativeness so both fixing the decay in both education and the fourth
estate that have happened so the people can start self-organizing to then influence the corporations
the nation states to do different things and or build new ones themselves yeah fundamentally
that's the thing that has to happen we the exponential tech gives us a novel problem
landscape that the world never had the nuke gave us a novel problem landscape and so that required
this whole breton woods world the exponential tech gives us a novel problem landscape our
existing problem solving processes aren't doing a good job we have had more countries get nukes we
haven't a nuclear deproliferation we haven't achieved any of the un sustainable development goals
we haven't kept any of the new categories of tech for making arms races so our global coordination
is not adequate to the problem landscape so we need fundamentally better problem solving processes a
market or a state is a problem solving process we need better ones that can do the speed and
scale of the current issues right now speed is one of the other big things is that by the time we
regulated ddt out of existence or cigarettes not for people under 18 they'd already killed so many
people and we let the market do the thing but as elon has made the point that won't work for ai by
the time we recognize afterwards that we have an autopoietic ai that's a problem you won't be able
to reverse it that there's a number of things that when you're dealing with tech that is either
self replicating and disintermediate humans to keep going doesn't need humans to keep going
or you have tech that just has exponentially fast effects your regulation has to come early it can't
come after the effects have happened the negative effects have happened if because the negative
effects could be too big too quickly so we basically need new problem solving processes that do
better at being able to internalize externality solve the problems on the right timescale and the
right geographic scale and those new processes to not be imposed have to emerge from people wanting
them and being able to participate in their development which is what i would call kind of a
new cultural enlightenment or renaissance that has to happen where people start understanding
the new power that exponential tech offers the way that it is actually damaging
current governance structures that we care about and creating an extra-risk landscape but could also
be redirected towards more protopic purposes and then saying how do we rebuild new social
institutions what are adequate social institutions where we can do participatory governance at scale
in time and how can the people actually participate to build those things i the the solution that i
see working requires a process like that and the result maximizes love so again elan would be right
that love is the answer let me take it back from the scale of societies to the scale that's far far
more important which is the scale of family you've written a blog post about your dad
we have various flavors of relationships with our fathers what have you learned about life when
your dad well people can read the blog post and see a lot of individual things that i learned that
i really appreciated um if i was to kind of summarize at a high level um i had a really
incredible dad like very very unusually uh positive set of experiences he was committed
we were homeschooled and he was committed to work from home to be available and like prioritize
fathering in a really deep way um and you know as a super gifted super loving very unique man
he also had his unique issues that were part of what crafted the unique brilliance and those
things often go together and i say that because i think i had i had some unusual gifts and also
some unusual difficulties and i think it's useful for everybody to know their path probably has
both of those um but uh if i was to say kind of at the the essence of one of the things my dad
taught me across a lot of lessons was like a the intersection of self-empowerment ideas and practices
that self-empower towards collective good uh towards some virtuous purpose beyond the self
and he both said that a million different ways taught it in a million different ways when we
