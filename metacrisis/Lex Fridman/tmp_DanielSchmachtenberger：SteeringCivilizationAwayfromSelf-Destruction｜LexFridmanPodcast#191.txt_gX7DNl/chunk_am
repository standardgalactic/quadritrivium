were doing construction and he was teaching me how to uh build a house we were putting the wires
to the walls before the drywall went on he made sure that the way that we put the wires through
is beautiful like the the that the height of the holes was similar that we twisted the wires in a
particular way that and it's like no one's ever going to see it and he's like if a job's worth
doing it's worth doing well and excellence is its own reward and those types of ideas and if there
was a really shitty job to do he'd say see the job do the job stay out of the misery just don't
indulge any negativity do the things that need done and so there's like a there's an empowerment
and a nobility together um and yeah extraordinarily fortunate is there ways you think you could have
been a better song is there things you regret it's an interesting question let me get first say
just as a bit of a criticism that uh what kind of man do you think you are not wearing a suit and
tie a real man should exactly uh i grew with your dad on that point you mentioned offline that uh he
suggested a real man should wear a suit and tie but outside of that is there ways you could have
been a better son maybe next time on your show i'll wear a suit and tie my dad would be happy about
that um please
i can answer the question later in life not early um i had just a huge amount of respect
and reverence for my dad when i was young so i was asking myself that question a lot so i
learned a lot of things i knew that i wasn't seeking to apply um there was a phase when i went
through my kind of individuation differentiation where i had to make him excessively wrong about
too many things um i don't think i had to but i did and he had a lot of kind of non-standard
model beliefs about things whether early kind of ancient civilizations or ideas on evolutionary
theory or alternate models of physics and and they weren't irrational but they didn't all have the
standard of epistemic proof that i would need and i went through and some of them were kind of
spiritual ideas as well i went through a phase in my early 20s where i kind of had that the
attitude that Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens has that can kind of be um like excessively
certain and sanctimonious uh applying their reductionist philosophy of science to everything and
um i'm kind of brutally dismissive uh i'm embarrassed by that phase um
i'm not to say anything about those men in their path but for myself and so during that time
i was more dismissive of my dad's epistemology than i would have liked to have been
i gotta correct that later apologize for it but that's the first thought that came to mind
you've written the following i've had the experience countless times making love watching
a sunset listening to music feeling the breeze that i would sign up for this whole life and all
of its pains just to experience this exact moment this is a kind of worldless knowing
it's the most important and real truth i know that experience itself is infinitely meaningful
and pain is temporary and seen clearly even the suffering is filled with beauty
i have experienced countless lives worth of moments worthy of life such an unreasonable fortune
a few words of gratitude from you beautifully written is there some beautiful moments now you
have uh experienced countless lives worth of those moments but there's some things that uh
if you could uh in your darker moments you can go to to relive to remind yourself that the whole
ride is worthwhile maybe skip the making love part we don't know about that i mean i i feel
i feel unreasonably fortunate that it is a such a humongous list because i mean i feel fortunate
to have like had exposure to practices and philosophies in a way of seeing things it makes
me see things that way so i can take responsibility for seeing things in that way and not taking for
granted really wonderful things but i can't take credit for being exposed to the philosophies that
even gave me that possibility um you know it's not just with my wife it's with every person who
i really love when we're talking i look at their face i in the context of a conversation feel
overwhelmed by how lucky i am to get to know them and like that there's never been someone like them
in all of history and there never will be again and then they might be gone tomorrow i might be
gone tomorrow and like i get this moment with them and when you take in the uniqueness of that
fully and the beauty of it it's overwhelmingly beautiful
and you know i remember the first time i did a big dose of mushrooms and i was looking at a tree
for a long time and i was just crying with overwhelming how beautiful the tree was and
it was a tree outside the front of my house that i'd walked by a million times and never looked at
like this and it wasn't the dose of mushrooms where i was hallucinating like where the tree was
purple like the tree still looked like if i had to describe it it's green and it has leaves looks
like this but it was way fucking more beautiful like like capturing than it normally was and i'm
like why is it so beautiful if i would describe it the same way and i realized i had no thoughts
taking me anywhere else yeah like what it seemed like the mushrooms were doing was just actually
shutting the narrative off that would have me be distracted so i could really see the tree
and then i'm like fuck when i get off these mushrooms i'm gonna practice seeing the tree
because it's always that beautiful and i just miss it and so i practice being with it and
quieting the rest of the mind and then being like wow and if it's not mushrooms like people have
peak experiences where they'll see life and how incredible it is it's always there it's funny
that i had this exact same experience and the un quite a lot of mushrooms just sitting alone
and looking at a tree and exactly as you described it appreciating the beauty undistorted beauty of
it and it's funny to me that here's two humans very different with very different journeys
where at some moment in time both looking at a tree like idiots for hours
and just in awe and and happy to be alive and yeah and uh even just that moment alone is
is worth living for but you did say humans and we have a moment together as two humans
and you mentioned shots well i have to ask what uh what are we looking at when i went to go
get a smoothie before coming here i got you a keto smoothie that you didn't want because
you're not just keto but fasting but i saw the thing with you and your dad where you did
shots together yeah and this place happened to have shots of um ginger turmeric cayenne
juice of some kind and so i with some Himalayan salt i didn't necessarily plan it for being on the
show but i just brought it wow but we can we can do it that way i think we should we shall uh
we shall toast like heroes daniel it's a huge honor what do we toast to what do we toast to
we toast to this moment this this this unique moment that we get to share together i'm very
grateful to be here in this moment with you and uh yeah i'm grateful that you invited me here
we met for the first time and i will never be the same for the good and the bad
i am
that is really interesting that feels way healthier than the vodka my dad and i were drinking
so i feel like a better man already daniel this is one of the best conversations i've ever had
i can't wait to have many more likewise this has uh it's been an amazing experience thank you for
wasting all your time today i want to say in terms of what you're mentioning about like the
that you work in machine learning and the optimism that wants to look at the issues but
wants to look at how this increased technological power could be applied to solving them and that
even thinking about the broadcast of like can i help people understand the issues better and
help organize them like fundamentally you're you're oriented like wikipedia what i see to
really try to tend to the information commons without another agentic interest distorting it
and for you to be able to get guys like
lee smolen and roger pennrose and like the the the greatest thinkers of that are alive and you
know have them on the show and most people would never be exposed to them and talk about it in a
way that people can understand uh i think it's an incredible service i think you're doing great
work so i was really happy to hear from you thank you daniel thanks for listening to this
conversation with daniel schmockdenberger and thank you to ground news net suite for
sigmatic magic spoon and better help check them out in the description to support this podcast
and now let me leave you with some words from albert einstein i know not with what weapons
world war three will be fought but world war four will be fought with sticks and stones
thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
