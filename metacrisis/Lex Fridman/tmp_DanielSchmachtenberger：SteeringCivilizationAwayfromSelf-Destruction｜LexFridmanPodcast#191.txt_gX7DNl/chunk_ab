No. The evolutionary adaptiveness of humans was involved critically group selection and
individual humans alone trying to figure out stone tools and protection and whatever aren't
what was selected for and so I think the or is the wrong frame. I think it's individuals are
affecting the group that they're a part of they're also dependent upon and being affected by the group
that they're part of and so this now starts to get in deep into political theories also which is
theories that orient towards the collective at different scales whether a tribal scale or an
empire or a nation state or something and ones that orient towards the individual liberalism and
stuff like that and I think there's very obvious failure modes on both sides and so the relationship
between them is more interesting to me than either of them the relationship between the individual
and the collective and the question around how to have a virtuous process between those so a good
social system would be one where the organism of the individual and the organism of the group of
individuals is they're both synergistic to each other so what is best for the individuals and
what's best for the whole is aligned but there is nevertheless an individual they're not it's a
it's a matter of degrees I suppose but what is what defines a human more the the social network
within a which they've been brought up through which they've developed their intelligence or is
it their own sovereign individual self like what's your intuition of how much not just for
evolutionary survival but as intellectual beings how much do we need others for our development
yeah I think we have a weird sense of this today relative to most previous periods of
sapien history I think the vast majority of sapien history is tribal like depending upon your
early human model two or three hundred thousand years of homo sapiens in little tribes where
they depended upon that tribe for survival and excommunication from the tribe was was fatal
I think they and our whole evolutionary genetic history is in that environment and the amount
of time we've been out of it is is relatively so tiny and then we still depended upon extended
families and local communities more and the big kind of giant market complex where I can provide
something to the market to get money to be able to get other things from the market where it
seems like I don't need anyone it's almost like disintermediating our sense of need even though
even though you're my ability to talk to each other using these mics and the phones that we
coordinated on took millions of people over six continents to be able to run the supply chains
that made all the stuff that we depend on but we don't notice that we depend upon them they all
seem fungible um if you take a baby obviously that you didn't even get to a baby without a mom
was it dependent or we depended upon each other right without two two parents at minimum and
they depended upon other people but if we take that baby and we put it out in the wild it obviously
dies so if we let it grow up for a little while the minimum amount of time where it starts to
have some autonomy and then we put it out in the wild and there this has happened a few times
it doesn't learn language and it doesn't learn the artic the small motor articulation
that we learn it doesn't learn the type of consciousness that we end up having that is
socialized so i think i think we take for granted how much conditioning affects us
um it is possible that uh it affects basically 99.9 or maybe the whole thing the whole thing is
the connection between us humans and that we're we're uh no better than apes without our human
connections because that that thinking of it that way forces us to think very differently
about human society and how to progress forward if the connections are fundamental i just have
to object to the no better than apes because better here i think you mean a specific thing which
means have capacities that are fundamentally different than i think apes also depend upon
troops um yes and i i think the idea of humans as better than nature in some kind of
ethical sense ends up having heaps of problems we'll table that we can come back to it but
when we say what is unique about homo sapien capacity relative to the other animals we currently
inhabit the biosphere with and i'm saying it that way because there were other early hominids that
had some of these capacities uh we believe our tool creation and our language creation and our
coordination are all kind of the results of a certain type of capacity for abstraction
and other animals will use tools but they don't evolve the tools they use they keep using the
same types of tools that they basically can find so a chimp will notice that a rock can cut a vine
that it wants to and it'll even notice that a sharper rock will cut it better and experientially
it'll use the sharper rock and if you even give it a knife it'll probably use the knife because
it's experiencing the effectiveness but it doesn't make stone tools because that requires
understanding why one is sharper than the other what is the abstract principle called sharpness
to then be able to invent a sharper thing that same abstraction makes language and the ability
for abstract representation which makes the ability to coordinate in a more advanced set of ways
so i do think our ability to coordinate with each other is pretty fundamental to the selection
of what we are as a species i wonder if that coordination that connection is actually the
thing that gives birth to consciousness that gives birth to well let's start with self-awareness
more like theory of mind theory of mind yeah you know i i suppose there's experiments that show
that there's other mammals that have a very crude theory of mind i'm not sure maybe dogs
something like that but actually dogs probably has to do with that they co-evolved with humans
see it'd be interesting if that theory of mind is what leads to consciousness in the way we think
about it is the richness of the subjective experience that is consciousness i have an
inkling sense that that only exists because we're social creatures that that doesn't come
with this with the hardware and the software in the in the beginning that's like that's learned
as an effective tool for communication almost like we we think we i think we think that consciousness
is fundamental and maybe it's not there's a bunch of folks kind of criticize the idea that the
illusion of consciousness is consciousness that it is just a facade we use to
to help us construct theories of mind you almost put yourself in the world as a subjective being
in that experience you want to reach the experience as an individual person so that i could empathize
with your experience i find that notion compelling mostly because it allows you to then create robots
that become conscious not by being quote-unquote conscious but by just learning to fake it till
they make it is uh creative you know present the facade of consciousness and with it with the task
of uh making that facade very convincing to us humans and thereby it will become conscious
have a sense that in some way that will make them conscious if they're sufficiently convincing to
humans is there some element of that that you uh that you find convincing this is a much harder
set of questions and deep end of the pool than starting with the aliens was um we went from
aliens to consciousness this is not the trajectory i was expecting nor you but let us walk a while
we can walk a while and i don't think we will do it justice so what do we mean by consciousness
versus conscious self-reflective awareness what do we mean by awareness qualia theory of mind
there's a lot of terms that we think of as slightly different things and um subjectivity
first person uh i i don't remember exactly the quote but i remember when reading when sam
harris wrote the book free will and then denet critiqued it and then there was some writing
back and forth between the two because normally they're on the same side of kind of arguing
for critical thinking and logical fallacies and philosophy of science against um supernatural
ideas and here denet believed there is something like free will he is a determinist compatible
list but no consciousness and radical limitivist and sam was saying no there is consciousness
but there's no free will and that's like the most fundamental kinds of axiomatic senses they
disagreed on but neither of them could say it was because the other one didn't understand the
philosophy of science um or logical fallacies and and they kind of spoke past each other and at the
end if i remember correctly sam said something that i thought was quite insightful which was to
the effect of it seems to because they weren't making any progress and shared understanding
it seems that we simply have different intuitions about this and what you could see was that
what the words meant right at the level of symbol grounding might be quite different
one of them might have had deeply different enough life experiences that what is being
referenced and then also different associations of what the words mean this is why when trying to
address these things charles sanders per said the first philosophy has to be semiotics because
if you don't get semiotics right we end up importing different ideas and bad ideas right into the
nature of the language that we're using and then it's very hard to do epistemology or ontology
together uh so i'm saying this to say why i don't think we're going to get very far is i think
we would have to go very slowly in terms of defining what we mean by words and fundamental
concepts um well and also allowing our minds to drift together for a time so there are
definitions of these terms aligned i think there's some there's a beauty that some people
enjoy with sam that he is quite stubborn on his definitions of terms without often clearly revealing
that definition so in his mind he can like he could sense that he can deeply understand what he
means exactly by a term like free will and consciousness and you're right he's very he's
very specific in fascinating ways that not only does he think that free will is an illusion
he thinks he's able not thinks he says he's able to just remove himself from the experience of free
will and just be like for minutes at a time hours at a time like really experiences if he has no
free will like he's a leaf flowing down the river and given that he's very sure that consciousness
is fundamental so here's a this conscious leaf that's subjectively experiencing the floating
and yet there's no ability to control and make any decisions for it for itself it's only a
the decisions have all been made there's some aspect to which the terminology there perhaps
is the problem so that's a particular kind of meditative experience and the people in the
vedantic tradition and some of the buddhist traditions thousands of years ago described
similar experiences and somewhat similar conclusions some slightly different
there are other types of phenomenal experience that are the phenomenal experience of pure agency
and you know like the the catholic theologian but evolutionary theorist ter dishardan describes
this and that rather than a creator agent god in the beginning there's a creative impulse or a
creative process and he was would go into a type of meditation that identified as the pure essence
of that kind of creative process and I think the types of experiences we've had and then
one the types of experiences we've had make a big deal to the nature of how we do symbol grounding
the other thing is the types of experiences we have can't not be interpreted through our existing
interpretive frames and most of the time our interpretive frames are unknown even to us
some of them and so this is a tricky this is a tricky topic so I guess there's a bunch of
directions we could go with it but I want to come back to what the impulse was that was
interesting around what is consciousness and how does it relate to us as social beings and how
does it relate to the possibility of consciousness with it ai's right you're keeping us on track
which is which is wonderful you're a wonderful hiking partner okay yes let's go back to the
initial impulse of what is consciousness and how does the social impulse connect to consciousness
is consciousness a consequence of that social connection I'm gonna state a position and not
argue it because it's honestly like it's a long hard thing to argue and we can totally do it another
time if you want I don't subscribe to consciousness as an emergent property of biology or neural
networks obviously a lot of people do obviously the the philosophy of science orient towards that
in not absolutely but largely I think of the nature of first person the universe of first person
of of qualia as experience sensation desire emotion phenomenology the but the the felt
sense not the we say emotion and we think of a neurochemical pattern or an endocrine pattern
but all of the physical stuff the third person stuff has position and momentum and charge and
stuff like that that is measurable repeatable I think of the nature of first person and third
person as ontologically orthogonal to each other not reducible to each other there are different
kinds of stuff and so I think about the evolution of third person that we're quite used to thinking
about from subatomic particles to atoms to molecules to on and on I think about a similar
kind of and corresponding evolution in the domain of first person from the way whitehead talked about
kind of prehension or proto qualia in earlier phases of self-organization and to higher orders
of it and that there's correspondence but that neither like the like the idealists do we reduce
third person to first person which is what idealists do or neither like the physical lists or do we
reduce first person to third person obviously bone talked about an implicate order that was
deeper than and gave rise to the explicate order of both nagle talks about something like that I
have a slightly different sense of that but again I'll just kind of not argue how that occurs for
a moment and say so rather than say does consciousness emerge from I'll talk about do
higher capacities of consciousness emerge in relationship with so it's not first person as
a category emerging from third person but increased complexity within the nature of first person
and third person co-evolving do I think that it seems relatively likely that more advanced neural
networks have deeper phenomenology more complex where it goes just from basic sensation to
to emotion to social awareness to abstract cognition to self-reflexive abstract cognition
yeah but I wouldn't say that's the emergence of consciousness I would say it's increased
complexity within the domain of first person corresponding to increased complexity and the
correspondence should not automatically be seen as causal we can get into the arguments for why
that often is the case so what I say that obviously the sapien brain is pretty unique
and a single sapien now has that right even if it took sapiens evolving in tribes based on group
selection to make that brain so the group made it now that brain is there now if I take that a
single person with that brain out of the group and try to raise them in a box they'll still not be
very interesting even with the brain but the brain does give hardware capacities that if conditioned
in relationship can have interesting things emerge so do I think that the the human biology
types of human consciousness and types of social interaction all co-emerged and co-evolved yes
as a smaller side as you're talking about the biology let me comment that I spent this is what
I do this is what I do with my life this is why we'll never accomplish anything is I spent much of
the morning trying to calculate trying to do research on how many computations the brain performs
and how many how much energy it uses versus the state of the rcpus and gpus now arriving at
about 20 quadrillion so that's 2 to the 10 to the 16 computations so synaptic firings per second
that the brain does and that's about a million times faster than the uh
the let's say the 20 thread state of the arts intel cpu the the 10th generation and then
there's similar calculation for the for the for the gpu and all ended up also trying to compute
that it takes 10 watts to run the brain about and then what does that mean in terms of calories per
day killer calories that's about two for an average human brain that's
250 to 300 calories a day and so it ended up being a calculation where you're doing about
20 quadrillion calculations that that are fueled by something like depending on your diet three
bananas so three bananas results in uh in a computation that's about a million times more
powerful than the current state of the art computers now let's take that one step further
there's some assumptions built in there the assumption is that one what the brain is doing
is just computation two the the relevant computations are synaptic firings and that there's
nothing other than synaptic firings that we have to to factor so I'm forgetting his name
right now there's a very uh famous neuroscientist at stanford just passed away recently who did a
lot of the pioneering work on glial cells and showed that his assessment glial cells did a huge
amount of the thinking not just neurons and it opened up this entirely different field of like
what the brain is and what consciousness is you look at demasio's work on embodied cognition
and how much of what we would consider consciousness or feeling is happening outside of the nervous
system completely happening in endocrine process involving lots of other cells and
signal communication uh you talk to somebody like penrose who you've had on the show and even
though the penrose hammerhoff conjecture is probably not right is there something like that
that might be the case where we're actually having to look at stuff happening at the level of quantum
computation of microtubules I'm not arguing for any of those I'm arguing that we don't know how big
the unknown unknown set is well at the very least this is this has become like an infomercial for
the human brain at the very but wait there's more at the very least the three bananas buys you a
million times at the very least at the very least and then you could have uh and then the synaptic
firings we're referring to is strictly the electrical signals that could be the mechanical
transmission of information like this chemical transmission of information there's there's all
kinds of other stuff going on and there's memory that's built in that's also all tied in not to
