they probably don't seek public attention also but the that that was yeah if there was any word
that could express what what I've learned from Joe why he's been a really inspiring figure is that
compersion and I wish our world was had a lot more of that because then it I mean my own
sorry to go in a small tangent but like you're speaking how society should function but I feel
like if you optimize for that metric in your own personal life you're going to live a truly
fulfilling life I don't know what the right word to use but that's a really good way to live life
you will also learn what gets in the way of it right and how to work with it that if you wanted
to help try to build systems at scale or apply Facebook or exponential technologies to do that
you would have more actual depth of real knowledge of what that takes and this is you know as you
mentioned that there's this virtuous cycle between when you get stoked on other people doing well and
then they have a similar relationship to you and everyone is in the process of building each other
up and this is what I would say the healthy version of competition is versus the unhealthy
version the healthy version right the the root I believe it's a Latin word that means to strive
together and it's that impulse of becoming where I want to become more but I recognize that there's
actually a hormesis there's a challenge that is needed for me to be able to do that but that
means that yes there's an impulse where I'm trying to get ahead maybe I'm even trying to win but I
actually want a good opponent and I want them to get ahead too because that is where my ongoing
becoming happens and the win itself will get boring very quickly the ongoing becoming is
where there's a liveness and for the ongoing becoming they need to have it too and that's
the strive together the so in the healthy competition I'm stoked when they're doing really
well because my becoming is supported by it now this is actually a very nice segue into
a model I like about what a meaningful human life is if you want to go there
let's go there what I have I have three things I'm going elsewhere with but if we were first
let us take a short stroll through the park of the meaning of life Daniel what is a meaningful life
I think the semantics end up mattering because a lot of people will take the word meaning and the
word purpose almost interchangeably and they'll think kind of what is the meaning of my life what
is the meaning of human life what is the meaning of life what's the meaning of the universe and
what is the meaning of existence rather than non-existence so there's a lot of kind of existential
a lot of kind of existential considerations there and I think there's some cognitive mistakes
that are very easy like taking the idea of purpose which is like a goal which is a utilitarian
concept the purpose of one thing is defined in relationship to other things that have assumed
value and to say what is the purpose of everything well it's a purpose is too small of a question
it's fundamentally a relative question within everything what is the purpose of one thing
relative to another what is the purpose of everything and there's nothing outside of it
with which to say it you actually just got to the limits of the utility of the concept of purpose
it doesn't mean it's purposeless in the sense of something inside of it being purposeless it
means the concept is too small which is why you end up getting to you know like in Taoism talking
about the nature of it rather the there's a fundamental what where the why can't go deeper
is the nature of it but I'm gonna try to speak to a much simpler part which is when people
think about what is a meaningful human life and kind of if we were to optimize for something at
the level of individual life but also how does optimizing for this at the level of the individual
life lead to the best society for insofar as people living that way affects others and long
term the world as a whole and how would we then make a civilization that was trying to think about
these things because you can see that there are a lot of dialectics where there's value on two
sides individualism and collectivism or the ability to accept things and the ability to push harder
and whatever and there's failure modes on both sides and so when you were starting to say okay
individual happiness you're like wait fuck say this can be happy while hurting people it's not
individual happiness it's love but wait some people can self-sacrifice out of love in a way
that actually ends up just creating codependency for everybody or okay so so how do we think about
all those things together one like this kind of came to me as a simple way that I kind of relate
to it is that a meaningful life involves the mode of being the mode of doing and the mode of
becoming and it involves a virtuous relationship between those three and that any of those modes
on their own also have failure modes that are not a meaningful life the mode of being the way I
would describe it if if we're talking about the essence of it is about taking in and appreciating
the beauty of life that is now it's a mode that is in the moment and that is largely about being
with what is it's fundamentally grounded in the nature of experience and the meaningfulness of
experience the prima facia meaningfulness of when I'm having this experience I'm not actually asking
what the meaning of life is I'm actually full of it I'm full of experiencing it the momentary
experience yes so taking in the beauty of life doing is adding to the beauty of life I'm going
to produce some art I'm going to produce some technology that will make life easier more
beautiful for somebody else I'm going to do some science that will end up leading to better
insights or others people's ability to appreciate the beauty of life more because they understand
more about it or whatever it is or protect it right I'm going to protect it in some way but
that's adding to or being in service of the beauty of life through our doing and becoming
is getting better at both of those being able to deepen our being which is to be able to take in
the beauty of life more profoundly be more moved by it touched by it and increasing our capacity
with doing to add to the beauty of life more and so I hold that a meaningful life has to be all
three of those and where they're not in conflict with each other ultimately it grounds in being
it grounds in the intrinsic meaningfulness of experience and then my doing is ultimately
something that will be able to increase the possibility of the quality of experience for others
and my becoming is a deepening on those so it grounds an experience and also the evolutionary
possibility of experience and the point is to oscillate between these never getting stuck on
anyone yeah or I suppose in parallel well you can't really attention is a thing you can only allocate
attention I want moments where I am absorbed in the sunset and I'm not thinking about what to do
next yeah and then the fullness of that can make it to where my doing doesn't come from what's in
it for me because I actually feel overwhelmingly full already and then it's like how can I how can
make life better for other people that don't have as much opportunities I had how can I add
something wonderful how can I just be in the creative process and so I think where the doing
comes from matters and if the doing comes from a fullness of being it's inherently going to be
paying attention to externalities or it's more oriented to do that than if it comes from some
emptiness that is trying to get full in some way that is willing to cause sacrifices other places
and where a chunk of its attention is internally focused and so when Buddha said desires the cause
of all suffering then later the vow of the bodhisattva which was to show up for all sentient
beings in universe forever is a pretty intense thing like desire I would say there's a kind of
desire if we think of desire as a basis for movement like a flow or a gradient there's a
kind of desire that comes from something missing inside seeking fulfillment of that in the world
that ends up being the cause of actions that perpetuate suffering but there's also not just
non-desire there's a kind of desire that comes from feeling full at the beauty of life and wanting
to add to it that is a flow this direction and I don't think that is the cause of suffering I think
that is you know and the western traditions right the eastern traditions focused on that
and kind of unconditional happiness outside of them in the moment outside of time western
traditions said no actually desires the source of creativity and we're here to be made in the
image and likeness of the creator we're here to be fundamentally creative but creating from where
and in service of what creating from a sense of connection to everything and wholeness and service
of the well-being of all of it is very different which is back to that compassion compersion axis
being doing becoming it's pretty powerful
also could potentially be algorithmatized into a robot just saying
where does um
where does death come into that
being is forgetting I mean the the the concept of time completely there's a there's a sense to
doing and becoming that has a deadline and built in the urgency built in do you think
death is fundamental to this to a meaningful life uh
acknowledging or um
feeling the terror of death like Ernest Becker or just acknowledging the uncertainty the mystery the
the melancholy nature of the fact that the ride ends is that part of this equation
or not necessary okay look at how it could be related I've experienced fear of death
I've also experienced
times where I thought I was gonna die it felt extremely peaceful and beautiful and
um
it's funny because if we we can be afraid of death because we're afraid of hell or battery
incarnation or the bardo or some kind of idea of the afterlife we have or we're projecting
some kind of sentient suffering but if we're afraid of just non-experience
I noticed that every time I stay up late enough that I'm really tired
I'm longing for deep deep sleep and non-experience right like I'm actually longing for experience
to stop and it's not morbid it's not a bummer it's and and I don't mind falling asleep and I
sometimes when I wake up want to go back into it and then when it's done I'm happy to come out of it
so um
when we think about death and having finite time here and we could talk about if we live for
a thousand years instead of a hundred or something like that it'll still be finite time
the one bummer with the age we die is that I generally find that people mostly start to
emotionally mature just shortly before they die but there's
if I get to live forever I I can just stay focused on what's in it for me forever
and if life continues and consciousness and sentience and people appreciating beauty and
adding to it and becoming continues my life doesn't but my life can have effects that continue
well beyond it then life with a capital L starts mattering more to me than my life my life gets
to be a part of it and in service to and the whole thing about when old men plant trees the
shade of which they'll never get to be in um I remember the first time I read this poem by
Hafez the the Sufi poet written in like 13th century or something like that and he talked about
that if you're lonely to think about him and he was kind of leaning his spirit um into years
across the distance of a millennium and would come for you with these poems and he's thinking
about people millennium from now and caring about their experience and what they'd be suffering if
they'd be lonely and could he offer something that could touch them and it's just fucking beautiful
and so like the most beautiful parts of humans have to do with something that transcends what's
in it for me and death forces you to that so not not only does death create the urgency it uh
urgency of doing it you're very right it does have a sense in which it uh incentivizes the
compersion and the compassion and the widening you remember Einstein had that quote something to
the effect of it's an optical delusion of consciousness to believe there are separate
things there's this one thing we call universe and uh something about us being inside of a
prison of perception that can only you know see a very narrow little bit of it but
but this this might be just some weird disposition of mine but when I think about the future after
I'm dead and I think about consciousness I think about young people falling in love for the first
time in their their experience and I think about people being awed by sunsets and I think about
and I think about all of it right I can't not feel connected to that do you feel some sadness
to the very high likelihood that you will be forgotten completely by all of human history
you Daniel the name that that which cannot be named systems like to self-perpetuate
egos do that the idea that I might do something meaningful that future people appreciate of
course there's like a certain sweetness to that idea but I know how many people did something
did things that I wouldn't be here without and that my life would be less without whose names
I will never know and I feel a gratitude to them I feel a closeness I feel touched by that and I
think to the degree that the future people are conscious enough there is a you know a lot of
traditions had this kind of are we being good ancestors and respect for the ancestors beyond
the names I think that's a very healthy idea but let me return to a much less beautiful
and much less pleasant conversation you mentioned prison back to x-risk okay
and conditioning you mentioned something about the state
so what role let's talk about companies governments parents all the mechanisms that
can be a source of conditioning which flavor of ice cream do you like do you think the state
is the right thing for the future so governments that are elected democratic systems that are
representing representative democracy is there some kind of political system of governance
that you find appealing is it parents meaning a very close knit tribes of conditioning that's
the most essential and then you and michael malice would happily agree that it's anarchy
where the state should be dissolved or destroyed or burned to the ground if you're michael malice
giggling holding the torch as the fire burns so which which is it is the state can the state be good
or is the state bad for the condition of a beautiful world a or b this is like an sd test
you like to give these simplified good or bad things um would i like the state that we live in
currently the united states federal government to stop existing today no i would really not like
that um i think that would be not quite bad for the world in a lot of ways uh do i think that it's a
optimal social system and maximally just and humane and all those things and i wanted to
continue as is no also not that um but i am much more interested in it being able to evolve to a
better thing without going through um the catastrophe phase that i think it's just non-existence would
give so what size of state is good in a sense like do we should be as a human society as this
world becomes more globalized should we be constantly striving to reduce the we can we can
put on a map like right now literally like the the the centers of power in the world some of them
are tech companies some of them are governments should we be trying to as much as possible
decentralize the power to where it's very difficult to point on the map the centers of power and that
means making the state however there's a bunch of different ways to make the government much smaller
that could be reducing in the united states reducing the the funding for the government
all those kinds of things there's a set of responsibilities the the set of powers it could be
i mean this is far out but making more nations or maybe nations not in a space that are
defined by geographic location but rather in the space of ideas which is what anarchy is about
so anarchy is about forming collectives based on their set of ideas and doing so dynamically not
based on where you were born and so on i think we can say that the natural state of humans if we
want to describe such a thing was to live in tribes that were below the dunbar number
meaning that for a few hundred thousand years of human history all of the groups of humans mostly
stayed under that size and whenever we'd get up to that size it would end up cleaving and so it seems
like there's a pretty strong but there weren't individual humans out in the wild doing really
well right so we were a group animal but with groups that had a specific size so we could say
in a way humans were being domesticated by those groups they were learning how to have
certain rules to participate with the group without which you'd get kicked out but that
that's still the wild state of people and and maybe it's useful to do as a side statement
which i've recently looked at a bunch of papers around Dunbar's number where the mean is actually
150 if you actually look at the original paper it's a range it's really a range so it's actually
some somewhere under a thousand so it's a range of like two to five hundred or whatever it is
but like you could argue that the i think it actually is exactly to two the range is two to
five hundred and twenty something like that and this is the mean that's taken crudely it's not a
very good paper the in terms of the actual numerical numerically speaking but it'd be
interesting if there's a bunch of Dunbar numbers that could be computed for particular environments
particular conditions so on it is very true that they're likely to be something small you know
under a million but it'd be interesting if we can expand that number in interesting ways that will
change the fabric of this conversation i just want to kind of throw that in there i don't know
the if the 150 is baked in somehow in the heart into the hardware we can talk about some of the
