things that it probably has to do with up to a certain number of people and this is going to
be variable based on the social technologies that mediate it to some degree we can talk about that
in a minute up to a certain number of people everybody can know everybody else pretty intimately
so let's go ahead and just take 150 as a as an average number
everybody can know everyone intimately enough that if your actions made anyone else do poorly
it's your extended family and you're stuck living with them and you know who they are and there's
no anonymous people there's no just them and over there and that's one part of what leads to a
kind of tribal process where it's good for the individual and good for the whole has a coupling
also below that scale everyone is somewhat aware of what everybody else is doing there's not
groups that are very siloed and as a result it's actually very hard to get away with bad behavior
there's a forced kind of transparency and so you don't need kind of like the state
in in that way but lying to people doesn't actually get you ahead sociopathic behavior
doesn't get you ahead because it gets seen and so there's a conditioning environment where the
individuals behaving in a way that is aligned with the interest of the tribe is what gets conditioned
when it gets to be a much larger system it becomes easier to hide certain things from the
group as a whole as well as to be less emotionally bound to a bunch of anonymous people
I would say there's also a communication protocol where up to about that number of people
we could all sit around a tribal council and be part of a conversation around a really big decision
do we migrate do we not migrate do we you know some something like that do we get rid of this person
and why why would I want to agree to be a part of a larger group where everyone can't be part of
that council and so I am going to now be subject to law that I have no say in if I could be part
of a smaller group that could still survive and I get a say in the law that I'm subject to so I
think the cleaving and in a way we can look at it beyond the Dunbar number two is we can look at
that a civilization has binding energy that is holding them together and has cleaving energy and
if the binding energy exceeds the cleaving energy that civilization will last and so there are things
that we can do to decrease the cleaving energy within the society things we can do to increase
the binding energy I think naturally we saw that had certain characteristics up to a certain size
kind of tribalism that ended with a few things it ended with people having migrated enough that
when you started to get resource wars you couldn't just migrate away easily and so tribal warfare
became more obligated it involved the plow in the beginning of real economic surplus there were
so there were a few different kind of um forcing functions but we're talking about what size should
it be right what size should a society be and I think the idea like if we think about your body
for a moment as a self-organizing complex system that is multi-scaled we think about body is a
wonderland our body is a wonderland yeah uh you have you that's a john mayer song I apologize
but yes so if we think about our our body and the billions of cells that are in it well you don't
have like think about how ridiculous it would be to try to have all the tens of trillions of cells
in it with no internal organization structure right just like a sea of protoplasm it would work your
democracy and so you have cells and tissues and then you have tissues and organs and organs and
organ systems and so you have these layers of organization and then obviously the individual
in a tribe in a ecosystem and each of the higher layers are both based on the lower layers but
also influencing them I think the future of civilization will be similar which is there's
a level of governance that happens at the level of the individual my own governance of my own choice
I think there's a level that happens at the level of a family we're making decisions together
we're inter influencing each other and affecting each other taking responsibility for the idea of
an extended family and you can see that like for a lot of human history we had an extended family
we had a local community a local church or whatever it was we had these intermediate structures
whereas right now there's kind of like the individual producer consumer taxpayer voter
and the massive nation state global complex and not that much in the way of intermediate
structures that we relate with and not that much in the way of real personal dynamics all
impersonalized made fungible and so I think that we have to have global governance meaning
I think we have to have governance at the scale we affect stuff and if if anybody is messing up
the oceans that matters for everybody so that that can't only be national or only local
everyone is scared of the idea of global governance because we think about some top
down system of imposition that now has no checks and balances on power I'm scared of that same
version so I'm not talking about that kind of global governance it's why I'm even using the
word governance as a process rather than government as an imposed phenomena and so I think we have to
have global governance but I think we also have to have local governance and there has to be
relationships between them that each where there are both checks and balances and power flows of
information so I think governance at the level of cities will be a bigger deal in the future than
governance at the level of nation states because I think nation states are largely fictitious things
that are defined by wars and agreements to stop wars and like that I think cities are based on
real things will keep being real where the proximity of certain things together the physical
proximity of things together gives increased value of those things so you look at like Jeffrey West's
work on scale and finding that companies and nation states and things that have a kind of
complicated agreement structure get diminishing return of production per capita as the total
number of people increases beyond about the tribal scale but the city actually gets increasing
productivity per capita but it's not designed it's kind of this organic thing right so there
should be governance at the level of cities because people can sense and actually have some
agency there probably neighborhoods and smaller scales within it and also verticals and some of
it won't be geographic it'll be network based right networks of affinities so I don't think the
future is one type of governance now what we can say more broadly is say when we're talking about
groups of people that inter-effect each other the idea of a civilization is that we can figure out
how to coordinate our choice making to not be at war with each other and hopefully increase total
productive capacity in a way that's good for everybody division of labor and specialties
so we all get more better stuff and whatever but it's a it's a coordination of our choice making
I think we can look at civilizations failing on the side of not having enough coordination of
choice making so they fail on the side of chaos and then they cleave and an internal war comes
about or whatever or they can't make smart decisions and they overuse their resources or whatever
it can fail on the side of trying to get order via imposition via force and so it fails on the
side of oppression which ends up being for a while functional ish for the thing as a whole but
miserable for most people in it until it fails either because of revolt or because it can't
innovate enough or something like that and so there's this like toggling between order via
oppression and chaos and I think the idea of democracy not the way we've implemented it but
the idea of it whether we're talking about a representative democracy or a direct digital
democracy liquid democracy republic or whatever the idea of an open society participatory governance
is can we have order that is emergent rather than imposed so that we aren't stuck with chaos
and infighting and inability to coordinate and we're also not stuck with oppression
and what would it take to have emergent order this is the most kind of central question for me
these days because if we look at what different nation states are doing around the world and
we see nation states that are more authoritarian that in some ways are actually coordinating
much more effectively so for instance we can see that China has built high-speed rail not just
through its country but around the world and the US hasn't built any high-speed rail yet
you can see that it brought 300 million people out of poverty in a time where we've had increasing
economic inequality happening you can see like that if there was a single country that could make
all of its own stuff if the global supply chains failed China would be the closest one to being able
to start to go closed loop on fundamental things uh belt and road initiative supply chain on rare
earth metals transistor manufacturing that is like oh they're actually coordinating more effectively
in some important ways in the last call at 30 years and that's imposed order imposed order
and we can see that if in the US if let's look at why real quick
we know why we created term limits so that we wouldn't have forever monarchs that's the thing
we were trying to get away from and that there would be checks and balances on power and that
kind of thing but that also has created a negative second order effect which is nobody
does long-term planning because somebody comes in who's got four years they want re-elected
they don't do anything that doesn't create a return within four years that will end up getting
them elected re-elected and so the 30-year industrial development to build high-speed trains or
the new kind of fusion energy or whatever it is just doesn't get invested in and then if you have
left versus right where whatever someone does for four years then the other guy gets in and
undoes it for four years and most of the energy goes into campaigning against each other this
system is just dissipating as heat right like it's just burning up as heat and the system that
has no term limits and no internal friction in fighting because they got rid of those people
can actually coordinate better but I would argue it has its own fail states eventually and dystopic
properties that are not the thing we want so the goal is to accomplish to create a system that does
long-term planning without the negative effects of a monarch or dictator that stays there for the
long term and accomplish that through not through the imposition of a single leader but through
emergent so doesn't that perhaps first of all the technology in itself seems to maybe
maybe disagree a lot for different possibilities here which is make primary the system not the humans
so the the the basic the medium on which the democracy happens like like a platform
or where people can make decisions do the choice making the coordination of the choice making
where emerges some kind of order to where like something that applies at the scale of the family
the extended family the city the the country the the continent the whole world and then
does that so dynamically constantly changing based on the needs of the people sort of always
evolving and it would all be owned by google like doesn't the doesn't this is there a way to
so first of all you optimistic that you could basically create the technology can save us
technology at creating platforms by technology I mean like software and network platforms
that allows humans to deliberate like make government together dynamically without the need
for a leader that's on a podium screaming stuff that's one and two if you're optimistic about that
are you also optimistic about the CEOs of such platforms the idea that technology is values
neutral values agnostic it and people can use it for constructive or destructive purposes but it
doesn't predispose anything it's just it's just silly naive technology elicits patterns of human
behavior because those who utilize it and get ahead end up behaving differently because of their
utilization of it and then other people then they end up shaping the world or other people race to
also get the power of the technology and so there's whole schools of anthropology that look at the
effect on social systems and the minds of people of the change in our tooling
Marvin Harris's work called cultural materialism looked at this deeply obviously Marshall McLuhan
looked specifically at the way that information technologies change the nature of our beliefs
minds values social systems I will not try to do this rigorously because there are academics will
disagree on the subtle details but I'll do it kind of like illustratively you think about the
emergence of the plow the ox drawn plow in the beginning of agriculture that came with it or
before that you had hunter gather and then you had horticulture kind of a digging stick but not
the plow well that the world changed a lot with that right and and
a few of the changes that at least some theorists believe in is when the ox drawn plow started
to proliferate any culture that utilized it was able to start to actually cultivate grain because
just with a digging stick you couldn't get enough grain for it to matter grain was a
storable caloric surplus they could make it through the famines they could grow their
population so the ones that used it got so much ahead that it became obligate and everybody
used it that corresponding with the use of a plow animism went away everywhere that it existed
because you can't talk about the spirit of the buffalo while beating the cow all day long to
pull a plow so the moment that we do animal husbandry of that kind we have to beat the cow
all day you have to say it's just a dumb animal man has dominion over earth and the nature of even
our religious and spiritual ideas change you went from women primarily using the digging stick to
do the horticulture or gathering before that men doing the hunting stuff to now men had to use the
plow because the upper body strength actually really mattered women would have miscarriages when
they would do it when they were pregnant so all the caloric supply started to come from men where
it had been from both before and the ratio of male female gods changed to being mostly male gods
following that obviously we went from very that particular line of thought then also says that
feminism followed the tractor and that the rise of feminism in the west started to follow women
being able to say we can do what men can because the male upper body strength wasn't differential
once the internal combustion engine was much stronger and we can drive a tractor so I don't
think to try to trace complex things to one cause is a good idea so I think this is a reductionist
view but it has truth in it and so the idea that technology is values agnostic is silly technology
codes patterns of behavior that code rationalizing those patterns of behavior and believing in them
that the plow also is the beginning of the Anthropocene right it was the beginning of us
changing the environment radically to to clear cut areas to just make them useful for people which
also meant the change of the view of where the the web of life were just a part of it etc so
all those types of things um so that's brilliantly put but by the way that was just brilliant but
the question is so it's not agnostic but so we have to look at what the psychological effects of
specific tech applied certain ways are and be able to say it's not just doing the first order thing
you intended it's doing like the effect on patriarchy and animism and the end of tribal
culture in the beginning of empire and the class systems that came with that not like we can go on
and on about what the plow did the beginning of surplus was inheritance which then became the
capital model and like lots of things so we have to say when we're looking at the tech how is what
are the values built into the way the tech is being built that are not obvious right so you
always have to consider externalities yes this is no matter what and the externalities are not
just physical to the environment they're also to how the people are being conditioned and
how the relationality between them is being conditioned question i'm asking you so i personally
would rather be led by a plow and a tractor than stalling okay that's the question i'm asking you
is uh in creating an emergent government where people where there's a democracy that's dynamic
that makes choices that does governance at at like a very kind of liquid like uh there's a
bunch of fine resolution layers of abstraction of governance happening at all scales right and
doing so dynamically where no one person has power at any one time that can dominate and impose rule
okay that's the stalling version i'm saying isn't there the uh the isn't the alternative
that's emergent empowered or made possible by the plow and the tractor which is the modern
version of that is like the internet the the digital space where we can the monetary system
where you have the current currency and so on but you have much more importantly to me at least
is just basic social interaction the mechanisms of human transacting with each other in this
base of ideas isn't so yes it's not agnostic definitely not agnostic you've had a brilliant
rant there the tractor has effects but isn't that the way we achieve an emergent system
of governance yes but i wouldn't say we're on track
you haven't seen anything promising but it's not that i haven't seen anything promising
is that to be on track requires understanding and guiding some of the things differently than
is currently happening and it's possible that's actually what i really care about so
you couldn't have had a stall in without having certain technologies emerge he couldn't have ruled
such a big area without transportation technologies without the train without the uh
communication tech that made it possible so when you say you'd rather have a tractor or a plow than
a stall and there's a relationship between them that is more recursive which is new physical
technologies allow rulers to rule with more power over larger distances historically and
but some things are more responsible for that than others like stalling also eats
stuff for breakfast but the thing he ate for breakfast is less responsible for the starvation
of millions than than the train the train is more responsible for that and then the
weapons of war are more responsible so some technology like let's not throw it all in the
