Checking BBC Earth/Praying Mantis Decapitated by Ant Swarm ｜ Superswarm ｜ BBC Earth.txt
 This narrative describes the intricate and cooperative behavior of an ant colony, focusing on how it collectively responds to various threats and challenges. The ants are highly organized and have mechanisms to deal with potential dangers such as soil millipedes that are poisonous and preying mantises that prey on them. When a soil millipede is detected, the ants quickly recognize its toxic nature and take action to bury it safely away from the colony. In another instance, when a preying mantis threatens the ants by plucking them from their trail, the ants respond with remarkable coordination. They immobilize the mantis and swiftly execute it, ensuring their safety by decapitating it to prevent any further harm.

The ant colony operates like a superorganism, where individual ants are like cells in a larger nervous network that communicates through pheromones. This collective intelligence allows the colony to make decisions and adapt to environmental changes effectively. The queen's role is solely to lay eggs, contributing to the growth and sustainability of the colony, which operates under the collective decision-making power of all the ants. This example illustrates a unique form of intelligence that emerges from the interactions and cooperation among numerous individual organisms, rather than from any single entity or brain. The ant superbrain is thus a product of collective effort and communication, demonstrating a form of distributed intelligence within the colony.
