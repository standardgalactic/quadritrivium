startup whatever seeking that kind of enhancement because there is an increased demand for productivity
and cognitive productivity beyond what there's ever been while having more things trying to
distract from focus and you know also stresses on the nervous system like we've talked about
the thing about aterol and other smart drugs and just shit tons of caffeine is that while they
can positively affect some metrics which is why people use them many of the other metrics that
are critical are actually being down-regulated in real time so we can see for most people when
they're taking aterol that their focus will go up their drive will go up but certain aspects of
creative thinking and systemic thinking and even aspects of memory go down let alone emotional
things like empathy going down and then long-term health effects so we wanted to see can we develop
something that would meet the same need people's desire to be able to go into creative productive
flow states where their full cognitive capabilities were available can we do that more comprehensively
than has been done so far and more safely and we started by doing this in integrative clinical
settings where we were running people's whole genome we were running a lot of clinical chemistry
we're running brain scans we're getting medical history and we were really dialing in you know
personalized chemistry for people then the question was could we take some element of that
that would work across a bell curve of people and and meaningfully be able to affect them because
personalized chemistry at scale is tricky we're working on it we're actually working on
moving from the one version of qualia to multiple versions in the future all the way to
you know lab-based fully customized chemistry pharmacology but we were really surprised at
how well we were able to do taking a systems approach to natropics where we were you know we
started out by modeling when people are taking some smart drug or something that affect what are
they really seeking and so we did kind of a cognitive science of they're they're seeking
increased short-term memory and long-term memory and speed of memory and digit span and verbal
fluency and task switching and creative thinking and critical thinking you know analysis and synthesis
and a bunch of emotional things like emotional resilience and drive and you know so we were
looking at that whole set of things together and then saying all right we want to be able to affect
that whole set not a subset of it and then what are the underlying physiologic pathways that
mediate all that which ones are mediated via acetylcholine or glutamate or catecholamines or
ion channels or so we mapped that out used kind of systems dynamics for looking at how
those all interact with each other and the pathways that regulate them and then looked at the
chemistry that maps to those and then started our kind of hypothesis development process for what
we could do to upregulate all of those systems simultaneously in a way that would actually
upregulate the regulatory capacity of the system where after someone had been on it for a while
rather than get addicted and downregulated it could actually have lasting baseline elevation.
So let's just say I take I take qualia what's my first week going to be like what's a typical
experience of someone who uses qualia in the first week and then you know second third and you
know short term and then long term. So we have done a bunch of internal you know single-blinded
trials we're just engaged in our first double-blinded trials right now but we don't have results
I can't make any claim about what one will experience I can say what many people have
claimed and many people is quite large numbers for us now and obviously it's going to be different
experiences for different people I want to say first qualia is actually not recommended for
everyone there are contraindications specifically if people are on psychiatric meds or neurologic
meds or treating cancer or treating hypertension then we would not recommend people use it without
consulting their appropriate healthcare practitioner first this doesn't mean that there
are not healthcare practitioners that are using it and recommending it for such people in knowledgeable
ways we wouldn't recommend people do it on their own because there are chances of interactions.
So that said for people that it's not contraindicated we're getting an extremely
high positive success rate this the small percentage of people about 16 percent of people
that describe a null effective they don't experience very much are almost exclusively
because they have sleep issues if people are not getting adequate delta sleep so if they're not
sleeping enough or not sleeping well qualia will usually not work well for them because
memory consolidation happens during delta sleep and we're specifically working with chemistry that
is mediated through the memory consolidation pathways so one of the things we say is you know
that it's that it really is critical that people are sleeping well and if you have apnea
or not Tory or something like that probably going to need to address that first
of the people who are using it and having good experiences
there are testimonials on the website but increased focus attention concentration
insight actual emotional steadiness emotional regulation many people describing increased
epiphany increased empathy all of those things are fairly common.
All right we're talking to Daniel Schmuckdenberger co-founder of Nero Hacker Collective I just
had a look on your website while we were talking there and I see a couple of testimonials of people
that I actually know as Eric Lee and TJ Anderson there's a few people there I know live down in
the San Diego area if you're listening to this and you want to follow the work of Nero Hacker
Collective there is a Facebook page called Nero Hacker Collective you could go and like
that page and be kept up to date with everything that Daniel Schmuckdenberger and his team are
doing in terms of emotional resilience no tropics outsmarting the modern world as we've been talking
about is there anywhere else or our listeners can find you Daniel anywhere else you'd like us to go
I think the Facebook page and the website are good resources right now if you go to the website
you'll get a hint on the ethos page of what we're working on beyond what our current offering is
but mostly you'll see information about quality and there's a decent bit of information about
the chemistry and the scientific approach that we use and you know there's information that's
worth looking at the blog has some very interesting articles but what we're really working towards is
being able to vet all of the different technologies that can meaningfully enhance
people's psychology and cognition this is everything from the psychotherapeutic technologies to
psychedelic assisted psychotherapy to you know all forms of neurotech really vetting which ones are
effective and that are effective not just at short-term and partial effects but positive
system up regulation and then effective for what for what kinds of people for what kinds of pathway
issues etc being able to synthesize all that and then being able to develop a platform where people
can upload personal data that is synthesized with a you know unique kind of AI like combinatorial
algorithms they can then be able to direct people to what technologies have the highest probability
of being most meaningful for them for the kinds of things they're wanting to work on and then being
able to have a deeper version of that available for medical practitioners really pioneering the
future of personalized medicine where we can synthesize all of the diagnostics and synthesize
all the therapeutics customize the therapeutics based on this kind of deeper interpretive model
and so we don't say too much about that yet because you know we want to share about the
things as we're able to release meaningful offerings but if you keep checking in you'll
see more in this way terrific well thank you very much for explaining the difference between
no tropics smart drugs and brain nutrients there's a fascinating conversation i'm going to make sure
that my farmers market down on let's see what's what road is it on i think it's on Santa Monica
boulevard it might be on something else actually there's a farmers market that i've been meaning
to go to but i don't go to it because i take the lazy route i must hit that now hit that now and
start asking the types of questions that you ask that you encourage me to ask so i appreciate that
thank you very much for sharing your experience daniel i really appreciate that if you're listening
make sure you like the neurohacker neurohacker collective facebook page and you can go and
check out more at neurohacker.com thank you sir for your time i appreciate it daniel
james i'm i'm really happy to see all of the important empowering brilliant work you're
sharing with people and it's a delight to be on here thank you thank you sir
