What is neurohacking? What is no tropics? You've probably heard this throne about over
the past few years, when people are talking about, I take no tropics and my brain is working
on another level. I'm taking these smart drugs called no tropics. You've got to check them
out. Maybe you've heard this in conversation, but you don't quite know what it is. You don't
know what no tropics do. Maybe you don't even know what neurohacking means. Today, we're going to
find out. Today, we're going to talk to the co-founder of Neurohacker Collective, who takes a
complex system approach to medicine and well-being science. We're going to be talking about all the
toxins that are in your living room and in your kitchen and in your life, how spending so much
time indoors is affecting your life and what we can do about it. We're going to get geeky.
We're going to be talking brain health, no tropics, smart drugs. Mr. Daniel Schmuckdenberger,
great to have you here on the show, sir. Thanks for having me. Fun to be here. Let's dumb this down
to the very simple. What is neurohacking? Neurohacking is a general term for any kind of
applied neuroscience, applied neuro technology for optimizing the nervous system, optimizing
the mind-brain interface for various cognitive goals or psychomotional goals primarily. We could
also be talking about neurohacking for kind of sensory motor neuro purposes or anything that
has top-down neurologic control, whether that's aspects of health and regulation, immune system,
longevity. But when we talk about neurohacking in kind of contra distinction to the whole field of
biohacking, we're generally talking about cognitive and psychomotional tuning and upregulation.
Okay, so to the uninitiated, what did you just say? Because it sounded very interesting.
It sounded very complex. What does it mean in a nutshell?
Tools for increasing cognitive capability, intelligence, focus, memory, etc., and for
increasing psychological well-being. Awesome. Okay. What is preventing us from just being
naturally gifted in our intelligence and having an optimized nervous system? Like what's going on
today in 2017 as we're recording this that's preventing us from having that kind of optimum
capability? A tremendous amount actually. So if you look at our interface with the modern
technological built world and you look at what our evolutionary biological history is, and you look
at the places where there's suboptimal interface between those, it's in almost every area. So
whether it's eating food that came from topsoil, where the agricultural method had it deficient
in micronutrients, trace minerals, where even if you're eating the healthiest food that you
can get access to, you have fundamental nutrient deficiency. And those are the nutrients that make
not only all aspects of physiology function, but brain specifically, or whether we're looking
at ubiquitous toxicity, like the volatile organic compounds that are in paint and flooring and so
much carpet, so much interior toxicity or external environmental toxicity, organophosphates,
PPEs, phthalates. Most of the toxins that we are exposed to and we see study after study of
breast milk in mothers in the United States having 200 plus petrochemicals. Those petrochemicals are
either endocrine disruptors or carcinogens or neurotoxins. They have a real effect.
And then we also have pathogens we never had before because of antibiotic resistance, because of
the amount of global travel, because of pesticide resistance. So as you share the effects of
artificial lighting, the effect of the amount of time people spend in fixed postural positions with
a fixed eye focal length to a screen, so many of these things are things that we can work with,
but are suboptimal to the human condition. That's just on the physiology side. On the psychology side,
most people don't have the connection to tribe that would have been part of the
an evolutionary biology of humans feeling meaningfully connected to other humans, don't have
a sense of connection to meaning and purpose, have a level of stress from the worldview that they
have come into and from the macroeconomic system and maybe from other macro global issues. So
all of these are stresses on our physiology, our psychology, our nervous system that are
going to have a suboptimal quality of life and performance if we don't work with them.
It's fascinating. You're talking about, you know, the food we eat, probably the cleaning
products we use in our kitchen or bathroom, staring at a screen. Obviously, I talk a lot
about the dangers of looking at too much electronic light sitting down as well. There's a great
book called Get Up by James Levine, which talks about the problems of humans sitting down so much
and how that's affecting us. And then I assume what you were talking about when you were talking
about emotional capability was, of course, Dunbar's number of people, I think, was about 150 or 160
people when we used to be in tribes. That was the number. But now it seems like even if we're
connected to more than that, which would make you feel like you were popular because you connected
250 people, it seems to suggest that actually, you become less happy, the more people that you
know or the more people that you're connected to or the more people that you have to keep up with.
So can we just break down each one of these things? Let's just look at the food we eat for
the time being. Like, if I go to Whole Foods down on Fairfax in Santa Monica Boulevard in
West Hollywood here, can I be sure that the foods I'm eating from the salad bar at Whole Foods
or the kale or spinach I'm buying from the in the plastic bags are going to be okay for me? Or
is what you're arguing saying, you know what, chances are it's still going to be pretty bad for you?
I don't want people to feel hopeless or... But you're about to make us feel hopeless.
No, I mean, is buying food that is from a farmer's market or some place that is local,
fresh, are going to be a lot better than other sources? Yes, very likely. Is buying food that is
organic likely to have less pesticide residue and maybe more trace mineral? Yes, those were worth
doing. Now, even in even in organic crops, will we still find glyphosate and other
organophosphate residue just because it's being sprayed nearby? Yeah, we find that. And is the
top soil going to have the microbiota and trace mineral density of what an indigenous and
primitive environment would have? No, so it's better. It is still not ideal and people aren't
going to be eating the variety of foods they would in a natural environment that are seasonal and
that are each pulling different minerals out of the soil and air. And they are going to have
an increased need for certain nutrients because of toxins and stresses that they're processing.
So what we're arguing is basically we don't have an evolved process for dealing with
organophosphates. Our glutathione pathway or cytochrome P450 pathway, none of those pathways
were evolved for dealing with petrochemicals because they weren't part of our evolutionary
environment. And so given that we have the exposure to those things, it's actually
important and beneficial to support our system to deal with the world it happens to be in.
So how do we ensure that we're eating the best quality foods and what's the practical
way that we can do that? Outside of someone foraging or having a garden where they
can really ensure that themselves, I would say farmers markets are great because it's
someone else having a garden where you can learn about the farmer, learn about their methods,
find one like well. Likely you can get something there that is less hours since it was harvested
then at a grocery store. And outside of where that's viable, then going to local co-ops and local
health food stores is going to be probably the best usually viable option. And then of course
understanding the different things that are in there which is that not everything in a health
food store is actually healthy and not everything that's healthy for one person is for someone else.
And is there one question that we should ask our farmer at the farmers market when we're about to
buy the kale or the spinach or the strawberries or the bananas or the fruit or whatever we're
about to buy? Is there one question we should be asking and one answer we should be looking for
to ensure that we're giving ourselves the best opportunity to get the healthiest food we possibly
can? Well you might have one question being that you framed it that way which I'd love to hear.
I would generally ask what are their growing processes and practices? So I'd want to get into
how they enrich the soil, what kind of, you know, do they use rock flowers? Do they use
different kinds of micro rice and, you know, soil enrichments, pesticides, proximity to other
pesticides? How long from when they're harvested so they'll get in? Obviously the more one knows
about anything the better they can do to navigate that space. Okay we're talking to Daniel Schmucktenberger
who's the co-founder of Neurohacker Collective. We're going to talk to him a little bit about
a product that he has as well that's going to help you with your with your brain and to give
you brain nutrients. I had a cleaner come to my home just the other day here in Los Angeles,
Daniel, and she was complaining that I didn't have enough products in my in my apartment for
her to be able to clean with. She didn't bring her own product. She, you know, came and was reliant
on me and she asked me for next time that she came to buy a product the name of which escapes me.
I think it was Clorex or something like that and it was clearly like a bad chemical. What product
should I be buying to clean my home or to make available? Like what what kind of natural products
because it seems like everyone's like oh yeah get this and it's like these vicious chemicals which
are doing this. It seems like permanent damage to our brains. Just for a little bit of context.
Ammonia is an amazing beautiful chemical, right? Chlorine is a beautiful molecule. All of the
chemicals that we have developed, I mean DDT is a fascinating chemical, right? And so the better
living through chemistry, the problem was that we didn't understand complex systems. We didn't
understand whole systems and so we understood one very narrow part of a system. We developed
something that would be good for that part of a system but it had other effects. Those other
effects were called externalities. We started to understand those externalities and realize the
problem of the externalities on both the environment and our physiology. So you know most of the
pharma meds are actually really fascinating chemicals for the one pathway they're affecting.
It's just that they affect other stuff which is very problematic. So it's not that it's not that
bleach or ammonia or limaway doesn't have some application where it's possibly beneficial but
we do want to be conscientious of the fact that those chemicals have effects on biology that
even breeding them have effects on biology after the fact. And those are they're not
effects on biology that we want to have unconsciously. So you have companies like
7th generation and heathers and things that people can get even in the grocery store that are
more eco-friendly both from their effect on the environment and their effect on humans in the
environment where they're clean. And then you have some companies that make really kind of
high-tech things with high-tech nature tech cleaning products that can be very effective
with different essential oils and imponified natural fatty acids. Yeah I'm not I'm not affiliated
with any of the the companies I'm about to to mention but 7th generation certainly I have
a couple of those products and I'm glad that you said that because that makes me feel good about
buying them. And then there's Honest the Honest company which is the company created by the
Hollywood actress Jessica Alba. And are you familiar with their products so that the Honest
company products healthy as healthy as I can get as well Daniel? I have seen them and heard good
things about them but I can't speak to the chemistry out of my head. Okay you mentioned
global travel how is global travel affecting our nervous system? Lots of things I was speaking
from the point of view of pathogens which was before we had global travel we had the pathogens that
would have been within a bio region that would have been things that we had evolved immune system
and microbiome to deal with well. And when we travel we have the possibility of getting exposed to
a lot more pathogens that we don't have innate immunity to deal with and so there's of course
beautiful things about our ability to travel and get exposed to other ways of looking at the world
and you know people worldviews but there are there are other effects of that that we have
to be conscientious of and so the answer of just more vaccines for every place you go also has
consequences and so it just these are if we have a system that's going to be exposed to
more pathogens and pathogens that it didn't evolve to deal with in recent history well
then again we would just say that's a place where we want to have more immune system support
just like we'd want to have more detox system support if we're exposed to more environmental
toxins. Let's highlight just a couple of other problems and then we'll get into some possible
solutions here. Staring at a screen what are the problems with that? Well beyond the
the backlighting and the lumens and the specific kind of uh the kelvins the specific kind of
spectral frequencies of light that I imagine your listeners all understand quite well a few
other things that can be problematic about it is that it's a fixed focal length and so if I'm
looking at a computer that is 12 inches or 18 or however many inches from my face then the focal
length of my eyes for being able to focus very close and very far is not getting engaged and
those are muscles and in an evolutionary environment we would have been not looking at a very fixed
focal length for all that much time right we would have been looking further off and seeing
trees up close in the process of that dynamic movement of the eye musculature to be able to
focus near and far is part of what helps keep that musculature healthy and prevent the kind of
vision loss that we consider so natural with age it happened before computer screens with books for
us but fixed focal length for very long period of time there's an easy solution for that which is
every 15 minutes half an hour that you're looking at a book or a screen just look far away you know
and let your eyes focus look at something very close let your eyes focus so musculature stays
engaged there's also a postural effect of if I'm looking at a screen uh if it involves me not moving
very much then of course we have all of the neurological myofascial effects of just being
very sedentary but if the posture of the ergonomics themselves have me looking down and taking the S
curve out of my cervical spine the C curve out of my cervical spine you know then I'm going to
be dealing with those uh postural effects so computers are awesome international travel is
awesome and to to the degree that we're interfacing with it for one set of reasons but it's having
other effects we just want to understand those effects and know how to uh augment any possible
negatives because I got a uh a lifespan treadmill desk and I'm as I'm recording this with you now
I'm standing on it I'm not actually walking on it at the moment but I I now for the most part
work at a computer standing up and initially I thought I was so clever but then I realized that
I didn't have a computer stand on my desk so my computer was actually down at kind of chest
level and so my head was kind of you know aiming down a little bit rather rather than straight so
here I was for months going I'm so clever I'm on a treadmill desk I'm standing up look at me
and then I was like oh actually hang on a second my spine is probably still slouching over because
I'm looking down so now I have a stand and the stand my computer and my laptop sits on top of
that stand and as you can see I'm talking to you now Daniel my eyes are at you know my head and
my posture is exactly the way it should be I'm speaking to you from home on my couch on a laptop
so laptops are are pretty profoundly suboptimal ergonomics and as much as we can say that we'd
like people on not on computers which is uh not necessarily realistic for the work they have to
do in the world it's also meaningful or that we want them on ergonomically uh perfect computer
setups which when they're traveling is going to be hard at least understanding the dynamics so one
can counterbalance them but for most people the ergonomics that are going to be important is if
you're looking straight ahead uh meaning not down and not up you would like to be looking slightly
up from there if you're going to be in one place for a long period of time so that the natural C
curve in the cervical spine is being supported rather than otherwise so where we're generally
looking a little bit down then we end up getting the muscles in the back of the neck and the suboccipital
muscles getting tight causing all of the kind of dynamics that come from that and so if someone
puts their monitor higher than they normally would where the center point of their monitor is around
eye level uh and then they usually want their keyboard low and we can get into ergonomic keyboards
so that the shoulders aren't up that uh that's generally keyboard low monitor high is a kind of
first rule of thumb i love it well i'm i'm now you've inspired me to put my computer up even higher
now so i'm going to make sure i do that when we uh when we finish this interview thank you for the
for the tip there um two more things i want to talk about um uh before we move on to a little
bit more about neurohacking but we're talking to daniel schmuckdenberger and you can check out what
he does over at neurohacker.com that's neurohacker.com you can read all about what it means to be a
neurohacker um wi-fi i love wi-fi everywhere i go now when i travel it's like i need wi-fi i need
wi-fi we're all addicted to wi-fi when i was down in sydney australia recently they've got free wi-fi
on bondai beach and when i was traveling through the baltic area in latvia lithuania everywhere you
go is public wi-fi free everywhere i'm in my apartment here in los angeles i've got the super
duper high speed wi-fi just running through the the whole place what are the potential dangers
of wi-fi and or too much wi-fi this is a tricky and harder to answer question um
when we think about wireless uh transmission in general so we're talking about emf and rf
so we're looking at wi-fi we're looking at bluetooth we're also looking at 60 hertz
emf that is the ac in our house we're looking at emf fields from batteries motors etc what we're
also looking at police signal transmission military signal you know other frequencies of radio
what we know is that the total amount of wireless energy that people are exposed to has been on a
power law like more's law since the 60s as we have had more cell towers and more satellites and more
frequencies uh we are doubling the amount of transmission that we're exposed to something
like every 18 months that means that we're in a very high number of order of magnitudes more
total wireless transmission than we ever were in an evolutionary environment that that is going to
have some physiologic effect is pretty easy to buy uh that basically when you measure eeg when you
measure ekg you're measuring biosignals and that there's actually electrical signal processing
that is how we work right electrical signal processing is core to how our our nervous system
works that it's sensitive and that all signals end up affecting all other signals through
wave interference uh exactly how it affects us there is a lot of research that is conflicting on
and different countries have done research very differently largely based on the
how big telecom is affecting the way their government does research very much like
pharma uh effects of uh you know government funding research so we're actually doing a meta
analysis and structured review of all of the research done from all the companies all the
countries in the world right now on the topic of wireless transmission and you know potential
cancer effects potential um oxidative uh effects of sub ionizing radiation in humans and other
biology so we actually should have the best information on that topic available soon but we
still have a lot of interpretation to do and when you're doing meta analysis where the
initial pieces of data that you're looking at are questionable to begin with it's tricky but
I would say that uh for people to be thoughtful about their exposure is warranted and to take
easy steps like not keeping your cell phone near your bed at night and not having unlimited amounts
of cell phone and other access and turning your wi-fi router off at night just the easy steps one
can do uh seem very well warranted and anecdotally many people who have left cities and went to places
where they had almost no wireless exposure and deep wilderness uh describe psychoneuro dynamics
especially sleep issues but anxiety anorexia going away now whether that's just being in nature
is beautiful whether it's the stress of the city whether it's smog and there's so many factors that
that's close to meaningless on its own but we also notice a number of people who've put themselves
inside of faraday cages and found much better sleep so I would say that research-wise we don't
know fully uh but there's good reason to think it's something worth paying attention to is it possible
that 10 20 years or two years or whatever we're going to realize that cell phones and wi-fi
is going to be as damaging to us as we now know that smoking is is to us for years nobody
realized nobody thought that smoking was bad for you and then all of a sudden in the 50s and 60s it
still started to sort of catch on or actually we're starting to see some correlation here between
smoking and being unfit and heart disease is it possible that one day not so long from now or a
long time from now we're going to wake up and go damn I cannot believe we were using the wi-fi I
can't believe we're using cell phones we were absolutely killing ourselves entirely possible
damn I would say that it is probable that we will realize some effects that seem
unacceptable to us with I'm not quantifying how much compared to cigarettes but some effects
now cigarettes are pretty easy which is we just don't actually need them right um wi-fi and just
wireless energy transmission and not just wireless but energy transmission in general we're just not
going to go backwards from that um so I think one of the things that's going to happen is we're
going to start realizing that just like you know we're not going to stop having cleaning products
we're going to make better cleaning products where we pay attention to how the molecules and the
cleaning products actually interface with biology I think we're going to start paying attention to
understanding biosignals better and what are the primary kind of EEG EKG cellular signaling
biosignals that are most sensitive and uh starting to develop wireless transmission
thoughtfully in terms of the spectral ranges that it works in to how it'll interface with
biology where like tesla hypothesized that it could actually be a healing force rather than a
illness force all right let's do one more before we move on to some talk about no tropics and uh
I want to talk about a little bit about qualia which is a smart drug that you have developed
we're talking you talked a little bit before about emotional feelings and the tribe and I mentioned
you know dunbars um I think it was 150 people that's the tribe how are we how are we struggling
with either having too many Facebook friends or having being connected to too many people like
what's what's going on here how is this affecting uh affecting us
so the primatologist dunbar took an observation that many people had had previously which is
that most indigenous tribes capped out at around 150 people give or take maxed out around 225 in a
few cases but generally 150 and then if they got bigger than that they would bifurcate um or
intentionally limit their size and there's a question as to why and he found that there was
a similar thing that happened in all kinds of primates and that the size of the troop they
could hold was actually proportional to neocortical volume and the idea was that we actually have a
limited number of unique relationships that we can actually process well and so when you've got
about 150 people you can actually know everybody in that village well know their lives their history
what's going on and that works if you're going to have a village where everyone is going to impact
everyone knowing everybody caring about everybody being able to see in real time your effect on them
is part of what makes social cohesion works as soon as you start having enough people that you
actually can't track everybody then you start having anonymous people and you start having people
if they're suffering you don't kind of care as much and then you can have effects that could
lead to them suffering but you don't care as much so you can't have social cohesion in the same way
now obviously we are not going to move back to a world of just Dunbar number tribes because
you also would then have to have technology that only you know is back to the technology of that
time where you're only affecting that number of people and obviously our technology extends our
impact to now global um there's and there's actually what we can think of that was the first
insight there's multiple Dunbar numbers which is numbers where different social dynamics occur
one on one is the first right then small groups three four then up to about 12 or 15 etc so it's
really not a problem how many people you've been exposed to or how many people you have friends on
facebook it there is a need to have some deep meaningful interactions with some number of people
which will probably be less than your total number of friends on facebook and it's important to
understand the difference of in-person deep meaningful human interactions where you deeply
know them they deeply know you and you can be authentic with each other then the kinds of
interactions that are mediatable over uh social media so stop focusing on trying to get a hundred
thousand instagram fans and facebook likes and start really going in and and and concentrating
on the quality of relationships rather than the quantity it's i i really want to say i'm a technologist
um i am just about right use of technology understanding all of the effects of it i have
nothing wrong with someone getting a hundred thousand likes on facebook if they're sharing a
message that's meaningfully benefiting the world and having more people hear that that is actually
making a better world i just want them to understand that that doesn't equal deep interpersonal human
connection and that a bunch of people liking them on facebook also isn't going to give them a
meaningful sense of esteem it's going to give them some quick external reference dopamine hits
they can cover up the fact that something in their childhood didn't teach them who they were and made
them externally referential for other people's approval about who they are but it's not bad
to develop a following it just needs to be for the right reason and if the reason is self-esteem
or connection it's the wrong tool for that job we're talking to daniel schmuckdenberger the
co-founder of neurohacker neurohacker i should say collective um daniel what are what are no
tropics a lot of people ask me about this and i don't actually have a very clear answer um but
just explain to me what what what exactly are no tropics i'll make a distinction between three
different terms that are often used kind of synonymously but are worth uh defining differently
brain nutrients no tropics and smart drugs so when we think of brain nutrients we think about
nutrients it would be part of a natural diet uh that are involved in healthy brain function that
either we might be deficient in or that we can actually utilize more of and it will uh you know
meaningfully bolster our capabilities so we're talking about vitamins and minerals and antioxidants
here so uh to the degree that there are key nutrients so when people are talking about
the effects of minerals like magnesium or lithium or zinc or etc on brain function or vitamin d or
phospholipids or essential fatty acids those are all brain nutrients that one would ideally get
in a healthy diet but because again like we said it's very hard to get adequate amounts of those
in a healthy diet and we have increased demand because say we're talking about B vitamins we
to the degree that you're experiencing more uh psychological stress than you would in an evolutionary
environment you're going to burn through B vitamins quicker so supplementing the appropriate brain
nutrients can be useful the distinction there is that's going to take you from deficiency to
not deficiency which means your normal healthy baseline of cognitive and psychologic function
will be supported it's not going to move you beyond baseline capacity because those are elements
that are part of the evolutionary environment right so smart drugs and notropics are distinct
in that they are not nutrients that would be part of a normal diet they are some kind of uh
additional set of chemistry synthetic or natural that are going to try and modulate some systems
for enhanced capability so notropic generally means a chemical that can enhance some aspect
of cognitive function like memory or focus or attention or verbal fluency or task switching
so some nutrient that can modulate some aspect of cognitive function beyond someone's normal
healthy baseline without meaningful side effects that's the general definition of a notropic
and then a smart drug is uh usually and these terms are don't have solid semantic definitions
they're they're kind of uh slang terms but i'm going to give you the best general definitions
smart drug are usually pharmaceuticals that have some cognitive benefit generally for off-label
purposes so these are um either psychiatric meds like ADD or Ritalin or Welbutrin or narcolepsy meds
like uh midaphanel or Alzheimer's meds or Parkinson's meds levodopa things like that
that can increase wakefulness increase focus increase you know something um smart drugs
can enhance some aspect of cognitive function that someone uh wants to experience and you know
hypothetically this could be not just pharma drugs but any drug you could put cocaine or
methamphetamine or other drugs into those categories where they do modulate some neurotransmitter
like dopamine in a way that will have some cognitive effect but usually with some meaningful side
effects immediate side effects like they might up regulate focus but increase anxiety or paranoia
or irritability or something like that um and they might also have long-term side effects which
could be anything from like real physiological issues hepatotoxicity or something but also just
dependence right addiction forming because they're taking something like dopamine or acetylcholine
or glutamate or some neurotransmitter usually that your body naturally regulates and they're
overriding the natural regulatory process to spike it and in doing so if you do that enough times
can actually override the natural regulatory process where it becomes dependent on that
exogenous input that's what we call addiction uh no tropics the goal with no tropics and it's why
it's like kind of an almost like magic unicorn idea um is that there are some chemistries
that can be added to the system that can enhance some aspect of function without creating meaningful
short-term or long-term side effects so of all so obviously the way that you're describing it no
tropics improves your cognitive function above your average functionality without the side effects
smart drugs if we how to take your explanation is can also improve cognitive effect and they're good
for things like ADD and Alzheimer's but they come with problems they come with potential short and
long-term effects and i think there was a third one there brain nutrients right i think you broke
it into can just explain brain nutrients again as opposed as that is different from the smart
drugs and the no tropics essential fatty acids essential amino acids vitamins minerals antioxidants
the things that you would normally get from food that either you're not getting enough of from food
or that it's beneficial to get additional amounts of based on what you know what we're exposed to
how much we're actually using our brains and the cognitive load so these are basically
brain nutrients are either going to be things that could be found in food or things that could
be found endogenously in the body that the body would make from food gotcha okay so you're obviously
a proponent of no tropics of all those three correct and brain nutrients but not so much with
the smart drugs well again like i said bleach has a right application and any drug can have a right
application but in general there's such a there's such a profound complexity to how human physiology
works and complex means something different than complicated a circuit ship is complicated it was
designed externally you put a certain number of transistors linked them in particular way
a cell is complex it's self-organizing its boundary is non-arbitrary complex systems
behave in fundamentally different and and more organizing dynamic kind of ways than complicated
systems so when we look at human physiology and especially the brain it's such a radically
complex self-organizing uh dynamic homostatic system that we don't want to override that right so if
someone's dopamine is low our goal isn't to just give them in-chain dopamine or a dopamine agonist
it would be to say well let's see if we can understand the dopaminergic system better and see
how to support that system's endogenous regulatory capacity so that the intervention that we're doing
actually leads to lasting up regulation rather than short-term stimulus and then lasting down
regulation so in general for all kinds of inputs to biology i'm interested in things that understand
and that seek to better understand the body's natural dynamic homostatic processes and seek
to work with and up regulate them rather than override them gotcha okay so let's go back to
neurohacker collective um which is the organization that you that you co-founded what is its purpose
what is its mission and what is unique about its approach to neurohacking and applied psychoneuro
optimization yeah um so neurohacker collective our goal is optimizing the mind-brain interface
for the optimization of human experience and human capability writ large and so we are technology
agnostic meaning uh biochemical technologies that's both direct to consumer like no tropics and
nutraceuticals as well as things that could be you know doctor mediated for medical conditions and
general things that are direct to consumer are going to be and neurohacking the way we think of
it usually is not for curing illness but for optimization well-being support and enhancement
but a complexity approach and a systems biology approach to medicine is also very meaningful and
part of the deeper research that we're involved in um but so you know we work with biochemical
solutions we work with microbiomic solutions we're interested in genomic solutions in neurotech
transcranial lasers transcranial direct stem alternating currents you know ultrasound eeg
neurofeedback as well as psychotherapeutic and you know meditative technologies working with the
human hardware and software we're interested in anything that basically can up regulate some
aspect of human experience to have a better human experience or human capacity um for any kind of
personal condition and the reason why this is so meaningful for us is all of the other issues that
we care about in the world beyond human experience and capacity are affected by human experience
and capacity all the major problems that we see environmentally and socially uh etc are caused by
human activity and the solutions need to come about through human activity so upgrading the
comprehensive collective intelligence of humanity not just cognitive intelligence but uh interpersonal
intelligence you know etc ends up being a meaningful lever for every other thing worth doing
and to that extent you've created uh your own product called qualia q al i a um and i'm presuming
this is a no-tropic right yes okay so tell us a little bit about what this is like tell us a
little bit about why qualia is a little different and what typical experiences people might have
if they take this product that you've created so like i said we're working on a lot of different
areas of technology qualia is the first product that we have brought to market we have quite a
few other products in trials that will be coming to market this year and then some relatively
difficult ones that will take a little bit longer but are are developing well uh the goal with qualia
was when we look at the give or take 15 billion dollars a year domestically in energy drinks
and how much kind of caffeine stimulus happens and if we look at the estimated something like
five billion dollars in off-label aterol use not justified doctor aterol use which we can
question if it's ever a good thing but just people who are for their midterms or finals or tech
startup whatever seeking that kind of enhancement because there is an increased demand for productivity
and cognitive productivity beyond what there's ever been while having more things trying to
distract from focus and you know also stresses on the nervous system like we've talked about
the thing about aterol and other smart drugs and just shit tons of caffeine is that while they
can positively affect some metrics which is why people use them many of the other metrics that
are critical are actually being down-regulated in real time so we can see for most people when
they're taking aterol that their focus will go up their drive will go up but certain aspects of
creative thinking and systemic thinking and even aspects of memory go down let alone emotional
things like empathy going down and then long-term health effects so we wanted to see can we develop
something that would meet the same need people's desire to be able to go into creative productive
flow states where their full cognitive capabilities were available can we do that more comprehensively
than has been done so far and more safely and we started by doing this in integrative clinical
settings where we were running people's whole genome we were running a lot of clinical chemistry
we're running brain scans we're getting medical history and we were really dialing in you know
personalized chemistry for people then the question was could we take some element of that
that would work across a bell curve of people and and meaningfully be able to affect them because
personalized chemistry at scale is tricky we're working on it we're actually working on
moving from the one version of qualia to multiple versions in the future all the way to
you know lab-based fully customized chemistry pharmacology but we were really surprised at
how well we were able to do taking a systems approach to natropics where we were you know we
started out by modeling when people are taking some smart drug or something that affect what are
they really seeking and so we did kind of a cognitive science of they're they're seeking
increased short-term memory and long-term memory and speed of memory and digit span and verbal
fluency and task switching and creative thinking and critical thinking you know analysis and synthesis
and a bunch of emotional things like emotional resilience and drive and you know so we were
looking at that whole set of things together and then saying all right we want to be able to affect
that whole set not a subset of it and then what are the underlying physiologic pathways that
mediate all that which ones are mediated via acetylcholine or glutamate or catecholamines or
ion channels or so we mapped that out used kind of systems dynamics for looking at how
those all interact with each other and the pathways that regulate them and then looked at the
chemistry that maps to those and then started our kind of hypothesis development process for what
we could do to upregulate all of those systems simultaneously in a way that would actually
upregulate the regulatory capacity of the system where after someone had been on it for a while
rather than get addicted and downregulated it could actually have lasting baseline elevation.
So let's just say I take I take qualia what's my first week going to be like what's a typical
experience of someone who uses qualia in the first week and then you know second third and you
know short term and then long term. So we have done a bunch of internal you know single-blinded
trials we're just engaged in our first double-blinded trials right now but we don't have results
I can't make any claim about what one will experience I can say what many people have
claimed and many people is quite large numbers for us now and obviously it's going to be different
experiences for different people I want to say first qualia is actually not recommended for
everyone there are contraindications specifically if people are on psychiatric meds or neurologic
meds or treating cancer or treating hypertension then we would not recommend people use it without
consulting their appropriate healthcare practitioner first this doesn't mean that there
are not healthcare practitioners that are using it and recommending it for such people in knowledgeable
ways we wouldn't recommend people do it on their own because there are chances of interactions.
So that said for people that it's not contraindicated we're getting an extremely
high positive success rate this the small percentage of people about 16 percent of people
that describe a null effective they don't experience very much are almost exclusively
because they have sleep issues if people are not getting adequate delta sleep so if they're not
sleeping enough or not sleeping well qualia will usually not work well for them because
memory consolidation happens during delta sleep and we're specifically working with chemistry that
is mediated through the memory consolidation pathways so one of the things we say is you know
that it's that it really is critical that people are sleeping well and if you have apnea
or not Tory or something like that probably going to need to address that first
of the people who are using it and having good experiences
there are testimonials on the website but increased focus attention concentration
insight actual emotional steadiness emotional regulation many people describing increased
epiphany increased empathy all of those things are fairly common.
All right we're talking to Daniel Schmuckdenberger co-founder of Nero Hacker Collective I just
had a look on your website while we were talking there and I see a couple of testimonials of people
that I actually know as Eric Lee and TJ Anderson there's a few people there I know live down in
the San Diego area if you're listening to this and you want to follow the work of Nero Hacker
Collective there is a Facebook page called Nero Hacker Collective you could go and like
that page and be kept up to date with everything that Daniel Schmuckdenberger and his team are
doing in terms of emotional resilience no tropics outsmarting the modern world as we've been talking
about is there anywhere else or our listeners can find you Daniel anywhere else you'd like us to go
I think the Facebook page and the website are good resources right now if you go to the website
you'll get a hint on the ethos page of what we're working on beyond what our current offering is
but mostly you'll see information about quality and there's a decent bit of information about
the chemistry and the scientific approach that we use and you know there's information that's
worth looking at the blog has some very interesting articles but what we're really working towards is
being able to vet all of the different technologies that can meaningfully enhance
people's psychology and cognition this is everything from the psychotherapeutic technologies to
psychedelic assisted psychotherapy to you know all forms of neurotech really vetting which ones are
effective and that are effective not just at short-term and partial effects but positive
system up regulation and then effective for what for what kinds of people for what kinds of pathway
issues etc being able to synthesize all that and then being able to develop a platform where people
can upload personal data that is synthesized with a you know unique kind of AI like combinatorial
algorithms they can then be able to direct people to what technologies have the highest probability
of being most meaningful for them for the kinds of things they're wanting to work on and then being
able to have a deeper version of that available for medical practitioners really pioneering the
future of personalized medicine where we can synthesize all of the diagnostics and synthesize
all the therapeutics customize the therapeutics based on this kind of deeper interpretive model
and so we don't say too much about that yet because you know we want to share about the
things as we're able to release meaningful offerings but if you keep checking in you'll
see more in this way terrific well thank you very much for explaining the difference between
no tropics smart drugs and brain nutrients there's a fascinating conversation i'm going to make sure
that my farmers market down on let's see what's what road is it on i think it's on Santa Monica
boulevard it might be on something else actually there's a farmers market that i've been meaning
to go to but i don't go to it because i take the lazy route i must hit that now hit that now and
start asking the types of questions that you ask that you encourage me to ask so i appreciate that
thank you very much for sharing your experience daniel i really appreciate that if you're listening
make sure you like the neurohacker neurohacker collective facebook page and you can go and
check out more at neurohacker.com thank you sir for your time i appreciate it daniel
james i'm i'm really happy to see all of the important empowering brilliant work you're
sharing with people and it's a delight to be on here thank you thank you sir
