so we're looking at wi-fi we're looking at bluetooth we're also looking at 60 hertz
emf that is the ac in our house we're looking at emf fields from batteries motors etc what we're
also looking at police signal transmission military signal you know other frequencies of radio
what we know is that the total amount of wireless energy that people are exposed to has been on a
power law like more's law since the 60s as we have had more cell towers and more satellites and more
frequencies uh we are doubling the amount of transmission that we're exposed to something
like every 18 months that means that we're in a very high number of order of magnitudes more
total wireless transmission than we ever were in an evolutionary environment that that is going to
have some physiologic effect is pretty easy to buy uh that basically when you measure eeg when you
measure ekg you're measuring biosignals and that there's actually electrical signal processing
that is how we work right electrical signal processing is core to how our our nervous system
works that it's sensitive and that all signals end up affecting all other signals through
wave interference uh exactly how it affects us there is a lot of research that is conflicting on
and different countries have done research very differently largely based on the
how big telecom is affecting the way their government does research very much like
pharma uh effects of uh you know government funding research so we're actually doing a meta
analysis and structured review of all of the research done from all the companies all the
countries in the world right now on the topic of wireless transmission and you know potential
cancer effects potential um oxidative uh effects of sub ionizing radiation in humans and other
biology so we actually should have the best information on that topic available soon but we
still have a lot of interpretation to do and when you're doing meta analysis where the
initial pieces of data that you're looking at are questionable to begin with it's tricky but
I would say that uh for people to be thoughtful about their exposure is warranted and to take
easy steps like not keeping your cell phone near your bed at night and not having unlimited amounts
of cell phone and other access and turning your wi-fi router off at night just the easy steps one
can do uh seem very well warranted and anecdotally many people who have left cities and went to places
where they had almost no wireless exposure and deep wilderness uh describe psychoneuro dynamics
especially sleep issues but anxiety anorexia going away now whether that's just being in nature
is beautiful whether it's the stress of the city whether it's smog and there's so many factors that
that's close to meaningless on its own but we also notice a number of people who've put themselves
inside of faraday cages and found much better sleep so I would say that research-wise we don't
know fully uh but there's good reason to think it's something worth paying attention to is it possible
that 10 20 years or two years or whatever we're going to realize that cell phones and wi-fi
is going to be as damaging to us as we now know that smoking is is to us for years nobody
realized nobody thought that smoking was bad for you and then all of a sudden in the 50s and 60s it
still started to sort of catch on or actually we're starting to see some correlation here between
smoking and being unfit and heart disease is it possible that one day not so long from now or a
long time from now we're going to wake up and go damn I cannot believe we were using the wi-fi I
can't believe we're using cell phones we were absolutely killing ourselves entirely possible
damn I would say that it is probable that we will realize some effects that seem
unacceptable to us with I'm not quantifying how much compared to cigarettes but some effects
now cigarettes are pretty easy which is we just don't actually need them right um wi-fi and just
wireless energy transmission and not just wireless but energy transmission in general we're just not
going to go backwards from that um so I think one of the things that's going to happen is we're
going to start realizing that just like you know we're not going to stop having cleaning products
we're going to make better cleaning products where we pay attention to how the molecules and the
cleaning products actually interface with biology I think we're going to start paying attention to
understanding biosignals better and what are the primary kind of EEG EKG cellular signaling
biosignals that are most sensitive and uh starting to develop wireless transmission
thoughtfully in terms of the spectral ranges that it works in to how it'll interface with
biology where like tesla hypothesized that it could actually be a healing force rather than a
illness force all right let's do one more before we move on to some talk about no tropics and uh
I want to talk about a little bit about qualia which is a smart drug that you have developed
we're talking you talked a little bit before about emotional feelings and the tribe and I mentioned
you know dunbars um I think it was 150 people that's the tribe how are we how are we struggling
with either having too many Facebook friends or having being connected to too many people like
what's what's going on here how is this affecting uh affecting us
so the primatologist dunbar took an observation that many people had had previously which is
that most indigenous tribes capped out at around 150 people give or take maxed out around 225 in a
few cases but generally 150 and then if they got bigger than that they would bifurcate um or
intentionally limit their size and there's a question as to why and he found that there was
a similar thing that happened in all kinds of primates and that the size of the troop they
could hold was actually proportional to neocortical volume and the idea was that we actually have a
limited number of unique relationships that we can actually process well and so when you've got
about 150 people you can actually know everybody in that village well know their lives their history
what's going on and that works if you're going to have a village where everyone is going to impact
everyone knowing everybody caring about everybody being able to see in real time your effect on them
is part of what makes social cohesion works as soon as you start having enough people that you
actually can't track everybody then you start having anonymous people and you start having people
if they're suffering you don't kind of care as much and then you can have effects that could
lead to them suffering but you don't care as much so you can't have social cohesion in the same way
now obviously we are not going to move back to a world of just Dunbar number tribes because
you also would then have to have technology that only you know is back to the technology of that
time where you're only affecting that number of people and obviously our technology extends our
impact to now global um there's and there's actually what we can think of that was the first
insight there's multiple Dunbar numbers which is numbers where different social dynamics occur
one on one is the first right then small groups three four then up to about 12 or 15 etc so it's
really not a problem how many people you've been exposed to or how many people you have friends on
facebook it there is a need to have some deep meaningful interactions with some number of people
which will probably be less than your total number of friends on facebook and it's important to
understand the difference of in-person deep meaningful human interactions where you deeply
know them they deeply know you and you can be authentic with each other then the kinds of
interactions that are mediatable over uh social media so stop focusing on trying to get a hundred
thousand instagram fans and facebook likes and start really going in and and and concentrating
on the quality of relationships rather than the quantity it's i i really want to say i'm a technologist
um i am just about right use of technology understanding all of the effects of it i have
nothing wrong with someone getting a hundred thousand likes on facebook if they're sharing a
message that's meaningfully benefiting the world and having more people hear that that is actually
making a better world i just want them to understand that that doesn't equal deep interpersonal human
connection and that a bunch of people liking them on facebook also isn't going to give them a
meaningful sense of esteem it's going to give them some quick external reference dopamine hits
they can cover up the fact that something in their childhood didn't teach them who they were and made
them externally referential for other people's approval about who they are but it's not bad
to develop a following it just needs to be for the right reason and if the reason is self-esteem
or connection it's the wrong tool for that job we're talking to daniel schmuckdenberger the
co-founder of neurohacker neurohacker i should say collective um daniel what are what are no
tropics a lot of people ask me about this and i don't actually have a very clear answer um but
just explain to me what what what exactly are no tropics i'll make a distinction between three
different terms that are often used kind of synonymously but are worth uh defining differently
brain nutrients no tropics and smart drugs so when we think of brain nutrients we think about
nutrients it would be part of a natural diet uh that are involved in healthy brain function that
either we might be deficient in or that we can actually utilize more of and it will uh you know
meaningfully bolster our capabilities so we're talking about vitamins and minerals and antioxidants
here so uh to the degree that there are key nutrients so when people are talking about
the effects of minerals like magnesium or lithium or zinc or etc on brain function or vitamin d or
phospholipids or essential fatty acids those are all brain nutrients that one would ideally get
in a healthy diet but because again like we said it's very hard to get adequate amounts of those
in a healthy diet and we have increased demand because say we're talking about B vitamins we
to the degree that you're experiencing more uh psychological stress than you would in an evolutionary
environment you're going to burn through B vitamins quicker so supplementing the appropriate brain
nutrients can be useful the distinction there is that's going to take you from deficiency to
not deficiency which means your normal healthy baseline of cognitive and psychologic function
will be supported it's not going to move you beyond baseline capacity because those are elements
that are part of the evolutionary environment right so smart drugs and notropics are distinct
in that they are not nutrients that would be part of a normal diet they are some kind of uh
additional set of chemistry synthetic or natural that are going to try and modulate some systems
for enhanced capability so notropic generally means a chemical that can enhance some aspect
of cognitive function like memory or focus or attention or verbal fluency or task switching
so some nutrient that can modulate some aspect of cognitive function beyond someone's normal
healthy baseline without meaningful side effects that's the general definition of a notropic
and then a smart drug is uh usually and these terms are don't have solid semantic definitions
they're they're kind of uh slang terms but i'm going to give you the best general definitions
smart drug are usually pharmaceuticals that have some cognitive benefit generally for off-label
purposes so these are um either psychiatric meds like ADD or Ritalin or Welbutrin or narcolepsy meds
like uh midaphanel or Alzheimer's meds or Parkinson's meds levodopa things like that
that can increase wakefulness increase focus increase you know something um smart drugs
can enhance some aspect of cognitive function that someone uh wants to experience and you know
hypothetically this could be not just pharma drugs but any drug you could put cocaine or
methamphetamine or other drugs into those categories where they do modulate some neurotransmitter
like dopamine in a way that will have some cognitive effect but usually with some meaningful side
effects immediate side effects like they might up regulate focus but increase anxiety or paranoia
or irritability or something like that um and they might also have long-term side effects which
could be anything from like real physiological issues hepatotoxicity or something but also just
dependence right addiction forming because they're taking something like dopamine or acetylcholine
or glutamate or some neurotransmitter usually that your body naturally regulates and they're
overriding the natural regulatory process to spike it and in doing so if you do that enough times
can actually override the natural regulatory process where it becomes dependent on that
exogenous input that's what we call addiction uh no tropics the goal with no tropics and it's why
it's like kind of an almost like magic unicorn idea um is that there are some chemistries
that can be added to the system that can enhance some aspect of function without creating meaningful
short-term or long-term side effects so of all so obviously the way that you're describing it no
tropics improves your cognitive function above your average functionality without the side effects
smart drugs if we how to take your explanation is can also improve cognitive effect and they're good
for things like ADD and Alzheimer's but they come with problems they come with potential short and
long-term effects and i think there was a third one there brain nutrients right i think you broke
it into can just explain brain nutrients again as opposed as that is different from the smart
drugs and the no tropics essential fatty acids essential amino acids vitamins minerals antioxidants
the things that you would normally get from food that either you're not getting enough of from food
or that it's beneficial to get additional amounts of based on what you know what we're exposed to
how much we're actually using our brains and the cognitive load so these are basically
brain nutrients are either going to be things that could be found in food or things that could
be found endogenously in the body that the body would make from food gotcha okay so you're obviously
a proponent of no tropics of all those three correct and brain nutrients but not so much with
the smart drugs well again like i said bleach has a right application and any drug can have a right
application but in general there's such a there's such a profound complexity to how human physiology
works and complex means something different than complicated a circuit ship is complicated it was
designed externally you put a certain number of transistors linked them in particular way
a cell is complex it's self-organizing its boundary is non-arbitrary complex systems
behave in fundamentally different and and more organizing dynamic kind of ways than complicated
systems so when we look at human physiology and especially the brain it's such a radically
complex self-organizing uh dynamic homostatic system that we don't want to override that right so if
someone's dopamine is low our goal isn't to just give them in-chain dopamine or a dopamine agonist
it would be to say well let's see if we can understand the dopaminergic system better and see
how to support that system's endogenous regulatory capacity so that the intervention that we're doing
actually leads to lasting up regulation rather than short-term stimulus and then lasting down
regulation so in general for all kinds of inputs to biology i'm interested in things that understand
and that seek to better understand the body's natural dynamic homostatic processes and seek
to work with and up regulate them rather than override them gotcha okay so let's go back to
neurohacker collective um which is the organization that you that you co-founded what is its purpose
what is its mission and what is unique about its approach to neurohacking and applied psychoneuro
optimization yeah um so neurohacker collective our goal is optimizing the mind-brain interface
for the optimization of human experience and human capability writ large and so we are technology
agnostic meaning uh biochemical technologies that's both direct to consumer like no tropics and
nutraceuticals as well as things that could be you know doctor mediated for medical conditions and
general things that are direct to consumer are going to be and neurohacking the way we think of
it usually is not for curing illness but for optimization well-being support and enhancement
but a complexity approach and a systems biology approach to medicine is also very meaningful and
part of the deeper research that we're involved in um but so you know we work with biochemical
solutions we work with microbiomic solutions we're interested in genomic solutions in neurotech
transcranial lasers transcranial direct stem alternating currents you know ultrasound eeg
neurofeedback as well as psychotherapeutic and you know meditative technologies working with the
human hardware and software we're interested in anything that basically can up regulate some
aspect of human experience to have a better human experience or human capacity um for any kind of
personal condition and the reason why this is so meaningful for us is all of the other issues that
we care about in the world beyond human experience and capacity are affected by human experience
and capacity all the major problems that we see environmentally and socially uh etc are caused by
human activity and the solutions need to come about through human activity so upgrading the
comprehensive collective intelligence of humanity not just cognitive intelligence but uh interpersonal
intelligence you know etc ends up being a meaningful lever for every other thing worth doing
and to that extent you've created uh your own product called qualia q al i a um and i'm presuming
this is a no-tropic right yes okay so tell us a little bit about what this is like tell us a
little bit about why qualia is a little different and what typical experiences people might have
if they take this product that you've created so like i said we're working on a lot of different
areas of technology qualia is the first product that we have brought to market we have quite a
few other products in trials that will be coming to market this year and then some relatively
difficult ones that will take a little bit longer but are are developing well uh the goal with qualia
was when we look at the give or take 15 billion dollars a year domestically in energy drinks
and how much kind of caffeine stimulus happens and if we look at the estimated something like
five billion dollars in off-label aterol use not justified doctor aterol use which we can
question if it's ever a good thing but just people who are for their midterms or finals or tech
