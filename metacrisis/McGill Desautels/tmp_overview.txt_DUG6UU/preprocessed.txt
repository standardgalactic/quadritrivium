Checking McGill Desautels/Precision Convergence Webinar Seriesâ€¯with Dr. Karl Friston.txt
 The discussion was a panel conversation following Carl Chang's presentation on the integration of free energy principles with agent-based models and generative models, particularly in the context of COVID modeling and understanding complex systems. The panelists included Randy Nelson, Conrad Eichwald, Martin Hildebrandt, Alan Hammond, Mark Galassi, and Lauren Silberman, with John Collard moderating.

Key points from the conversation were:

1. **Interdisciplinary Integration**: The importance of integrating diverse approaches and disciplines to address complex questions in science, particularly those at the frontier where discovery is most likely to occur.

2. **Behavioral Emergence**: The challenge of understanding how behavior emerges from individual processes, including how genes and environment interact to create a vulnerable brain.

3. **Information as Fundamental**: Mark Galassi emphasized the idea that information is a fundamental element in the universe and how it interacts with experience to produce variation in behavior.

4. **Generative Models and Objective Functions**: The discussion highlighted the need for generative models to answer complex questions, including the choice of objective functions in such models.

5. **Application of Free Energy**: Conrad Eichwald shared examples of applying free energy principles in the domain of COVID modeling, emphasizing the importance of understanding the application and how it can lead to new insights.

6. **Precision Convergence**: The conversation underscored the goal of precision convergence, which is to build capacity for connecting diverse data types and models to address real-world problems in real time.

7. **Community Building**: The session was seen as an opportunity to build a community of researchers and practitioners who are interested in integrating different approaches to solve complex scientific questions.

8. **Next Steps**: The panelists expressed their excitement for the future of multi-agent active inference and the patterns that will emerge from such models. They also looked forward to the next presentation by Satya Ghosh from MIT on neuroinformatics infrastructure development.

9. **Gratitude**: There was a collective expression of gratitude for the contributions of all participants, organizers, and the audience for their time and intellectual investment in fostering precision convergence at the edge of science.

The session concluded with a thank you to Carl Chang for his insightful presentation and a reminder about the upcoming presentation by Satya Ghosh on May 24. The event highlighted the importance of continued dialogue, asking questions, and attempting to answer them to advance our understanding of complex systems and inform real-world transformations.
