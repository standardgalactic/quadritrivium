evolution, our knowledge too is evolving in a slow process over hundreds and thousands of years,
driven by the pursuit of science, and hopefully ever decreasing ignorance.
Hey guys, this video is sponsored by the newly released sci-fi novel New Eden by Kishore Tepreneni.
New Eden is a mind-boggling story of quantum entanglement and the origins of life.
Follow physicist Joshua Andrews and journalist Rachel Miller as they discover
that entangled particles were created at the moment of the Big Bang,
creating a universe-wide communication network. So if you love sci-fi based on some real science,
I highly recommend New Eden. It's available now from Amazon. The link is in the description below.
