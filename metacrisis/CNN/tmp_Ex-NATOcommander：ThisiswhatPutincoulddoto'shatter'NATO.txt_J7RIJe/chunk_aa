General Clark, you said recently that the world should be, in your words, expecting
a frustrated Putin to do something.
Can you elaborate on what you mean, and also how would you, if you were in your prior post
as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, how would you be preparing for that?
Well, I think, first of all, you have to anticipate what he might do.
So the use of chemical weapons seems to be a little bit premature, except perhaps in
going after Marie Opel, but it's not that significant.
So I think the chemical weapons threat is a more far-fetched threat.
If he really wants to deter NATO involvement, and he believes that he can shatter NATO,
then he would perhaps use a low-yield nuclear weapon.
And where would he use it?
Probably not in Ukraine, but perhaps on the staging areas or some populated area in Poland.
This is what's usually done in the Russian exercises.
So the way they postulate in their exercises is that if Russia starts to lose because of
NATO's support for the opposition, then, pal, they send a nuclear weapon in.
NATO says, oh, my goodness, we don't want a nuclear war.
That would be the third world war, okay?
That's serious about it.
We'll back off.
So this is the way the Russians have educated themselves to think about what they would
do in a circumstance like this.
And this is why there's so much concern on the part of the administration and other
NATO leaders, because we all know this.
