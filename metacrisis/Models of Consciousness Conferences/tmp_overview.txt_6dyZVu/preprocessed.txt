1. The talk begins by discussing the interplay between action and perception in vision, which can be understood through the free energy principle (FEP). This principle suggests that living systems aim to minimize variational free energy over time to ensure their continued existence in a meaningful way.

2. Active inference is a theory derived from the FEP, where living systems predict sensations they will encounter and actively sample these predictions to reduce uncertainty or expected Bayesian surprise.

3. The speaker is interested in active vision, a generative process within active inference where fictive locations (predictions) influence changes in position in the generative model, leading to action as part of this process.

4. The equations governing this generative process can be translated into neural message passing between populations of neurons, with excitatory prediction errors and inhibitory predictions characterizing predictive coding.

5. Exteroceptive vision and proprioception are seen as interconnected processes that both aim to minimize free energy by contextualizing each other. This implies that vision is not just about passively collecting sensory data but involves an active exploration of the world, focusing on what is salient for a particular phenotype.

6. The future work proposed aims to explore the links between network topology and neural dynamics, particularly how the brain adapts and reorganizes according to cognitive interactions with the environment, considering the role of subjective experience in these processes.

In summary, the talk outlines a framework for understanding vision not just as a passive sensory process but as an active, goal-directed exploration that is rooted in the imperative to minimize free energy. The speaker emphasizes the importance of integrating exteroceptive and proprioceptive information and suggests that future research should focus on how subjective experience influences neural connections and deployment.

1. Nguyen's question pertains to metacognition and its connection to conscious experiences, particularly in light of evidence from animal studies suggesting that some form of metacognitive ability exists even if it is unconscious.

2. Francken's response outlines the connection between metacognitive processes and consciousness within his predictive processing framework, which uses a Bayesian model selection approach to understand natural selection.

3. In this framework, evolution is seen as optimizing the structure of genetic models through a process analogous to structure learning in radical constructivism. This involves both encoding beliefs (i.e., recognizing content) and estimating the uncertainty or precision of these beliefs.

4. Francken emphasizes that for belief structures to be fully optimized, it is necessary to estimate not just the certainty of the belief but also the precision, or uncertainty, about this belief. This estimation of precision occurs at every hierarchical level and is essential for accurate inference.

5. At a high level in the hierarchy, when estimating the precision of beliefs associated with oneself, this can be seen as a form of metacognitive processing that might underlie certain aspects of consciousness or self-hood.

6. Francken suggests that this metacognitive processing, which involves optimizing the precision of predictions at different levels, could be the kind of internal action or mental process that houses a conversation about consciousness, even if it is not yet self-awareness.

7. Nguyen acknowledges that the self-component Francken describes might be distinct from the conscious dimension, opening up further debate on the relationship between self and consciousness.
