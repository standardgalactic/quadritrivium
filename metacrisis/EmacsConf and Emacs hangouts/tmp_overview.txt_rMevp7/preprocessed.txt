 The FRGCSA (Free Research Group Computer Science Applications) project has been working for over 20 years on creating a comprehensive system that integrates thousands of AI tools to assist users in planning and managing their lives. This system, known as the Free Life Planner (FLP), aims to take into account all aspects of a user's life, from finances to meal planning, transportation, healthcare, and beyond.

The FLP is part of a larger suite of over 600 custom code bases developed by FRGCSA, which are accessible through a virtual machine distribution called Panoply. This distribution includes Emacs, Prolog, and Pearl, among other tools, as its core development environment.

FRGCSA excels at finding, packaging, and repurposing software, with a particular focus on natural language understanding to spider the internet for rules and information. It also uses information extraction systems (IES) to identify and label text with metadata, which is then converted into machine-readable format by NLU-MF.

The system reasons with common-sense rules through an AI called psych or its open-source alternative, Libre logic-move. The FLP currently offers functionalities like calendaring, reminders, and scheduling, but the goal is to make it even more robust and capable of crowdsource life planning.

FRGCSA also includes a software robot called Prolog Agent, which can autonomously package software based on recorded traces and eventually use that software to achieve objectives. Additionally, Clear, a tool for reading books, manuals, and websites aloud with the ability to pause, quit, resume, and filter content, is designed to help users learn about the tools they need to manage their lives effectively.

The project aims to release a public alpha version of Panoply in the coming months and invites interested individuals to join FRDCSA and Freelife Planner on FreeNode to test and familiarize themselves with the system. The story of "homelessstory.html" is provided as a use case to illustrate the practical application and potential of the FLP.

In summary, FRGCSA's Free Life Planner is an ambitious project that integrates AI, rule-based systems, and software management to help individuals plan and improve their lives with a focus on practicality and learning. The project is moving towards a public release and encourages community involvement and testing.
