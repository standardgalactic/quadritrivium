Checking Corrado Pezzato/Active inference in Robotics - My PhD at AIRLab Delft.txt
 Corrado, as a PhD student in Cognitive Robotics at AIRLAB (the AI for Retail Lab), is focused on the challenge of integrating simple skills into complex systems so that robots can reliably perform tasks in environments designed for humans, such as supermarkets. The task of stocking an empty shelf, which might seem straightforward to a human, is actually quite complex for robots due to potential failures in perception systems or unpredictable events.

To address this, Corrado is exploring a control architecture that allows robots to adapt and recover from such situations using the principles of active inference, a scientific theory that models decision-making processes in the brain. This approach aims to enable robots to handle tasks with some level of variability and ultimately achieve a high degree of autonomy.

While current research has made progress in this area, there is still a significant gap between where the field is now and the fully autonomous robots that can operate safely and effectively alongside humans in everyday settings. The goal is to advance robotics responsibly and ethically to contribute positively to society. Corrado and his colleagues are working towards a future where robots like these become seamlessly integrated into our daily lives.

 Corrado Pezzato from the Connective Robotics Department at the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands, along with his colleagues, has developed an adaptive control system for robot manipulators using Active Inference (AI). This approach is particularly useful for robotics operating in unstructured or changing environments where precise modeling of the robot's dynamics is challenging. Here's a summary of the key points from Pezzato's presentation:

1. **Problem Context**: Traditional control methods, such as Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC), require accurate models of the system they are controlling. However, in dynamic or unpredictable environments, these models can become outdated or unreliable, leading to suboptimal performance or safety issues.

2. **Active Inference Approach**: Active Inference is a method that allows for control without relying on an explicit model of the system's dynamics. Instead, it uses a reference model that the system aims to follow, adapting in real-time to changes in the environment or the robot itself.

3. **Design Choices**: The team simplified the design by treating the state to be controlled as the joint positions and encoding a simple relationship between the torque applied and the acceleration produced. They avoided complex modeling of the full dynamics, focusing on a model-free control law that is adaptable and robust.

4. **Simulation and Real-World Testing**: The AI controller was first tested in simulation using an approximated model of the robot (Franca Emica Panda 70-crisis). Then it was applied to the real robot, which showed less oscillation and smoother performance compared to the MRAC benchmark.

5. **Performance Comparison**: The AI controller demonstrated faster and smoother response times in a pick-and-place scenario, with fewer tuning parameters (6 vs. 119 for MRAC). It was also computationally inexpensive, running within a 300 microsecond time constraint on a standard laptop.

6. **Contributions and Future Work**: The study provides experimental evidence for the value of Active Inference in adaptive control of robot manipulators. The team has developed the first online closed-loop torque control AI scheme for robotics that is model-free, easy to tune, computationally lightweight, and transferable from simulation to a real-world setup without retuning.

7. **Challenges and Future Directions**: While the AI controller has been shown to be stable in practice, a formal mathematical proof of stability remains to be established. This will be addressed in future work, along with exploring the potential of Active Inference in more complex scenarios and across different types of robots.

In conclusion, Corrado Pezzato and his team have made significant advancements in the field of adaptive control for robotics using Active Inference, paving the way for more robust, versatile, and easier-to-tune systems that can operate effectively in a variety of environments.
