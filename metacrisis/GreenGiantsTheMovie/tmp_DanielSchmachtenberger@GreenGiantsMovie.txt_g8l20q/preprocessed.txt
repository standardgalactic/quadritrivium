If we don't care about just part of the problem, if our care isn't limited to just coral reef
or species extinction or education or health care or African kids or any part of it but
it includes and transcends all of that, and what we want is a truly viable world system
that makes possible the highest quality of life for all life now and ongoingly and with
the maximized evolutionary rate, how do we get from where we are as a species to that
world system as quickly and efficiently as possible as one integrated meta-endever factoring
everything.
That's the most critical thing is an approach for how we really address what our task as
a human species is on this planet.
The first thing we have to get clear on is what are all of the problems that need addressed
and how do they all inter-effect each other and what are the timelines and scopes and
magnitudes on those and not the UN, not World Watch, no organization centrally understands
how all of the parts really fit together right now.
We've been dealing with it in a very parts-based, fragmented, disintegrated way and there really
aren't national issues anymore.
There aren't industry issues because it doesn't matter who's polluting in a one world ocean,
one world atmosphere and we're all, we're globalization and the power of technology
has made all the industries totally interconnected.
