You know, if we do focus on the blind spots,
we really make a difference and progress.
And then that motivates this movement
towards the body as precarious source of significance,
which is the whole point of the inactive approach
at different levels.
It's the same point many times.
And this is why the inactive approach
can provide this...
You know, it's trying to focus on this question
and provide definitions of agency, values,
sense-making, social interaction, and so forth.
And that leads us with, you know, of course, lots of open challenges.
You know, understanding habits and skills, as you already said,
that habits is such a rich concept
that it's very hard to pin it down, but it's possible.
Understanding the subjectivity, understanding this notion
of a social flesh, of the social invisible,
as well as the typical challenges
of understanding higher forms of mediation
and higher forms of cognition.
That's also a challenge for the inactive approach.
You know, understanding what makes a human self.
But I think I'll stop there because it's too much.
And yeah, thank you.
Thank you.
