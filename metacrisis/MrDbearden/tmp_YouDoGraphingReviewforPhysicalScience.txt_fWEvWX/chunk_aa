Hello.
Hey.
Brown sugar.
That's me.
Can anybody hear me?
All right.
Loud and clear.
Loud and clear. Okay. Am I too loud?
Okay.
Let's see.
Well, that's, that's a little bit more response than I kind of expected.
David.
The hippie and the athlete, you guys are crazy.
Who's that?
Okay, we'll give it just a minute or so more and see if.
Anybody else is going to show up.
So.
All right.
Let me check. I'm checking. I was doing another thing.
Okay.
Okay.
David, what's up with your name?
I'm talking to David.
All right. So that's about three minutes.
Three or four minutes. So.
All right. So my, my intention was to just kind of start where you guys
are.
Let's see.
I'm trying to remember. I know somebody was using.
Google sheets.
Or some other software. Does everybody here have.
Excel or.
Okay, Jacob.
And you do too, David. Okay.
Addison turned off her iPad. So I can't tell.
I can't see.
You can tell her to start her video.
Oh, there she is. Okay, cool.
So do you have Excel, Edison or.
Okay. All right. So.
Because I also had to kind of learn Google sheets and I found out that
it's not so great. So.
All right, let me share my screen here.
Okay.
So.
Too many options.
Okay. So.
Can, can y'all still see me? Yeah, I guess my camera is still on.
Okay. So here's the, here's the assignment sheet.
And so essentially the first task was just to type in all this info.
And this is the way I typed it in.
And so.
That's where I am on this. Okay. And I.
Called it raw data. So, so.
If you want to, so we're going to have multiple tabs as we go across
here.
And so.
That's actually pretty useful as long as you name them something.
Oh, let's see. Someone just came in.
Where is this?
I'm sorry.
Let me stop sharing real quick.
I thought somebody came in.
But it's not okay. Share again.
All right.
So.
Rather than having us sit here and watch me type this in.
I just opened a new blank Excel spreadsheet.
And I typed in this information. Okay.
And I'm just going across here and you can see that's exactly what I typed.
I just.
All right.
And so, and in fact, if you looked at the table in the book,
I think this number.
I made a typo or changed it. So all the numbers should match what's in the
book.
I've got the length in this column, the mass in this column.
And then we did.
Three trials.
Supposedly.
And this is the results from the three trials for the three different
lengths. So this is an experiment.
We didn't actually get the time to do.
In class and our.
In our class experiment, we kept the length set to.
Whatever it was.
And then we changed the mass.
So the table from class will be a little bit different.
Okay. So the first task then is to type in this data.
And then the next task is to try to make it look like this as much as
possible.
Now, unfortunately, I made a mistake in taking this picture.
You see row one.
This picture starts with row two. And I should have included row one.
Which would look like this row.
But I made a boo boo.
So some of you guys caught that and made it look exactly like that
picture, which is good.
All right. So, so that I.
For when I turn in my homework, I want to be able to show that I did
this.
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to.
Copy this date, this whole table to a new sheet.
So I right click and I'm going to say move or copy.
And I'm going to leave it in this same notebook.
I'm going to move it to the end, but I'm going to create a copy.
So now I have two.
Tabs that have the exact same information in them.
I.
And so what I want to do is rename this tab just to keep my
homework.
Clear. So that's task two. So I'm going to call this.
I'll double click that it highlights it and I can type tasks.
So I'm going to call this task two.
Enter.
All right. So now I want to start formatting this in some way.
So.
Let me just.
Walk through this. So one way to make a title go all the way across.
And be centered is to do a merge.
And on my toolbar here, I have the merge command.
And it says merge and center.
And now you see that is all one cell.
There's no.
Cell G1.
Let's see the other thing I might want to do is go ahead and put in
this color.
So let me highlight these guys and say make the field color.
Match what's on the screen there.
And depending on whether you have a Mac or PC,
you might see different colors here.
So let me just pick, say, this color.
And then look dark enough.
Let me pick a different darker, darker rows.
Maybe that's it. Okay.
And I also wanted to get these ones across here filled in the same color.
So I highlight it and I can use the same color.
I just add by clicking again. So there's some color.
I'm actually below.
I see that that one has a dark red background.
So let me go ahead and pick a darker red.
Maybe this guy.
So now you see that the problem is, is I can't.
See the writing in that one. So I want to change the color,
the color of that text. So I'll highlight that cell.
Go here.
And I'll say make the text white.
I'll say make the text white.
It also looks bigger.
So since that cell is highlighted, I want to make the font bigger.
So I have a,
I can either pick a specific font here.
Or I can just say.
With this thing here, scale it up.
And maybe it's also bold so I can make it bold.
Okay.
So one of the things I noticed is that, um,
Well, I need to change the colors of these fonts to white as well.
So let me go ahead and do that.
I'm going to highlight those things and say make that white font.
And highlight these things and make that a white font.
Okay.
Um,
So I also just look at the way these columns are arranged.
I see it looks like everything is centered in the box.
So I'm going to highlight all of those squares and say center them.
In the box. So there's an icon to do that.
Um, I can also, if I right click,
I get a format.
Uh, cells.
Function, which gives me a whole lot of choices here.
Um, so I could go under alignment and say,
Uh,
Um,
I'm going to line it in the center.
And I actually want this to be in the middle of those boxes.
Let's see what that does.
Uh,
Oh, I see you made a boo boo. So I made this thing too big.
So I'm going to unmerge that.
And then this box accidentally has some color in it.
So I'm going to get rid of that and say no fill. All right.
So it's starting to look a little bit like these things.
Everything's centered.
Everything's in a column.
Um,
The text goes off the screen here.
So what I need to do is adjust the width of these columns.
So if I highlight them all.
I can highlight them.
And then if I put my mouse here and drag.
Well, it didn't do it.
I'm going to undo that with command Z.
I'm going to go here and drag. Yeah.
That's not doing it either.
Okay. So I'm going to.
Oops.
That didn't do so well under that.
So sometimes I'm just poking around here. All right.
So if I double click each of these lines, then.
