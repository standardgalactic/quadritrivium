It makes the column wide enough to put everything in there.
Um,
Which is not good because now I see I've got these huge wide columns.
And I really wanted something that was a, you know,
About as wide as the first column there.
So I need to fix that part of the problem is,
is that I really want this stuff to not be stretched out.
I want it to wrap in the cells.
I'm going to highlight those cells and do a right click.
I'm going to format those cells.
I'm going to say, wrap the text.
Here's a text control button.
I'm going to say, wrap the text.
And let's see what that does.
Well, it doesn't do much until I go in and I make these things.
Now, ah, now.
It made the text kind of fit a little better.
Um, and I can make these, uh,
I guess one of the things I'm not very good at is making these all the same
with some, uh,
Uh,
Just drag it onto a certain way as what I can do.
If I drag this, okay.
Do you see that it says that the width is 1.18 inches.
I'm going to stretch that out to make it like, uh,
Well, make it 1.19.
I can make all of these 1.19.
And I know that somewhere in Excel,
there's a way to do this automatically for all these cells.
But, um,
Okay.
Now let's look at what we notice.
Um,
Y'all are awfully quiet.
Is anybody got a
Question or anything?
Um,
All right.
So one of the things I notice is that, uh,
this picture,
it looks like the lines between the boxes are dark.
So probably I need to see about putting a border on each of these boxes.
So let me highlight all the boxes.
And then I want to go to the border function.
Um,
And there's an icon here.
I can also, if I say format.
These cells format cells,
which is command one on a Macintosh.
Um, there's a tab here for border as well.
So you can really control the borders and find detail if you want.
I happen to know that the thing that I'd really like is already here on this
button where to go right there.
And I want to click this.
Just put a single dark line on all the borders.
Okay.
So that's looking a little better.
All right.
Um,
So at this point, I kind of see.
A couple of things that, uh,
Catch my eye. Well, this column isn't 1.19 wide either. Okay.
So now my columns here are about the same width.
Um,
So one of the things that I notice is the,
the number formatting. So for example,
In this column, it says one.
And then here it's 0.8 and so forth.
So what I want to do is make all these have the same number of decimal
places.
So I'm going to highlight them.
Going to right click.
I'm going to format these cells.
All right.
And it says, it sees that there's numbers in there.
So I'll get this number.
So I select that and I go to number.
Uh, and here I can tell it, give each one of those.
Well, it comes up with two decimal places.
I only want one decimal place.
All right.
And it shows me a little sample of what it's going to look like when
I select that.
So one lot.
Now I have 1.0.
And just, that's what, that's what I wanted right there.
So I'm going to go ahead and, uh,
look at these other numbers here and they're also all to one decimal
place.
So I'm going to do that same thing.
All these numbers.
I'm going to highlight them.
Right click.
Format cells.
Tell them, yes, it is a number and I want one decimal place.
I'm going to highlight them.
Right click.
Format cells.
Okay. So now.
So let me, so you say, well, that's not a big deal.
Well, uh, let me undo it.
With the command Z and look at this number here.
So it went from 12 with no decimal place.
And then command Y lets me redo it.
To 12.0.
So now they're all to the same number of decimal places.
All right. So that might be helpful to you.
All right. We're getting really close.
The problem that I noticed though,
is that like on this one,
it says length and then on a line below it says meters.
So how can I do that?
One way might be to maybe drag the cell like that.
Okay. That kind of does it,
but it's not the right width compared to the target that we had.
So try to play and drag it out a little bit.
It's going to stay with me for a little while.
Oops, but then it switches back.
So what I'd really like to do is.
Figure out a way to put a line feed in there.
So let me.
Go to this and I'm going to go to insert character.
Or insert special character.
Where is that?
Insert a symbol.
I happen to know that that's on the symbols menu.
And that comes up.
2222. Where is that thing?
Special. Okay. Special character.
Now that's not what I want. I want.
Does anybody know where that is?
I'm looking for a line feed.
Could be an arrows.
Or arrows, you think.
Now see that'll just put an arrow in there.
So I'm going to use the help system.
I want to insert.
See what comes up here.
No results found.
Oh, maybe it's under keyboard shortcuts.
That's what I want.
I'm not seeing it.
Looking for a line.
Okay. Did I have to go to my.
Show me my keyboard.
I'm going to insert a character.
What I want to do is insert a character turn.
So maybe what I'm going to do since I can't find the exact thing,
I'm going to try some key combinations.
So if I just hit return.
Okay.
It just goes to the next cell.
That's not what I want.
Double click on it. I want to hit.
Let me try a shift return.
Well, that didn't work.
You know, when I found this before.
Command shift return.
I said, I'm going to remember this because I'm going to make sure
these kids know how to do it.
And there.
Here I go.
All right. So.
Where, oh, where.
Can you just add spaces?
Well, you could add spaces, but that's like.
I call that typewriter word processing.
Because when you do that, like in a word document,
it's always going to come back to bite you.
Right. Because if I say I misspelled the word length.
And I go back and correct it later than that might shift everything
around.
So in desperation, you might do that,
but we're not quite desperate.
I know there's a way to find this because I found it.
And this is the bad thing about Excel is.
I know it's going to be in the help system.
So I'm going to insert.
Okay.
That's entering cells.
Formatting and entering data.
So this is, this is kind of the bad place to be because.
Number one, none of these help things here seem to be.
What I want.
Okay.
Let me cheat.
Because I know how to do it.
Elsewhere. So here's the one I worked from.
All right, so I'm going to go into this guy.
I'm going to.
Highlight that and copy it.
I'm going to close.
I know there's a way to do this and then I'm going to paste it in
there. All right.
Also, if you notice that.
So once you find that line feed character and figure out how to
put it in there, you can cut and paste it wherever you want.
And so actually, if you, let me see this last one.
Average time for 10.
I think I put it in here as well.
