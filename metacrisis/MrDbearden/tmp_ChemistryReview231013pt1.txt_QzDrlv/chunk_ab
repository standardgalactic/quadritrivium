And I know the units.
I always write down the units and it would help you to do that too.
I can't remember what you did on the last test, but.
Okay. Now I need to check.
So hurts doesn't sound like meters or seconds,
but it's actually.
I'm going to put it in a more conventional unit.
And it's one over seconds.
Okay. So let's write.
Let's keep going.
It's 3.0.
10 to the eight.
I'm going to put the numbers together so I can.
Run my calculator or you can run the calculator at 6.4.
Times 10 to the.
14. Maybe I can write 14.
A little better this time.
And then the units are.
Meters.
Per second.
Okay. So let's write.
Let's keep going.
It's 3.0.
10 to the eight.
Meters.
Per second.
Divided by.
One over seconds.
All right. So if you put this number, do you have a calculator?
Yeah, I got one. Okay. Go ahead and do that number in the calculator.
I got.
We round up, right?
Yeah, that's going to be a multi just give me the first, say,
three digits.
Okay. Cause it's significant figures.
4.6.
8.
0.6.
8.
Times.
And then 10 and says exponent negative seven.
Okay.
All right. So that's the number that looks about right to me.
I was kind of mentally doing that.
Now we've got to deal with the units. All right.
So we have meters per second.
Divided by one per second.
How would you see simplifying that?
Well, what we would do is wouldn't we just,
we would cancel out the one in the meter and there would just be a
regular one over us.
Cause wouldn't.
No, that.
No, meters can't cancel out.
Meters is a unit and one is dimensionless.
So that can't cancel out.
So maybe you learn to do.
Tractions by flipping the bottom one upside down.
So I have meters per second.
And then if I flip the bottom one upside down,
I have seconds.
For one.
Does that ring any bells with doing fractions?
Yeah, that rings a bell.
Okay.
So one is just a number.
I could put it over here and divide this by one.
But I know what the answer is going to be.
Seconds here canceled seconds here.
So my final result is meters.
So that says 4.68.
And then we have to convert meters to.
Correct.
I'm going to put the divisor line in there.
All right. I want meters.
Cancel out.
So I want meters in the bottom.
And I.
Nanometers would be really convenient.
So I'm going to put nanometers in the numerator.
Just making sense.
And I just got to put two numbers here that make this equal to one.
Okay.
So nanometers are fractions. There's less than a meter.
So I'm going to put a number here.
And I'm going to say in one meter.
How many nanometers do I have?
If we're converting to nanometers,
we put the one on the nanometers and then do.
One time.
This is easier math.
Okay.
And if I listen to the sentence, I'm about to say.
In one meter, how many nanometers do you have?
Is it 10, a hundred, a thousand?
What does the word nano mean?
Um, nano.
Nano kind of.
That's one billionth.
Negative. Yeah. So now it'd be negative nine.
Right.
10.
That looks like 16. Sorry.
Minus nine.
Or 10 to the plus nine.
So there's a billion.
Nanometers in one meter.
Okay.
So now I can do,
since this is an exponential times an exponential,
I can easily do that in my head.
So it's minus seven.
Plus nine.
So my answer in nanometers.
Is for.
Shoot.
Oh.
Yeah.
Well, if I knew where there was an undo button.
Okay. Let me.
I'm here.
Again.
4.68.
Times.
10 to the minus seven.
Times 10 to the minus nine.
So I'm going to get 4.68.
Times.
Minus seven plus nine is plus two.
10 to the two.
And the only unit because meters cancels meters.
The only unit remaining is nanometers.
Okay.
Now I'd like to get this into a form that I can easily look at
that graph.
And see, so what is 10 to the second is what?
That's the hundreds.
Yeah. So if I multiply this number by a hundred.
468.
468.
It's going to be between 500 nanometers and 450,
which would make it blue light.
So I'm going to get blue.
So that would be faster than me.
Or 68.
Yeah. It's that blue green region there.
Isn't it?
A blue indigo.
So we'll say, I mean, I don't know how you figure that out.
The only other way would be to get a table somewhere that gives you
specific frequencies. So yeah.
So then that means that that's blue.
And you might say blue slash indigo.
Color.
All right. Does that help?
That helps. That helps with that problem. I have, um,
I have two more, I have two more questions.
Okay.
About this, um, this specific part about it. So.
Let me ask the end of real quick on the end. Did you hear that?
Did you have any questions or problems?
You probably have to unmute.
No, I don't have any questions.
Okay.
So.
There we go.
Um, so I'm just going to erase this.
I know there's probably a screen erase.
But in somewhere, but.
This is.
Almost okay.
All right. What's your next question?
So we're, let me ask you something first.
So it's working at that way.
Do you think you can answer your, uh,
Questions on the.
What, uh, wavelength and.
Frequency questions or.
Cause you had another question that was on a different topic.
I have, um, I have a similar question to this. It's.
Asking like what the frequency range would be.
If they were, if they gave me like two, um.
Wouldn't I have to. So.
On your end question 3.5.
Yeah, that one's a little bit confusing to me.
Okay. So.
They're giving you two frequencies.
F1.
And F2.
And they're saying, uh, what is the frequency range.
A red light.
Sorry guys.
Potential spam once again.
So what we need to do.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I gave wavelengths. So scratch that.
So they give you a little lamb to one.
And lambda to, they give you two different wavelengths.
And they want to know what frequency range.
And between these two wavelengths, they say that's,
