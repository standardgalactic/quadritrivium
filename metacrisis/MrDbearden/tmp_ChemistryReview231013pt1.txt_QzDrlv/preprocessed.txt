Thanks again for being here and helping us out with this.
No problem. Nothing better to do.
Actually, tomorrow is a big day.
What is this showing me?
Oh yeah, so I can chat.
Tomorrow is a big day for the Ham radio club.
If y'all are at, if you want to go to Olive Branch City Park on a Saturday, we're going to have him.
Ham radio thing and free food at noon.
So.
This may chat.
I hadn't been in zoom in a while, so it's changed a bit.
Yeah, I had to do teams when, when COVID happened. I didn't do zoom. I use teams.
Oh, is that okay.
A little bit different for me too.
Okay.
Well, let's.
Darn, I was gonna.
I gotta figure out how my iPad works because I haven't used that in a while.
I hope I can remember.
I guess I just have to share my screen, but I was trying to find the app. Oh my goodness.
I don't even remember what the icon looks like.
So.
As much as I did zoom during COVID, you'd think I would remember some of this, but maybe it's because it's a bad memory.
I don't have some tablet.
Okay.
That's going to help me.
I'm going to go to my apps here. Sorry, I'm floundering around.
Oh,
I can't have it.
That's not what I want.
I don't even remember if I used a different type of app to use this.
And I don't have a.
I don't know.
Something's going to jog my memories here because I can't.
There's open board. Let's try that.
No, maybe.
All right.
This will let me write that I have to remember how to erase.
And I guess that raises. Okay.
Good.
All right, I have a way to write. That's better than a kick in the head.
This thing may cut off because it said without a subscription, I have to.
I can only get 40 minutes. So hopefully we can get through your questions. And so go ahead and let's start. What's your highest priority?
My highest priority right now is the understanding the frequency equations like in on your own.
3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.
Okay, what page is that?
In the workbook that is page 82 and 83.
I've only got the textbook so.
Let's.
All right, I'm going to share my screen.
So many options.
And it's got an exclamation point.
In the textbook, it should be on page 103, I believe.
103 and 104.
Okay.
Let's just do desktop.
Okay.
Yeah, so many.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah. Here we go.
Not be able to record the contents of your screen until it is correct.
Okay, I don't care that much about recording.
Okay, let's try and share my screen now.
There we go.
Share.
All right, so you see a big whiteboard?
Yes.
Okay, I'm sorry. What page did you say on the book?
In the book 103 and then 104.
Three.
I see example.
3.2.
Oh, okay.
All right, so 3.4 says what color.
Is light that has a frequency of something. Okay, so.
Let's see.
So we have light with.
Well, how to get on that again.
I go to pencil.
Okay.
Oh boy, I'm doing something wrong here.
Stay on pencil.
Well, this, oh, I got the pen turned upside down. That'll do it every time.
Okay, so a frequency.
Boy, that's horrible running.
6.4.
6.4.
Stand to the.
14.
It's.
And it wants the color.
Okay. How do we get color?
Color.
Out of a frequency.
You would have to convert to like nanometers, right?
And then.
Well, let's look at what the book has in terms of a conversion table.
So on page 100, it's got a.
Red to violet.
Spectrum and it gives wavelengths at the bottom, right?
And now meters.
All right.
So that's, so we need to turn frequency.
Into.
Wavelength.
And we may then have to, if we get the wavelength in the wrong units,
we may have to convert that.
To.
Wavelength.
In nanometers.
Right.
Is that legible enough to you?
Yeah. Yeah. I can, I can see it correctly.
Okay.
So how do we go from frequency to wavelength? We have equation.
Let's see. How do they put it in the book?
F equals C over lambda.
Okay.
And C is equal to state of light.
Yeah. Well, so this is one of those three part equations and.
You really need to.
Be able to manipulate these. So let me just.
I don't know what the first version is that the book gives,
but let's just write C.
Is equal to F.
Lambda.
Okay. So.
We'll have.
In your science studies,
you'll see equations like this all the time.
Now it turns out that we know that C is just a number.
So it's a constant.
All right. And we can look that up or know it from memory from the textbook.
F is a frequency in some unit and lambda is a,
is a wavelength in some unit.
So what we can do is rearrange this in many useful ways.
So if I want to solve for frequency.
What I need to have to solve this equation and rearrange it for frequency.
I divide both sides by lambda.
And so on the left side, I would have C over lambda.
Okay. So that's one way.
So this is one form of the equation. This is another one.
And we should be able to get another one. If we want to solve for lambda.
We say that lambda is equal to.
And I divide this equation by F on both sides.
Are you following that when I say divide by F on both sides?
Yeah. Cause it cancels the, it cancels the F from the lambda.
So it'd be a lambda equals C over F.
Correct.
Yeah. All right. So we won't do electronics in this book,
but if you've ever done, well, probably in physical science,
you had the resistance equation V equals IR.
And you have to arrange that again,
since there's three components in there,
you can arrange that three different ways to solve any problem.
So here we need to go from frequency to wavelength.
So now you just said this out loud a minute ago,
but it looks like this is the one that we would like to have.
All right.
So let's say that our wavelength for this problem is going to be B,
which is 3.0 times,
which form does the book use centimeters per second or.
It uses it just as the notation of eight, I think it's hurts.
Okay. That's meters per second. Okay.
Cause sometimes people use the speed of light and centimeters per second
or other units, nanometers per second.
So all right. So it's 10 to the eight.
And I always carry my units along when I'm writing these out meters per second.
So that's the speed of light in the numerator and then the denominator.
Well, that's horrible.
We need the frequency.
So that's what we wrote down first.
So that's 6.4 times 10 to the 14.
Hurts is Lambda is Lambda frequency or is Lambda.
So are we, it's asking for us to solve for the frequency.
So wouldn't that mean that the,
it should be frequency equals C over Lambda.
Well, no, it gives us the frequency.
That's a given.
Oh, and then we got it.
Well, the question is what color is it?
Oh, that makes sense now. That makes sense.
So the only thing we have to go from either frequency or wavelength to
color is this figure.
That's on page.
Wherever it was.
I think I flip cast it.
Page 100.
Okay. So that,
and that picture is given in wavelength.
So we have to take our frequency and get to wavelength.
And that's the step we're doing right here.
We're going from frequency to wavelength.
Do you see that now?
I do. Yeah.
That makes sense.
And the unit is hurts.
So I always.
Unless this is a calculation that I put into a spreadsheet or
something that I do every day.
And I know the units.
I always write down the units and it would help you to do that too.
I can't remember what you did on the last test, but.
Okay. Now I need to check.
So hurts doesn't sound like meters or seconds,
but it's actually.
I'm going to put it in a more conventional unit.
And it's one over seconds.
Okay. So let's write.
Let's keep going.
It's 3.0.
10 to the eight.
I'm going to put the numbers together so I can.
Run my calculator or you can run the calculator at 6.4.
Times 10 to the.
14. Maybe I can write 14.
A little better this time.
And then the units are.
Meters.
Per second.
Okay. So let's write.
Let's keep going.
It's 3.0.
10 to the eight.
Meters.
Per second.
Divided by.
One over seconds.
All right. So if you put this number, do you have a calculator?
Yeah, I got one. Okay. Go ahead and do that number in the calculator.
I got.
We round up, right?
Yeah, that's going to be a multi just give me the first, say,
three digits.
Okay. Cause it's significant figures.
4.6.
8.
0.6.
8.
Times.
And then 10 and says exponent negative seven.
Okay.
All right. So that's the number that looks about right to me.
I was kind of mentally doing that.
Now we've got to deal with the units. All right.
So we have meters per second.
Divided by one per second.
How would you see simplifying that?
Well, what we would do is wouldn't we just,
we would cancel out the one in the meter and there would just be a
regular one over us.
Cause wouldn't.
No, that.
No, meters can't cancel out.
Meters is a unit and one is dimensionless.
So that can't cancel out.
So maybe you learn to do.
Tractions by flipping the bottom one upside down.
So I have meters per second.
And then if I flip the bottom one upside down,
I have seconds.
For one.
Does that ring any bells with doing fractions?
Yeah, that rings a bell.
Okay.
So one is just a number.
I could put it over here and divide this by one.
But I know what the answer is going to be.
Seconds here canceled seconds here.
So my final result is meters.
So that says 4.68.
And then we have to convert meters to.
Correct.
I'm going to put the divisor line in there.
All right. I want meters.
Cancel out.
So I want meters in the bottom.
And I.
Nanometers would be really convenient.
So I'm going to put nanometers in the numerator.
Just making sense.
And I just got to put two numbers here that make this equal to one.
Okay.
So nanometers are fractions. There's less than a meter.
So I'm going to put a number here.
And I'm going to say in one meter.
How many nanometers do I have?
If we're converting to nanometers,
we put the one on the nanometers and then do.
One time.
This is easier math.
Okay.
And if I listen to the sentence, I'm about to say.
In one meter, how many nanometers do you have?
Is it 10, a hundred, a thousand?
What does the word nano mean?
Um, nano.
Nano kind of.
That's one billionth.
Negative. Yeah. So now it'd be negative nine.
Right.
10.
That looks like 16. Sorry.
Minus nine.
Or 10 to the plus nine.
So there's a billion.
Nanometers in one meter.
Okay.
So now I can do,
since this is an exponential times an exponential,
I can easily do that in my head.
So it's minus seven.
Plus nine.
So my answer in nanometers.
Is for.
Shoot.
Oh.
Yeah.
Well, if I knew where there was an undo button.
Okay. Let me.
I'm here.
Again.
4.68.
Times.
10 to the minus seven.
Times 10 to the minus nine.
So I'm going to get 4.68.
Times.
Minus seven plus nine is plus two.
10 to the two.
And the only unit because meters cancels meters.
The only unit remaining is nanometers.
Okay.
Now I'd like to get this into a form that I can easily look at
that graph.
And see, so what is 10 to the second is what?
That's the hundreds.
Yeah. So if I multiply this number by a hundred.
468.
468.
It's going to be between 500 nanometers and 450,
which would make it blue light.
So I'm going to get blue.
So that would be faster than me.
Or 68.
Yeah. It's that blue green region there.
Isn't it?
A blue indigo.
So we'll say, I mean, I don't know how you figure that out.
The only other way would be to get a table somewhere that gives you
specific frequencies. So yeah.
So then that means that that's blue.
And you might say blue slash indigo.
Color.
All right. Does that help?
That helps. That helps with that problem. I have, um,
I have two more, I have two more questions.
Okay.
About this, um, this specific part about it. So.
Let me ask the end of real quick on the end. Did you hear that?
Did you have any questions or problems?
You probably have to unmute.
No, I don't have any questions.
Okay.
So.
There we go.
Um, so I'm just going to erase this.
I know there's probably a screen erase.
But in somewhere, but.
This is.
Almost okay.
All right. What's your next question?
So we're, let me ask you something first.
So it's working at that way.
Do you think you can answer your, uh,
Questions on the.
What, uh, wavelength and.
Frequency questions or.
Cause you had another question that was on a different topic.
I have, um, I have a similar question to this. It's.
Asking like what the frequency range would be.
If they were, if they gave me like two, um.
Wouldn't I have to. So.
On your end question 3.5.
Yeah, that one's a little bit confusing to me.
Okay. So.
They're giving you two frequencies.
F1.
And F2.
And they're saying, uh, what is the frequency range.
A red light.
Sorry guys.
Potential spam once again.
So what we need to do.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I gave wavelengths. So scratch that.
So they give you a little lamb to one.
And lambda to, they give you two different wavelengths.
And they want to know what frequency range.
And between these two wavelengths, they say that's,
we would consider that all red light.
So what we have to do is convert these wavelengths to frequency.
So I wrote them all down before.
So to get frequency.
Uh, from a wavelength.
So the frequency for light number one is equal to.
Uh, lambda one divided by C.
Right.
And the frequency for lambda two is going to be frequency two.
And that's going to be.
Lambda two.
Divided by C.
The book says that to find frequency.
It would be.
Frequency equals.
No, that's right. I did this wrong. Sorry.
I was trying to do it.
It's C over lambda.
Okay.
Yeah.
Is equal to.
C over lambda one.
C over lambda two.
Okay.
So now you just have to put in the numbers with the units.
And that'll give you two frequencies.
Yeah.
I feel like I can set up the equation.
And it might be some questions that I have along the way of it.
Well, um,
I think you can do this. So let's say the two frequencies are.
700 nanometers and 650.
So this one is larger than this one.
So what does that mean about the frequency since this is the inverse.
Oh man, it says my meeting will end in 10 minutes.
Um,
let's see if this really does end,
I will start another meeting right away and figure out how to get that to you.
Okay.
Um, so which.
If this is a larger wavelength.
Is this one going to have the larger or the smaller frequency?
That's going to have the larger frequency.
So large, this is larger than that.
And you're saying that.
So I'm dividing by a larger number than over here.
So it's a constant divided by a larger number.
So this should be the lower frequency.
Oh, cause yeah, cause larger number means it's split up into more. So.
Okay. So.
All right.
Let's see if it'll let me beg for more time.
No.
Boy, they've gotten hard nose. I remember.
For some reason, it let me go long, long time before. So.
All right. So is that, I think you've got enough to probably go on that one.
So.
I got a, um, I plugged that into my calculator and I got like an answer where it was just.
Like.
Well, you're going to have to carry units along because remember the units for C.
Are.
You got to do the units. There's no skipping the units.
They're not going to give you easy units.
So the units are going to be C is in meters per second.
And the wavelength is in nanometers.
Okay. You can't cancel those out. You've got to fix the units as well.
Oh, that makes sense.
So, uh, now the problem will be since it's,
you got to convert either meters to nanometers or nanometers to meters,
but that's a factor of 10 to the nine.
So you're going to be off by a billion if you don't do it right.
So it looked like you had something like 40,000 or something like that on your calculator.
So it's probably a billion times that.
For the frequency.
And the number all visible light comes in with the frequency of about 10 to the 14.
In verse seconds.
So I'll say the answers should be about 10 to the 14 inverse seconds.
And that's a good thing to kind of remember eyes is that if someone's asking you about the frequency of light,
just remember 10 to the 14. That's a kind of a magic number.
And now the coefficient in front determines exactly what the answer is,
because they should be something times 10 to the 14.
When you get to the frequencies. Okay, let's look real quick at the next one. If you're ready to go on.
Yeah, I just have one more question about this. So how would I get 10 to the 14th because I looked at the book for guidance and it did end up showing 10 to the 14.
I didn't, I didn't understand because of the equation is speed of light over seven to 10 over to the second power.
How would I get 10.
You got look packs you're going to have to do the units in long hand every time to get it right on these problems. So let's let's take this one.
All right, so see is 3.0.
10 to the eight meters per second.
And the wavelength for one, I can read this is 7.0 zero.
Is that the wavelength.
Yeah, times 10 to the two.
I can't read that what does it say 10 to 10 to second power, and then then that's a nanometers. Okay, so 10 to the two nanometers.
Okay, so just to go through it again so I'm going to put the two numbers down so because we can do those in a calculator.
10 to the eight divided by 7.00 times 10 to the two.
It's just too shaky. And then I have
and the units are going to be
meters per second divided by nanometers.
Now I'm going to try to do this in one fell swoop.
So I'm going to have to convert meter. So you see it's nanometers over one, the one is implied there.
So if I get this one into meters, then the meters are going to cancel out and I'll get one over seconds so let's let's convert.
If I put meters in the denominator, and I've got new nano nanometers in the numerator.
In one meter, there's 10 to the nine nanometers.
Let's check that out.
Nanometers here is going to cancel nanometers there.
It's a numerator and a denominator thing. And then here I have meters in the denominator and that's going to cancel meters in the numerator.
Can you do a screenshot when we're done that way I want to erase all this because I am going a little fast.
All right, so in my calculator now I have 3.0 times 10 to the eight divided by, or that's horrible, 7.00 times 10 to the two times one times 10 to the nine, 10 to the nine.
And the units are one over seconds.
Okay.
So I can actually look at I'm just going to do the.
So I have three divided by seven is the coefficient.
And I've got a minus two is six.
And six plus nine is 15.
And I'm going to convert seconds to hurts, or one over seconds to hurts.
So three divided by seven is about a half.
Let's say it's a half 0.5 times 10 to the 15 hurts.
That's not standard form for a scientific notation I need to multiply this by 10 which means I have to take one away from that so that's equal to five times 10 to the 14.
So let's say let me.
I'll put my calculator here.
Come on with my thing.
I can't get to my calculator so do three divided by seven and what do you get.
You divide by seven I got 0.428.
428 is 43 so instead of five here.
It's 4.3 times 10 to the 14 hurts.
Okay.
And then I just do that with the other value to, and then that's my range.
Yes, so the, and it's going to be a larger number than 4.3 times 10 to the 14 it might be, I don't know.
Yeah, it's going to be, it might be up to five or six times 10 to the 14 hurts.
It says I have less than a minute. So if this connects us, I will try to start a new one.
Yenda, do you want to be on the net new one? Are you bored or?
I can be on.
