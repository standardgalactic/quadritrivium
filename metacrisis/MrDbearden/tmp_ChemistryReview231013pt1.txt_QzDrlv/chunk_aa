Thanks again for being here and helping us out with this.
No problem. Nothing better to do.
Actually, tomorrow is a big day.
What is this showing me?
Oh yeah, so I can chat.
Tomorrow is a big day for the Ham radio club.
If y'all are at, if you want to go to Olive Branch City Park on a Saturday, we're going to have him.
Ham radio thing and free food at noon.
So.
This may chat.
I hadn't been in zoom in a while, so it's changed a bit.
Yeah, I had to do teams when, when COVID happened. I didn't do zoom. I use teams.
Oh, is that okay.
A little bit different for me too.
Okay.
Well, let's.
Darn, I was gonna.
I gotta figure out how my iPad works because I haven't used that in a while.
I hope I can remember.
I guess I just have to share my screen, but I was trying to find the app. Oh my goodness.
I don't even remember what the icon looks like.
So.
As much as I did zoom during COVID, you'd think I would remember some of this, but maybe it's because it's a bad memory.
I don't have some tablet.
Okay.
That's going to help me.
I'm going to go to my apps here. Sorry, I'm floundering around.
Oh,
I can't have it.
That's not what I want.
I don't even remember if I used a different type of app to use this.
And I don't have a.
I don't know.
Something's going to jog my memories here because I can't.
There's open board. Let's try that.
No, maybe.
All right.
This will let me write that I have to remember how to erase.
And I guess that raises. Okay.
Good.
All right, I have a way to write. That's better than a kick in the head.
This thing may cut off because it said without a subscription, I have to.
I can only get 40 minutes. So hopefully we can get through your questions. And so go ahead and let's start. What's your highest priority?
My highest priority right now is the understanding the frequency equations like in on your own.
3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.
Okay, what page is that?
In the workbook that is page 82 and 83.
I've only got the textbook so.
Let's.
All right, I'm going to share my screen.
So many options.
And it's got an exclamation point.
In the textbook, it should be on page 103, I believe.
103 and 104.
Okay.
Let's just do desktop.
Okay.
Yeah, so many.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah. Here we go.
Not be able to record the contents of your screen until it is correct.
Okay, I don't care that much about recording.
Okay, let's try and share my screen now.
There we go.
Share.
All right, so you see a big whiteboard?
Yes.
Okay, I'm sorry. What page did you say on the book?
In the book 103 and then 104.
Three.
I see example.
3.2.
Oh, okay.
All right, so 3.4 says what color.
Is light that has a frequency of something. Okay, so.
Let's see.
So we have light with.
Well, how to get on that again.
I go to pencil.
Okay.
Oh boy, I'm doing something wrong here.
Stay on pencil.
Well, this, oh, I got the pen turned upside down. That'll do it every time.
Okay, so a frequency.
Boy, that's horrible running.
6.4.
6.4.
Stand to the.
14.
It's.
And it wants the color.
Okay. How do we get color?
Color.
Out of a frequency.
You would have to convert to like nanometers, right?
And then.
Well, let's look at what the book has in terms of a conversion table.
So on page 100, it's got a.
Red to violet.
Spectrum and it gives wavelengths at the bottom, right?
And now meters.
All right.
So that's, so we need to turn frequency.
Into.
Wavelength.
And we may then have to, if we get the wavelength in the wrong units,
we may have to convert that.
To.
Wavelength.
In nanometers.
Right.
Is that legible enough to you?
Yeah. Yeah. I can, I can see it correctly.
Okay.
So how do we go from frequency to wavelength? We have equation.
Let's see. How do they put it in the book?
F equals C over lambda.
Okay.
And C is equal to state of light.
Yeah. Well, so this is one of those three part equations and.
You really need to.
Be able to manipulate these. So let me just.
I don't know what the first version is that the book gives,
but let's just write C.
Is equal to F.
Lambda.
Okay. So.
We'll have.
In your science studies,
you'll see equations like this all the time.
Now it turns out that we know that C is just a number.
So it's a constant.
All right. And we can look that up or know it from memory from the textbook.
F is a frequency in some unit and lambda is a,
is a wavelength in some unit.
So what we can do is rearrange this in many useful ways.
So if I want to solve for frequency.
What I need to have to solve this equation and rearrange it for frequency.
I divide both sides by lambda.
And so on the left side, I would have C over lambda.
Okay. So that's one way.
So this is one form of the equation. This is another one.
And we should be able to get another one. If we want to solve for lambda.
We say that lambda is equal to.
And I divide this equation by F on both sides.
Are you following that when I say divide by F on both sides?
Yeah. Cause it cancels the, it cancels the F from the lambda.
So it'd be a lambda equals C over F.
Correct.
Yeah. All right. So we won't do electronics in this book,
but if you've ever done, well, probably in physical science,
you had the resistance equation V equals IR.
And you have to arrange that again,
since there's three components in there,
you can arrange that three different ways to solve any problem.
So here we need to go from frequency to wavelength.
So now you just said this out loud a minute ago,
but it looks like this is the one that we would like to have.
All right.
So let's say that our wavelength for this problem is going to be B,
which is 3.0 times,
which form does the book use centimeters per second or.
It uses it just as the notation of eight, I think it's hurts.
Okay. That's meters per second. Okay.
Cause sometimes people use the speed of light and centimeters per second
or other units, nanometers per second.
So all right. So it's 10 to the eight.
And I always carry my units along when I'm writing these out meters per second.
So that's the speed of light in the numerator and then the denominator.
Well, that's horrible.
We need the frequency.
So that's what we wrote down first.
So that's 6.4 times 10 to the 14.
Hurts is Lambda is Lambda frequency or is Lambda.
So are we, it's asking for us to solve for the frequency.
So wouldn't that mean that the,
it should be frequency equals C over Lambda.
Well, no, it gives us the frequency.
That's a given.
Oh, and then we got it.
Well, the question is what color is it?
Oh, that makes sense now. That makes sense.
So the only thing we have to go from either frequency or wavelength to
color is this figure.
That's on page.
Wherever it was.
I think I flip cast it.
Page 100.
Okay. So that,
and that picture is given in wavelength.
So we have to take our frequency and get to wavelength.
And that's the step we're doing right here.
We're going from frequency to wavelength.
Do you see that now?
I do. Yeah.
That makes sense.
And the unit is hurts.
So I always.
Unless this is a calculation that I put into a spreadsheet or
something that I do every day.
