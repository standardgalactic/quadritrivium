took the old nest they got a they had a somehow they lifted it up with a crane and they took it
from the power pole to this dummy pole and the hope was when the eagles come back to nest again
because I guess they come back to the same spot that instead of building a new nest where they were
they'll just go to the dummy nest which has no electricity on it and that's what they did actually
so the next year we saw the eagles were back and they were having their chicks in a in that nest
safe away from electricity and it also meant we didn't lose power if they made it short out
so that was good for us too so it was kind of interesting it was scary because I you know I
didn't our building had a lot of sensitive equipment in it I didn't like the power going out but anyway
all right so a circuit breaker so here's some important safety tips this will save your life
the the rule rule in red bold italic is never replace a fuse or a circuit breaker with a higher
rated device and this is really really tempting okay so you've got a piece of equipment and a
fuse blows now you might know that the fuse blew because of lightning or some kind of a surge and
and you might know kind of why that fuse blew sometimes they blow and you don't know why they
blew now this usually happens with complicated electrical equipment like you know if you work
in a laboratory or something like that and so the first thing you do is you just replace the
fuse maybe it was a fluke maybe something weird happened and then the fuse blows again
and you look around in the equipment you can't see anything particularly wrong
and you think well maybe the guy who picked that fuse size picked it just a little bit too small
and so you want to put in a slightly bigger fuse
that's an awfully strong temptation because it means then that maybe your your equipment will
keep working and you won't be interrupted and stuff like that so like another example is
like your air conditioner on your house if it keeps tripping a breaker
you know and you look at it and it's got a 30 amp breaker you might say well I can go get a 50
amp breaker and so you go buy that and put it in there well what the tripping is meaning is that
something's wrong with the equipment something's wrong with that circuit so you really need to
so and and the safety of the fuse or the circuit breaker is telling you I see something is wrong
I'm going to try to save the equipment from getting hurt worse and so really if you have a fuse that
blows or circuit breaker that trips more than once something's wrong and you've got to fix it
so the answer is not to replace the fuse with the and the book tells you I don't know if y'all
read that but it says oh some people put in a a coin or this that and the other yeah and sometimes
those people uh so like I'll pick on JT you know I don't know your car maybe you got this super
speaker system and you know 400 watts of bass you know playing state guard or whoever
all right all right country good okay so Garth Brooks I don't know actually I have a a cousin
who plays for Montgomery Gentry he's a three-finger guitarist that's cool when he was born he had a
deformed pinky and the surgeon the doctor just cut it off so he only has three fingers on his left hand
anyway um so anyway you like music you like it loud and fuses keep blowing and you think oh I'm
just going to put a bigger fuse in there well um and you do and it's fine for a little while
and then all of a sudden you smell your amp smoking you see smoke coming out and the fuse
doesn't blow and it smokes more and more and pretty soon this is this is your amp in the trunk of your
car and you know your your uh trunk starts smoking pretty soon well maybe it's your truck maybe you
got a truck um and so pretty soon your car truck is on fire because you put a bigger you stuck a
coin in there instead of getting the right size fuse and fixing the problem this is incredibly
common and so just like last week with my whole diet tribe about how to chart get a jump from
you know somebody who's trying to help you get your car started um yeah don't don't be
swapping out fuses if the fuse keeps blowing you've got to fix the problem before you can
keep going forward so all right so let's do an example here so here's a circuit i've got
three things three resistors and parallel i've got a switch which is closed so this circuit
should be operating and i've got a fuse and here's our battery and let's put some numbers on there
so it's a 12 volt battery um resistor one is nine ohms this one is 15 ohms and this is
eight ohms so the question is what size fuse should we use so how are we going to figure that out
any ideas what we have to know well we know the fuse should be the same size as the one we were
using okay well you're the electrical engineer you're designing this so this hadn't even been
built yet so you got to tell them what size fuses to order to put into this oh okay so yeah if this
was an existing circuit and this was a 10 amp fuse then yeah i would go now if i had to i might use
a 9 amp fuse it's okay to go down in size um so say say you've got a box of 9 amp fuses but
but no 10 amp fuses and this was had a 10 amp you could try a 9 amp in there and see if that
would work at least long enough to you could get the right size fuse usually that doesn't work i've
done that myself a few times just hoping because i don't have that stupid blasted you know 6.2 amp
fuse i have a 5 amp fuse and so i'll try that but anyway no we don't know what this number is so
what are we so fuses are meant to blow with a certain amount of current so what we need to do
is figure out how much current is going to flow from this battery through these resistors
and then i'm going to pick a fuse which is has a rating slightly higher than that current
and that'll protect me if in case like for example um a squirrel walks across this resistor
and all of a sudden this resistor is zero if it goes to zero then a whole lot more current would
be needing to flow and that would then my fuse would blow and it would keep these wires from
melting and stuff like that all right so how do we figure out this current
Caroline are you you're looking too comfortable there girl
not sure okay so what we need to do is it's all right uh we got a we got three resistors here so
one of the things we might be able to replace all three resistors with one resistor
and then we would have our simple circuit of a voltage circuit and one resistor and we could
then use ohm's law to figure out what the current should be and once we figure out that current
then we'll know what size a fuse to look at so let's let's try that so
um the rule for figuring the equivalent resistance uh parallel resistors is that
one over the effective resistance is equal to one over each of these resistances
so r1 was nine so one over nine plus one over 15 plus one over eight so let me let me show you how
to uh do that i'm gonna um
i don't want to do this let me go to my um
calculator uh calculator here y'all can y'all see my calculator now yes sir okay so uh
and your calculator may operate differently so i'm going to say nine one over that
plus what's the next one 12
on that page i think it was 15
i'm gonna cheat i'm gonna yeah 15 you're right something about 15
one over that equals then plus
eight
eight one over that okay so uh so that's the sum of all the inverses and then to get
are effective i have to take one over that so 3.303 actually i when i work this problem i know
to get things right later i'm going to remember it's 303 i think when i write it down though i'm
gonna here i'm just going to say yeah oh goodness no wonder i got it wrong no 3.303 303 all right so
effective uh resistance the first time i wrote it down i just kept three significant figures
but later i found out i needed more so all right so the effective resistance now
i can replace all three of these resistors with a 3.3 ohm resistor
and then i can find uh the maximum current then it's going to be this voltage divided by that
effective resistance so that's 12 volts divided by 3.3 so the maximum current flowing out of this
battery is going to be 3.63 amps so then i could now know the maximum current that i want to ever
let flow is 3.63 amps um so the fuse uh should blow at slightly over 3.6 amps so maybe if i had a
four amp fuse uh that would work now a real engineer is going to figure out safety margins
uh you know it could be that these wires uh are very long and they have a lot of resistance
and they may be small wires and so i may decide if i really did an engineering analysis and i had
all those details i might decide that i really need to go find a 3.7 amp fuse or have one made
or something like that so anyway so the problems that you'll get in fact this is out of the book so
it said you've got a two amp a four amp and a six amp fuse and which size is the best one
so our answer would be the four amp fuse okay so here's an additional question so how much power
should this battery be ready to deliver because i also since i'm designing this circuit
i have to decide what's how big this 12 volt battery is is it the size of a car battery
or is it the size of my desk you know what size battery do i need to think about here
so this battery is going to have to deliver 3.63 amps so the power coming out of the battery
is the voltage times the current now we do know the voltage and we do know the current
but we also know the effective resistance so let's use this formula so v squared divided by r
so v squared is 12 squared divided by the resistance the effective resistance over here
3.30 and we find out that this battery has to deliver 43.6 watts all right so that would be a good
answer on this problem but we there's other ways to solve it we could have used the we could have
just used straight power is equal to voltage times the current because we'd already calculated the
current maximum so we could figure that out and we get when we round that we get the same thing
43.6 watts and then the other way using our other power equation we could take the current squared
times the resistance and that gives us a slightly different answer it's 43.52
and what i did that's why i went back and i got more significant figures here
so you really have to think about how many significant figures you want
if your ultimate if the ultimate goal is figure out how much power this battery
has to be able to put out then you would want to you know we've practiced several times
in the intermediate calculation we try to carry along as many significant figures as we can
so anyway so using either either one of our three power equations we get about the same answer
43.5 43.6 watts and so that's a pretty good size battery for these resistors
i don't think a flashlight battery or d-cell is going to put out 43.5 watts for very long
it may try for a couple of seconds but it's going to lose its juice pretty quick
so all right so let's uh
it's 11 and i get you till 1130 right okay i'm not going to pan right again
all right so let's look at some more complicated circuits so here's a
circuit with six resistors in it and the values are shown there it's a 120
volt battery and so we could ask a couple of things we could um ask uh what the equivalent
resistance of each of these pairs is so let's look at this so how would we analyze this how
do we break down these six resistors and look at them usually you do it in multiple steps
okay so here we have two resist the smallest parts here we've got two resistors in there in
parallel so we could probably replace these with one resistor and same here i've got two
resistors in parallel and i could probably replace that with one resistor and these two resistors
are in parallel so what maybe the first thing i can do to simplify this circuit is to replace
these doubled resistors with single resistors so i'll go from having six resistors to three
resistors and then i'm trying to get you to draw this picture in your mind so then you're going to
have a resistor here a resistor here and a resistor here and those three resistors are in series
so then we can use our series addition rule to come up with an equivalent with one resistor
so let's see what question um uh is going to be asked so the question is how much power is used by
the circuit now the question this this would be an important place to slow down and to read carefully
um a harder question would be to say how much power is used by the 22 ohm resistor
let's think about that um just looking at this circuit how would can you see that that that's
going to be a pretty tough question i'm going to have to figure out a couple of one of two so to get
the power in this 22 ohm resistor i would need to know the current through this resistor then i could
do i squared times r or if i could figure out the voltage across this resistor now the voltage
across this resistor is not the same as the voltage across this battery because i've got
some other resistors in the circuit so i would have to calculate this voltage in a some special way
all right uh so then i could do v squared divided by 22 ohms v squared over r to get the power
so it's possible maybe if we have a couple of minutes maybe we'll just try this um i didn't
actually work it out last night but maybe we could um how much power is used by the circuit so
i want to know of these six resistors how much power does this battery have to supply
so all i'm like so all i'm low resistance
so um
now these are weird numbers 22 and 29 and 15 and 13 these aren't easy to do but maybe um
um if you had two you you should think about this parallel rule enough to get to the point
where you say if i have two 100 ohm resistors in parallel what is the resistance
or if i have three uh 500 ohm resistors in parallel so the resistance is all the same
what is my resistance
so uh let's let's do that real quick let me go back i can do that let's so i've got 500
one over that plus 500 one over that plus 500 one over that equals and then to find the equivalent
i've got a one over that so three 500 ohm resistors in parallel is 166.6666666
so let's try this is that truly 500 divided by three
oh so if i use equal resistant resistors in parallel i can actually divide the resistance
so two 100 ohm resistors in parallel would give me 50 ohms
okay now that doesn't apply if uh in this case where these two resistances aren't equal it's
not the average of these 22 plus 29 average together is not 12 and a half this is less than these two
okay so and then the third third one here to replace this one the 31 and 39 i need a 17.27 ohm
resistor all right so i could redraw my circuit now so i've replaced those pairs of resistors
with single resistors and i've written down the values here so now my circuit's getting a lot simpler
right so now i see that i've got three resistors in series and i could probably combine those and
the rule there is a whole lot easier the effective resistance of things that are in series i just add
the resistances together so the effective resistance of these three guys is just their sum
and when you do that you get that the effective resistance is 36.74 ohms so i could replace all
three of these resistors by one 36.74 ohm resistor so now then i have a simplified circuit with one
voltage source and one resistor and i can see that the power then that i need the battery to produce
is the voltage squared over the effective resistance so that's 120 squared divided by 36.74
so that battery needs to generate about 392 watts
all right so uh now you can imagine maybe you can imagine and when you work the problems for
this chapter let's say that i could take this very same problem and say i'm going to connect a resistor
from here down to here i'm going to connect a 20 ohm resistor between here and here oh my goodness
i'm going to have a much more complicated circuit but maybe i can still simplify it by using these
parallel and series combination rules and so if i if i had another i didn't make a drawing
let me see oh my god so let me let me um let me go ahead and go down here i've got you for a
few more minutes i'm going to make up for last week so now let me take a wire from
all right so this is all weird powerpoint stuff i'm going to copy that
and paste it so there's my new wire i'm going to connect it there
and i need a resistor
so i have maybe i can just use my mouse
oh man
go ahead
i'm going to go back and he just i need to picture one resistor
did i make my life really hard i'm going to go back even further because i know some of these are
i'm going to shoot bar all right i'll have to do it the hard way
let me ungroup this have y'all played around in powerpoint very much it's really not making
wrong ah there now i'm going to copy that i'm going to paste it so i'm going to drag this guy up here
i need to rotate it
ah
Ha.
Ha.
