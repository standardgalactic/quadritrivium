Oh, okay. Let me see.
And then I think that's all the questions I have for Module 3.
Is there an email?
I think that's all.
Getting flustered.
All right.
Which one?
It's on page 107, example 3.3.
Oh man, they work it out for you.
You really need that one?
I think I can manage with figuring that one out.
I think the one that can be used is on your own 3.7.
Because it's relating that to the color.
Okay.
Okay, so.
Oh, there she is.
Can you hear us, Linda?
Yeah.
Okay.
Sorry about all that.
It kicked us out, but then it gave me a button to restart it.
So if we go another 40 minutes, then we'll do the same thing.
So y'all just try to log in.
Okay.
So the question, let's say we're going to go to on your own 3.7.
Where they give you an energy.
Now my book has a typo.
It says 3.3 times 10 to the minus nine joules.
But the actual correction is 3.3 times 10 to the minus 19.
Is that what you're saying?
That is minus 19.
Okay.
All right.
Let me share my screen again.
I don't know if y'all got.
Which problem are we on?
On your own 3.7.
At the bottom of page 108 in the textbook.
Okay.
Get everything off of this that you needed.
The previous problem.
I have a picture on that.
So I can, I can send that to you all if you need.
No, I'm good.
All right. Let's.
Should take a moment and.
Let's see.
Oh yeah, there's a screen race.
Okay, good.
All right. I'm learning as I go here.
Sorry guys.
All right.
So it says that the energy.
Well.
Yeah.
It didn't go right back to pan.
If it would if I turned my pen over to pan.
See this is why they never picked me for the sports teams.
He.
Is given as.
3.3.
Times 10.
Minus 19.
Jules.
Okay.
Jules is a unit of energy.
And so we'll have to figure out.
What that is.
And I think that a J is a.
Newton meter per second squared.
Or a jule per hertz.
Is H. Okay.
That's probably easier to do.
So.
All right. So now the question is.
What color is it?
So we're going to have to go from.
Energy.
To.
And again, they're referring us to figure 310.
Which is on page 100.
Put a bookmark there.
Might help me.
It's going to fall out.
Oh wow.
We need to go from energy.
Or Jules.
To wavelength.
All right.
But to get there.
We're going to actually go through.
Frequency.
Then we're going to go from frequency to wavelength.
Much, much like we did in the previous problems.
All right.
So.
So.
So.
So.
So what is the equation that's relevant?
We know that.
E.
Equal to a constant.
H called plonks constant.
Times the frequency.
So.
To get the frequency.
This is a three element equation.
I'm going to rearrange it.
I'm going to say that frequency.
Is equal to.
A constant.
H called plonks constant.
Times the frequency.
Is equal to.
E.
Divided by.
H.
Okay.
Okay.
Um.
And so what I can do then is put in my number here for Jules.
And then get H.
In an appropriate set of units.
Um.
And then we'll see what happens.
So.
To get the freak.
And then I'm going to have to.
Go from frequency to lambda.
So remember that would be F is equal to.
I'm sorry.
Lambda.
Is equal to C.
Divided by the frequency.
All right.
So let's do this part first.
So our frequency.
Is equal to.
That many Jules.
Three.
Point three.
Times 10.
Minus 19.
Jules.
Divided by H.
In a convenient unit for H.
Is.
Um.
Where is it?
Okay.
It's going to be.
Six point three.
Is equal to.
Is equal to.
Six point.
Six three.
Can't even put a point there.
Digitally.
Times 10 of the minus 34.
And that's Jules per hertz.
When the first one if it's Jules per hertz.
If we're trying to cancel the.
Units out, wouldn't that mean that it's.
Um.
Invert inverse Jules.
Would that be able to.
Invert inverse Jules.
Invert inverse Jules.
Invert inverse Jules.
Would that be like one over.
One over J or J over one for the first one.
For the numerator here.
I'm sorry.
Say that again.
So I know that we're going to have to.
Convert the units and make sure that the units are okay.
So.
This one I know that they kind of gave us.
The J over hertz.
So for the first one what would.
How do we put that in fraction?
We put that J over one one over J.
Or is there another unit that we need to use to find?
Well, I can see that Jules here is going to cancel Jules here.
And I can see that because I've done this 10 million times.
So let's just keep going the slow way that I.
Go sometimes.
I'm going to put the numbers first.
So I've got.
3.3.
10 to the minus 19.
Divided by.
6.63.
10 to the minus 19.
Divided by.
3.3.
Times 10.
Y times 10.
Minus 34.
Okay, that's my calculator work there.
And then for units, I have Jules.
I could put Jules over one to make this more transparent to you.
Divided by.
Jules.
Okay.
So this part, I'm going to go up here.
So that's.
Jules divided by one.
And then to do this big division sign here, I turn this fraction upside down.
So that's going to be times hurts.
Her jewel.
If that seems totally strange to you, you probably need to.
Go back and review fractions from algebra or whatever.
What, what math are you in right now?
Say again.
Algebra.
Okay.
So this should be.
So that's going to be times.
Her jewel.
If that seems totally strange to you, you probably need to.
Go back and review fractions.
From algebra or whatever you're.
What, what math are you in right now?
Say again.
Okay.
So this should be an algebra too.
This.
Well, maybe I was a bit different than when I took it.
But this fixing this fraction like this should be automatic.
So I see now that.
Jules cancel out.
And so that leaves me just hurts.
Okay.
So somebody.
I could take this number here.
Let's see what we get.
So three divided by six is about a half.
So.
I'll recalculate.
I'm going to say 0.5.
Times and then I've got 10 minus 19.
And to bring this to the numerator, I.
Add 34.
So that's going to be 10.
To the 15th.
Hurts.
Is that right?
Is that right?
Is that right?
Is that right?
Is that right?
Is that right?
Is that's, that's the unit's up here.
That gave me.
4.9.
Okay.
So it can read it.
It gave me 4.977.
And so on to 10 to the 14th.
Okay.
Oh.
All right.
So you.
So the answer of 3.3 divided by 6.6.
Is 0.498.
But.
The calculation.
Yeah, you did the whole calculation.
So this is 10 of the 14.
Which again, since it's a visible.
Did it say it's visible?
Yeah, visible light.
It should be something times 10 of the 14.
So about.
Almost five times 10 of the 14.
Hurts is the frequency.
All right.
Now to get wavelengths to see what frequency that is.
I've got to use.
Lambda is equal to.
C over F.
Write that down again.
That's equal to.
3.0.
Times 10.
To the eighth.
Meters per second.
Divided by my frequency.
Sorry.
Divider line had to dip.
4.98.
4.
Times 10.
To the 14.
And instead of her.
So I'm going to go and put it back in.
A hurts is a one over a second.
Okay.
And.
So that's a calculator problem.
So 3.
10.
To the eight.
10.
10.
To the eight.
Divided by.
4.98.
Times 10 of the 14.
10.
Then the units are.
Meters per second.
Divided by.
One over seconds.
One over seconds.
That would give us.
We'll have to put that right to meters per second.
Times.
Meters over seconds.
Second over one.
Right.
And that means the seconds are going to.
In fact.
My mind says this.
S is in the denominator.
And down here it's in the denominator.
So I know those are going to cancel.
I don't have to do the algebra.
M is in the numerator.
One is in the numerator.
So those stay.
So M divided by one is M.
So the units is meters.
And.
What do we get for this math here?
I got.
6.02.
Times.
10.
Negative seven.
Okay.
And to go to our chart.
We need it in.
Nanometers.
So let's.
Put in a conversion here where I go from.
Nanometers I want that in the numerator.
To meters in my denominator.
The one that I can remember is that one meter.
Is a billion nanometers.
Right.
So that's equal to one.
And so all I have to do now is add the coefficient.
So that's going to be.
6.02.
Times.
10.
Minus seven plus nine is two.
And the remaining unit here, the meters cancel.
Is nanometers.
So 6.02 times 100.
Is.
102.
Nanometers.
And you go look at the thing on page 100.
And 600 is yellow orange.
Kind of halfway between yellow and orange, I guess.
I don't know.
It's about the best you can do.
So that's goes to yellow.
That makes a lot of sense.
Okay, so here, so this is a multi step problem.
So it had to go from energy.
The frequency from frequency to wavelength.
And then wavelength in the right units to match the table we had.
So, so this 6.02 times 10 minus seven meters is the correct answer,
but the units are just not useful to us.
So to change the units, we multiply by one.
So.
And I would just, I've tried to say this to people,
but I don't take the shortcut.
Don't assume that the units are going to work out because I can pretty much guarantee you.
They won't, they won't be natural units.
That's part of the fun of learning this type of stuff.
So.
Okay, you want to get a picture of that or did you or.
I already snapped the picture of it.
That makes a lot of sense now.
Okay, all right, good.
Amanda.
Yeah, I'm good.
This way works a lot better, I think.
What does.
I said the way you worked it works a lot better than the book, I would say.
Okay.
I'm going to raise this.
All right.
Now we got to go to module four, right.
Which problem.
In number four.
I think the Lewis dot problems are probably the ones you had some trouble with.
I can't hear you, you're muted.
Did I mute you?
Sorry.
I must have me to myself that's my bed.
I had so 4.1 the Lewis structures are pretty.
Those are pretty easy with the bonds.
Those are also pretty easy.
It's just some of the more complex ones with the double bonds and the triple bonds.
And then also with the giving the chemical formula names with like the Roman numerals.
Because.
For example, for on your own 4.2.
I did it as I would if it was in normal notation.
So beryllium chloride.
I originally thought that would just be BCL without the two.
Without the.
The squared ends.
Turns out there's like exponents to them and I don't understand how to find those like exponents.
Okay.
One of the ones that we have to give spet extra information on.
If this was iron chloride, we would have to give you more information.
So beryllium is a place in a periodic table.
That's easy.
So.
Okay, get on that thing here.
So beryllium.
Is it two hours?
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Go to the periodic table and tell me what group it's in.
It is in the.
Really.
Then to a group to a to a.
No, is that right?
I'll be in the it's in one of the s groups.
But the it's in group to to a.
So.
Okay.
Yeah.
Man.
I couldn't pass the test today for I think having time off really like.
Is a problem.
Okay, so it's group to a.
So that means then.
In the symbol is.

Rhaid.
Now I've got another that leaves one electron here and I can't move it over here because this has a full.
chlorine structure, so I actually need another chlorine.
i'm just going to copy what I did up above.
There's one electron, and so if I take this electron and share it here right there, then okay beryllium is given away it's two electrons so it's a happy camper chlorine has gotten an electron and this chlorine's gotten an electron, so these are going to most be happy so and typically the way we would write that would be CL.
Be.
that's not right.
Be.
And CL and i've shown one dash that represents.
Well, this isn't that's not right it's not going to be a molecule like that right we're going to have beryllium now, since it lost two electrons so forget this that's wrong beryllium lost two electrons it lost two negative charges so now it's a a plus two charge.
And we have two chlorines.
And they each got an electron so it's a minus one charge and a minus one charge and so we would say then that it's got to be be.
And two chlorines.
Oh, because the two electrons and be they satisfy the chlorines which would make that which would negate the positive charges correct correct.
So beryllium has more electrons than zero that would mean it's a positive charge and if, for example, chlorine had less than what would satisfy the octet rule that would mean it's a negative one charge, but if it was say at like six electrons would be a negative.
No, no, when you add an electronic gets a negative charge.
What we did was we took this electron from here and moved it over here. So we gave chlorine an extra electron, an extra negative charge.
And that's why we say CL minus.
Oh, and then when you and then when you take away an electron it adds.
It's a plus charge then so beryllium is left with a plus two charge and chlorine is left with a minus charge minus one and a minus one charge.
That's why I need two chlorines to make the net charge overall is still zero.
So one another way to designate that if I write it like this molecule here I could put two plus and then minus here.
So the net charge net charge.
On this thing is I've got plus two on the beryllium minus one on one chlorine and minus one on the other chlorine and so the net charge is still zero.
Plus two minus one minus one is zero.
Is that all they asked about that?
Yeah, so what would you say is a good chemical formula?
Yeah.
Would it be helpful to write out the Lewis dot structures for these type of problems?
Absolutely, you have to.
If you don't do it, you won't get it right.
I mean.
So let's okay aluminum.
Okay, aluminum.
Aluminum phosphide.
Did you get that one?
That would just.
That would just satisfy and just it would just be ALP on its end, right?
Because the aluminum in the five said three plus five would equal eight.
Aluminum, man.
It's in group three five, right?
Or is it?
Aluminum is in group three eight and then phosphorus is in group five.
Okay, so that's not so group three eight and phosphorus is in group five.
All right.
So let's do the Lewis dot structure of this.
Al.
It's got three electrons.
So I'm going to go one, two, three.
That's not very close to a octet.
Is it?
And then phosphorus.
It's got five.
One, two, three, four.
Oh, I see what. Yeah, okay.
So.
So this is three electrons short of an octet and aluminum since it's a metal will give up electrons pretty easily.
So what I would do then is say I'm going to take this electron and put it there.
I'm going to take this electron and put it here.
And this aluminum this electron and put it there.
And so now the Lewis dot structure is going to be Al.
And I've got three pairs between Al.
There's one pair.
Two pairs.
Three pairs.
And then P.
It has that other lone pair, which I have to take account of.
All right.
So P now has two, four, six, eight electrons around it.
So that's
Let's see.
I should be able to change colors here.
Yeah.
So the book.
The book offers kind of a weird way to do it.
It says, I mean, looking back at it, it says that in group one, eight, it would have like a plus one charge.
And then group six, eight would have a negative two charge.
So say that like, for example, for the magnesium, magnesium nitride problem, if it said, if it's in group two, it has a plus two charge.
And if it's a group five, eight has a negative two charge.
Because the five, five minus eight is three, which would mean that it requires three more electrons to make.
And it says that if we look at the groups.
So say, for example, if it's in group three, eight, it's a positive, a plus three charge.
And if it's in five, eight, it's a negative, it's a negative three charge.
So for this, we could just switch the numbers and it would cancel out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the way they say to do it.
Lewis electron dots are another way to do it.
Because now I can see what kind of bond is this.
That's a double bond.
I'll ask again, what kind of bond is this?
That's a double bond.
I'll ask again, what kind of bond is this?
One, two, three pairs.
That would be a triple bond.
I just, I saw it going across.
Now that's why I thought it was a double bond.
Oh, like this one is shared or something.
So you have now, since aluminum lost three electrons, it's a plus three.
And since phosphorus got three electrons, it's a minus three.
And aluminum is happy by itself now.
And phosphorus will be happy.
So it would be A L should have changed to black triple bond P.
And it's kind of optional to show the lone pairs, but for right now I would show them.
So that's what aluminum phosphide would look like.
But yeah, the other way would be to say, okay, aluminum, boy, that's horrible.
Aluminum is in group three A.
So it's going to lose three electrons.
And phosphorus is in group.
So it's going to be a minus three.
So it's going to lose three electrons.
And phosphorus is in group, so it's going to be a minus three.
Phosphorus is in group five A, so it's going to be a plus three.
So that tells you the stoichiometry.
So that means for each aluminum, you can use one phosphorus.
So A L P.
But that doesn't give you much insight into the kind of bond between them.
It would be potentially a triple bond if it's in a solid form.
When it goes into solution, it's going to be A L.
Minus or plus three.
And phosphorus.
Minus three in solution.
Because remember it's an ionic compound.
And it's going to dissolve so that each of these ions is independent of one another.
I get that now.
Okay.
All right.
I've got seven minutes on this go round.
What else do you need?
I have like one last question.
So in my book, I understand the Lewis structures for like the molecules because all you have to do is just put the certain things on there.
Like you'd have to do.
For example, for NHC at the end in the middle, because that's the least electrically charged.
And then you would fill out the valence electrons.
And then you would create bonds with what is on there.
So I understand that.
Okay.
But what I'm sure is with problems like 413 and 414, because they're a little more complex Lewis structures, because they have more.
They have like three elements in them.
Is it problem 413?
Yeah, problem 413 and problem 414.
They kind of, they're kind of tripping me up.
That's not study practice problems or extra practice problems.

want that. Too late. All right. So a Lewis dot structure for CH2O. All right. So carbon
is in group four, so it's electron dot structure is four outer electrons. H is in group one, so
it has one electron and O is in group six, so it's got two pair and one, two was one
electron in it. And I have two of these H's. Okay. So, yeah, so where C is the least
select or is the, or O is the most electronegate. So C would probably be the central atom. So
let's start with that premise. So when you do these, sometimes you end up saying, no,
that's not right, because you can't make it fit. It's like you picked up the wrong puzzle
piece or something. So, well, let's just, for example, let's say, oh, it looks like oxygen
is going to be the middle atom. So I'm going to draw it down here. Okay. So this is attempt
one here. All right. So now, well, goodness, if I put the H's there, I don't have any place
to hook the carbon. So let me draw the carbon here. All right. So I can say, well, if I move
this, share this electron there, and this one there, that makes oxygen happy. And carbon
has lost two electrons. So it's almost halfway happy. Or it's sharing them. It's not lost them.
It's this is a covalent bond, not a ionic bond. And then I could say, well, look, I've got two
hydrogens. So if I put one here, it's electron, it can share right there. And do another one
here. And let it share there. Maybe that's complete then. Now, what's happened? See, I started out
thinking oxygen might be the central one. But as soon as I connected carbon, I saw that I
couldn't connect anything else to oxygen. So, um, well, my first observation, which I didn't
draw anything for was I said, if I put the hydrogens right there, I'm going to have just
water, and then I've got the carbon and nothing to connect it to. You look a little shocked or
dazed. Am I going too fast here? No, that makes sense. Okay. So it turns out the way I do this,
carbon did end up being the central atom. So then I would just redraw this, I would put C. And I
have two shared pairs with oxygen. So I'm going to draw a double bond to oxygen. But I want to show
these pairs here as well. So dot, dot, dot, dot. And then I want to show that I have these
hydrogens here. So that's a shared pair. So I just have to do H and show a bond and H and show
a bond. So let's count on now. H has one shared pair. H is happy. H here has one shared pair.
He's happy. Carbon now has four bonds. One, two, three, four. So that makes carbon happy. And oxygen
has two, four, six, eight electrons around it. So it's pretty happy as well. So that's probably the
right answer then. Does that make sense? That does make sense, because the bonds have to connect
somehow. So the carbon sense it has, four valence electrons, it's going to connect to the oxygen,
because the oxygen needs to be satisfied, because the oxygens and the hydrogen. Hydrogens can
act because it causes two electrons to make a bond. Let's go back and another way to check this.
Let's count the valence electrons. We could have done this at the very beginning. Carbon has four
valence electrons, right, because it's in group four. Hydrogen has one valence electron, because it's in
group one A. So it has, since there's two of them, that's two valence electrons. And oxygen is in group
six A, so it has six valence electrons. So tall together, there's 12 valence electrons, 12 valence
