Oh, okay. Let me see.
And then I think that's all the questions I have for Module 3.
Is there an email?
I think that's all.
Getting flustered.
All right.
Which one?
It's on page 107, example 3.3.
Oh man, they work it out for you.
You really need that one?
I think I can manage with figuring that one out.
I think the one that can be used is on your own 3.7.
Because it's relating that to the color.
Okay.
Okay, so.
Oh, there she is.
Can you hear us, Linda?
Yeah.
Okay.
Sorry about all that.
It kicked us out, but then it gave me a button to restart it.
So if we go another 40 minutes, then we'll do the same thing.
So y'all just try to log in.
Okay.
So the question, let's say we're going to go to on your own 3.7.
Where they give you an energy.
Now my book has a typo.
It says 3.3 times 10 to the minus nine joules.
But the actual correction is 3.3 times 10 to the minus 19.
Is that what you're saying?
That is minus 19.
Okay.
All right.
Let me share my screen again.
I don't know if y'all got.
Which problem are we on?
On your own 3.7.
At the bottom of page 108 in the textbook.
Okay.
Get everything off of this that you needed.
The previous problem.
I have a picture on that.
So I can, I can send that to you all if you need.
No, I'm good.
All right. Let's.
Should take a moment and.
Let's see.
Oh yeah, there's a screen race.
Okay, good.
All right. I'm learning as I go here.
Sorry guys.
All right.
So it says that the energy.
Well.
Yeah.
It didn't go right back to pan.
If it would if I turned my pen over to pan.
See this is why they never picked me for the sports teams.
He.
Is given as.
3.3.
Times 10.
Minus 19.
Jules.
Okay.
Jules is a unit of energy.
And so we'll have to figure out.
What that is.
And I think that a J is a.
Newton meter per second squared.
Or a jule per hertz.
Is H. Okay.
That's probably easier to do.
So.
All right. So now the question is.
What color is it?
So we're going to have to go from.
Energy.
To.
And again, they're referring us to figure 310.
Which is on page 100.
Put a bookmark there.
Might help me.
It's going to fall out.
Oh wow.
We need to go from energy.
Or Jules.
To wavelength.
All right.
But to get there.
We're going to actually go through.
Frequency.
Then we're going to go from frequency to wavelength.
Much, much like we did in the previous problems.
All right.
So.
So.
So.
So.
So what is the equation that's relevant?
We know that.
E.
Equal to a constant.
H called plonks constant.
Times the frequency.
So.
To get the frequency.
This is a three element equation.
I'm going to rearrange it.
I'm going to say that frequency.
Is equal to.
A constant.
H called plonks constant.
Times the frequency.
Is equal to.
E.
Divided by.
H.
Okay.
Okay.
Um.
And so what I can do then is put in my number here for Jules.
And then get H.
In an appropriate set of units.
Um.
And then we'll see what happens.
So.
To get the freak.
And then I'm going to have to.
Go from frequency to lambda.
So remember that would be F is equal to.
I'm sorry.
Lambda.
Is equal to C.
Divided by the frequency.
All right.
So let's do this part first.
So our frequency.
Is equal to.
That many Jules.
Three.
Point three.
Times 10.
Minus 19.
Jules.
Divided by H.
In a convenient unit for H.
Is.
Um.
Where is it?
Okay.
It's going to be.
Six point three.
Is equal to.
Is equal to.
Six point.
Six three.
Can't even put a point there.
Digitally.
Times 10 of the minus 34.
And that's Jules per hertz.
When the first one if it's Jules per hertz.
If we're trying to cancel the.
Units out, wouldn't that mean that it's.
Um.
Invert inverse Jules.
Would that be able to.
Invert inverse Jules.
Invert inverse Jules.
Invert inverse Jules.
Would that be like one over.
One over J or J over one for the first one.
For the numerator here.
I'm sorry.
Say that again.
So I know that we're going to have to.
Convert the units and make sure that the units are okay.
So.
This one I know that they kind of gave us.
The J over hertz.
So for the first one what would.
How do we put that in fraction?
We put that J over one one over J.
Or is there another unit that we need to use to find?
Well, I can see that Jules here is going to cancel Jules here.
And I can see that because I've done this 10 million times.
So let's just keep going the slow way that I.
