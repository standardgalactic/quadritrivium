Go sometimes.
I'm going to put the numbers first.
So I've got.
3.3.
10 to the minus 19.
Divided by.
6.63.
10 to the minus 19.
Divided by.
3.3.
Times 10.
Y times 10.
Minus 34.
Okay, that's my calculator work there.
And then for units, I have Jules.
I could put Jules over one to make this more transparent to you.
Divided by.
Jules.
Okay.
So this part, I'm going to go up here.
So that's.
Jules divided by one.
And then to do this big division sign here, I turn this fraction upside down.
So that's going to be times hurts.
Her jewel.
If that seems totally strange to you, you probably need to.
Go back and review fractions from algebra or whatever.
What, what math are you in right now?
Say again.
Algebra.
Okay.
So this should be.
So that's going to be times.
Her jewel.
If that seems totally strange to you, you probably need to.
Go back and review fractions.
From algebra or whatever you're.
What, what math are you in right now?
Say again.
Okay.
So this should be an algebra too.
This.
Well, maybe I was a bit different than when I took it.
But this fixing this fraction like this should be automatic.
So I see now that.
Jules cancel out.
And so that leaves me just hurts.
Okay.
So somebody.
I could take this number here.
Let's see what we get.
So three divided by six is about a half.
So.
I'll recalculate.
I'm going to say 0.5.
Times and then I've got 10 minus 19.
And to bring this to the numerator, I.
Add 34.
So that's going to be 10.
To the 15th.
Hurts.
Is that right?
Is that right?
Is that right?
Is that right?
Is that right?
Is that right?
Is that's, that's the unit's up here.
That gave me.
4.9.
Okay.
So it can read it.
It gave me 4.977.
And so on to 10 to the 14th.
Okay.
Oh.
All right.
So you.
So the answer of 3.3 divided by 6.6.
Is 0.498.
But.
The calculation.
Yeah, you did the whole calculation.
So this is 10 of the 14.
Which again, since it's a visible.
Did it say it's visible?
Yeah, visible light.
It should be something times 10 of the 14.
So about.
Almost five times 10 of the 14.
Hurts is the frequency.
All right.
Now to get wavelengths to see what frequency that is.
I've got to use.
Lambda is equal to.
C over F.
Write that down again.
That's equal to.
3.0.
Times 10.
To the eighth.
Meters per second.
Divided by my frequency.
Sorry.
Divider line had to dip.
4.98.
4.
Times 10.
To the 14.
And instead of her.
So I'm going to go and put it back in.
A hurts is a one over a second.
Okay.
And.
So that's a calculator problem.
So 3.
10.
To the eight.
10.
10.
To the eight.
Divided by.
4.98.
Times 10 of the 14.
10.
Then the units are.
Meters per second.
Divided by.
One over seconds.
One over seconds.
That would give us.
We'll have to put that right to meters per second.
Times.
Meters over seconds.
Second over one.
Right.
And that means the seconds are going to.
In fact.
My mind says this.
S is in the denominator.
And down here it's in the denominator.
So I know those are going to cancel.
I don't have to do the algebra.
M is in the numerator.
One is in the numerator.
So those stay.
So M divided by one is M.
So the units is meters.
And.
What do we get for this math here?
I got.
6.02.
Times.
10.
Negative seven.
Okay.
And to go to our chart.
We need it in.
Nanometers.
So let's.
Put in a conversion here where I go from.
Nanometers I want that in the numerator.
To meters in my denominator.
The one that I can remember is that one meter.
Is a billion nanometers.
Right.
So that's equal to one.
And so all I have to do now is add the coefficient.
So that's going to be.
6.02.
Times.
10.
Minus seven plus nine is two.
And the remaining unit here, the meters cancel.
Is nanometers.
So 6.02 times 100.
Is.
102.
Nanometers.
And you go look at the thing on page 100.
And 600 is yellow orange.
Kind of halfway between yellow and orange, I guess.
I don't know.
It's about the best you can do.
So that's goes to yellow.
That makes a lot of sense.
Okay, so here, so this is a multi step problem.
So it had to go from energy.
The frequency from frequency to wavelength.
And then wavelength in the right units to match the table we had.
So, so this 6.02 times 10 minus seven meters is the correct answer,
but the units are just not useful to us.
So to change the units, we multiply by one.
So.
And I would just, I've tried to say this to people,
but I don't take the shortcut.
Don't assume that the units are going to work out because I can pretty much guarantee you.
They won't, they won't be natural units.
That's part of the fun of learning this type of stuff.
So.
