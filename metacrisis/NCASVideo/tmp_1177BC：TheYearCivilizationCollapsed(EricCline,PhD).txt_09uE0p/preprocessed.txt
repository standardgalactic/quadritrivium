Well, welcome.
My topic today I'm going to talk about 1177 BC, so let me take you away from rainy Bethesda
and take you back more than 3,000 years in the past.
More hopefully it's a little warmer and sunnier.
This is the late Bronze Age.
This is the period that is, I would say, nearest and dearest to my heart.
If I could be reincarnated backwards, I would choose to live back then.
I'm sure I would not live more than about 48 hours, but it'd be a good 48 hours.
So we're in the period from 1700 to about 1200 BC here, 500 years.
And you can see from this map the different colored areas are the different civilizations
that were around at that point.
Basically I call them, for shorthand, the G8 of the ancient world, because there's actually
nine, but never mind.
So it's close.
So we've got Minoans and Mycenaeans over in Greece, we've got Hittites up in Turkey, we've
got the Egyptians, which are coming up here in Tecanon, Mitanni here, Assyrians and Babylonians,
Cypriots here.
These are the great powers of the late Bronze Age.
They're all flourishing 3,500 years ago, give or take.
And this is actually a period that you know about.
You might not have thought you knew about it, but you do.
Because in this time period we've got Hatshepsut, the world's first female pharaoh, familiar
to anybody.
You've all heard of her, right?
Tupmosus III, her stepson.
I'm in Hotep the Third.
How about Akhenaten, the heretic pharaoh?
All right, okay, so he's in this period as well.
I am venturing to guess that most of you have heard of King Tut.
Would I be correct about that?
Yes, okay, so that's this period as well.
Ramses II, pharaoh of the Exodus, if it took place, that's another lecture.
Ramses III is going to be our boy today.
He's going to be the hero of this particular period.
This is also the time when we get the battle of Kadesh between the Egyptians and the Hittites,
1279, little thing called the Trojan War.
Heard of that?
That's at this time period.
In fact, this is the context for the Trojan War.
I do think it happened.
Again, that's a topic for another lecture.
My wife does not think it happened.
We argue about this at home.
Others argue over mortgage payments.
We argue about the Trojan War.
And then again, this is the period of the Exodus, probably about 1250 BC, if it took
place.
So you see, you already know this period even if you thought that you did not.
Now one thing that is special about this period is that it is globalized for its time period.
That is, it's not globalized like we are today, but from Italy on the west to Iraq and India
on the east, they are all in connection with each other.
They are all in contact from Turkey in the north down to Egypt in the south.
We get one of these social network diagrams.
That's what my wife does, social network analysis.
So this is courtesy of her.
You know the, what is it, six degrees of Kevin Bacon with all the movies?
Yeah.
Same thing here, except that this is what's called a small world, which means there are
no more than three leaps between any two pairs or any pair of people.
So if the Mycenaeans did not know the Assyrians, they knew the Hittites who knew the Assyrians
and you could get there within one or two leaps.
Now the reason this is important is that there's been very few times in history where we've
had such a situation.
Us today is one, them back then is another.
So this is why I would say that looking at what happened to these guys, even though it
was more than 3,200 years ago, is actually relevant to today because looking at what
happened to them might have implications for us today as well.
And what happened, well, they collapsed.
Just after 1200 BC, everything that had been going very nicely for several centuries by
this point comes to a crashing halt on either side of 1200 BC.
Everybody that I just mentioned goes down.
We get a dark age that lasts for between 150 and 300 years and basically civilization has
to reboot in this area.
So this was a huge loss to the world.
It is comparable to the collapse of the Roman Empire, which happened 1500 years later.
The main problem is we're not really sure what caused it.
So that's what I want to talk about mostly today are the possible explanations for what
caused that collapse and then see if maybe we should start going, hmm, yeah, all right.
So it used to be that it was a very simple explanation.
When I was in graduate school, when I was an undergraduate and for decades before me,
the simple solution was that the Sea Peoples had done it.
When in doubt, the Sea Peoples.
So who are the Sea Peoples?
Well, this is the Egyptian name for them.
The Egyptians actually, it's our name for them.
We call them the Sea Peoples.
The Egyptians talk about a number of different groups coming through the Eastern Mediterranean
and winding up in Egypt on the shores, attacking them not once, but twice over a 30 year period.
They come in 1207 and they come in 1177 and yes, 1177 is where I get the title of the
book.
It is the second time that Egypt is invaded by these people.
Now the problem is in fact that the dates change.
The Egyptologists keep changing the chronology.
So a better way to put it is the fifth year of Merneptah and the eighth year of Ramses,
the third and that way you don't have to worry about it, right?
On their inscriptions they say, in my fifth year this happened and in the eighth year this
happened.
That is why the, well, when the book came out two years ago, I got a nice note from
a senior colleague in New York City and he sent me an email and all he said is, congrats
on the book, the title should have been 1186 BC.
I wrote him back a two word email.
No, it's not what you're thinking.
I wrote back and said it was and in fact the original contract which I had signed with
Princeton back in 2007, the title was 1186 BC, but in the interim while I was working
on it the Egyptologists changed the chronology again.
So it became 1177.
Ironically since it's come out they've changed the chronology back.
So the next edition is probably going to be called 1186, question mark, something like
that.
All right, so what we get, the Egyptians tell us in both reigns and Monapta and Ramses the
third, but let me focus on Ramses the third here because it's more literally picturesque.
He leaves on the wall of his mortuary temple in Egypt, a place called Medinat Habu which
is near the valley of the kings.
In fact, I presume some of you have been there.
Anybody been to Medinat Habu?
No?
I think we need a field trip for sure, definitely.
All right, well it's over by King Tutstume, the valley of the kings on a wall of his temple
which is what you're looking at here on the left hand side and you see the drawing on
the right hand side.
He gives us a picture of the invasion and an inscription of what went on.
So he tells us the foreign countries made a conspiracy in their islands, all at once
the lands were removed and scattered in their fray.
No land could stand before their arms and then he tells us what happens, who they overran
from Hattay, Koday, Karkamesh, Artswa and Alashia on.
We know where these places are, Hattay is Turkey, it's the Hittites, Koday is where
Turkey meets Syria, Karkamesh, northern Syria, Artswa is actually western Turkey on the coast
there, Alashia is the ancient name for Cyprus.
Well these people are sweeping across from west to east, across Turkey, down the Levant,
across Cyprus.
They set up a camp in Amor, that's northern Syria, desolated its people, its land was
like that which has never come into being, they were coming forward toward Egypt, flame
was prepared before them and then he actually tells us the name of the peoples.
He says their confederation was the Peleset, the Tejaker, the Shekelesh, the Denian and
the Weshesh.
So he gives us, how many is that, one, two, three, four, five right there.
There's another six that are mentioned the first time back in 1207, two of them overlap
so there's a total of nine separate groups that come twice in those 30 years.
So where are they from, what are they doing, what happens to them, well we're told part
of that.
Merneptah says in another inscription from a couple years later he says, I overthrew
those who invaded from their lands, I slew the Denian who were in their isles, the Tejaker
and the Peleset were made ashes, the Shardana and the Weshesh of the sea, they were made
as those that exist not.
So he beats them and in fact Merneptah had beaten them back in 1207 as well.
So they come twice, they lose twice, they do not come a third time, that's it, alright.
Now the question is where do they come from and what do they look like, well what do they
look like is easy because Ramsey shows us the pictures, this is a picture of the sea
peoples.
In fact if anybody is going to dress up for Halloween, there you go, right though it's
actually I've got a cheaper way to do it, when I was in grad school the two people the
year behind me they came to our Halloween party with about 100 paper mache seas stapled
to their clothes, we said what are you, they said well we're sea peoples, so they won first
place, so true story, alright so that's what they look like, the problem is though where
do they come from.
So for instance one of the groups is Shardana, the other is Shekelesh, Tejaker, Denian the
names I just read to you, can you think of any place in the Mediterranean either eastern
or western that looks like Shardana?
Sardania, absolutely, so people think that maybe they're from Sardania or maybe they
went there afterward, one way or the other, how about Shekelesh, any place in the Mediterranean
got the same consonants, forget about the vowels with the same consonants, no not Askelon
though that is an interesting idea but no, somewhere near Sardania, Sicily, absolutely,
right so Sicily, Tejaker's a little bit harder we're thinking maybe the Troad or Cycles,
so either Italy or Troy, Denian, many people have suggested these are Homer's Danottans,
so the Mycenaeans from Greece, the Weshash, not sure, ancient name for Troy is Willousus,
so maybe that's where they're from, the only one that we're pretty sure we know and it
was actually identified already by Champollion, the guy that deciphered hieroglyphics, is the
Pleset, anybody care to take a guess where the Pleset might be, Philistines, the Philistines
and in fact the Bible says the Philistines came from Crete, so that would actually fit,
so we may be able to identify where these people come from but it's not for sure by
a long shot and in fact the original people talking about this weren't sure if they,
as I said, came from there or if they went there, alright and that has not been decided
either, what has been decided is that they said the Sea Peoples were responsible for
the collapse, 1207, 1177, that was the answer, Gaston Mossbrough and French Egyptologists
had already put this theory, it was a theory, actually it was a hypothesis, in about 1850,
by 1901 it was solidified and so every time an archaeologist excavated a site that was
destroyed they said see, it's the Sea Peoples, the problem is of course that's backwards,
it's not what you do, so I actually think that this is not the right answer, even though
there are some interesting parts to it, so for instance here's your Sea Peoples again,
the Philistines and we do have Philistine remains in the region that is now Israel,
also Lebanon, also Syria, this is degenerate Mycenaean pottery, it looks like somebody
from Greece came over, made it but the clay that they're using is from Cyprus or Rhodes
or the Levant, so it really does look like you've got Mycenaeans that join in and come
on over, so there is something to the suggestion that the Sea Peoples were real, the Egyptians
are not just making them up, but if we take a look at the inscription that he actually
leaves us, what Ramsey shows us and it's kind of hard to see but on the left you've got
the actual drawing, on the top right is an artist's rendition of it and then down bottom
a modern day parallel, what Ramsey shows us is that these people that are coming, they're
not like Vikings, they're not just raiding, they're bringing their families, you've got
the wife, you've got the kids, you've got the belongings, you've got the ox cart, these
are people moving, they're migrating, so instead of Vikings think of the Dust Bowl
from the 1930s here in America, everybody moving from Oklahoma to California, it's
that kind of thing, so the question then becomes, what could have started such a migration?
Now I also think that it's a little too simplistic to give the explanation that I was taught
in graduate school, they said, oh there was a drought and that led to famine and that
led to the movement of the Sea Peoples, that led to cutting of the trade routes and that
then led to collapse because they were not self-sufficient enough.
Now on the one hand, that's a nice explanation, on the other hand you'll notice it's quite
linear, you will also probably realize it's never that nice, it's a lot more messy and
so I think that this is not the right answer, I think it's too simple.
The Sea Peoples are part of it, yes, but they're not the sole reason and in fact I think they
might have been as much the victims as they were the oppressors, that is they are one
of the symptoms of this, but I don't think they're the cause, I think they are a bogeyman
that's been used to scare little kids for the last couple of generations, or at least
if your parents are archeologists it was.
So I was skeptical, shall we say, and I wanted to look around for what really happened, so
what I want to present to you today is my alternate hypothesis for what caused the collapse
and then see what you think of it.
Now I remind you that we've got a globalized society for that time, for that period with
everybody in contact with everybody else and I give you one major example, I said that
this is the late Bronze Age and actually the Bronze Age goes from 3000 to 1000 BC give
or take and we're in that last part of it, you've got the early, middle and late.
The way you make bronze as I put up here is tin and copper, right, 90% copper, 10% tin.
Some of you may know that if you don't have tin you can actually use something else, anybody
know what that is, you can actually use arsenic, I don't recommend it, you won't live long
but you can make arsenic bronze, but here most of the copper is used to make bronze
at that time, the copper is not a problem, it's coming from Cyprus, in fact that's where
the word comes from, Cyprus means copper.
The tin is a little bit more problematic, possible some came from Cornwall though I
rather doubt they got up there more than once in the blue moon, there are some tin mines
in southern Turkey but not enough, the vast majority came from Afghanistan, specifically
the Badakshan region of Afghanistan, now anybody here have lapis lazuli jewelry, anything
like that, same area, right, lapis and tin come from the same area of Afghanistan, so
we have to get it all the way from Afghanistan over to this area and we do know that they
are doing this because we have a text from the site of Mari which is on the Euphrates
river, I'm actually not sure that Mari exists anymore because ISIS took it over and we're
busy looting it so it may be gone by now, but the Mari letters which were found by the
French in the 1920s, one of them says that tin is coming there and being sent on to Ugarit
on the northern coast of Syria and from there is being sent on to Crete, so you can see
that you've got a trade route of hundreds if not thousands of miles, if you cut it at
any point you are indeed in trouble and in fact a colleague of mine in England has said
that for them tin was like oil is for us and that keeping the steady flow of tin is the
same problem that we've got for oil and I think that's a pretty good analogy, but bear
in mind that they're also importing finished goods as well, we've got them swapping raw
materials, not just tin and copper but also gold and silver and other things, but along
with the raw materials are coming the finished goods, they've got a regular trade circuit
going here, so this is one of my favorite, it's another one of these Mari letters, actually
dates from just after 1800 BC, one Kaftorian weapon, now Kaftor is their name for Crete
and the Minoans, so this is a weapon from Crete, the top and the base are covered with
gold, its top is encrusted with lapis lazuli, now this is not the dagger, this is from the
death pits of war, but still I thought it illustrated it nicely a gold dagger with lapis
lazuli and I don't know about you, I want one of these, I'd happily carry it open whatever
but I think my absolute favorite is another letter that says one pair of leather shoes
in the Kaftorian style, so Minoan shoes, and if you've been to Crete you know there's
probably sandals, though they could be boots, which to the palace of Hammurabi, King of
Babylon and yes that is the Hammurabi, right an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, Bakhti
limb carried but which were returned, so these sandals come all the way from Crete to Babylon,
they're given to Hammurabi, he doesn't like them and he returns them, why, I don't know,
too small, two last millennium, at any rate, so for fun at GW I once had my students look
at Hammurabi's law code all 272 or 282 laws and I said find the penalty for returning
shoes and they came back Chris Fallon and they said there is no penalty, I said exactly,
so nothing changes, that's one of the interesting things about it, so we've got this globalized
society, trade, reciprocity, diplomacy, everybody's marrying each other's daughters for gold
and silver and whatnot and then into it you drop a little chaos and suddenly we've got
a big, big problem and one by one these wink out until you're only left with Egypt, everybody
else goes away, no more Mycenaeans, no more Minoans, no more Hittites, no more Cypriots
at least temporarily, only the Egyptians survive because they win but it's a Pyrrhic victory,
they're never as strong again, that was their high point, the New Kingdom period, so
When you say the others went away, they completely died out or their civilization became more
primitive?
Pretty much went away, the 1% is gone and I'll come back to this but they lose the
art of writing, they lose the art of large buildings, you get a dark age, alright, so
Mycenaean civilization is considered to end just after 1200, same with Minoans, same with
Hittites, same with the Syrians, same with Babylonia, you will get successors which will
get there with Neo in front of them, the Neo-Hittites, the Neo-Syrians, the Neo-Babylonians, so it's
not the end of the world as we know it but it's close, okay, so what I would like to
do then is to figure out if it's not the Sea Peoples then what else could have caused this,
so could it have been drought like some have suggested, could it have been famine, could
it have been invaders, could it have been earthquakes and my answer to this is yes, I actually
think it's all of them because you can survive a famine, at least some people can, you can
survive a drought, you can survive invaders, you can survive an earthquake, yes lots of
people will die but your civilization does not end, what if you have more than one of
them then, if you have a multiplier effect, if you have what I would call a perfect storm
and that's what I think happens, so let me quickly run through the evidence for each
of those and then see what you think, so for instance drought, drought's not a new suggestion,
already back in the 1960's Reese Carpenter who was a professor at Bryn Mawr was suggesting
that the Mycenaeans came to an end because of drought but he didn't have hard data, he
didn't have proof for it, it was just a hypothesis, he looked at changes in population, he looked
at population movements and various things and he hypothesized that this is what caused
it but it remained just a hypothesis and it was never proven so people kind of forgot
about it, however in the last five years we now have the data that he was looking for
so we can now bring it back scientifically, there is a guy named Kaniyouski, he works out
of Paris, he's got an international team and he went to the site of Gibala in North Syria
back in 20, actually he was there in about 2010, published the article in 2011 and what
they did was to take samples from dried up lagoons and lakes and look at the pollen that
was in there and what they found was that there is what he called a dry event, a 300-year
long dry event, the pollen showed that there was drier climatic conditions in the Mediterranean
from the 12th century until the 9th century so about 1200 BC to about 900 BC there is
this dry event, what we would call climate change, so this was the first instance, he
then went over to Cyprus, did the same thing, published that in 2013 and again took samples
from Halasolt and Teke which has a dried up lagoon and here again major environmental
changes took place in the period from 1200 to 850, it turned the area into a drier landscape
and the precipitation in groundwater probably became insufficient to maintain sustainable
agriculture, so drought in North Syria, drought in Cyprus and then Lee Drake came along and
published a great article in 2012 in the Journal of Archaeological Science in which he looked
at a number of different studies that other people had done and pulled them all together
including things like there is a drop in the temperature of the surface of the sea in the
Aegean which would lead to less rainfall and he concluded also that there was a drought
that started somewhere after 1250 BC and I actually I liked this article so much I did
some I don't usually do, I wanted to send him an email saying that it was a great article,
I did a search for him, he was somewhere like at Northern Arizona University and I typed
in Lee Drake and into Google and it said the very first thing, it said you are friends
on Facebook, seriously, so I wrote to him, I said Lee I guess we're friends on Facebook,
anyway great article and he wrote right back to me, it says good to hear from you, I haven't
seen you since Megiddo in 2006, so we dug together, so be careful who you're writing
to, you may actually know them, so what was neat though, he was in the Philippines searching
for down World War II aircraft with XRF stuff, so pretty neat stuff, anyway so he
came up with this and then the other scientific survey that is relevant was done by Daphne
Langut, you can see her down here at Israel Finkelstein and Thomas Litt and they went
to the Sea of Galilee and to the Dead Sea and they showed that there was a drought there
as well but shorter, this time it was only from about 1250 to 1100, so as a result of
this now we've got drought, North Syria, Cyprus, Israel and Greece which means that it's pretty
much Mediterranean wide, so I think now we've got the data that Reese Carpenter won and
of course as each of these studies came out the world's media grabbed hold of it, so this
is New York Times pollen study points to drought as corporate in Bronze Age mystery, LA Times,
change may have caused demise of late Bronze Age civilizations, National Geographic got
into it, Archaeology magazine came out with something, New York Post and they threw in
globalization for good matter as well, right so this made headlines all around the world,
so I do think that we've got evidence for drought and then you may remember the NASA
funded study that said that we were going to end in a couple of decades except then it
turned out NASA hadn't funded it but never mind and so at that point I decided I wrote
an op-ed that came out in the Huffington Post, the collapse of civilizations, it's complicated,
right which it is, so we've got drought and drought frequently leads to famine but how
do you find archaeological evidence for that, it can be tough, unless you find mass graves
something like that you don't know if you've got famine, unless you have written textual
evidence which we have, they are writing back then, there's no problem, this is a nice period
and this site of Ugarit where we already mentioned that the tin was coming at one point, there are
entire archives that have been excavated there, you have to be able to read Acadian or Ugaritic
but I presume most of you can so that's not a problem, so here we've got one letter from the
house of Ortenu, Ortenu is one of the merchants that's both working for himself and on behalf of
the government and he says that there is a famine ravaging the city of Imar, now that's in inland
Syria but he was such a good businessman that he had a branch in Imar, so he's based in Ugarit but
he's over in Imar and he says in about 1185 there's famine in our house will all die of hunger,
if you don't quickly arrive here we ourselves will die of hunger, you will not see a living soul,
so famine, drought, yes I think so, but just in case here's a letter from the king of Ugarit to
somebody who's not named but he's probably his peer, here with me plenty has become famine, so
Ugarit itself also is suffering, up in Turkey they are hit as well, two letters from the Hittite
King one says do you not know that there was a famine in the midst of my lands and the other one
says it's a matter of life and death, so I think we're on pretty safe ground to say that there is
famine and that people are dying from it, now what about invaders or even internal rebellion, I think
these both happened as well but it can be hard to tell them apart whether you've got people from
outside or people from inside, so in terms of outsiders again we've got written textual evidence
and this again is from the city of Ugarit, it's just a wealth of information, in fact they've just
published three more volumes in French that I haven't even seen yet and I want to see what's in
those, but here this was found quite a while ago and it reports on ships of the enemy, my father
now the ships of the enemy have come, they've been setting fire to my cities, they've done harm to
the land, doesn't my father know that all of my infantry and territory are stationed in Hati,
so they're up in Turkey, all of my ships are stationed in the land of Luka, that's Lisha,
which is southwestern Turkey, they've not yet arrived back so the land is thus prostrate,
may my father be aware of this, now the seven ships of the enemy which have been coming have
done harm to us, if other ships of the enemy turn up send me a report, now I was taught in
graduate school that this was found in a kiln being about to be baked before they sent it,
which was fairly typical because then you can't change it and that the city had been invaded
again by other ships and it had been destroyed before this could be sent, which is a nice story
right, too good to be true, it turns out upon re-examination that this was not found in a kiln,
it was actually originally in a basket with about 70 other tablets that were up on the
second floor of the palace and they fell during the destruction, toppled over and then the basket
disintegrated so you're left with what looks like a kiln but in fact wasn't anything like it,
so if this is not being baked what's going on, well we're not actually sure when this is from,
it could be from this 1177 or it could be from the earlier one 30 years earlier in 1207, we're
just not sure, so what had been a great piece of evidence goes away but still we can use it for
outside invaders regardless of which invasion it is and then there's a private letter, one of the
last that we know about from Ugarit, when your messenger arrived the army was already humiliated,
the city was sacked, our food and the threshing floors was burnt, the vineyards were also destroyed,
our city is sacked, may you know it, may you know it, so somebody did come and in fact we know that
Ugarit is destroyed, the archaeologists found about six feet of destruction level and bodies in the
streets, arrowheads embedded in the walls, it's definitely war, it's not like mother nature.
Now Kaniyuski in fact looked at this when he was doing the drought at Gibala and he looked at the
destructions and he probably said, ah, sea peoples and he actually published an article that said
the sea peoples were there to which I would respond, look it's definitely destroyed at that time,
yes the sea peoples are around but you cannot say it's sea peoples, there's no little sign there
that says the sea peoples did it, so they might have but they might not have and one of the reasons
that I say this is because of the situation at Hotsor which is in Israel today but it was Canaanite
Hotsor back at that time, that city was also destroyed at about this time between 1250 and 1200,
we know it's destroyed because all the mud bricks in the palace are burnt, cherry red and deep brown
and all of that but it could have been destroyed by anyone of about four different groups,
Egyptians, Canaanites, Israelites, sea peoples or maybe even a fifth possibility in Toronto Rebellion.
Now one of the co-directors, Amnon Ben Tor who's actually going to be coming to this area and
lecturing in November on Hotsor so keep your eye out, I think he'll be at the JCC, might be at
Bassanova if you're familiar with those, he says it's not Egyptians or Canaanites because in the
destruction at Hotsor there are Egyptian statues and Canaanite statues and both of them are defaced,
the arms hacked off, the noses mutilated and he says Egyptians would not do that to Egyptian
statues, Canaanites would not do that to Canaanite statues and then he says it's not the sea peoples
were too far inland at Hotsor which I would disagree with, sea peoples got even further inland but
never mind, so for Ben Tor it leaves only Israelites, specifically Joshua and in the Bible it says that
Joshua burned Hotsor to the ground so for Ben Tor this is evidence of the Israelites and the Exodus
but his co-director Sharon Zuckerman who recently passed away unfortunately she said no it's not
that at all, it's internal rebellion and when Ben Tor said what's your proof she said look at what's
destroyed, the palace is burnt, the temples are burnt but the places where the regular people
are living are not touched, the stores are not touched, she said this is what happens
when the 99% try to overthrow the 1%, that's what you get, so she says it was an internal rebellion
I kind of like that thought process, my point though is if the two co-directors can't decide
who destroyed their site how are we supposed to, right, so yes it could be outsiders but it could
be internal as well but it could also be Mother Nature, it could be earthquakes, so for example
we've got a map of again all the sites that are destroyed after 1200 all of our 1177 everything
that's an X is destroyed but if you put on top of it a map of earthquakes that have happened in
this region just since 1900 you can actually see that most of the sites that are destroyed are in
active seismic zones and in fact there are faults going all over this region including the famous
one going right up the rift valley there with the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee but you've got for
example the north Anatolian fault line going right across Turkey and this has done something
interesting in the last 60 or 70 years there have been earthquakes upon earthquake upon
earthquake following one upon the other and this is what's known in modern parlance by
seismologists as an earthquake sequence, namely if you've got an earthquake and it doesn't release
all the tension in the fault line you'll have another earthquake very soon thereafter might be
days might be weeks could be months but you'll have another earthquake if that doesn't release
all the pressure you'll then have another one and another one and another one until the fault
line is basically unzipped and all the pressure is gone you will then have about 400 years before
the pressure builds up enough to start the whole process going again so this is a known feature
for modern and some people the archaeo seismologists the ones that study ancient earthquakes
say the same thing happened in antiquity but there they've got a six year name for it they call it
an earthquake storm rather than earthquake sequence and I think we've got one at about this time
period because we can see earthquakes in this region from about 1225 to 1175 there's about a
50 year period of what look like earthquake damage so for example here's Mycenae right capital
of the Mycenaeans in Greece you've got the famous lion gate right here but look off to the side here
underneath the big cyclopean wall right here you've got that kind of a slope there anybody recognize
what that is because the geologists and seismologists looked at it and just started laughing that's
one side of a slip zone that's part of an active fault and they said the Mycenaeans built their
capital city or one of their capital ones right on top of an active fault line who does that who
builds a major city on top of an active fault and then Amos Nor from Stanford said well I'm from San
Francisco yeah yes it has moved there have been numerous earthquakes and yes yes it has right but
it's not just at Mycenae it's elsewhere as well but when I went looking for evidence because Amos
Nor and I work together on this we found evidence of earthquake victims at many sites so for instance
this young woman it's the same skeleton in both pictures this stone right there was embedded in
her skull when she was first excavated she had actually sheltered in a doorway which is supposed
to be the safest place in this case the doorway collapsed and killed her all right so that's at
Mycenae just about 10 kilometers away at Tirans there's another set a woman and a child lying
underneath a fallen wall if you go across to Troy on the northwestern coast of Turkey trust
me that wall is not supposed to look like that right this is I was there about a year ago took
the same picture right there Troy 6 is probably one of the cities of the Trojan War it fits perfectly
it's 1250 BC but it's destroyed by an earthquake same thing back at Ugarit but this is a little
bit earlier this is a wall from about 1365 Ugarit seems to be hit by a number of earthquakes
but again trust me that wall was not supposed to look like that that's what happens after an
earthquake so I think some of the destructions that have been attributed to the Sea Peoples
are actually caused by mother nature all right so you've got some of that going on and by the way
to anticipating any questions you might have the climate change yes it's also mother nature the
Hittites are not driving SUVs back then right so we've got mother nature doing some stuff back
then as far as cutting the international trade routes I think this is what happens I think it
is part of the scenario and we've got evidence for what had gone on before that so for instance
Hatshepsut whom I mentioned she sends an expedition down to Punt she puts it on her mortuary temple
here this would be about 1500 BC give or take she's even got pictures of what they saw down there
and what they brought back this is the queen of Punt down there in the bottom and she even tells us
that her name is Eti ETI so we know that they went down to Punt the problem is we didn't know where
Punt was it could be Yemen it could be Ethiopia it could be any number of places turns out it is
Ethiopia or Eritrea or Ethiopia because of a baboon mummy in the British Museum where they've
analyzed it and said that that's the nice parallel so that's kind of neat they are also in contact
in Egypt with Greece at that time here's a tomb painting from the tomb of Rek Mare these are
Minoans bringing gifts to Egypt same thing in another tomb you got looks like a decapitated
bull's head that's a Minoan vessel so we've got international trade between Crete and the Egyptians
we've also got trade with the Mycenaeans right recognize these the Colossae of Memnon this is
Amonhotep the third's mortuary temple little after 1400 BC he builds this temple it's now
completely gone because the later pharaohs used it as a quarry to make their own buildings right why
go and cut stone when you can just rob a guy who's dead anyway so the entire mortuary temple is gone
but there are still bits and pieces in here including you see the little feet right there
there were a line of about 10 statue bases which once held statues that are about 10 feet tall
Colossae are 60 feet tall these guys were smaller just about 10 feet tall and one of them has a
list of names that's never been seen before in Egypt and never is again at least most of them
the two names on the right here are like head names like titles one says Kaftor and the other says
actually says Keftiou and the other says Tanaya remember I said Kaftor is Crete that was the
Mesopotamian Akkadian name in Egypt it's Keftiou same thing Keftiou is Crete Tanaya is mainland
Greece it's the Mycenaeans so you've got mainland Greece and Crete on one side and then 14 other
names going around the base and these are Amnesos Festos Mycenae Canalsos Amnesos actually is on
there twice Kithra is on there Naphthion's on there these are names and places in Mycenaean Greece
and like I say these have never been seen in Egypt before and they will never be seen again
when they were first identified in about 1965 the British Egyptologist guy named Ken Kitchen he
published an article in which he said I hardly dare suggest but these names look uncomfortably
like Mycenaean and Canalsos well he was quite right that's exactly what they were so I actually
think that when you take a look in Greece at what's been found you've got Amon Hothup the third the
guy who made the statue base list you have his objects at many of the sites that are listed on
that statue base so here are fragments of an Egyptian pheon's plaque with Amon Hothup's name
on it found at Mycenaean in fact there's about 10 of them found at Mycenaean nowhere else are these
found outside of Egypt except for here you've also got a scarab with his name on it found at
Canalsos where the Minoans are on Crete so I think what we've actually got on the statue base
they're actually in geographical order if you look at it it looks like a trip that goes from
Egypt to Crete up to mainland Greece back to Crete and then back to Egypt I actually think
that's why Amon Hothup is on there twice because it's a round trip so you're going from Egypt up to
Crete and they're like okay everybody out coffee bathroom right it's like being on the New Jersey
Turnpike then they go around so they're visiting the Minoans who they've known now then they go
visit the Mycenaeans who are new to them and then they're like okay and last stop is again
Amon Hothup everybody out use the bathroom get a drink and then we're heading back to Egypt
all right so I think that's why so I can't prove it but I think that's what's going on
and one of the reasons why I think this is a a decent explanation we have another text from Ugarit
it's called the Sinoranu text because it's a guy named Sinoranu it's by the way I wanted
to name my child that my wife objected for some reason thought he'd be unique right Sinoranu
Klein are you here oh yeah but no from the present day Amostamru the son of Nick Meppa that's the
king of Ugarit exempt Sinoranu son of Sigino his grain his beer his olive oil to the palace
he shall not deliver his ship is exempt when it arrives from Crete so you've got a merchant
named Sinoranu in Ugarit North Syria sending a ship to Crete coming back with olive oil
grain and beer and when it comes back he doesn't have to pay import tax on it right I think this
may be the world's first corporate exemption in history right but it does mean that we've got these
ships going around and in fact we found one off the coast of Turkey there's a ship that
went down in about 1300 BC in a place called Ula Barun this is National Geographic's reconstruction
of it Carver's story December 1987 if you want to go check it out this is what it looked like
when they were diving down there you've got almost well just about 300 ingots of pure copper from
Cyprus each of them weighing about 60 pounds and actually there's so much copper on board you could
have outfitted an army of 300 people with swords and shields and helmets and everything else
they've also got about 14 of these big blocks of stone each with one hole in them anybody identify
what those are yeah very good stone anchors absolutely as one gets caught just cut the rope
and bring the other one up in the meantime you're using them as ballast and to balance your ship
right so there's about 10 tons of copper on board this wreck here's my friend Nicole she never wore
a jacket even though this is 140 feet below the surface they could only go down twice a day for
20 minutes at a time and the director George Bass who it's a great name isn't it George Bass for
the father of underwater archaeology perfect name he said this was as if you had had two martinis
and then tried to work but working was you know 140 feet down and you could drown so they never
had an accident not a major accident in 20,000 dives over 12 years it's because they had an
X Navy seal in charge so right anyway at 10 tons of copper there's also a ton of tin on board and
remember the 90% copper and 10% tin they could have made a fortune in bronze off of here all the
raw materials up here this is actually my favorite raw material there ingots of raw glass in this case
colored with cobalt so they're blue but they also had purple and rose and brown and down here lower
left terribent resin from the pistachio tree you use it in making perfume you also use it to color
wax uh ivory both elephant and hippopotamus we had always thought all the ivory in the late bronze
was elephant once it turned out these were hippo they went to all the museums and retested turns
out about 90% of the ivory is from hippo they're like that's strange there aren't any hippos in
the regional Levant anymore then somebody went yeah I think I know why right and then some brand
new Cypriot and Canaanite pottery that would have been delivered somewhere so this ship is
it's a microcosm of the international trade of the time there are seven different cultures
represented on board uh in terms of the goods both finished and raw so it's probably going
round and round but it could be a gift from one king to another they could have been on a shopping
expedition I mean we'll never know we will never know but it does show what's going on at that time
and in fact we've got a letter from that period also I will bring to you as a present 200 talents
of copper now what we've got on the ship is 300 talents of copper so it shows that that's what
they're doing back then so again globalized economy and I remind you about the copper and 10
in antiquity so to sum up let me present three points that I think we can all agree on so the first
would you agree that we've got a number of separate civilizations that are flourishing
back then from the 15th to the 13th just after the 12th Mycenaeans and Minoans Hittites Egyptians
Babylonians Assyrians Canaanite Cypriots they're all independent but they interacted with each
other and if I persuaded you of that so far we agree with that no argument okay point number
two it's clear that many cities were destroyed which they were and the late Bronze Age civilizations
and life as they knew it came to an end a little after 1177 we agreed on that everything's destroyed
all right number three there is no proof as to what caused it right we agree with that as well
so what do we do well people are still presenting the old simple explanation in fact just last
November at our annual meetings a very senior archaeologist got up and presented this and I
stood up and I said this is too simple and he says yeah you have a better idea and I said
yeah actually I do so what I think we've got here I think that again as I said at the beginning
if you ask me are there droughts I would say yes are there famines I would say yes earthquakes yes
invaders yes rebellions yes each of these is a stressor each of them is a driver and you react
to each of them in a different way but I think there's not one there's not two I think there's all
of them I also think you could survive one you could probably even survive two maybe even three at
the same time if you're pushing it but four or five you're like all right I give up I'm dead all
right so I think what we've got then is a domino situation because they are so interlinked that
when one goes down it influences the other so especially if the Cypriots went down that affects
the copper supply for everybody the Hittites go down the Mycenans go down and then I think we've
got this you know kind of like a multiplier effect going on here but I also think that we've got
other things going on as well so for instance what we're really talking about here is the
systems collapse literally the whole system collapses now this is a known situation it's
happened elsewhere as well in fact Colin Renfrew a very famous British archaeologist back in 1979
defined systems collapse he says it's when your central administration collapses it's when your
traditional elite disappear your centralized economy collapses and you get lots of sediment shifts
and population decline and that's exactly what we see here so what we've got is a systems collapse
but we've also got then to take into account the systems collapse doesn't just happen
in one year and that's actually why the title of my book is misleading and I fought the publisher
for the entire time I was writing it because I said 1177 is not the year when it collapses
it takes a century and so he says well what would you rather I said 1200 is very different from
1100 which is totally different from a thousand and he says well that's correct but that's a
terrible title and it won't fit on the book and I said okay so the way I see it is 1177 is
shorthand just as we say that 476 is when the roman empire collapsed which is of course not true
right it took most of the fifth century ad and even then the eastern roman empire keeps going
for another thousand years and still we say Rome collapsed in 476 or at least that's what we
told the kids in sixth grade 1177 for me is the same thing it's a hallmark it's a bench right I
know it didn't happen that year but that's a good way to refer to it so shorthand if you will
and the thing is when you have such a systems collapse there's usually no obvious there's no
smoking gun and in fact on amazon that's one of the major complaints from the people that
about the book they said he didn't give us the answer I said actually I did the answer is there's
no answer we're not sure yet they're like well where's the smoking gun I said we don't have it yet
so in the paperback version I've got a new afterward that came out when it came out about
a year later in which I say something like no smoking gun or something like that but the other
thing though is that when you have a dark age which always follows the systems collapse you will
then have romantic stories about the past right and so think of Homer and the Trojan war you've
got exactly this so I think that's what we've got here as well now in terms of our takeaway what
lessons can we learn is there a lesson for this for us today I think the answer is yes so for
instance are we facing a situation that is similar today is there climate change well we could argue
all night about that right but let's say for argument yes at least some are there famines and
droughts in the world today yes of course there are earthquakes yes rebellions yes I think the only
thing that's missing are sea peoples and in fact I think we've got them too because I think on the
one hand ISIS are the sea peoples busy destroying everything but on the other hand the refugees
that are fleeing Syria could also be the sea people so you've got both sides well I actually think
we've got pretty much the same situation so in the last couple of years the headlines coming out of
the Mediterranean in the Middle East Greece's economies tanked right there should all be
familiar since about 2012 internal rebellions in Libya Egypt and Syria with outsiders and foreign
warriors right the Arab Spring Turkey fears it's going to be income involved Israel's afraid it
will be involved Jordan's crowded with refugees Iran is bellicose and threatening pretty much
as usual Iraq is in turmoil right these are all ripped from the headlines in the last what three
four years right well what if we looked at news from the Middle East in about 1200 BC yeah pretty
much the same so my question now is does knowing this help us well from my point of view I look back
many of you probably look forward so can we use this knowing what happened to them 3200 years ago
and knowing we may have some of the same symptoms what do we do about it or we just say
it's history it never repeats itself I think maybe it does different actors thank you
oh was there any role for piracy because you have a lot of this this communication goes
is seaborn and so there would be a great opportunity we see this now we could add that to your list
we have a we have piracy now in areas that we didn't have it absolutely so is there piracy
the answer is yes and in fact two friends of mine they've been writing paper after paper after
paper about piracy in the late Bronze Age we definitely know it's there later I mean Julius
Caesar actually gets captured by pirates from this region right but yes so Louise Hitchcock
and Aaron Maier have been writing paper after paper and they have all kinds of wonderful titles you
know arg piracy in the right so yes I think I think this is part of it I would though put
that in the category of cutting the international trade routes right as that but yes I think definitely
presumably these these powers had you know their own navies that could provide protection as as they
collapse then their their midlines of communication became extremely vulnerable yes absolutely
absolutely yes so one of the modern problems that someone gets attacked their allies have to help
was that a problem then too they did have mutual defense treaties yes in fact there is a very famous
one called the Shashankamuru Treaty which dates to about the same time period where the Hittites
are allying the from Turkey are allying with the Assyrians from what is now Iraq northern Syria
and they say let no ship of the Akiyahu go to him Akiyahu are the Akiyans the Mycenaeans
and so they've actually set up an embargo but they also say if you are attacked we will come to your
defense if we are attacked you will come to our defense and we have other ones too especially with
Willowsa Troy same sort of thing so yeah they've got mutual defense packs back then yeah did they use
any money coins to trade them any money money coins coins and all that no we are 700 600 years too
early for that coins the first coins we know about are invented in Lydia in Turkey in about 700 BC
so we're a good six or seven hundred years too early but that doesn't mean they don't have the
equivalent there has been a suggestion that those oxide ingots the talents that were in the ship
that that was the equivalent of currency and you could barter with it so we don't have coins
but we do have other things with copper and tin so very valuable what did people have to trade
to get it okay so what are you trading in order to get the copper and tin well it depends what
society you're in but for instance we know the Mycenaeans are trading olive oil and perfume
which in fact they make from the olive oil they're also trading the other metals silver
and gold right Egypt's got a monopoly on gold silver the Mycenaeans there's a huge mine just
outside of Athens so pretty much anything you can think of they're trading including wheat and grain
and barley and grapes and all those things the Ulibur and Shipwreck actually had the remnants
of raw materials such as fruits figs and and all that so yeah so they're definitely going back
and forth it's a nice little economy that's going yeah given that Athens is one of the basic
problems that you see here it seems I did these invaders that burned the entire city including
all the food crops doesn't make a lot of sense it does not make a lot of sense exactly so if the
invaders are coming in and burning everything the ground including the grain yeah what's going on
in fact we have an interesting situation which is almost the opposite in a way at Hotsor when she
pointed out that it might be an internal rebellion the jars were found still full of grain they're
burnt but they're still full of grain so exactly that whoever did it burnt their own grain which
does seem strange on the other hand if you are an invader and you're following a burnt or scorched
earth policy that's exactly what you would do all right so it may be that in those cases it is the
sea peoples but yeah what I find interesting though linking sea peoples and drought the original
hypothesis was that they started moving from Sicily and Sardinia because of a drought in the
western Mediterranean if so they were extremely unlucky because by the time they got to the
eastern Mediterranean there's a drought there so maybe these people just brought the drought
with them I don't know but yes so it is it's odd I will I will give you that yes someone had said
that the Israelites originated in an internal rebellion could you that in other words equating
okay so the Israelites all right so that's probably the Finkelstein's suggestion where
the Israelites are already in Canaan and they are the same as the Canaanites and all that
there's I mean that's a whole another lecture on the Exodus and all that the short answer is
I'm not going to go quite there but I'll go part way there because what I think happens is
you notice everything collapses right about the same time as the Israelites are moving around
according to tradition I think what happens is that the collapse of the Bronze Age powers
creates a power vacuum in this region we know for sure that the Egyptians withdraw
and they had been in control of that area for a good three centuries and when they withdraw
and if the Canaanite cities like Hotshore go down when the Israelites come in I think they took
advantage of an empty land smoking ruins and that they simply claim credit for themselves so
it's what I would call a coattail hypothesis that the Israelites are riding the coattails
of the Sea Peoples and the other natural problems here but it is possible they were already there
and that's in fact what Finkelstein is saying that they're moving from the high lands
down to the low lands but it's because the Egyptians have moved out and there are now
smoking ruins there so I would actually link the two of them so in terms of the Exodus and I
do mention this briefly in the book I simply say that I think if it happened it happens now
and it's because they take advantage otherwise I don't think there's any way the Israelites would
have been able to take on the Canaanites there's no way but this then explains for me how it could
have happened if that makes sense now you're not asking one other question I was waiting for you to
ask there is one stressor or driver that I haven't mentioned that should go hand in hand with drought
and famine and war yeah disease where's the disease thank you I haven't mentioned disease at all right
why not there's no evidence for it we don't have bodies anywhere none of the texts mention it
so there's nothing we do know now the text should mention it if it's happening
we know back um 1350 BC time of almond hooked up the third and my favorite guy Shoupi Luleyuma
I wanted to name my other kid that
he is a king up in Turkey he's a king of the Hittites
and they tell us that he went to war with Egypt and they brought back Egyptian prisoners of war
who were suffering from the plague and the plague then wiped out most of the royal family of the
Hittites and a lot of the population but that happens 150 years earlier there is also evidence
there is a um mummy of a later Ramses Ramses the sixth who is about 1140 1130 BC he had smallpox
but and you can tell that from his mummy but you can't tell if he died from smallpox
and there's no mention of the Egyptian records of anybody else dying for it so I'm waiting I'm sure
that it was there but we don't have any text for it we don't have any bodies so for the moment
the one thing I thought would have really ravaged the world did not there is no evidence for disease
but as we say in archaeology um absence of evidence is not evidence of absence so I think
we will be able to add this but it's going to be another excavation that will find evidence for
this just like David Soren found a cemetery outside of Rome with all kinds of malaria victims
that he says contributed to the fall of Rome so it may be that we'll have something like that but not
yet what was happening in eastern and western Europe at the time is there any evidence of any
contact between like the peoples that were running around in you know France and Spain places like
that is that too remote no no it's not too remote okay so the evidence up in Europe and what's
happening at that there is some contact in fact there was an article maybe a couple months ago
up in Scandinavia that there showed that there were contacts with Mycenae in Greece
which I'm not surprised at you're getting amber from the Baltic coming down here so
yes they're in contact I don't think it's huge I think most of the trading partners are in and
around the Mediterranean but we do have them going up to Europe and there is evidence for a drought
up in Europe a little bit before this so that was the original hypothesis was that people moving
down from Europe moved into Sicily and Sardinia kicking those people out who then moved over to
Greece who kicked those people out and you had a whole domino effect that way so the events in
Europe will affect them to a certain extent but there isn't this globalized connection like we
have with these guys here I would say the contacts are intrepid explorers or somebody
who's dead set on getting amber so I do think the events up in Europe affect them to a certain
extent but not in a calamitous fashion how does the explosion of Thera fit into this time frame
how does the explosion of Thera fit into this um it does not and the reason I say this you're
Santorini Thera is about 70 miles north of Crete it does blow up for sure and it used to be
thought that it ended the Minoans and all this the problem is that radiocarbon dating is now
pushed the explosion back it's now dated to 1628 BC so the 17th century so it probably did have an
impact on the Minoans at that point but it does not end civilization as we know it because
well 1628 down to 1177 that's quite a few centuries there so but that is the number one
number two question that I get on amazon how come you didn't talk about Santorini and my answer is
I do talk about it it's on one page and I say it's not related but still everybody wants it to
be related because it's an easy solution right or not so easy but but people tend to link it to
to the exodus with the you know parting of the Red Sea and this net again problems there too there's
a couple hundred years in between so you'd have Moses raising his hand for like 200 years which
is a little long so right anyway yes um you say writing was lost so I know that like a lot of
languages we don't even know the translation for them um but were there people then who like
still used it despairingly or was it totally just not there those languages right okay so let me
qualify that what had what happens at this point the elite in Egypt and everywhere else you only
have about one percent that can read a right to begin with right so the scribe even the kings
couldn't read a right so when your scribe a class goes away you forget how to write now it does not
take long to pick it right back up but what gets picked up are different things so for instance
into this same power vacuum you get people moving sometimes right away so we haven't even mentioned
them but the Phoenicians move into this power gap at the same time as the Israelites do Phoenicians
are on the coast of what is now Lebanon Syria in fact they're probably the survivors of the Canaanites
because Canaan and Phoenicia they both mean purple so they're probably the survivors
and the Phoenicians have this little thing called the alphabet right and now at Ugarit they had
already been experimenting with the alphabet but when they went down that went away but the Phoenicians
step in right away maybe as early as the 11th century so we've got a gap I would say of about
a hundred years but after that point the Phoenicians come in but still other places like Greece
dark ages keep going till 900 800 but by the time we come out of it the Phoenicians have successfully
exported their alphabet not only to Greece but also to Italy right so we've got the Latin alphabet
that we use to write English today but it's the same sort of thing that we've got for Greek so
there are different periods out of which everybody comes and in fact I'm about to agree
to write a sequel which is called Phoenix from darkness to democracy because out of all this
we eventually get new inventions like iron democracy monotheistic religion so I actually
have said in the past and I would agree with it that and I end the book this way that sometimes
you need a wildfire to burn away the old growth and get things started new and I think that's
what you've got we would not be here today doing the things that we do if these guys hadn't collapsed
so it's because they collapse that we are doing what we do today so I'll stick around and answer
more questions and I think there's some books so if you want but thank you very much
