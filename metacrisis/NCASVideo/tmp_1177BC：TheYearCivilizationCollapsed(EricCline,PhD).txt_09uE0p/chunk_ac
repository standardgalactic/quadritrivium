interesting in the last 60 or 70 years there have been earthquakes upon earthquake upon
earthquake following one upon the other and this is what's known in modern parlance by
seismologists as an earthquake sequence, namely if you've got an earthquake and it doesn't release
all the tension in the fault line you'll have another earthquake very soon thereafter might be
days might be weeks could be months but you'll have another earthquake if that doesn't release
all the pressure you'll then have another one and another one and another one until the fault
line is basically unzipped and all the pressure is gone you will then have about 400 years before
the pressure builds up enough to start the whole process going again so this is a known feature
for modern and some people the archaeo seismologists the ones that study ancient earthquakes
say the same thing happened in antiquity but there they've got a six year name for it they call it
an earthquake storm rather than earthquake sequence and I think we've got one at about this time
period because we can see earthquakes in this region from about 1225 to 1175 there's about a
50 year period of what look like earthquake damage so for example here's Mycenae right capital
of the Mycenaeans in Greece you've got the famous lion gate right here but look off to the side here
underneath the big cyclopean wall right here you've got that kind of a slope there anybody recognize
what that is because the geologists and seismologists looked at it and just started laughing that's
one side of a slip zone that's part of an active fault and they said the Mycenaeans built their
capital city or one of their capital ones right on top of an active fault line who does that who
builds a major city on top of an active fault and then Amos Nor from Stanford said well I'm from San
Francisco yeah yes it has moved there have been numerous earthquakes and yes yes it has right but
it's not just at Mycenae it's elsewhere as well but when I went looking for evidence because Amos
Nor and I work together on this we found evidence of earthquake victims at many sites so for instance
this young woman it's the same skeleton in both pictures this stone right there was embedded in
her skull when she was first excavated she had actually sheltered in a doorway which is supposed
to be the safest place in this case the doorway collapsed and killed her all right so that's at
Mycenae just about 10 kilometers away at Tirans there's another set a woman and a child lying
underneath a fallen wall if you go across to Troy on the northwestern coast of Turkey trust
me that wall is not supposed to look like that right this is I was there about a year ago took
the same picture right there Troy 6 is probably one of the cities of the Trojan War it fits perfectly
it's 1250 BC but it's destroyed by an earthquake same thing back at Ugarit but this is a little
bit earlier this is a wall from about 1365 Ugarit seems to be hit by a number of earthquakes
but again trust me that wall was not supposed to look like that that's what happens after an
earthquake so I think some of the destructions that have been attributed to the Sea Peoples
are actually caused by mother nature all right so you've got some of that going on and by the way
to anticipating any questions you might have the climate change yes it's also mother nature the
Hittites are not driving SUVs back then right so we've got mother nature doing some stuff back
then as far as cutting the international trade routes I think this is what happens I think it
is part of the scenario and we've got evidence for what had gone on before that so for instance
Hatshepsut whom I mentioned she sends an expedition down to Punt she puts it on her mortuary temple
here this would be about 1500 BC give or take she's even got pictures of what they saw down there
and what they brought back this is the queen of Punt down there in the bottom and she even tells us
that her name is Eti ETI so we know that they went down to Punt the problem is we didn't know where
Punt was it could be Yemen it could be Ethiopia it could be any number of places turns out it is
Ethiopia or Eritrea or Ethiopia because of a baboon mummy in the British Museum where they've
analyzed it and said that that's the nice parallel so that's kind of neat they are also in contact
in Egypt with Greece at that time here's a tomb painting from the tomb of Rek Mare these are
Minoans bringing gifts to Egypt same thing in another tomb you got looks like a decapitated
bull's head that's a Minoan vessel so we've got international trade between Crete and the Egyptians
we've also got trade with the Mycenaeans right recognize these the Colossae of Memnon this is
Amonhotep the third's mortuary temple little after 1400 BC he builds this temple it's now
completely gone because the later pharaohs used it as a quarry to make their own buildings right why
go and cut stone when you can just rob a guy who's dead anyway so the entire mortuary temple is gone
but there are still bits and pieces in here including you see the little feet right there
there were a line of about 10 statue bases which once held statues that are about 10 feet tall
Colossae are 60 feet tall these guys were smaller just about 10 feet tall and one of them has a
list of names that's never been seen before in Egypt and never is again at least most of them
the two names on the right here are like head names like titles one says Kaftor and the other says
actually says Keftiou and the other says Tanaya remember I said Kaftor is Crete that was the
Mesopotamian Akkadian name in Egypt it's Keftiou same thing Keftiou is Crete Tanaya is mainland
Greece it's the Mycenaeans so you've got mainland Greece and Crete on one side and then 14 other
names going around the base and these are Amnesos Festos Mycenae Canalsos Amnesos actually is on
there twice Kithra is on there Naphthion's on there these are names and places in Mycenaean Greece
and like I say these have never been seen in Egypt before and they will never be seen again
when they were first identified in about 1965 the British Egyptologist guy named Ken Kitchen he
published an article in which he said I hardly dare suggest but these names look uncomfortably
like Mycenaean and Canalsos well he was quite right that's exactly what they were so I actually
think that when you take a look in Greece at what's been found you've got Amon Hothup the third the
guy who made the statue base list you have his objects at many of the sites that are listed on
that statue base so here are fragments of an Egyptian pheon's plaque with Amon Hothup's name
on it found at Mycenaean in fact there's about 10 of them found at Mycenaean nowhere else are these
found outside of Egypt except for here you've also got a scarab with his name on it found at
Canalsos where the Minoans are on Crete so I think what we've actually got on the statue base
they're actually in geographical order if you look at it it looks like a trip that goes from
Egypt to Crete up to mainland Greece back to Crete and then back to Egypt I actually think
that's why Amon Hothup is on there twice because it's a round trip so you're going from Egypt up to
Crete and they're like okay everybody out coffee bathroom right it's like being on the New Jersey
Turnpike then they go around so they're visiting the Minoans who they've known now then they go
visit the Mycenaeans who are new to them and then they're like okay and last stop is again
Amon Hothup everybody out use the bathroom get a drink and then we're heading back to Egypt
all right so I think that's why so I can't prove it but I think that's what's going on
and one of the reasons why I think this is a a decent explanation we have another text from Ugarit
it's called the Sinoranu text because it's a guy named Sinoranu it's by the way I wanted
to name my child that my wife objected for some reason thought he'd be unique right Sinoranu
Klein are you here oh yeah but no from the present day Amostamru the son of Nick Meppa that's the
king of Ugarit exempt Sinoranu son of Sigino his grain his beer his olive oil to the palace
he shall not deliver his ship is exempt when it arrives from Crete so you've got a merchant
named Sinoranu in Ugarit North Syria sending a ship to Crete coming back with olive oil
grain and beer and when it comes back he doesn't have to pay import tax on it right I think this
may be the world's first corporate exemption in history right but it does mean that we've got these
ships going around and in fact we found one off the coast of Turkey there's a ship that
went down in about 1300 BC in a place called Ula Barun this is National Geographic's reconstruction
of it Carver's story December 1987 if you want to go check it out this is what it looked like
when they were diving down there you've got almost well just about 300 ingots of pure copper from
Cyprus each of them weighing about 60 pounds and actually there's so much copper on board you could
have outfitted an army of 300 people with swords and shields and helmets and everything else
they've also got about 14 of these big blocks of stone each with one hole in them anybody identify
what those are yeah very good stone anchors absolutely as one gets caught just cut the rope
and bring the other one up in the meantime you're using them as ballast and to balance your ship
right so there's about 10 tons of copper on board this wreck here's my friend Nicole she never wore
a jacket even though this is 140 feet below the surface they could only go down twice a day for
20 minutes at a time and the director George Bass who it's a great name isn't it George Bass for
the father of underwater archaeology perfect name he said this was as if you had had two martinis
and then tried to work but working was you know 140 feet down and you could drown so they never
had an accident not a major accident in 20,000 dives over 12 years it's because they had an
X Navy seal in charge so right anyway at 10 tons of copper there's also a ton of tin on board and
remember the 90% copper and 10% tin they could have made a fortune in bronze off of here all the
raw materials up here this is actually my favorite raw material there ingots of raw glass in this case
colored with cobalt so they're blue but they also had purple and rose and brown and down here lower
left terribent resin from the pistachio tree you use it in making perfume you also use it to color
wax uh ivory both elephant and hippopotamus we had always thought all the ivory in the late bronze
was elephant once it turned out these were hippo they went to all the museums and retested turns
out about 90% of the ivory is from hippo they're like that's strange there aren't any hippos in
the regional Levant anymore then somebody went yeah I think I know why right and then some brand
new Cypriot and Canaanite pottery that would have been delivered somewhere so this ship is
it's a microcosm of the international trade of the time there are seven different cultures
represented on board uh in terms of the goods both finished and raw so it's probably going
round and round but it could be a gift from one king to another they could have been on a shopping
expedition I mean we'll never know we will never know but it does show what's going on at that time
and in fact we've got a letter from that period also I will bring to you as a present 200 talents
of copper now what we've got on the ship is 300 talents of copper so it shows that that's what
they're doing back then so again globalized economy and I remind you about the copper and 10
in antiquity so to sum up let me present three points that I think we can all agree on so the first
would you agree that we've got a number of separate civilizations that are flourishing
back then from the 15th to the 13th just after the 12th Mycenaeans and Minoans Hittites Egyptians
Babylonians Assyrians Canaanite Cypriots they're all independent but they interacted with each
other and if I persuaded you of that so far we agree with that no argument okay point number
two it's clear that many cities were destroyed which they were and the late Bronze Age civilizations
and life as they knew it came to an end a little after 1177 we agreed on that everything's destroyed
all right number three there is no proof as to what caused it right we agree with that as well
so what do we do well people are still presenting the old simple explanation in fact just last
November at our annual meetings a very senior archaeologist got up and presented this and I
stood up and I said this is too simple and he says yeah you have a better idea and I said
yeah actually I do so what I think we've got here I think that again as I said at the beginning
if you ask me are there droughts I would say yes are there famines I would say yes earthquakes yes
invaders yes rebellions yes each of these is a stressor each of them is a driver and you react
to each of them in a different way but I think there's not one there's not two I think there's all
of them I also think you could survive one you could probably even survive two maybe even three at
the same time if you're pushing it but four or five you're like all right I give up I'm dead all
right so I think what we've got then is a domino situation because they are so interlinked that
when one goes down it influences the other so especially if the Cypriots went down that affects
the copper supply for everybody the Hittites go down the Mycenans go down and then I think we've
got this you know kind of like a multiplier effect going on here but I also think that we've got
other things going on as well so for instance what we're really talking about here is the
systems collapse literally the whole system collapses now this is a known situation it's
happened elsewhere as well in fact Colin Renfrew a very famous British archaeologist back in 1979
defined systems collapse he says it's when your central administration collapses it's when your
traditional elite disappear your centralized economy collapses and you get lots of sediment shifts
and population decline and that's exactly what we see here so what we've got is a systems collapse
but we've also got then to take into account the systems collapse doesn't just happen
in one year and that's actually why the title of my book is misleading and I fought the publisher
for the entire time I was writing it because I said 1177 is not the year when it collapses
it takes a century and so he says well what would you rather I said 1200 is very different from
1100 which is totally different from a thousand and he says well that's correct but that's a
terrible title and it won't fit on the book and I said okay so the way I see it is 1177 is
shorthand just as we say that 476 is when the roman empire collapsed which is of course not true
right it took most of the fifth century ad and even then the eastern roman empire keeps going
for another thousand years and still we say Rome collapsed in 476 or at least that's what we
told the kids in sixth grade 1177 for me is the same thing it's a hallmark it's a bench right I
know it didn't happen that year but that's a good way to refer to it so shorthand if you will
and the thing is when you have such a systems collapse there's usually no obvious there's no
smoking gun and in fact on amazon that's one of the major complaints from the people that
about the book they said he didn't give us the answer I said actually I did the answer is there's
no answer we're not sure yet they're like well where's the smoking gun I said we don't have it yet
so in the paperback version I've got a new afterward that came out when it came out about
a year later in which I say something like no smoking gun or something like that but the other
thing though is that when you have a dark age which always follows the systems collapse you will
then have romantic stories about the past right and so think of Homer and the Trojan war you've
got exactly this so I think that's what we've got here as well now in terms of our takeaway what
lessons can we learn is there a lesson for this for us today I think the answer is yes so for
instance are we facing a situation that is similar today is there climate change well we could argue
all night about that right but let's say for argument yes at least some are there famines and
droughts in the world today yes of course there are earthquakes yes rebellions yes I think the only
thing that's missing are sea peoples and in fact I think we've got them too because I think on the
one hand ISIS are the sea peoples busy destroying everything but on the other hand the refugees
that are fleeing Syria could also be the sea people so you've got both sides well I actually think
we've got pretty much the same situation so in the last couple of years the headlines coming out of
the Mediterranean in the Middle East Greece's economies tanked right there should all be
familiar since about 2012 internal rebellions in Libya Egypt and Syria with outsiders and foreign
warriors right the Arab Spring Turkey fears it's going to be income involved Israel's afraid it
will be involved Jordan's crowded with refugees Iran is bellicose and threatening pretty much
as usual Iraq is in turmoil right these are all ripped from the headlines in the last what three
four years right well what if we looked at news from the Middle East in about 1200 BC yeah pretty
much the same so my question now is does knowing this help us well from my point of view I look back
many of you probably look forward so can we use this knowing what happened to them 3200 years ago
and knowing we may have some of the same symptoms what do we do about it or we just say
it's history it never repeats itself I think maybe it does different actors thank you
oh was there any role for piracy because you have a lot of this this communication goes
is seaborn and so there would be a great opportunity we see this now we could add that to your list
we have a we have piracy now in areas that we didn't have it absolutely so is there piracy
the answer is yes and in fact two friends of mine they've been writing paper after paper after
paper about piracy in the late Bronze Age we definitely know it's there later I mean Julius
Caesar actually gets captured by pirates from this region right but yes so Louise Hitchcock
and Aaron Maier have been writing paper after paper and they have all kinds of wonderful titles you
know arg piracy in the right so yes I think I think this is part of it I would though put
that in the category of cutting the international trade routes right as that but yes I think definitely
presumably these these powers had you know their own navies that could provide protection as as they
collapse then their their midlines of communication became extremely vulnerable yes absolutely
absolutely yes so one of the modern problems that someone gets attacked their allies have to help
was that a problem then too they did have mutual defense treaties yes in fact there is a very famous
one called the Shashankamuru Treaty which dates to about the same time period where the Hittites
