are allying the from Turkey are allying with the Assyrians from what is now Iraq northern Syria
and they say let no ship of the Akiyahu go to him Akiyahu are the Akiyans the Mycenaeans
and so they've actually set up an embargo but they also say if you are attacked we will come to your
defense if we are attacked you will come to our defense and we have other ones too especially with
Willowsa Troy same sort of thing so yeah they've got mutual defense packs back then yeah did they use
any money coins to trade them any money money coins coins and all that no we are 700 600 years too
early for that coins the first coins we know about are invented in Lydia in Turkey in about 700 BC
so we're a good six or seven hundred years too early but that doesn't mean they don't have the
equivalent there has been a suggestion that those oxide ingots the talents that were in the ship
that that was the equivalent of currency and you could barter with it so we don't have coins
but we do have other things with copper and tin so very valuable what did people have to trade
to get it okay so what are you trading in order to get the copper and tin well it depends what
society you're in but for instance we know the Mycenaeans are trading olive oil and perfume
which in fact they make from the olive oil they're also trading the other metals silver
and gold right Egypt's got a monopoly on gold silver the Mycenaeans there's a huge mine just
outside of Athens so pretty much anything you can think of they're trading including wheat and grain
and barley and grapes and all those things the Ulibur and Shipwreck actually had the remnants
of raw materials such as fruits figs and and all that so yeah so they're definitely going back
and forth it's a nice little economy that's going yeah given that Athens is one of the basic
problems that you see here it seems I did these invaders that burned the entire city including
all the food crops doesn't make a lot of sense it does not make a lot of sense exactly so if the
invaders are coming in and burning everything the ground including the grain yeah what's going on
in fact we have an interesting situation which is almost the opposite in a way at Hotsor when she
pointed out that it might be an internal rebellion the jars were found still full of grain they're
burnt but they're still full of grain so exactly that whoever did it burnt their own grain which
does seem strange on the other hand if you are an invader and you're following a burnt or scorched
earth policy that's exactly what you would do all right so it may be that in those cases it is the
sea peoples but yeah what I find interesting though linking sea peoples and drought the original
hypothesis was that they started moving from Sicily and Sardinia because of a drought in the
western Mediterranean if so they were extremely unlucky because by the time they got to the
eastern Mediterranean there's a drought there so maybe these people just brought the drought
with them I don't know but yes so it is it's odd I will I will give you that yes someone had said
that the Israelites originated in an internal rebellion could you that in other words equating
okay so the Israelites all right so that's probably the Finkelstein's suggestion where
the Israelites are already in Canaan and they are the same as the Canaanites and all that
there's I mean that's a whole another lecture on the Exodus and all that the short answer is
I'm not going to go quite there but I'll go part way there because what I think happens is
you notice everything collapses right about the same time as the Israelites are moving around
according to tradition I think what happens is that the collapse of the Bronze Age powers
creates a power vacuum in this region we know for sure that the Egyptians withdraw
and they had been in control of that area for a good three centuries and when they withdraw
and if the Canaanite cities like Hotshore go down when the Israelites come in I think they took
advantage of an empty land smoking ruins and that they simply claim credit for themselves so
it's what I would call a coattail hypothesis that the Israelites are riding the coattails
of the Sea Peoples and the other natural problems here but it is possible they were already there
and that's in fact what Finkelstein is saying that they're moving from the high lands
down to the low lands but it's because the Egyptians have moved out and there are now
smoking ruins there so I would actually link the two of them so in terms of the Exodus and I
do mention this briefly in the book I simply say that I think if it happened it happens now
and it's because they take advantage otherwise I don't think there's any way the Israelites would
have been able to take on the Canaanites there's no way but this then explains for me how it could
have happened if that makes sense now you're not asking one other question I was waiting for you to
ask there is one stressor or driver that I haven't mentioned that should go hand in hand with drought
and famine and war yeah disease where's the disease thank you I haven't mentioned disease at all right
why not there's no evidence for it we don't have bodies anywhere none of the texts mention it
so there's nothing we do know now the text should mention it if it's happening
we know back um 1350 BC time of almond hooked up the third and my favorite guy Shoupi Luleyuma
I wanted to name my other kid that
he is a king up in Turkey he's a king of the Hittites
and they tell us that he went to war with Egypt and they brought back Egyptian prisoners of war
who were suffering from the plague and the plague then wiped out most of the royal family of the
Hittites and a lot of the population but that happens 150 years earlier there is also evidence
there is a um mummy of a later Ramses Ramses the sixth who is about 1140 1130 BC he had smallpox
but and you can tell that from his mummy but you can't tell if he died from smallpox
and there's no mention of the Egyptian records of anybody else dying for it so I'm waiting I'm sure
that it was there but we don't have any text for it we don't have any bodies so for the moment
the one thing I thought would have really ravaged the world did not there is no evidence for disease
but as we say in archaeology um absence of evidence is not evidence of absence so I think
we will be able to add this but it's going to be another excavation that will find evidence for
this just like David Soren found a cemetery outside of Rome with all kinds of malaria victims
that he says contributed to the fall of Rome so it may be that we'll have something like that but not
yet what was happening in eastern and western Europe at the time is there any evidence of any
contact between like the peoples that were running around in you know France and Spain places like
that is that too remote no no it's not too remote okay so the evidence up in Europe and what's
happening at that there is some contact in fact there was an article maybe a couple months ago
up in Scandinavia that there showed that there were contacts with Mycenae in Greece
which I'm not surprised at you're getting amber from the Baltic coming down here so
yes they're in contact I don't think it's huge I think most of the trading partners are in and
around the Mediterranean but we do have them going up to Europe and there is evidence for a drought
up in Europe a little bit before this so that was the original hypothesis was that people moving
down from Europe moved into Sicily and Sardinia kicking those people out who then moved over to
Greece who kicked those people out and you had a whole domino effect that way so the events in
Europe will affect them to a certain extent but there isn't this globalized connection like we
have with these guys here I would say the contacts are intrepid explorers or somebody
who's dead set on getting amber so I do think the events up in Europe affect them to a certain
extent but not in a calamitous fashion how does the explosion of Thera fit into this time frame
how does the explosion of Thera fit into this um it does not and the reason I say this you're
Santorini Thera is about 70 miles north of Crete it does blow up for sure and it used to be
thought that it ended the Minoans and all this the problem is that radiocarbon dating is now
pushed the explosion back it's now dated to 1628 BC so the 17th century so it probably did have an
impact on the Minoans at that point but it does not end civilization as we know it because
well 1628 down to 1177 that's quite a few centuries there so but that is the number one
number two question that I get on amazon how come you didn't talk about Santorini and my answer is
I do talk about it it's on one page and I say it's not related but still everybody wants it to
be related because it's an easy solution right or not so easy but but people tend to link it to
to the exodus with the you know parting of the Red Sea and this net again problems there too there's
a couple hundred years in between so you'd have Moses raising his hand for like 200 years which
is a little long so right anyway yes um you say writing was lost so I know that like a lot of
languages we don't even know the translation for them um but were there people then who like
still used it despairingly or was it totally just not there those languages right okay so let me
qualify that what had what happens at this point the elite in Egypt and everywhere else you only
have about one percent that can read a right to begin with right so the scribe even the kings
couldn't read a right so when your scribe a class goes away you forget how to write now it does not
take long to pick it right back up but what gets picked up are different things so for instance
into this same power vacuum you get people moving sometimes right away so we haven't even mentioned
them but the Phoenicians move into this power gap at the same time as the Israelites do Phoenicians
are on the coast of what is now Lebanon Syria in fact they're probably the survivors of the Canaanites
because Canaan and Phoenicia they both mean purple so they're probably the survivors
and the Phoenicians have this little thing called the alphabet right and now at Ugarit they had
already been experimenting with the alphabet but when they went down that went away but the Phoenicians
step in right away maybe as early as the 11th century so we've got a gap I would say of about
a hundred years but after that point the Phoenicians come in but still other places like Greece
dark ages keep going till 900 800 but by the time we come out of it the Phoenicians have successfully
exported their alphabet not only to Greece but also to Italy right so we've got the Latin alphabet
that we use to write English today but it's the same sort of thing that we've got for Greek so
there are different periods out of which everybody comes and in fact I'm about to agree
to write a sequel which is called Phoenix from darkness to democracy because out of all this
we eventually get new inventions like iron democracy monotheistic religion so I actually
have said in the past and I would agree with it that and I end the book this way that sometimes
you need a wildfire to burn away the old growth and get things started new and I think that's
what you've got we would not be here today doing the things that we do if these guys hadn't collapsed
so it's because they collapse that we are doing what we do today so I'll stick around and answer
more questions and I think there's some books so if you want but thank you very much
