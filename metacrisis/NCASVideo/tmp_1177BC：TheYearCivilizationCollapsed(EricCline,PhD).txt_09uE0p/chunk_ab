The Sea Peoples are part of it, yes, but they're not the sole reason and in fact I think they
might have been as much the victims as they were the oppressors, that is they are one
of the symptoms of this, but I don't think they're the cause, I think they are a bogeyman
that's been used to scare little kids for the last couple of generations, or at least
if your parents are archeologists it was.
So I was skeptical, shall we say, and I wanted to look around for what really happened, so
what I want to present to you today is my alternate hypothesis for what caused the collapse
and then see what you think of it.
Now I remind you that we've got a globalized society for that time, for that period with
everybody in contact with everybody else and I give you one major example, I said that
this is the late Bronze Age and actually the Bronze Age goes from 3000 to 1000 BC give
or take and we're in that last part of it, you've got the early, middle and late.
The way you make bronze as I put up here is tin and copper, right, 90% copper, 10% tin.
Some of you may know that if you don't have tin you can actually use something else, anybody
know what that is, you can actually use arsenic, I don't recommend it, you won't live long
but you can make arsenic bronze, but here most of the copper is used to make bronze
at that time, the copper is not a problem, it's coming from Cyprus, in fact that's where
the word comes from, Cyprus means copper.
The tin is a little bit more problematic, possible some came from Cornwall though I
rather doubt they got up there more than once in the blue moon, there are some tin mines
in southern Turkey but not enough, the vast majority came from Afghanistan, specifically
the Badakshan region of Afghanistan, now anybody here have lapis lazuli jewelry, anything
like that, same area, right, lapis and tin come from the same area of Afghanistan, so
we have to get it all the way from Afghanistan over to this area and we do know that they
are doing this because we have a text from the site of Mari which is on the Euphrates
river, I'm actually not sure that Mari exists anymore because ISIS took it over and we're
busy looting it so it may be gone by now, but the Mari letters which were found by the
French in the 1920s, one of them says that tin is coming there and being sent on to Ugarit
on the northern coast of Syria and from there is being sent on to Crete, so you can see
that you've got a trade route of hundreds if not thousands of miles, if you cut it at
any point you are indeed in trouble and in fact a colleague of mine in England has said
that for them tin was like oil is for us and that keeping the steady flow of tin is the
same problem that we've got for oil and I think that's a pretty good analogy, but bear
in mind that they're also importing finished goods as well, we've got them swapping raw
materials, not just tin and copper but also gold and silver and other things, but along
with the raw materials are coming the finished goods, they've got a regular trade circuit
going here, so this is one of my favorite, it's another one of these Mari letters, actually
dates from just after 1800 BC, one Kaftorian weapon, now Kaftor is their name for Crete
and the Minoans, so this is a weapon from Crete, the top and the base are covered with
gold, its top is encrusted with lapis lazuli, now this is not the dagger, this is from the
death pits of war, but still I thought it illustrated it nicely a gold dagger with lapis
lazuli and I don't know about you, I want one of these, I'd happily carry it open whatever
but I think my absolute favorite is another letter that says one pair of leather shoes
in the Kaftorian style, so Minoan shoes, and if you've been to Crete you know there's
probably sandals, though they could be boots, which to the palace of Hammurabi, King of
Babylon and yes that is the Hammurabi, right an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, Bakhti
limb carried but which were returned, so these sandals come all the way from Crete to Babylon,
they're given to Hammurabi, he doesn't like them and he returns them, why, I don't know,
too small, two last millennium, at any rate, so for fun at GW I once had my students look
at Hammurabi's law code all 272 or 282 laws and I said find the penalty for returning
shoes and they came back Chris Fallon and they said there is no penalty, I said exactly,
so nothing changes, that's one of the interesting things about it, so we've got this globalized
society, trade, reciprocity, diplomacy, everybody's marrying each other's daughters for gold
and silver and whatnot and then into it you drop a little chaos and suddenly we've got
a big, big problem and one by one these wink out until you're only left with Egypt, everybody
else goes away, no more Mycenaeans, no more Minoans, no more Hittites, no more Cypriots
at least temporarily, only the Egyptians survive because they win but it's a Pyrrhic victory,
they're never as strong again, that was their high point, the New Kingdom period, so
When you say the others went away, they completely died out or their civilization became more
primitive?
Pretty much went away, the 1% is gone and I'll come back to this but they lose the
art of writing, they lose the art of large buildings, you get a dark age, alright, so
Mycenaean civilization is considered to end just after 1200, same with Minoans, same with
Hittites, same with the Syrians, same with Babylonia, you will get successors which will
get there with Neo in front of them, the Neo-Hittites, the Neo-Syrians, the Neo-Babylonians, so it's
not the end of the world as we know it but it's close, okay, so what I would like to
do then is to figure out if it's not the Sea Peoples then what else could have caused this,
so could it have been drought like some have suggested, could it have been famine, could
it have been invaders, could it have been earthquakes and my answer to this is yes, I actually
think it's all of them because you can survive a famine, at least some people can, you can
survive a drought, you can survive invaders, you can survive an earthquake, yes lots of
people will die but your civilization does not end, what if you have more than one of
them then, if you have a multiplier effect, if you have what I would call a perfect storm
and that's what I think happens, so let me quickly run through the evidence for each
of those and then see what you think, so for instance drought, drought's not a new suggestion,
already back in the 1960's Reese Carpenter who was a professor at Bryn Mawr was suggesting
that the Mycenaeans came to an end because of drought but he didn't have hard data, he
didn't have proof for it, it was just a hypothesis, he looked at changes in population, he looked
at population movements and various things and he hypothesized that this is what caused
it but it remained just a hypothesis and it was never proven so people kind of forgot
about it, however in the last five years we now have the data that he was looking for
so we can now bring it back scientifically, there is a guy named Kaniyouski, he works out
of Paris, he's got an international team and he went to the site of Gibala in North Syria
back in 20, actually he was there in about 2010, published the article in 2011 and what
they did was to take samples from dried up lagoons and lakes and look at the pollen that
was in there and what they found was that there is what he called a dry event, a 300-year
long dry event, the pollen showed that there was drier climatic conditions in the Mediterranean
from the 12th century until the 9th century so about 1200 BC to about 900 BC there is
this dry event, what we would call climate change, so this was the first instance, he
then went over to Cyprus, did the same thing, published that in 2013 and again took samples
from Halasolt and Teke which has a dried up lagoon and here again major environmental
changes took place in the period from 1200 to 850, it turned the area into a drier landscape
and the precipitation in groundwater probably became insufficient to maintain sustainable
agriculture, so drought in North Syria, drought in Cyprus and then Lee Drake came along and
published a great article in 2012 in the Journal of Archaeological Science in which he looked
at a number of different studies that other people had done and pulled them all together
including things like there is a drop in the temperature of the surface of the sea in the
Aegean which would lead to less rainfall and he concluded also that there was a drought
that started somewhere after 1250 BC and I actually I liked this article so much I did
some I don't usually do, I wanted to send him an email saying that it was a great article,
I did a search for him, he was somewhere like at Northern Arizona University and I typed
in Lee Drake and into Google and it said the very first thing, it said you are friends
on Facebook, seriously, so I wrote to him, I said Lee I guess we're friends on Facebook,
anyway great article and he wrote right back to me, it says good to hear from you, I haven't
seen you since Megiddo in 2006, so we dug together, so be careful who you're writing
to, you may actually know them, so what was neat though, he was in the Philippines searching
for down World War II aircraft with XRF stuff, so pretty neat stuff, anyway so he
came up with this and then the other scientific survey that is relevant was done by Daphne
Langut, you can see her down here at Israel Finkelstein and Thomas Litt and they went
to the Sea of Galilee and to the Dead Sea and they showed that there was a drought there
as well but shorter, this time it was only from about 1250 to 1100, so as a result of
this now we've got drought, North Syria, Cyprus, Israel and Greece which means that it's pretty
much Mediterranean wide, so I think now we've got the data that Reese Carpenter won and
of course as each of these studies came out the world's media grabbed hold of it, so this
is New York Times pollen study points to drought as corporate in Bronze Age mystery, LA Times,
change may have caused demise of late Bronze Age civilizations, National Geographic got
into it, Archaeology magazine came out with something, New York Post and they threw in
globalization for good matter as well, right so this made headlines all around the world,
so I do think that we've got evidence for drought and then you may remember the NASA
funded study that said that we were going to end in a couple of decades except then it
turned out NASA hadn't funded it but never mind and so at that point I decided I wrote
an op-ed that came out in the Huffington Post, the collapse of civilizations, it's complicated,
right which it is, so we've got drought and drought frequently leads to famine but how
do you find archaeological evidence for that, it can be tough, unless you find mass graves
something like that you don't know if you've got famine, unless you have written textual
evidence which we have, they are writing back then, there's no problem, this is a nice period
and this site of Ugarit where we already mentioned that the tin was coming at one point, there are
entire archives that have been excavated there, you have to be able to read Acadian or Ugaritic
but I presume most of you can so that's not a problem, so here we've got one letter from the
house of Ortenu, Ortenu is one of the merchants that's both working for himself and on behalf of
the government and he says that there is a famine ravaging the city of Imar, now that's in inland
Syria but he was such a good businessman that he had a branch in Imar, so he's based in Ugarit but
he's over in Imar and he says in about 1185 there's famine in our house will all die of hunger,
if you don't quickly arrive here we ourselves will die of hunger, you will not see a living soul,
so famine, drought, yes I think so, but just in case here's a letter from the king of Ugarit to
somebody who's not named but he's probably his peer, here with me plenty has become famine, so
Ugarit itself also is suffering, up in Turkey they are hit as well, two letters from the Hittite
King one says do you not know that there was a famine in the midst of my lands and the other one
says it's a matter of life and death, so I think we're on pretty safe ground to say that there is
famine and that people are dying from it, now what about invaders or even internal rebellion, I think
these both happened as well but it can be hard to tell them apart whether you've got people from
outside or people from inside, so in terms of outsiders again we've got written textual evidence
and this again is from the city of Ugarit, it's just a wealth of information, in fact they've just
published three more volumes in French that I haven't even seen yet and I want to see what's in
those, but here this was found quite a while ago and it reports on ships of the enemy, my father
now the ships of the enemy have come, they've been setting fire to my cities, they've done harm to
the land, doesn't my father know that all of my infantry and territory are stationed in Hati,
so they're up in Turkey, all of my ships are stationed in the land of Luka, that's Lisha,
which is southwestern Turkey, they've not yet arrived back so the land is thus prostrate,
may my father be aware of this, now the seven ships of the enemy which have been coming have
done harm to us, if other ships of the enemy turn up send me a report, now I was taught in
graduate school that this was found in a kiln being about to be baked before they sent it,
which was fairly typical because then you can't change it and that the city had been invaded
again by other ships and it had been destroyed before this could be sent, which is a nice story
right, too good to be true, it turns out upon re-examination that this was not found in a kiln,
it was actually originally in a basket with about 70 other tablets that were up on the
second floor of the palace and they fell during the destruction, toppled over and then the basket
disintegrated so you're left with what looks like a kiln but in fact wasn't anything like it,
so if this is not being baked what's going on, well we're not actually sure when this is from,
it could be from this 1177 or it could be from the earlier one 30 years earlier in 1207, we're
just not sure, so what had been a great piece of evidence goes away but still we can use it for
outside invaders regardless of which invasion it is and then there's a private letter, one of the
last that we know about from Ugarit, when your messenger arrived the army was already humiliated,
the city was sacked, our food and the threshing floors was burnt, the vineyards were also destroyed,
our city is sacked, may you know it, may you know it, so somebody did come and in fact we know that
Ugarit is destroyed, the archaeologists found about six feet of destruction level and bodies in the
streets, arrowheads embedded in the walls, it's definitely war, it's not like mother nature.
Now Kaniyuski in fact looked at this when he was doing the drought at Gibala and he looked at the
destructions and he probably said, ah, sea peoples and he actually published an article that said
the sea peoples were there to which I would respond, look it's definitely destroyed at that time,
yes the sea peoples are around but you cannot say it's sea peoples, there's no little sign there
that says the sea peoples did it, so they might have but they might not have and one of the reasons
that I say this is because of the situation at Hotsor which is in Israel today but it was Canaanite
Hotsor back at that time, that city was also destroyed at about this time between 1250 and 1200,
we know it's destroyed because all the mud bricks in the palace are burnt, cherry red and deep brown
and all of that but it could have been destroyed by anyone of about four different groups,
Egyptians, Canaanites, Israelites, sea peoples or maybe even a fifth possibility in Toronto Rebellion.
Now one of the co-directors, Amnon Ben Tor who's actually going to be coming to this area and
lecturing in November on Hotsor so keep your eye out, I think he'll be at the JCC, might be at
Bassanova if you're familiar with those, he says it's not Egyptians or Canaanites because in the
destruction at Hotsor there are Egyptian statues and Canaanite statues and both of them are defaced,
the arms hacked off, the noses mutilated and he says Egyptians would not do that to Egyptian
statues, Canaanites would not do that to Canaanite statues and then he says it's not the sea peoples
were too far inland at Hotsor which I would disagree with, sea peoples got even further inland but
never mind, so for Ben Tor it leaves only Israelites, specifically Joshua and in the Bible it says that
Joshua burned Hotsor to the ground so for Ben Tor this is evidence of the Israelites and the Exodus
but his co-director Sharon Zuckerman who recently passed away unfortunately she said no it's not
that at all, it's internal rebellion and when Ben Tor said what's your proof she said look at what's
destroyed, the palace is burnt, the temples are burnt but the places where the regular people
are living are not touched, the stores are not touched, she said this is what happens
when the 99% try to overthrow the 1%, that's what you get, so she says it was an internal rebellion
I kind of like that thought process, my point though is if the two co-directors can't decide
who destroyed their site how are we supposed to, right, so yes it could be outsiders but it could
be internal as well but it could also be Mother Nature, it could be earthquakes, so for example
we've got a map of again all the sites that are destroyed after 1200 all of our 1177 everything
that's an X is destroyed but if you put on top of it a map of earthquakes that have happened in
this region just since 1900 you can actually see that most of the sites that are destroyed are in
active seismic zones and in fact there are faults going all over this region including the famous
one going right up the rift valley there with the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee but you've got for
example the north Anatolian fault line going right across Turkey and this has done something
