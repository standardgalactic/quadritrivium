you just construct these algebras
and they are connections on bundles
and this enables you
at least in principle to find a generic solution
of the Einstein vacuum equations
with cosmological constant
when I say find
so you mean
what would be called an Einstein manifold
the Ricci scalar is constant and non-zero
constant and non-zero, that's right
that's right, exactly what people call
an Einstein space
but this is Lorentzian and not positive
definitely
but it's not a construction attempt
that you sort of write this for me down
you construct this algebra
and then you look for sub-algebras and the algebra
and that's not the thing I'm good at doing
but still it needs to be worked out
sounds like you need to collaborate
oh absolutely
but I got distracted by cosmology and other things
stay away from that consciousness stuff
it'll suck all your time
well that is a problem actually
but you see other people are doing that
I'm not really doing that
they get me to give lectures on it
I give the same old lecture which I've given
many many
well I have to say that
if you stick with what you've
done in physics
and keep trying to push that ball forward
I can't imagine a better use of your time
you are invited
anytime you want to come back and return
to this program this has been an extremely
heavy load for our
listener
we don't apologize for that
we have to start doing something different
because people are hungry to know
what does it actually sound like to hear people
talking about where things are
rather than some spoon-fed, prettified
version that's like pre-tuned
as if it were baby food
I don't think they want that anymore
no I quite agree
and I think even if you don't understand
all the things that get some feeling
for some of the things people are trying to do
is really important
as important as the details or perhaps more
part of it is just respecting our listeners
they know that we don't know how to get this to them
in exactly the right way
and so I think we have the best listenership
of any program out there because they've been habituated
to recognize that not every program
and not every sentence is going to make sense
so Roger
thank you for coming
through we'll come back anytime
and would love to continue the conversation about
twisters or anything else you'd like to talk about
I've really enjoyed it thank you very much
