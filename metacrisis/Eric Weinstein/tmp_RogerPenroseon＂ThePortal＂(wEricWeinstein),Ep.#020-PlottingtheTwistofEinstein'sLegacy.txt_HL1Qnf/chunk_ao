because you can find somebody who springs up somewhere else
somebody will hate you for it
but quite honestly what are they going to do
make you pay with your career I don't think it's going to happen
but I think
I think what you say about the
geometry developed in Oxford
was pretty distinctive
but then
the people moved out too
Michael went back to Cambridge
but the Oxford system
I mean I don't have to
make it so peculiar to Oxford
but even if I think about
Nigel Hitchin
or
Mason I guess has been in
that system
yes no they grew up with very
very agile people
no doubt about that
but you're asking me to
a bigger thing then
let me just
one final thing
have you been to the
courtyard
of the Simon Center for Geometry and Physics
at Stony Brook which is
tiled with Penrose tiles
I've not been there I've seen photographs of the tiling
may I recommend
a pilgrimage they have a wall
there as well
the so-called iconic wall
which because Jim Simons
made so much money
he was able to chisel
some of the world's
most important equations and principles
that
you and I probably think of as being
the hallmarks of
being alive
just contact with these things
they're actually in a place that can be visited with a key
and I always think about
in a fantastic world
unlocking that wall and seeing whether it's
in fact a gateway to something else
yeah it's a long time since I've been there
and I haven't been there since the war
over pavings
I recommend it
let me ask you one final question
to close out
we all worry
when we've gotten this far
along
your road to reality if you will
that we're not going to live
to see
the final chapter
or completion that this is a mystery
like none other
but probably in some sense
does have
an explanation and a kind of end
is that something
that occupies you
I mean I find you absolutely
vital and
sharp as a tech
I'm worried about this at age
54
what if I don't get a chance to see the end
is that something that animates
there's a huge amount of chance involved in these things
so it's a ola
I think
to see a real end to all this
is too remote for that
but on the other hand
you see we didn't
really discuss
where Twister theory is stuck
or has stuck for 40 years
and where
I think it's got somewhat unstuck
you think it will be the answer
well I'm not sure how far it'll take us
you see that's another question
but the main problem
I saw it in Twister theory
it did sort of
surprisingly
things which worked surprisingly well
and one of these is to construct solutions
of the Einstein equations
or the Richey-Flat
four-dimensional space times
which were
completely generic
provided they were anti-self-deal
now what that means is you've got a complex
solution of Einstein's vacuum equations
which
are left-handed in some sense
now why do we want complex solutions anyway
you want the real solutions
well you say I thought at one point
well one useful way of thinking about the complex ones
is these are wave functions
because wave functions are naturally complex
so I thought well this is a wave function
but it's a non-linear wave function
so I called it the non-linear graviton
and it seemed to be
a big step forward in understanding how quantum mechanics
and gravity fits in together
but it got stuck
with what I call the googly problem
now you have to
if you're not a member
of the former British Empire you probably
won't know what a googly is
it's a ball
in the game of cricket
in cricket unlike baseball
you like to spin the ball about its axis
the direction
it spins about the direction which is moving
because it bounces, that's the key thing
so it bounces one way or the other
and to make it spin left-handed
has a certain action with your hand
and
there's a clever thing that people do
who are really good at this
who looks as though they're using the same action
but it's very cleverly done
that the ball spins the other way
and you throw occasional one of these in
and it gets the batsman completely bamboozled
and that's called a googly
so using the same action
that spins the ball left-handed
you spin it right-handed
so I use that term because he's very enact
the twist of framework
which naturally gives you the left-handed
graviton, make it do the right-handed one
and I struggled
and struggled and struggled
and had all sorts of wild ideas
for how to do this
and I came up with one which I was very proud of
but it needed a cosmological
constant to be zero
and so I thought there is no cosmological constant
and then I had a discussion
with Jerry Ostreicher
who was a very distinguished
astrophysicist
and I was talking about the observations
that there seemed to be
an exponential
expansion of the universe
which seemed to indicate
the presence of a positive cosmological constant
so I said well you know
surely that's not really there, it's dust or something
and he looked at me and said
that's not the point
there are so many things in cosmology
which work so much better
if you put this cosmological constant in
so I had to retract my view
I threw out my construction
but it took me many years
to see when you
have a cosmological constant you can do something
that didn't work without it
and this enables you to have a construction
which I think
solves this googly problem
the trouble is from my point of view
it translates into algebra rather than geometry
although you can get back to geometry
by thinking of a connection on the bundle
so that is a geometrical thing
these are connections
and then you talk about this algebra
and then instead of patching spaces together
to make a curved manifold you patch the algebras together
then they have to be non-commutative
a point that made clear to me
by Michael Atte at one point
and this is the proposal
