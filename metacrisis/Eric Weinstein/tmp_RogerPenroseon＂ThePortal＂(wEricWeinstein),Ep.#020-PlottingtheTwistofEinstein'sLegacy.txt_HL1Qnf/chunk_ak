are not being born by the people who benefited
from them, but by those who have to clean up after them.
Something to be said for that.
Well, you don't have to say it. I can say it
because I'm not inside of the university.
Now, what I would claim is that
while these people, I think,
did a tremendous disservice for all of us
taking what I consider to be our most accomplished
intellectual community in the history of academics,
theoretical physics,
it is
not the case that these people did
nothing
for 45 plus years,
but what they did do has never been
told properly. So I
claimed to you at dinner the other night.
If you just look at
the role of curvature
in our understanding
of not only general
relativity where it's been for over 100 years,
but now in particle
theory. So we had a first revolution
around the mid-1970s
with what's called the Wu Yang Dictionary
where
a particular geometer who becomes the most
successful hedge fund manager
in human history meets
arguably the most accomplished
theoretical
physicist, if it's not Weinberg, it might be Yang
in terms of
what has been proven as contributions.
They have
an unbelievable
interaction which shows
that the classical theory
underneath particle physics is as
or more geometric than the theory of Einstein
using Stienrod's
fiber bundles
and Eris Mann's connections
or vector potentials or what have you.
Then you have a second revolution
again involving, so
that was the first one that his singer takes
from Stony Brook to Oxford.
You have another one which is
the geometric quantization revolution
with your colleague
Nick Woodhouse writing the Bible there
in which
Heisenberg's uncertainty relations
strangely come out of
curvature rather than
there just being some sort of weird
curve at you looking connection
in the bundle. Well, there's this thing called
the pre-quantum line bundle where
line is against one of these planes
so the terminology is all screwed up.
Nevertheless, the key point
is that what we had previously treated
as the annoyance
of the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle
became the beauty
of a geometric quantum.
So now you had the underlying classical theory
is geometric.
The underlying quantum theory
is now geometric.
And then again with your
English group
particularly Graham Siegel's
is a real hero with Michael Latia
pointing the way.
Sure.
So you guys figure out
that this weird grab bag
that was called quantum field theory
which is this thing above quantum mechanics
that is needed for if you're going to have
particles that change
regimes in which the number of particles
changes like something emits a photon
you need quantum field theory you can't do it
quantum mechanics. So that world
was a grab bag that made
absolutely no effing sense pedagogically
to anybody coming from outside
of the discipline.
And this is coming from the 1980s
on
is that quantum field theory
would have been discovered by
topologists and geometers
even if the physical world had never used
it because it was actually
a naturally occurring augmentation
of what's called boredism theory
which is an enhancement of what you
previously referred to as co-homology.
So these are three separate
revolutions with people
that almost nobody's ever heard of
Louise Alvarez-Gaumay
and
Dan Quillen
who I think is the world's greatest accidental
quantum field theorist
for some reason the physics community
is still telling us stories
about entanglement
and about multiverses
and many worlds
and this actual thing that happened
which is as gorgeous as anything
I've ever seen has been a revolution
plowing through mathematics and physics
is covered up because
they want to tell a story about
quantum gravity which
just doesn't hang together. What the F?
Yeah, well I think
I mean...
First of all, am I wildly off?
No, I don't think you are you see
I mean a lot of these things
I wish I knew more about you see
for example Quillen theory and so on
which
life is too short
but these are...
This comes out of the Atheist singer theory
where he finds
these determinant lines
which are coming out of
non-local spectral information
and
building the basis maybe for
pre-quantum line bundles in which
the functions in that world
become the waves that give us the theory.
I think the trouble here
you see mathematics is full
of all sorts of beautiful
theory and
most of
mathematics as it exists now
in the sense of what's written in journals
and so on has almost no
bearing on the physical world.
Now you see I feel
totally convinced and I think you're
expressing something similar that if you
find the right route through this stuff
you will really
find the key to what we're seeing
in the physical world. Now we've found
many such keys and
general relativity
to the Laurentian
version of Riemannian
Semi-Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian?
Yes, pseudo-Riemannian geometry.
So that's picked up
a beautiful area of mathematics and turned it
into physics and
then in reverse
has
given a lot back to mathematics
and also with quantum... with quantum
theory clearly and quantum
theory but I think there are things they're
hiding there
which are very beautiful mathematics
and which will reveal themselves
as important
in the physics we haven't got to it yet.
What do you make of the fact that we now have
three separate
geometries?
You have Riemannian geometry
as the parent of general relativity.
Yes.
You have Erismannian geometry
which is based on sort of these penrose
coming from fiber bundle theory
which is the parent
of the Maxwell classical
theory but also the
classical theory that would be underneath the
strong force holding protons
together which want to repel and the weak force
which causes beta decay.
Alright.
