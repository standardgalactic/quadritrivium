was, St. John's College in Cambridge
where I was a fellow and I happened to be
opposite him at one point and
I had been working on these
two-spinner ways of looking at general
relativity and so I said to him
I thought you know I thought something he might be interested
in could he have
opportunities to talk me about it so
he reserved a room
and I had a little discussion with him and then I wrote down
this equation which is this wave equation
which
represents the Bianchi identities
and I wrote this thing down
in Dirac. I thought he
would instantly recognize it because it's
basically the same equation
that he had in his paper with all these
different spins and
he asked me
I wrote down the equation and he said where does
that equation come from?
So I said it comes from the Bianchi identities
and he said
what are the Bianchi identities?
Holy cow.
And I thought well he's been writing all these
papers in general relativity and he must
know perfectly what they are
the explanation presumably is
he simply rediscovered them himself
he just didn't know who they were called the Bianchi identities
I don't know
it's a very curious story
and this was in the form that the derivative
of the curvature
in terms of
the natural derivative is equal to zero that's
in vacuum say
and you take the
the vial curvature which is all
that's left of the Riemann curvature
and you write that in spinners
and it's a spinner with four
indices
completely symmetrical
and then when you write the derivative
it's the derivative acting on those four things
and one contraction the derivative's got two indices
and you contract one of those
and that's the equation that's vanishes
that's the equation same as the Maxwell equation
same as neutrino if you had one index
and no mass
and
it's the way I think about these things
and the conformal invariance is very crucial
to all sorts of ideas that
I wouldn't have thought of otherwise
and
it was clearly the sort of thing
Durak would have played with himself because his equation
all the higher spin equations
although and curiously in his paper
he did the massless case a different way
which I never quite understood why
but anyway
there are clearly things that he understood
completely
and somehow
maybe never connected I don't know what it was
did you read his
1963 article in Scientific American
where he makes a very interesting
case against
naive
application of the scientific method
no I don't that's Durak
absolutely
I should have seen that
he makes the point in the case of Schrodinger
and he says
Schrodinger would not have been led into
error if he had not been pressed for agreement
with experiment
because Schrodinger then
after publishing there was a period of time
where it wasn't understood that spin somehow
entered the picture
and complicated the theoretical prediction
with its experimental verification
but I think secretly
he was actually talking about himself
where he had introduced
the Durak equation
there had to be positively and negatively charged particles
and at that time the electron
and the proton were known
but the positron and the antiproton
were not
and so he linked those two and Heisenberg
immediately dinged him and said
wouldn't those be of the same mass
and you're obviously making an error
and he didn't stick to his guns or have the courage of his convictions
to predict the new particle
and I think that that 1963
paper from Scientific American
is Durak trying to give us a gift
from Mount Olympus to say
stop with the
incessant
on the naive scientific method
give yourself more room to imagine
more room to play
more room to be wrong
I think that's a crucial thing
that was the thing about Durak
he just didn't want to be wrong
he was very worried
about saying things that were wrong
and so often he would say nothing
rather than anything
so this is a big thing with him
and I think he was disturbed by
yeah you're right
he picked it instantly
I think he needed more freedom
and he didn't have it
and he tried to give that freedom
in a way being too timid yes
what
let me ask you a harder question
right
because we haven't asked you any hard questions to begin with
you're going to be
in your 90s soon
hope to make it yes
if you were to point
to younger people
there seems to be a failure
to pass torches that I've noticed
and
you don't seem to be the sort of person
I would imagine to have that problem
who would you be pointing to
a human being
individuals
you don't have to push anyone down
but who would you build
up
who's young and vital
you might say look
if anyone's got the scent
what would you look at
I think I'm not going to take you up on that one
I'll decline to push further
yes it's just
it's not so obvious
I mean I've certainly had people
clearly good
in
inspirational ways and think of things I've never thought of
but it's a bit hard
I don't know enough people I think
it's probably somebody I don't know
do you
worry that the glory
of the Oxford
school
of geometry and physics
may not continue
I do worry a bit about that
there was an unbelievable
nucleus of people
you're absolutely right it's very remarkable
and I worry that the UK doesn't value itself
enough I think that you guys are so idiosyncratic
and so
weird
badly behave I don't know what to call it
but the UK has punched
the way above its weight
by tolerating
and encouraging personalities idiosyncrasies
I think
there is a point there
I wouldn't know
how to generalize across countries
because maybe
but I think you were right to some degree
there is
tolerance of eccentricity
which is specifically
a kind of
tolerance which is specifically English
British
I don't know
I'm nervous about saying things like that
