And then you've got this other geometric theory
which is the geometric quantum
and
they're not the same geometry.
So for example, the geometry
that Jim Simons
and
C. N. Yang find
has this property called gauge symmetry.
You have
the opportunity for gauge symmetry
in the Einstein theory
but
because Einstein
takes curvature
and uses something called
linear algebra
to project all of the curvature information
into a smaller subset killing off
the soil curvature.
If you gauge,
symmetrize and then project
it's not the same as projecting
and then gauge symmetrizing.
So the opportunity to use gauge theory
is lost
by the specific genius of Einstein.
Well, you see, there's a good example
because he did this amazing thing
by producing general relativity
but then in his later years
he tried to develop the theory
in these unified field theories
and the particle point of view was not really
a very
was not likely to give much
new insights.
But he was right to think you should find
a unified scheme and so on
and bring the...
One trouble is he didn't really
he considered electromagnetism
but the particle
physics didn't play much of a role
in what he was doing.
Well, he died before quarks were understood.
Well, that's true.
I think the thing is there's
huge
beautiful things in mathematics and
we like to think
and I like to think that they do have a role
in a fundamental role
roles that we've not yet discovered
in operating
where the way the world works
is dependent on
very deep mathematics.
The trouble is that there's so many wrong
steps in the sense that
many beautiful things in mathematics
which are guided in certain directions
which from the point of view of mathematics
are great
and they can be generalizing ideas
and
revealing all sorts of previously unknown
beauties
but the proportion of these
which we find has relevance to physics
is very small at the moment.
I think that in some ways
maybe the most powerful, the most
sure.
I mean, complex numbers
and the analysis
of complex numbers is one example
where one does seem to see
a role
in operating the way the world works
and I'm sure that we will find other things.
It's just there are so many temptations
in directions which are not particularly
to do with physics. I understand that
but what I don't understand and what I'm absolutely
unsympathetic with
is that we
have a lot of people who once
upon a time had a lot of different ideas.
Now most of the ideas
at the moment, if we're brutally honest
we are so constrained
by this point in our story
in theoretical physics that almost every
new idea is
dead on arrival unless you specifically
keep it from predicting things
that we don't see.
Oh yeah.
What I see is that you've got
different, and this is a sociological
and economic critique
is that you have a class
of naughty boys
who are very badly behaved, who get
to make all sorts of
claims
who talk to the press incessantly over
decades about all the wonderful things
they're going to do which they don't do
and then you have got another group of people
whose feet are held to the fire where
the instant they start to consider
something that might for example violate
a no-go theorem
they're roundly humiliated.
Now what I see you as having
done is to carve out a very unusual
niche.
Twister theory is at a minimum
an incredibly
valuable tool
for generating solutions
on one space from solutions
on another let's say.
However
it's also somewhat
tolerated within the system. It's a
minority point of view, it's a minority
community
but it is allowed to play
a parallel game to the string world
where the string theorists
have lived for years in my estimation
on externalities.
There are lots of positive
externalities of having, and I do think
that's the smartest community out there
I do think that in general
they're smarter than the relativists, they're
even smarter than most of the geometers
they're insufferable.
Yeah, very clever people, very
insufferable.
And the problem
with that community is that
it's actually
accomplished a great deal
that isn't of a stringy nature.
That's true.
And I do think that what they've
done is instead of
quantizing geometry, which is what quantum
gravity was supposed to be, it backfired
and they had the geometry
geometrize the quantum.
And that's the main legacy
of these people.
They
took off
for Paris
and landed in Tokyo, which is very impressive
as a feat, but it wasn't what they were setting out to do.
No, I think basically I agree with that.
And certainly string theorists
had a big influence in various
areas of mathematics.
But the influence directly in physics
is being pretty minimal, I think.
What do you think about the legacy of something
like supersymmetry?
That's an interesting question.
Isn't it? Yes.
Well, it's very interesting partly
from a personal point of view, because when I first heard
about it, and a lot of it was
on conformal supersymmetry.
Right. And I could see there was a lot
of connection with Twister theory.
The only thing I didn't like was you were
led to these algebras which
didn't commute and
they were all
the square of something
was zero or something, whatever.
I mean, there weren't the kind of algeba
that you needed in Twister theory. You needed
complex analysis. But anyway,
I visited
Zumino at one point
and I was most intrigued because I could
This is half of the duo that came up
with the sort of original
deep supersymmetric model.
Absolutely, yes.
And so I thought there's enough connections here.
I'd like to understand it better.
And, yeah, I think I understood a bit
more. But one thing I remember
particularly, this is a little bit of a side point,
