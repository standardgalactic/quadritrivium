but I was talking to him about two
component spinners and I realized
he was somebody who understood
it perfectly well.
And he told me this story. He said he
once written a paper
in which he used two component
spinners and it worked out very well.
A few
months later, Abdus Salam
did the same thing but using
four component spinners.
And he said everybody referred to Abdus Salam's
paper and nobody referred to his paper.
And he said, well, from then on
he vowed never to write
a paper using the two-spinner formalism
which I thought was pretty ironic.
Particularly since
Dirac himself.
Intriguing.
There were a lot of people in the early days
of looking at generalizing the Dirac equation
for higher spins and so on.
And there were, you know,
Duff and Kamar and
all the ones I forget what they were all called.
Different names for all the different spins.
And they were all in Corson's book, I remember.
And Dirac
wrote this, had written this, I think earlier
I can't remember the history of Which Is Which
but I think earlier this paper where he did
a whole lot using two spinners.
I mean Dirac using two spinners
where you see clearly he knew about them
as far as I was concerned because he'd lectured on them.
But this was much earlier than that.
He had this paper in the Royal Society
describing all the different spins with two spinners.
Much more
much clearer
much more general
systematic.
And again nobody seemed to refer to Dirac's paper
which is quite curious
because he, I mean there's a huge irony there
because he wrote his initial paper
using these four spinners
and didn't realize until maybe pointed out by
Van de Verlander, I have no idea where he got it from
he realized that you could write all this
in two spinners.
And in some ways it was simpler
and used this to generalize to all the spins.
But for some curious reason
nobody or very few people
seemed to refer to Dirac's paper.
You know about this famous
situation where Feynman found
effectively
the path integral formalism
in some paper that Dirac had published
in the Soviet Union.
That's right.
And Feynman
was trembling I think
and asked Dirac, do you realize
when you said that these two things were analogous
that they're in fact proportional
and Dirac said, are they?
You had to be careful with Dirac
because I had a
when I'd first written things
in two spinners and I'd written general relativity
with just two spinners and I found
certain things came out
very beautifully and this thing
that everybody was worrying about calling
at that time called
spinners and tensor.
And you could, it's dropped out of use
two spinners and the
principal null directions and all sorts of things.
And the thing is you have this equation
which is the Bianchi
identities written in two spinners.
And you can see it's just the same equation
that you write for master's fields
Maxwell's equations are the same
neutrino if it had no mass just the same.
They're just the same you have it
the higher the spin the more indices.
But it's the same equation.
It's conformally invariant.
Part of the problem that you're going to get into
with all these things is I would
venture to argue
that even the lowly Bianchi identity
which is at the heart of how Einstein
figured out how to do his equations
to make sure that
effectively his vectors
pointed perpendicular to the orbits
of the symmetries that he was considering
that
we don't really even understand
the things that are given to us for
free fully.
There's an old paper of Jerry Kasdan
I believe in which he actually
rededuces the Bianchi identity
for much more fundamental principles
and the same thing is true with
the sudden appearance of a
version of the calculus due to
Levy Chavita
for merely choosing
rulers and protractors.
I really
worry that we never actually grounded
these fields properly.
I think it's Chekhov who said
that if a gun
is placed above the mantle place
in the first act
it must be fired by scene four.
Well
for example we have this thing called
the torsion tensor
that everybody's introduced to on the first day
of Ramonian geometry and then
they properly are encouraged to forget about
thereafter. Never
really seems to show up in any meaningful
way anywhere. Well it's always a puzzle
I know. And I've never quite made
up my mind about it. Let's not go
into that story though. Yes
I don't use it
though I once wrote a paper.
To ask you just in terms of the path forward
it strikes me
that what we have learned
about our physical world
and what comes up in this book
is of a very
frightening nature
Einstein's equations when you really
understand them through Hilbert's
insight come from
the simplest possible thing
we could minimize.
Oh yes. Same thing
for Maxwell's equations
they spread from the electromagnetism
to the weak force and to the strong force
because it was the simplest
possible thing that could
be optimized. I think he had the Lagrangian.
The Lagrangian. I'm trying to avoid saying those
words. Yes I know. And then
Dirac's
Yes. Third equation
to complete this triptych
is
the equation for matter
which generates all of something called
k-theory
which is absolutely fundamental.
So I could make an excellent argument
that the three
major equations to be supplemented by one
for the Higgs field now that we found it
are
the simplest and
best possible equations of
their type not that we've found
so far but provably so.
Yes. I think
the trouble with simplicity
arguments which I agree with
is that it's simple in one context
and what's simple in another context
it may be. But nature has shown
such I mean the thing that I
can't get over
is that her taste in mathematics
you know I've analogized
this to rating a jewelry store
with
millions of pieces and
in under half a minute finding
all the best stuff.
Yes.
I wanted to finish a story though you see
which I didn't quite finish it relates to something
you were saying earlier which I
at one point
you see Dirac was at the same college as I
