their future and their ability to have families
and make a living and that's absolutely essential to me.
And I look forward to finding out whether this theory
has merit to it or is without merit,
but I guarantee that if I'm going to go down with the ship,
I'm also not going to be knocked off the ship
as I was many years ago, completely unfairly.
And I won't dwell on it,
but the amount of power you professors have
is absolutely almost without parallel
because nobody really understands enough
to adjudicate disputes that happen in academics.
I'm going to insist that we fund you better
and that you are nicer to the people
who depend upon you in this beautiful chain that we call
science, scientific method,
and most particularly American science,
which I think is still the envy of the world.
So you've been through the portal.
I know it was a long slog.
I hope you found it interesting and enjoyable
and we'll see you again soon.
Be well everybody, stay safe.
