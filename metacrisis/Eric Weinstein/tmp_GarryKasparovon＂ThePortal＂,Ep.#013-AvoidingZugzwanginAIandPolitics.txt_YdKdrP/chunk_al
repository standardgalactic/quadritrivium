there's no adult
that's ready to go when things get bad
they recognize that
the new social media
could offer them enormous opportunities
to spread this fake news
because there's one way to tell the truth
many ways to lie
typical story was
with MH17
the Malaysian boy
that was shot by Russian missile
and it's
they didn't care
to provide
one narrative
that could refute
the widespread conviction
what they did
they spread all sorts of news
and one day on Russian television
on two different channels
they had two competing stories
with experts, with diagrams
again, who cares
if it's a ten different lies
it's a needle in a haystack
and they always give you a haystack
in 2015
I said to Facebook
that your business model
is the honeypot for Russian bear
because it was so obvious
it was an ideal opportunity
so this is how to use it
choose to affect people's mind
with information that could be most
sensitive
this is a very strange thing
I know these guys in Silicon Valley
they're very smart in a very limited way
and they are so childlike
but they didn't understand
that Putin already had a machine
before he attacked America
with this fake news industry
so he already had 10 years
Russia, then Russian speaking minorities
in neighboring countries
then Europe
so attacking America was just a matter of time
and I don't think Putin would expect it
to be so successful because the way
they propaganda handled it
I think they expected Trump to lose elections narrowly
that was the expectation
and that's why Trump already repeated
the Russian narrative rigged elections
how many times Trump said rigged elections
this is the thing that you did
which was very interesting
you said all you need to know
to impeach Trump is one thing
which is how he handled Ukraine
now whether I agree with you or I don't agree with you
your point was look
it's very important not to get caught up
let's keep it super simple
so you can just stay on one point
is that fair representation of your point?
exactly
I think he had other
impeachable offenses
but if you want to win this battle
because right now
the moment you accuse
Trump of numerous crimes
that's I believe he committed
it will be very easy
for Trump's defenders
or Trump's defenders
to dilute
that has to do
that has to do with the corruption
in the democratic side
because you can see
that the New York Times and the Washington Post
are not behaving as honest actors
and it's very clear at the moment that they're not
you have this different problem
which is
I spent almost all my time criticizing
the left not the right
not because I think the right is okay
absolutely isn't
but because if the left continues to pursue
these petty
transparent
ridiculous
many propaganda operations
we've undercut our own credibility
in any place that can actually call this out
what I hate most is hypocrisy
and as there's now
in the next democratic debates
I want to hear one question
to every democratic hopeful on stage
with a simple yes or no
Will you authorize
a sale of little weapons to Ukraine
yes or no
because Trump is on trial
for that will you or not
I'm afraid most of them will say no
and that shows a hypocrisy
that says at the end of the day
Trump's foreign policy
just don't kill me for that
not so different from Obama's
Trump the motivation is different
but Obama retreated because of his beliefs
it's like an ideological retreat
Trump doing these things for profit
but unfortunately
the outcome
you don't believe that Trump is under direct control of Putin
or does it matter
I said for profit
no Trump is a Russian asset
I said it many times
whether he understands it or not it's another story
Trump is a Russian asset
I don't even have to know all the details
your point is that the incentive structures are sufficient
I grew up in the Soviet Union
and I just repeated
again
I met enough KGB colonels
and I know how these people look at you
so the way Putin looks at Trump
is the way KGB handler looks at his asset
he looks at Merkel
at Macron with a contempt
it's a contempt
because he believes he can buy anyone on this planet
unfortunately
they failed to prove him wrong
but the way he looks at Trump
the way he acts
it's this rice smile
Trump is an asset
he believes that Trump for some reasons will do whatever he wants
and by the way
when people say
how can you say that
if you understand that when the Democratic Party asserts
that
when somebody inside
of the traditional left of center
media or political apparatus
starts to assert that Donald Trump
is under the direct control
as opposed to the incentive control
at the end of the day
Trump is
you're not understanding my point
what I'm trying to say is
there's a problem right now
with
we can't form a sense making
we can't form a story
that enough of us can participate in
to start actually dealing with our real problems
we're just in free fall
and whether or not I sign on to everything that you say
about Trump or not
I know that if you and I have enough time
we can at least figure out what we agree on
what the theories are
we have enough common denominator
so that's as clear from our conversation
we may disagree on many things
but at the end of the day we know where we are
where we stand so our disagreements
would be more of a tactical not a strategic character
yes so
what I'm concerned about is that right now
we're a sitting duck because we're not actually
there are no adults that I can find
anywhere on the stage
because again it's the
America has to reinvent itself
America has to reconsider
what is America's role
and again it says you go back to the democratic debates
they're talking about things that
they might be very important again
I understand you should talk about healthcare
you should talk about other issues that are important
for America long term
