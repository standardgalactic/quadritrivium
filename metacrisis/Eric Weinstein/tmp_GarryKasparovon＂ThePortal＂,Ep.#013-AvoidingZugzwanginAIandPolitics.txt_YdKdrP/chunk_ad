It could be a mixture of that.
So, but again.
You, for example, described
the current number one,
Magnus Carlsen is a mixture
of Karpov and Fisher.
Yes.
And Fisher was the obvious
sort of virtuoso at the level
of masterpiece.
But you pointed out that Karpov
was a master of maximum efficiency
of the power of an individual piece
to do the most with the least.
Yes, absolutely.
And Magnus is this lethal combination
of two, because Fisher,
I think, just,
he was very rough,
but it's, I mean, sheer energy.
He could play until the last pawn,
basically squeezing,
you know, water out of stone.
Now, Karpov was good in just
in getting the maximum effect
out of the minimum, you know,
resources he had available.
But he was not as consistent
as Fisher, not so pushy.
He, you know, it was more relaxed.
So Magnus brings them together.
And that's, you know, he has
Karpov's ability to maximize
the effect of his pieces.
But also he will play to the very last
move, as Fisher did.
Right.
And, OK.
So I think what you're telling me
is that we are not yet able
to figure out how to encode
the concept of brilliancy,
so that we may lose to these machines,
but that the poetry to be
extracted from chess
at one level belongs to this
positional brute force aspect,
and another belongs to something
that's ineffable that we can't quite touch.
Look, yes, it's the...
And I took your point
about the sacrifices that that's a sort of an obvious
version of a risk taking.
But it's interesting thing.
It's the latest chess
computer prodigy,
AlphaZero.
That's the program
run by Demis Khasabis
and his team.
It's the DeepMind team that is working
for Google.
They succeeded in
beating the best goal players.
Then they just, they came up
with this concept of AlphaZero,
which is starting from scratch.
So the machine knows only the rules,
whether it's God, whether it's chess,
whether it's a starcraft, any game.
And then it plays against itself.
It learns from its own experience
no human contamination.
Which is very funny, because one definition
of genius is the fire that lights itself.
Yeah, but it's...
Yes, and it played
against Stockfish,
against one of the strongest chess engines
and it beat it convincingly a number of times.
But then Stockfish got better.
Yeah, but it still...
AlphaZero still dominates the game.
Now, when we look at these games,
that's the first time when I thought,
oh wow, I can learn something from these machines.
AlphaZero
played chess more aggressively.
Contrary to our expectations,
that stronger machines will play
dollar games more, you know,
just it's the slow more games,
because every
sacrifice can be refuted.
So that's why machines, they don't take too much risk.
But AlphaZero,
contrary to our beliefs, you know,
played very aggressive chess sacrificing material
and beating
Stockfish,
machine, not humans, it's by just, you know,
always being
one or two moves ahead
anticipating what's coming next.
Now,
I use words sacrifice.
Yeah.
For machine, for AlphaZero,
it wasn't a sacrifice.
AlphaZero, thanks to its
massive experience through
these 60 million games,
60 million games to play against itself.
So it generated
a bank of data,
which provided
its, you know, better understanding of patterns.
So when AlphaZero sacrifice
quote-unquote,
we saw it as a sacrifice.
For AlphaZero, it was
the transformation of a material
pawns
or pieces into
other factors that were more dominant.
Position or momentum.
So, and it's amazing
that it's AlphaZero that
had, you know, just looked at the fewer positions.
It's about 1% of what,
you know, when you look at the number of positions
analyzed versus Stockfish,
it was far more
prescient in understanding what's coming next.
Again, playing without the material.
Stockfish, you know, it took, you know,
one or two moves to actually understand what's coming.
Because it looked, and again,
it's not that it's the combination was winning.
It's when AlphaZero made sacrifices.
It was not a forced win because
Stockfish would have seen it as well.
It was, you know, it was, again,
deeper understanding of the game based on
it's a pattern
that it was
able to design out of these
60 million games.
Во-первых,
imagine me telling you what a brilliancy is.
It's ridiculous.
But one thing
I might define it as
is anything
where there would be a body of
conventional wisdom and then there's a move that is
deeply weird relative
to that expectation.
So, for example, a move that doesn't seem to develop
anything, it's like almost a
throwaway move could also be a brilliancy.
If it turned out that that unlocked
something nobody could see.
But, yes, anything that surprises people
could be a brilliancy.
So, maybe one of the most
brilliant moves based on your definition.
Sure.
I ever made was game 24.
I played it until the Karpov.
It was a unique moment when you just, you know,
I had to survive this game
and Karpov had to win the game to
retain his title.
And it was a last game of the match.
And Karpov had a very, you know,
potentially, very strong attack.
And I found a move that was totally illogical.
By the way, ever since this game
this idea became
part of the defensive
concept for Black.
But at that time, you know, it was just
it looked so ugly, because
you don't put these rooks, you know, just
in a position
where it has no other moves
surrounded by your own pieces.
But it was not about, you know, it's not about
attacking. Basically, it was a very good
prophylactic moves, because it
prevented big threats from
White, and it had to force
Karpov to start looking for other plans.
So, you know, it's, and I was
very happy when I just, I remember, I made this move
because I just didn't understand how else
to defend. It just was so much against,
you know, what I learned, but then it made a move
and I remember when I just, you know, it's this is
