this is the horrible truth which is that
in a weird way
Putin appears to be
relatively in my way of thinking
one of the most skilled players left
on the chess board
here I have to disagree
I have to defend the integrity of my game
so Putin is not a chess player
oh sorry sorry
he's an opportunist
no it's the
Putin doesn't create these opportunities
he uses them so he grabs them
okay let me say it differently
Putin's strengths
is a weakness of the free world
yes but KGB had
a tremendous amount of know-how
it was resident within that
yeah but know-how is fine but KGB
has enormous amount of cash now
Vladimir Putin controls more money
than any other individual in the history
richest human
when people say
oh how rich is Putin
Putin is mega rich
but it's not
the same kind of wealth
that Bill Gates
or Karl Slim or Bezos
or whoever because it all depends
on him staying in power
but when you look at the amount of money
Vladimir Putin can move
you probably talking about something
like one trillion dollars
one trillion dollars
you add Russian
you add Russian
Russian hard currency reserves
the fortunes
of some of the top Russian oligarchs
connected to Putin
he's skilled, he's ruthless
he's a single decision maker
and he has this level of control over resource
there's no equal to that
unless it's the Chinese
No, no, let's say he has more power
probably than Xi Jinping
relatively to the country
because Xi Jinping's resources
are just incompatible with Putin
China is much stronger
I think Xi Jinping
and Chinese communists are very happy
to see Putin creating these problems
because it helps them
to shift their attention
China is a strategic threat
if you're using chess language
Putin is more of a tactical threat
but right now
this is a real threat
because if your king is on the threat of being mated
you can't think about long term
consequence of the endgame
Alright, so let's hit another chess term
and then I'll pull the ripcord
if it doesn't work
there's a concept which not everyone knows
called zhuzhuang
where you are in a situation
where you prefer not to have to move
because anything you do
but you have to move
Why do we keep acting as if we're in zhuzhuang
Let me go back to what I said
a few moments ago
Putin's strength is our weakness
Putin is good at looking at opportunities
and then he strikes
he doesn't create them
but the moment he sees weakness
it's animal instinct, he goes for kill
so why Vladimir Putin is in Syria
because America walked away
because America created a vacuum there
so when you look at the global map
because the free world blinked
didn't want to interfere
and that's what we learned
I hope, actually I was wrong
had to learn from the man in service
if we see rising dictatorship
and dictatorship
that is
challenging
the very foundation of our world
and we know we have a choice
of confronting it early
or postponing the decision trying to appease the dictator
every day
every week, every month
every year of a delay
pushing the price up
this is what's very scary to me
about Tulsi Gabbard's candidacy
which is that she's pushing this concept
of regime change wars
and she's trying
after you
this is the moment you mentioned the name
so I almost jumped on my chair
I don't understand
the democrats will not allow
any climate change denier on stage
rightly so
how do they allow a genocide denier
on stage
she acts like
I don't know about the details
of your relations with Assad or Putin
but she's supporting the most brutal dictators
on the planet
what do you think she's doing?
I don't know what she's doing
and I'm not here in another business of analyzing
whether she's in a peril or not
I don't care
what is she saying
she's percentage here and there
she's on the stage
and she's not confronted
she's defending Bashar al-Assad
one of the worst
dictator who used chemical weapons
she's denying it
I didn't hear any democrat taking her
so I was like what the hell are you doing here
and again that's what Putin is
but Gary, what's going on in some sense
is just as you were saying
in 1991-92
it's the economy stupid
we were going to abandon
all of our opportunities
obligations, what have you
we're now not capable
of formulating an America
that makes sense as a continuation
of our previous stuff
it's America from 1946
to 1991
was a thing
it had certainly no policy that it followed
you had Harry Truman set up certain
rules and institutions
and then you had republicans, democrats
republicans following the plan
and it led to a victory in the Cold War
because the strength of democracy
it's a strategy
again using chess terms
because you can rely on continuity
you can change administrations
but you still have the plan
there could be some deviations
there could be just one way or another
somebody could be more aggressive
more defensive
but at the end of the day
we were trying to become captains of the same team
but going back to 1991-92
American foreign policy
became more like a pendulum
shifting from one side
to another based on who is
in the Oval Office
there's no Clinton, Bush, Obama
Trump
and the rest of the world
is watching America
and it's paralyzed in fear
you're looking at a car that's swerving from lane to lane
but people used to know
that America is there
Eisenhower
Kennedy
Nixon
Reagan, Carter, Bush
America was there
and all of a sudden
you can no longer rely on America
you have massive
vacuum holes
and there's no vacuum
You know that no millennials have any
