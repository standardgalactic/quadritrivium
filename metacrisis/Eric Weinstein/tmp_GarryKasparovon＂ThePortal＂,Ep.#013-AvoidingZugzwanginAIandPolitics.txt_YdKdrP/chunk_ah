just to succumb
to Trump's
it's not even evil genius
it's just intellectual
it's always insulting to hear what he said
but the man
it's so
not as unqualified
but it's just if you ask
people to describe a potential threat
to his democracy
20 years ago
what could be the image of this villain
that would be threatening
the very foundation of America Republic
you could come up with somebody very intelligent
very slick
you have somebody like Bill Clinton
so that's his type, very intelligent
well-spoken
charming
just so you know
I did write, I think it was in 2013
an essay warning about what I thought was going to come up
based on
my understanding of professional wrestling
and professional wrestling is in some sense
something that mirrors some of the techniques
that may have been developed in Russia
because the propensity
to suspend disbelief
is not well understood
by many people who have a rational
enlightenment-oriented bent
but it's easy
I still want to go back to 1991-92
because it was the end of the Cold War
it was a moment of the greatest triumph of the free world
Soviet Empire collapsed
Soviet Union ceased to exist
and relatively peacefully
not perfectly
but amazingly peacefully
there were few wars
in the pyramid
Soviet Union
Yes, there was a very bloody war in former Yugoslavia
but still, you know, the cost
the human cost
for collapse of the evil empire
was insignificant
compared to what people expected
would be the outcome
and
in 1992
one of the most popular books
best-selling book was The End of History
by Francis Fukuyama
and I have to say I shared the same expectations
but the triumphal
continuation
of the history
of the free world
and liberal democracy
and the rest would be just us doing some great things
but never
to worry again about
threat to the free world
coming from dictators
and other, you know
that's what we expected in 1991-92
it's not what I expected
but no, no, no, no
I was terrified by the fact
that this is what was claimed
because I had thought
how is it that a country like the US
which has needed counterweights
in order for it to be like
you and I both have a Jewish component in our background
there's a weird way in which anti-Semitism
if it's too low
we stop being very Jewish
if it's too high we're in incredible threat
you have two separate
ethnic heritage
which would show you how vulnerable and precarious life can be
somehow
what terrified me
was the idea that we were going to take a bipolar system
which represented the Cold War
and suddenly remove
one part of it
without any plan as to how to manage this
but that's a good point
now, first of all, removing evil component
of this dichotomy was a good idea
I grew up on the Soviet Union
what was bad
is that it required a new plan
it did
and nobody wanted to talk about it
that's the weird part
now being a Monday morning
a quarterback
I know exactly what was wrong
actually I knew about it a few years ago
so in 1991-1992
it was America's role to start reconsidering
its
global participation
no Soviet Union, so what's the plan
and one of the most important things
was to address the reform of the United Nations
because the United Nations was built in 1945
as a successor of the failed League of Nations
to prevent an open war
open military conflict
between USSR and USA
between two superpowers
it was all about freezing conflicts
and it managed
there were conflicts but thanks God
it's been ridiculously successful
exactly in 1962 it came close
with the Caribbean crisis
but it was basically for a couple of weeks
there was no real threat
of World War 3
and global extermination
it's been amazingly quiet since 1945
yes, you look around the world
so the wars actually moved
from Europe to other continents
there was a Korean war
there was a Chinese Civil War
this is then
look, I hate to say it this way
Europe is one of the world's most
dangerous places
and we don't think about it that way
there is no stability that has been anomalous
Europe
that had wars for centuries
was pacified
so thanks to this United Nations
concept of
finding compromise to systems
they were fighting each other
but mostly proxy wars
around the world
that's why we had James Bond movies
and sometimes even James Bond cooperated
with KGB officers to fight global evil
so it's the
we knew how to live in this world
1991, you're right
Soviet Union has gone
so what's next?
it's the idea that evil disappears
it was dead wrong
evil can be buried for a while under the rubbles of Berlin Wall
but the moment we lose our vigilance
it sprouts out
so the United Nations
that was built to freeze conflicts
was not there
to solve problems
and we need to start looking for
solving problems
we need it, I believe
an organization that would be rather called League of Democracies
actually it's
late Senator McCain used it
but I have to say I used it separately
it's an organization
where the members
will not be just paying leapservice
to democracy
so America had to come up with a plan
like in 1946 rebuilding Europe
a global plan of spreading democracy
and freedom
but it's the
then
again, it's a human nature
it's very difficult to tell people
that recognize that for
nearly half a century there was an
existential threat
potential threat of the nuclear war
those who remember 1962 crisis
and Vietnam war
wow, it's all over
so why don't we just celebrate
why don't we get rich
why don't we just do other things
sometimes I think that
if the Soviet Union collapsed
a year later, probably Bush 41
