intuition
of where our passion is coming
I'm saying
has broken in terms of
our collective understanding of ourselves
we are having the most
irrelevant, bizarre
non-fact based, non-theory based
conversations
like children
but you said non-fact based
that's one of the problems
that's what putins of this world want us to forget
history
so now you're talking about world war 2
and so who cares, it's not relevant
it is relevant
but now Putin is basically
conquering
not territories
but actually
conquering our minds by
conducting very successful hybridism
let's go to that
what is it that
the Soviet Union and then Russia
understands about the human mind
that the US
needs to understand ASAP
but cannot figure out how to teach its own people
I don't think that we can compare
Soviet propaganda and Putin's
machine
for simple reason, Soviet Union
had an ideology
I took your point
again
my mother
she's 82
she was born under Stalin in 1937
so she still lives in Moscow
she heard it all
Stalin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev
Andropov, Gorbachev
and
she's watching this television
and she keeps telling me that
it's much worse than ever
because
before we had some ideals
yeah, they were false ideals
but it was all about
bright future
every ideology has its future
it could be horrible idea
even like Nazism
but again, they try to sell you the image of the future
Putin doesn't care about the future
it's the Putin's ideology in Russia
it's more like a cult of death
it was surrounded by enemies
what's a cult of confusion
everything is confusing
and they discovered that
instead of selling an ideology
which is always vulnerable
because the moment I give you the idea
you can't tell what the ideas are
everything slips through your fingers
it's a quick silver
so it's in 2004-2005
they had to make a decision
how to fight Russian oppositional internet
just at the time where I was about to stop
my chess career
and as I tried to help Russian oppositional movement
your early 40s
yeah, I'm early 40s in 2004-2005
and they made
call it ingenious decision
based on KGB experience
instead of following Chinese model
firewall, clothes
make people star for information
traditional dictatorships
they said
exactly the opposite
instead of
closing every hole
so what about the flood
flooding this information
by just creating so much
information here and there
for people just to get lost
and you can have
proud newspaper, front page
one story that everyone must follow
9 o'clock news
or you can start dividing
this story into many
poisonous elements
and start spreading them in the true stories
this is now all through our country
is that coming from Russia?
yes, in 2005
what's the transmission mechanism?
2004-2005
I'm going to get super aggressive
because I want to get to this
they decided that they'll start
creating these fake websites
when I say fake websites, they're real websites
but they looked like very liberal websites
they talked about certain things
they could even criticize Putin
some of them you noticed
but they always carried a little bit of a piece of story here and there
you and I have been talking
very critically about
Trump and the Republican phenomena
inhabiting this landscape
part of the problem we've had
is that the Democratic Party
went kleptocratic in the center
and started pursuing
policies that started like, let's say
widening the genie coefficients
so that we had greater inequality
and we started experimenting
with our own American style of nonsense
so right now we have a situation
which let me give you my feelings
I've been a lifelong Democrat
I don't trust my party as far as I can throw them
I don't trust the New York Times, Washington Post
I don't trust Fox News and the Republicans obviously
because that's transparently wrong
there is no ground truth
there's no place to go
people are tuning into this podcast
and by the way, I'm going to force you to come back
to this podcast because we need more time
and right now we're mostly talking to millennials
and the millennials are hungry
because they have an idea of
we came in on this game
we have no idea what we missed
everything makes no sense
where can I find some concept
of overarching
continuity
to make sense of a world that is disintegrating
into wet toilet paper
let's finish this story
about
fake news and troll factories
that's what Putin created
that's what KGB created
and they recognize it's far more effective
let's say they have to deal with Gary Kaspar
on his followers
you can go after Gary saying
he's just an American agent
he's a bad guy
he's working for CIA, for Mossad, whatever
some people will believe
some say no
he sells drugs, he sells guns
many intelligent people say no
he was a great Soviet champion
для them, it's a different story
they managed to create
it's a fake debate
you have a whole page
that is totally designed
elsewhere but it comes to
it's on a social media
somebody says Gary Kaspar
is a bad guy and then somebody is coming
no, no, no, no, he's a great guy
but I'm not so sure
and then you have a whole
if it wasn't for his drinking problem
I wish he had paid his time
but the typical one was
Gary was the greatest champion
but unfortunately he got
the ego went to his head
you understand that some people
refer to me as the alt right
like as if I could possibly be the alt right
the level of nonsense
but the level of nonsense
because people again, there's no gravitas
for us to understand
what is right is this
what does ground zero
nobody's been kept aside
you keep a fire extinguisher
under glass in case of emergencies
