when Karpov came to the stage, he looked at this
and then it's
great, another great player.
He realized that his move basically killed his
I think, you know,
structure
and it's, and he had to
actually start regrouping pieces, wasting
time, and he just, I think it's
definitely, it's
not just a strong move, but it was so unusual
move, looking weird, but
it shook Karpov's confidence and
he quickly made a mistake and lost the game.
That's fantastic.
Okay, here's a question
that I've never been able to ask, and maybe
if it doesn't make sense, you'll help me
I guess when we lost,
I mean, checkers was solved,
chess, we lost
with you in
So go, so
Okay, but the question is,
after go
I sort of expected something to happen
that didn't happen. I expected
someone to start trying
to create a new game
in which
humans would still have an advantage
that had the deterministic characteristics
and everyone seems so
demotivated
by this experience, like, what's the
point? Why are we, why race?
It's like trying to
continue to be a better number
multiplier in an age of computers, there's
no point.
Have we become demotivated?
Is anyone searching for
things that show off and accentuate
what humans still do better than any
any machine?
It's a very important question, and it's just
I think you just
so it's like almost homerun
because it's that's a question
that's in different
modifications. I hear all the time
since I now speak
three times a month
at the conferences, it's about AI
it's about cybersecurity and about
human machine collaboration
and about vanity
Yeah, so yes
The answer is that it's
we're not demotivated. I think
we're more pragmatic, we simply
understand that it doesn't make any sense
because it's not just chess or
God, it's a starcraft
it's Texas holding
poker, it's in you name
games, you know, and it's at the
end of the day machines will
always prevail. So to make it
you know easier for my audience to understand
I always tell them that every
game can be described
as a closed system
and if we have if you build a closed
system eventually a computer will always
win exactly. Okay, that's it
so the human strength is not
you know is not
trying to compete with machines in
closed systems because if we know how to
do it machines will do it better
not because they perfect again that's important
they will never reach 100% perfection
it doesn't exist in the universe
but they will make fewer mistakes
so machines will always
outperform humans
by you know by minimizing number of mistakes
or it's not just a number of mistakes
machines do not make
blunders so they get the gravity
of machines mistakes or inaccuracies
it's not as you know sometimes humans
could do something really stupid.
Have you ever looked at
the history of electric
guitar? No.
So you have these very weird players
I'm just gonna riff off of your open versus
closed games where
probably the first great electric guitarist
was a guy named Charlie Christian
but he was really playing the guitar
and it happened to be electrified
by the time we get to people
like Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen
whatever we
thought the vocabulary
was that we were restricted to in the instrument
they showed us that the
dimensionality of play was so much
greater than we had ever considered
for example by bringing the
amplification into the instrument and
making it part of the instrument or with Les Paul
creating the instrument as the recording studio
not just as the instrument
and so eventually these become closed
games but there is something about
and to just fit with the theme
of this series the search
for a portal out of the closed
game into a higher dimensional space
where something else is available
like people
talk about hearing Eddie Van Halen for the first
time and their guitarist and they're
thinking I have no idea what I'm listening
to how do those noises come from
that man
are there any
sort of innovations like
that
you think where computers can start
looking for ways out of the closed systems
into higher dimensions
I don't think so
I think machines will not
be able in a foreseeable
future if not indefinitely
to understand how
to transfer the knowledge from one closed system
into another
Can machine ask questions? Yes
they just don't know what questions are relevant
Well, so I give this example quite a bit
but
there's a very powerful concept in
pure mathematics
of taking square roots
of various objects where
like with real numbers it's quite clear
what a square root should be but even when
you get to the negative numbers
you end up having to go outside of the
real numbers to answer a question about the
square root of negative 7
and you can take the square roots of
rotations, you can take the square roots
of determinants of matrices
and you find these structures that nobody knew
were hiding there
so one of the things we've learned in pure mathematics
is that there is a way
of going from a closed system
into a larger closed system
and in that one moment
the closed system reveals itself to be open
Is that something that you imagine?
I'm not sure
it's a legitimate comparison
because it's a decision making
it's in math
there are answers
math, it's one or another
you have an answer
it's not a straightforward
it could be just a crook
but at the end of the day
there's a solution
Game of chess is not
or any other game is not math
there's no perfect solution
K.H. Hardy wrote
that chess is real mathematics
but of a trivial kind
in the sense that
he didn't mean trivial in that it was easy
or that it wasn't beautiful
he meant that it didn't connect to anything else
because the rules were artificial
and so what it told you about
was simply internal to the world of chess
but again in math you have perfect solutions
in chess
sometimes you have perfect solutions
but in most cases it's based on your assumption
and it's
again machines will always win
not because they see the perfect solution
