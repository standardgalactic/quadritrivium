to not talk about what the basis is
let's go back to the question
I want to hear what they say about foreign policy
because Trump
is on trial now
he will be impeached in the house
for his crimes
foreign policy related crimes
and they don't talk about it
they talk about something else
they want the country to believe that Trump was guilty
but we don't hear
what would they do differently
but if the democrats, for example
pursue things where Trump actually isn't guilty
so that he's both guilty
and not guilty of things that he's accused of
any attempt to prosecute things
frivolously
which we will see
is going to result in this loss of trust
we have to do something about trust
and if we don't have some
trust is important
