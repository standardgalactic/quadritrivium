Осторожнее, товарищи. Двери открываются. Привет. Вы нашли портал. Я твой хозяин,
Ирик Вайнштейн. И сегодня мой гейс в студии Герри Вайнштейн или Герри Каспаров. Я не знаю точно,
но еще нет проблем. Герри, добро пожаловать. Очень приятно. It's a huge honor to welcome you to the portal.
Thank you very much. Герри Каспаров. Let's make sure. My name was changed in 1975,
because my father died tragically when I was seven. He was just 39 and it was just leukemia.
They couldn't save him. I grew up with my mother and her parents. In 1975 there was a family decision
that I could change my name and to carry my name of my grandfather.
So that's a story. Since 1975 I'm known for the world of chess as Gary Kasparov.
I know that you're Gary Kasparov. In fact, there are very few people who need no introduction.
You are one of them and I was tempted to give you almost no introduction.
Yeah, but you said you're almost in perfect Russian.
You're very kind. Герри, you're known for many things.
Мы могли поговорить о том, что your dominance of the world of chess is world number one for many years,
famous from top level play, sort of a streak of dominance that we have never seen.
But if anything, it's been really remarkable to watch your career after chess,
where you've taken on this incredible role in a very confusing age as a champion of human rights.
Зактивая retirees are really, which of the topics I want to hit most,
whether it's talking about automation and your famous interaction with Deep Blue.
But I think that the thing I want to do is I want to try to complete some of the questions
you get asked over and over again, like who is the greatest chess player of all time.
Thank you, I'm very grateful.
Let's try to figure out what that might have crowded out, and let's move on to the next sorts of things.
Начнем с... Один из вещей, который я бы хотел поговорить с тобой,
это что-то, что я очень скучный.
Когда ты играл в «Дип-Блю» в lat 1990-х, и...
1996-1997.
Да, это точно.
В середине lat 1990-х.
В мире смотрелся в том, что он provaably не смотрел честного мастера,
когда Фишер против Спаски.
Это фейсовый статус?
Да, это фейсовый статус.
Я думаю, что это был лучший, видящий честный мастер в истории.
Потому что это не только честный мастер.
Это был паник.
Этот мастер против спаски, который...
был так fascinating для публичных генералов, за годы.
Этот мастер был, и он еще не был встанганным,
по очень гибким фокусам.
И, опять, что-то, что бы предпочитать.
Это была машина.
И люди думали, что это было унижение,
потому что это... Это была доной АИ.
Смотри, «Дип-Блю» не было интеллигентом,
это было не более интеллигентом, чем «Алварн-Клок».
Это очень приятно.
10 миллионов долларов на пиес,
но то, что машина, которая играла в чест в 1997-м,
не должна быть интеллигентом.
Потому что на конце дня,
это не о том, что она интеллигентна,
это не о репликации...
Это не репликания человеческих процессов,
это просто о том, как мы делаем решения,
но это о том, что мы делаем нескольких ошибок.
Это что-то, что...
Это, по-моему, самое важное,
что было в тактах 1997-м.
И также помимо тем, что люди я сходи в 1996-м.
И IBM, когда они играли с третьей матчей,
потому что в тактах, когда я был сильнее...
Такой пусси.
Да, но, смотри, это очень хорошая решение.
Как я explained в моем книге «Дип-Знайкинг»,
это очень хорошая решение,
потому что они знали,
что в 1997-м «Дип-Блю»
была очень сильная,
но как бы для машины сегодня,
Но сегодня это было просто норвисто.
Сегодня...
Понимаете, что случилось в последние 20 лет?
Да.
Ди Блую 1997 был уникальным проектом IBM,
где миллионы и миллионы долларов invest in one of the largest corporations on this planet.
Сегодня вы можете купить честный инжен,
и downloading your laptop.
И этот компьютер, этот честный инжен,
будет гораздо сильнее than Magnus Carlsen,
current world chess champion.
И если у вас есть специальные hardware
для одинаковых инженов,
как Stockfish, Houdini,
Commodore,
то отличие в связи между этими инженами,
и Magnus Carlsen,
как и у Сейн-Болтан-Феррари.
Ди Блую 1997 был не так хорошим.
Мы знаем, если мы взяли тот exact software,
и вы, в какой-то смысле, держите тракт,
что это за элорейтинг?
Да.
Что бы этот элорейтинг сегодня было relative to the top players?
Я думаю, что мы можем...
Спасибо большое, что вы меняли эти номера,
потому что аудио всегда любит номера.
Мой высший рейтинг, мой пик рейтинг,
был 2851.
28... 2851.
Боббе Фишерс высший рейтинг
был 2785, но в 1972.
Вы всегда должны помнить,
что инфлейшн был и не был эффектным.
Это релативный систем.
Это релативный систем.
Нет-нет-нет, это просто...
Вы perform well,
вы add points,
вы не perform well,
вы lose points.
И пункт-валю predicts,
если мы играем против each other,
у нас есть один рейтинг,
поэтому...
И я делаю,
скажем так,
6-4 пунктов,
т.е. я добавил 10 пунктов.
И вы делаете немного для меня?
10 пунктов.
Если...
Если в течение 200 пунктов,
я думаю, что 230 пунктов,
я должен выиграть 80%.
Я думаю, это просто из-за моего памятника.
Так.
Это предыдущие,
в зависимости от дифференции в элорейтинге.
И так я делаю лучше, чем предыдущие.
Так, add points,
worse, a lose point.
Так, вернусь обратно
к моему абсолютному форму,
абсолютным рекордам,
было 2851 пунктов.
Фишер был 2785 пунктов,
но помните,
когда Фишер достигнул
эту феноменальную высоту,
нет игроков в 2700 пунктов,
и очень много игроков в 2600 пунктов.
Так, это...
Это большая гадка.
Это была огромная гадка.
Так, это 2785 пунктов,
в 1972 пунктов,
наверное, было больше 2900 пунктов сегодня.
Так что, наверное,
2851 пунктов в 1999 пунктов,
так же.
Магнадос Карлсон,
высоту высоты,
было 2882 пунктов.
Теперь он около 2840 пунктов.
Так что, он еще,
выяснился,
это 2800 пунктов.
Да.
Есть только несколько игроков,
в этих днях,
кроме 2800 пунктов.
И там,
на уровне 2810,
2820,
так что...
Так,
и...
И когда я играл Дблюз,
я был 2800 пунктов,
Дблюз,
объективная гадка,
было, наверное, 2700 пунктов.
Но это не про объективную гадку,
это про, как вы играете в этой игре,
и как много ошибок вы делаете.
Теперь,
если вы
есть
эти
честные инженеры
на специалистовом hardware,
это будет, наверное, 3400.
Это невероятно.
3400.
Это невероятно.
Да, это, опять,
не потому что...
Но я хочу спросить
эту другую вопросу,
которая,
если мы взяли
exact machine
и software,
и мы взяли это из мауфбалов
с 1997 года,
что мы думаем, что
это элорейдинг
будет сегодня?
Это Дблюз?
Да,
это деблюз.
Но деблюз, я сказал,
это 20...
может 2800.
Но это не больше.
Потому что...
Так,
Магнаст Карлсон
будет...
The reason I ask...
Это будет
компетенция.
Деблюз, опять,
я мог бы играть в Дблюз,
если мы играли в третью матчу,
я бы был любимым,
потому что я уже aprendил
много об этом.
Но это...
Я думал, что это
очень inspiring,
потому что вы говорили о том,
как мы aprendим
от этих компьютеров,
что люди,
что они умеют...
Это не...
Это...
Это...
Это...
Машины сегодня...
Они так много...
Я не уверен, что я могу сказать,
они умеют.
Но это более advanced.
Потому что...
Не забудьте,
Деблюз
был...
Это не только проект Chess.
Это был проект
параллельных процессоров.
Так что
256 процессоров.
Каждый из них
был маленький компьютер,
который мог сделать
1,5 млн позиции в секунду.
Так что
Combined,
они могли достигнуть
феноменовой скорости
200 млн позиции в секунду.
200 млн.
Что, опять,
сегодня это не...
Это не...
Это не впечатление.
Это не впечатание.
Но...
Эти...
Эти Chess devices,
которые мы просто говорили,
на вашем лаптуре,
они не будут быстрее,
чем 5-6 млн позиции в секунду.
Так что они не так быстро,
но они более advanced,
потому что они не должны быть так быстро.
Это не о calculации,
о calculации,
потому что Chess
...
Some people don't recognize,
Chess is mathematically infinite,
or almost infinite game.
Functionally infinite,
from our perspective.
Functionally infinite,
according to Colossianan,
you know, one of the founding fathers
of computer science,
the number of legal moves
in the game of chess...
10 to 40 something?
10 to 46 power.
Okay, 10 to 46.
46 power, that's again,
that's just...
this number is just...
it's...
kills imagination.
Right, exactly.
Yeah.
So,
it's not about calculating only,
but it's also about
quoting what understanding.
And the programs today,
they are so much advanced.
All right, but let me...
There's no questions,
you cannot even touch them,
because even strongest players,
you know, they will be badly beaten.
Now,
if you have a free chess app
on your mobile phone,
yes.
that's probably as good as the blue.
Right.
Thanks to the Moore's Law.
Which is very impressive.
But what I really want to get at
is the reason that chess matters to us,
and the reason that we all thrilled to it,
is that it has to do with its legacy,
the way it's interwoven with our society,
our culture,
our storytelling,
even our language.
We are constantly searching for chess metaphor.
And one of the things that animates us
is the poetry of chess.
That when fathers and sons,
for example,
would pull out,
you know,
games of morphe or something,
and to try to show
something really graceful and beautiful,
we'd look to the evergreen game
or the immortal game
or something like that.
And it lifts our spirits.
And sometimes we're really focused
not on who won or who lost,
but on the concept of brilliancies.
When does somebody do something so unexpected
and so daring
that they put themselves at great risk
and then manage to somehow
extricate themselves?
What I want to know is,
are we in a position
to program computers
for brilliancies and poetries
rather than simply brute force?
Okay.
Let's start with your assumption.
Assumptions,
you can unweave them if you want.
Not assumption,
not actually assertion
or a concept of us,
because you said a few times, us.
Okay.
It's the now,
at the era of globalization,
we should recognize that,
us look different
in different quarters.
The game of chess that you mentioned,
it's not the only game of chess
that does exist.
Sure.
It's one that came from India
through Persia to Europe.
No, but it's one of the versions.
Whether it's India, again,
we don't have any records about India.
We definitely have few records
about the game played in Persia.
The records come actually from the Arab world.
Okay.
So what we know about European chess,
let me call it European chess,
is that the game traveled
from the Arab world
to Iberian Peninsula
and the first book
that presented
the compilation of chess studies
played by, you know,
in old Arab rules,
much slower game,
because the game of chess always reflected
some sort of,
it's a military knowledge of its time.
Right.
And it was King,
allegedly written by King Alfonso the Wise.
It's original is kept in Escorial,
in Spain,
in 1283.
And then, you know,
the current version of chess
has been shaped by the end
of the 15th century,
early 16th century in Spain,
with few extra editions
in Italy and in France
in the next couple of hundred years.
That's European chess.
That's international chess.
Got it.
But there is also Chinese chess.
Sure.
There is Thai chess.
And some variation of Thai chess.
That is, by the way,
closest to original Arab version,
so that's a very slow version of the game.
And there is a totally separate game
called Shogi,
Japanese chess,
by far the most popular game in Japan,
far more popular than Go.
OK.
So, and the way this Japanese chess
is played,
it probably reflects the way,
you know, the military operations
have been conducted over centuries there.
One of the key elements there is that
you always can bring a piece
that you took from your opponent back
with a parachute move.
Oh, really?
And most of the pieces,
they just move fast.
And straight.
So there's this,
the game doesn't have an end game,
the way we have it in chess.
It's all about attacking the king.
It's like a slow-motion game,
but then it's, the moment,
it's the both sides,
they meet each other,
that'll field.
It's like a samurai,
samurai, just it's bloodshed.
OK.
So there's like a metaphoric aspect
to which kind of chess we play.
Exactly, exactly.
No, but you said exactly.
In the Western European,
Eurocentric world,
chess has been viewed for centuries
as a nexus of human intelligence.
So it's saying,
oh, he or she played chess.
Wow,
because it was like a mystery.
It's not surprising that Alfred Binet,
the father of IQ test,
so at the end of the 19th century,
he was fascinated by the way
the chess player's mind was working.
So he believed that if he could study
the minds of the chess player,
the brains of the chess players,
he could reveal the ultimate secrets
of human intelligence.
It's very interesting.
By the way, it's not true.
It's very flattering for me to say that,
but that's the greatest minds
who always looked at chess
as sort of an open test.
Have you always been as self-critical
as you're being right now?
I'm self-critical.
I'm objective.
It's the aptitude for playing chess.
It's nothing else than aptitude for playing chess.
It's like your capital.
You have intellectual capital.
So you can invest it wisely.
You can invest it poorly.
I like the idea that even IQ, of course,
is not intelligence.
It's a particular measure of a something.
I don't know if you happen to know him,
but I went to graduate school in the same year
as a guy named Noam Elkes, who is...
He's the Israeli chess composer.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Just because I had a book, you know,
of the best Israeli chess studies.
And that's why I recognize him.
Yeah, but he was like the youngest
full professor at Harvard.
It's for him.
It was a hobby.
Some of the great studies.
But he comments on the fact
that he can only achieve
the level of chess master,
even though he's a grandmaster
in problem solving and composing.
And so even there,
there's something very mysterious,
because this is sort of like a
John von Neumann-like level of intelligence.
And he's commenting on the fact
that he's merely a chess master.
And so I found that to be quite shocking
and surprising,
because I know how amazing Noam is.
Look, it's not...
It's not...
Yeah, but absolutely.
Because it's also about competition.
You have to compete.
I mean, his great mind feels probably
more at home by composing.
He's just in his comfort of his study.
He can think about it.
So he can...
There's no time pressure.
There's no opponent just across the board.
No intimidation.
Exactly.
So getting back to brilliancies,
which I don't want you to avoid.
Okay, no, no.
I'm not going to avoid it,
because I have a straightforward answer.
Do you want to say what a brilliancy is
in your own language so that you don't...
No, it's not...
Before we move to my definition of brilliancy.
Sure.
Yes, I think the answer is no.
Straightforward no.
Machines cannot do it for a simple reason.
Because you're talking about brilliancy
and about creativity.
Those are things that, you know,
versus brute force.
Right.
The way machines operate,
they have been operating ever since
and they will be operating
in a different period of time.
It's based on odds.
They know odds.
They know patterns.
They can operate within this like a known universe.
Something that they know within the rules
that they...
Either they have been told about these rules
or the information that they have been provided for them.
But they are always looking for the best move.
So brilliancy based on creativity
and it means that, yes, I can play a very risky,
adventurous game.
Maybe it could be a brilliant game.
Maybe it could be a failure.
You have to accept the chance,
sometimes significant chance of failure
to create a masterpiece.
Машинки не могут оперировать
в этом продукте.
Вы не знают, как указать концепцию
на мастерпище?
Ну, мастерпище
это что-то, что-то, что-то, что-то, что-то.
То есть, это все-таки субъективно?
Да, это все-таки субъективно.
Потому что, ты знаешь,
некоторые люди, ты знаешь,
это о том, что есть субъективно.
Да.
Нет, некоторые игры,
люди говорят,
«Вау, это невероятно!»
Главное, что эти игры
просто, ты знаешь,
include some kind of sacrifices.
Потому что люди всегда
enjoy seeing that the spirit
triumphs over material.
But when you sacrifice pieces,
you know, here and there,
right, left and center,
and eventually you meet opponent's king,
that's the most popular
concept of masterpiece.
But you can have a very slow motion,
positional masterpiece,
you know, by just adding,
you know, just advantage,
micro-advantage after one,
after another,
and strangling your opponent.
It could be a mixture of that.
So, but again.
You, for example, described
the current number one,
Magnus Carlsen is a mixture
of Karpov and Fisher.
Yes.
And Fisher was the obvious
sort of virtuoso at the level
of masterpiece.
But you pointed out that Karpov
was a master of maximum efficiency
of the power of an individual piece
to do the most with the least.
Yes, absolutely.
And Magnus is this lethal combination
of two, because Fisher,
I think, just,
he was very rough,
but it's, I mean, sheer energy.
He could play until the last pawn,
basically squeezing,
you know, water out of stone.
Now, Karpov was good in just
in getting the maximum effect
out of the minimum, you know,
resources he had available.
But he was not as consistent
as Fisher, not so pushy.
He, you know, it was more relaxed.
So Magnus brings them together.
And that's, you know, he has
Karpov's ability to maximize
the effect of his pieces.
But also he will play to the very last
move, as Fisher did.
Right.
And, OK.
So I think what you're telling me
is that we are not yet able
to figure out how to encode
the concept of brilliancy,
so that we may lose to these machines,
but that the poetry to be
extracted from chess
at one level belongs to this
positional brute force aspect,
and another belongs to something
that's ineffable that we can't quite touch.
Look, yes, it's the...
And I took your point
about the sacrifices that that's a sort of an obvious
version of a risk taking.
But it's interesting thing.
It's the latest chess
computer prodigy,
AlphaZero.
That's the program
run by Demis Khasabis
and his team.
It's the DeepMind team that is working
for Google.
They succeeded in
beating the best goal players.
Then they just, they came up
with this concept of AlphaZero,
which is starting from scratch.
So the machine knows only the rules,
whether it's God, whether it's chess,
whether it's a starcraft, any game.
And then it plays against itself.
It learns from its own experience
no human contamination.
Which is very funny, because one definition
of genius is the fire that lights itself.
Yeah, but it's...
Yes, and it played
against Stockfish,
against one of the strongest chess engines
and it beat it convincingly a number of times.
But then Stockfish got better.
Yeah, but it still...
AlphaZero still dominates the game.
Now, when we look at these games,
that's the first time when I thought,
oh wow, I can learn something from these machines.
AlphaZero
played chess more aggressively.
Contrary to our expectations,
that stronger machines will play
dollar games more, you know,
just it's the slow more games,
because every
sacrifice can be refuted.
So that's why machines, they don't take too much risk.
But AlphaZero,
contrary to our beliefs, you know,
played very aggressive chess sacrificing material
and beating
Stockfish,
machine, not humans, it's by just, you know,
always being
one or two moves ahead
anticipating what's coming next.
Now,
I use words sacrifice.
Yeah.
For machine, for AlphaZero,
it wasn't a sacrifice.
AlphaZero, thanks to its
massive experience through
these 60 million games,
60 million games to play against itself.
So it generated
a bank of data,
which provided
its, you know, better understanding of patterns.
So when AlphaZero sacrifice
quote-unquote,
we saw it as a sacrifice.
For AlphaZero, it was
the transformation of a material
pawns
or pieces into
other factors that were more dominant.
Position or momentum.
So, and it's amazing
that it's AlphaZero that
had, you know, just looked at the fewer positions.
It's about 1% of what,
you know, when you look at the number of positions
analyzed versus Stockfish,
it was far more
prescient in understanding what's coming next.
Again, playing without the material.
Stockfish, you know, it took, you know,
one or two moves to actually understand what's coming.
Because it looked, and again,
it's not that it's the combination was winning.
It's when AlphaZero made sacrifices.
It was not a forced win because
Stockfish would have seen it as well.
It was, you know, it was, again,
deeper understanding of the game based on
it's a pattern
that it was
able to design out of these
60 million games.
Во-первых,
imagine me telling you what a brilliancy is.
It's ridiculous.
But one thing
I might define it as
is anything
where there would be a body of
conventional wisdom and then there's a move that is
deeply weird relative
to that expectation.
So, for example, a move that doesn't seem to develop
anything, it's like almost a
throwaway move could also be a brilliancy.
If it turned out that that unlocked
something nobody could see.
But, yes, anything that surprises people
could be a brilliancy.
So, maybe one of the most
brilliant moves based on your definition.
Sure.
I ever made was game 24.
I played it until the Karpov.
It was a unique moment when you just, you know,
I had to survive this game
and Karpov had to win the game to
retain his title.
And it was a last game of the match.
And Karpov had a very, you know,
potentially, very strong attack.
And I found a move that was totally illogical.
By the way, ever since this game
this idea became
part of the defensive
concept for Black.
But at that time, you know, it was just
it looked so ugly, because
you don't put these rooks, you know, just
in a position
where it has no other moves
surrounded by your own pieces.
But it was not about, you know, it's not about
attacking. Basically, it was a very good
prophylactic moves, because it
prevented big threats from
White, and it had to force
Karpov to start looking for other plans.
So, you know, it's, and I was
very happy when I just, I remember, I made this move
because I just didn't understand how else
to defend. It just was so much against,
you know, what I learned, but then it made a move
and I remember when I just, you know, it's this is
when Karpov came to the stage, he looked at this
and then it's
great, another great player.
He realized that his move basically killed his
I think, you know,
structure
and it's, and he had to
actually start regrouping pieces, wasting
time, and he just, I think it's
definitely, it's
not just a strong move, but it was so unusual
move, looking weird, but
it shook Karpov's confidence and
he quickly made a mistake and lost the game.
That's fantastic.
Okay, here's a question
that I've never been able to ask, and maybe
if it doesn't make sense, you'll help me
I guess when we lost,
I mean, checkers was solved,
chess, we lost
with you in
So go, so
Okay, but the question is,
after go
I sort of expected something to happen
that didn't happen. I expected
someone to start trying
to create a new game
in which
humans would still have an advantage
that had the deterministic characteristics
and everyone seems so
demotivated
by this experience, like, what's the
point? Why are we, why race?
It's like trying to
continue to be a better number
multiplier in an age of computers, there's
no point.
Have we become demotivated?
Is anyone searching for
things that show off and accentuate
what humans still do better than any
any machine?
It's a very important question, and it's just
I think you just
so it's like almost homerun
because it's that's a question
that's in different
modifications. I hear all the time
since I now speak
three times a month
at the conferences, it's about AI
it's about cybersecurity and about
human machine collaboration
and about vanity
Yeah, so yes
The answer is that it's
we're not demotivated. I think
we're more pragmatic, we simply
understand that it doesn't make any sense
because it's not just chess or
God, it's a starcraft
it's Texas holding
poker, it's in you name
games, you know, and it's at the
end of the day machines will
always prevail. So to make it
you know easier for my audience to understand
I always tell them that every
game can be described
as a closed system
and if we have if you build a closed
system eventually a computer will always
win exactly. Okay, that's it
so the human strength is not
you know is not
trying to compete with machines in
closed systems because if we know how to
do it machines will do it better
not because they perfect again that's important
they will never reach 100% perfection
it doesn't exist in the universe
but they will make fewer mistakes
so machines will always
outperform humans
by you know by minimizing number of mistakes
or it's not just a number of mistakes
machines do not make
blunders so they get the gravity
of machines mistakes or inaccuracies
it's not as you know sometimes humans
could do something really stupid.
Have you ever looked at
the history of electric
guitar? No.
So you have these very weird players
I'm just gonna riff off of your open versus
closed games where
probably the first great electric guitarist
was a guy named Charlie Christian
but he was really playing the guitar
and it happened to be electrified
by the time we get to people
like Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen
whatever we
thought the vocabulary
was that we were restricted to in the instrument
they showed us that the
dimensionality of play was so much
greater than we had ever considered
for example by bringing the
amplification into the instrument and
making it part of the instrument or with Les Paul
creating the instrument as the recording studio
not just as the instrument
and so eventually these become closed
games but there is something about
and to just fit with the theme
of this series the search
for a portal out of the closed
game into a higher dimensional space
where something else is available
like people
talk about hearing Eddie Van Halen for the first
time and their guitarist and they're
thinking I have no idea what I'm listening
to how do those noises come from
that man
are there any
sort of innovations like
that
you think where computers can start
looking for ways out of the closed systems
into higher dimensions
I don't think so
I think machines will not
be able in a foreseeable
future if not indefinitely
to understand how
to transfer the knowledge from one closed system
into another
Can machine ask questions? Yes
they just don't know what questions are relevant
Well, so I give this example quite a bit
but
there's a very powerful concept in
pure mathematics
of taking square roots
of various objects where
like with real numbers it's quite clear
what a square root should be but even when
you get to the negative numbers
you end up having to go outside of the
real numbers to answer a question about the
square root of negative 7
and you can take the square roots of
rotations, you can take the square roots
of determinants of matrices
and you find these structures that nobody knew
were hiding there
so one of the things we've learned in pure mathematics
is that there is a way
of going from a closed system
into a larger closed system
and in that one moment
the closed system reveals itself to be open
Is that something that you imagine?
I'm not sure
it's a legitimate comparison
because it's a decision making
it's in math
there are answers
math, it's one or another
you have an answer
it's not a straightforward
it could be just a crook
but at the end of the day
there's a solution
Game of chess is not
or any other game is not math
there's no perfect solution
K.H. Hardy wrote
that chess is real mathematics
but of a trivial kind
in the sense that
he didn't mean trivial in that it was easy
or that it wasn't beautiful
he meant that it didn't connect to anything else
because the rules were artificial
and so what it told you about
was simply internal to the world of chess
but again in math you have perfect solutions
in chess
sometimes you have perfect solutions
but in most cases it's based on your assumption
and it's
again machines will always win
not because they see the perfect solution
again 10 to the 46 power
number of legal moves
but because they make few mistakes
so they will be closer to perfection than humans
whether it's much close
or just close it doesn't matter
so they will be always ahead
so same with every other game
so all you need is to provide machine
with the rules and machines will start operating
just on their own
by creating their data
though I have to say that
today alpha 0 is still quite an exception
most of the machines today 99%
if not 99.9%
they are doing not transformation
but optimization
they are still operating with human generated data
but the future
no doubt it's for alpha 0 type computers
they will be
it's like a computer
with AI algorithms
and
they will require
some form of human guidance
it's like I always call this
the future computer experts
shepherds
so they will be nudging the flocks
of intelligent algorithms
one or another
but they will still need to be nudged
so it's
moving from one system to another
it's one close system to another close system
will require human guidance
what is very important for us to recognize
is that our role
percentage wise
is shrinking
but it doesn't mean that we become
expendable
so actually I think
we could become even more important
in this human machine collaboration
because we will be deciding
how this massive brute force
will be moved
right or left
or whatever up and down
if I'm honest about that
which you just said
that in the short term
I think we become more important
because the least interesting things
are taken over by the computers
and then if we're smart
we invest in what it is that we do best
which is often this act of
brilliance induction
opening a closed system
into a larger one
which is temporarily opening it up
and that's exciting
however I do feel
that we can
win for humanity
you find short term to be
well
I worry that this is on the order of decades
not centuries
for you and me it's probably not a very short term
yes
that's why I ask
why do we go too far
so this is again
the strength of humanity was always
to respond to the challenges
that we are here now
I don't want us to spend time
I would say
waste our time debating
what can
or may
may happen, may not happen
30, 40, 50 years from now
we have challenges that we should address
right now and
I think that it's time for us
to understand how we can
maximize the
benefits out of human machine
collaboration
so I had a very funny interaction preparing
for my interview with you today
which is that I spoke to two brilliant
young women
one of whom just released
25,000 new
stock photos of people who don't exist
generated by her AI
she's a PhD from Berkeley
the other of which is a brilliant musician
but arguably also one of the world's most
stunningly beautiful women
a supermodel
and I noticed that the ELO system
that you use for chess
can be used in any situation where
if you asked who would people
find more beautiful person A
or person B and then you have a prediction
so you could use an ELO system
and I asked my friend the supermodel
our name is Charlotte Kempmull
would you be willing
to subject yourself to
a Kasparov versus
the machine type
competition where my other friend will attempt
to generate photographs
that are even more beautiful
than any human being who has ever been
and we could try to figure out
what the ELO rating is
for simply feminine beauty
now that's a very different thing
than a computational problem
on the surface
it may be a computational problem
under the hood
but what happened when I started looking through
the friend's catalogue
of stock photos
is that I could see that you could very easily fall in love
with the images that she generated
even though they correspond to no human being
they were filled with emotion
grace
whatever it is that you associate most
with being human and yet she knew
exactly how they'd been generated
from her neural nets
that's pretty disturbing in some ways
would you not say so?
look
you're talking about images
still images
now
just for proper relations you need more than still images
well that's true but the idea
she's able to animate a lot of these
first of all into video
that becomes interesting
the moment you start animating
and then a couple of our friends
Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan
have put so many hours of data
of their voice into the world
that we can now generate their voice
so that they can't tell the difference between what they've said
and what the machines
so we're starting to get to the point
we also have programs that write sports stories
simply from the statistics
that come off the games
in a credible fashion
that's the data
you know what's here
is that we've associated various things
with our humanity
and I think your point about chess
which I just think is great
is don't make the mistake
of holding those associations
too tightly because the machines will let you know
that some of this
is not having to do with being human at all
yes
the decision making process
is not just
human prerogative forever
we used to think that
machines could do all sorts of work
but not to
challenge our cognitive skills
at the end of the day
what's the difference
machines could
help us
in just making progress
whether it's
in the field
of physical exercises
or mental exercises
though again
if you look at the statistics
I think it's the
the McKinsey's report
of 2016 US job market
showed that
it's the only 4%
of working activities
required medium
human creativity
4%
so it means that
for over decades
we have been training people to work like machines
and now we are shocked
that many of these jobs
they are just you know they do
this is like zombie jobs
they are already dead they just don't know
every repetitive job has that characteristic
repetitive jobs does not
necessarily
it's a physical one
you can have repetitive jobs
radiology is the easy one
intellectually
and when people say
oh yeah but many of these jobs
they are just in grave danger
but you know
thank you for mentioning radiology
yes
we know that human machine collaboration
shows better results
than either one individual
so that means
you will have some experts
and from my experience
you know in chess in combination of human plus machines
you don't need
the strongest minds
so the most talented players
working with machine but someone who knows
enough to give machines
so it's like
it's a to guide machine not interference machine
superior knowledge so that's why you may not need
a top professor but maybe
an assistant professor maybe even experienced
nurse to work with his machine
oh but
I hear time and again
thousands of jobs
you know they will be at grave risk
maybe they will be lost and it's the well-paid jobs
yes but what is the
what is the other side of this
of this coin
the jobs will be lost but the cost
goes down more people
could have access to that and when you look at the
number of lives that can be saved
in this country or especially
in the third world countries
developing countries so
then you know all of a sudden you understand that
it's while certain groups of people could be in danger
because their computation
and machines they bringing
you know
havoc in our professional routine
but as a humanity
we always win
but isn't it weird how many of us are seeking drudgery
that we wish
like you watch what happens when you liberate people
and you find that they go back to these games on their computers
that they play repetitively
you know that there's a way in which humans
we had always thought we wanted to be liberated
to do creativity but there's something terrifying about creativity
and many of us
actually seek repetitive
activity which anesthetizes
us and arguably
we're happiest
when we start behaving in a way
that is machine like
but again it brings us back to us
bring us back to human
because you know it's the
instead of talking about killer robots
terminators, matrix and other
horrors produced by Hollywood
so that's your neighbors here
so brainwashing
generations of
pain of attention to Boston Dynamics
yeah
it's
it's quite primitive
but why don't we talk about
you know about humans
using modern technology
to harm other humans because humans
still have monopoly for evil
and I think it's far more important
to understand how this modern technology
that has been designed
in theory to make our lives better
have been
effectively used to undermine
the very foundation of the free world
so what I
it's a great opportunity to transition
because if there's anything that I'm more interested in
than talking about computers
and poetry and all of these things
it's this bizarre moment that we find ourselves
in the free world
where I've never seen anything like this
in my life it appears
that there are almost no adults left in the system
it appears to me that there's almost no
institution that really cares about ground
truth and it appears to me
that we are right now in the process
of sort of
abandoning everything we've built up
for the most trivial of reasons
and I don't
know whether you subscribe
to this but the transformation of our
country intellectually to me
since slightly before the election of Donald
Trump till the present moment has been
the most unexpected
singularity
in terms of the ability to hold conversations
to analyze
what it is that we in fact hold
in common
our sense making apparatus appears to have been broken down
and a large number of people don't even seem
to be aware of this and
I don't know
how to explain how many different
clusters of beliefs
have now cropped up which appeared to be
incapable of communicating with each other
are you seeing the same thing?
yes
and I've been worrying about it for quite a while
so I wrote the book
winter is coming
just you know before the presidential elections
in 2016
and unfortunately
this warning
nobody understood it?
nobody wanted to hear this because it seemed
that is just like a pink
so far away
the book didn't mention Trump or Syria but you could read
that
because I really talked about Putin
and about his threat
to the free world
that it was just a matter of time
before the techniques
that have been developed in Russia and tested
in neighboring
countries and in other European countries
that these techniques
would be used
to undermine American democracy
and also I talked about
the growing vacuum in the world
that was a result of
the free world led by the United States
to depart from its leadership role
after the end of the Cold War
so it's easy to say
everything is about Donald Trump
but when you look at the Donald Trump phenomena
it has roots
it's a symptom
somehow Trump demonstrated
that the system was already so weak
that it could have
persons so unqualified
to win elections
by the rules
yes with foreign interference
with other things
the adaptive landscape
if you want to take the evolutionary metaphor
was created and then suddenly
there was a creature that inhabited
absolutely
before we go to Trump we should understand
why the system was so weak enough
susceptible
just to succumb
to Trump's
it's not even evil genius
it's just intellectual
it's always insulting to hear what he said
but the man
it's so
not as unqualified
but it's just if you ask
people to describe a potential threat
to his democracy
20 years ago
what could be the image of this villain
that would be threatening
the very foundation of America Republic
you could come up with somebody very intelligent
very slick
you have somebody like Bill Clinton
so that's his type, very intelligent
well-spoken
charming
just so you know
I did write, I think it was in 2013
an essay warning about what I thought was going to come up
based on
my understanding of professional wrestling
and professional wrestling is in some sense
something that mirrors some of the techniques
that may have been developed in Russia
because the propensity
to suspend disbelief
is not well understood
by many people who have a rational
enlightenment-oriented bent
but it's easy
I still want to go back to 1991-92
because it was the end of the Cold War
it was a moment of the greatest triumph of the free world
Soviet Empire collapsed
Soviet Union ceased to exist
and relatively peacefully
not perfectly
but amazingly peacefully
there were few wars
in the pyramid
Soviet Union
Yes, there was a very bloody war in former Yugoslavia
but still, you know, the cost
the human cost
for collapse of the evil empire
was insignificant
compared to what people expected
would be the outcome
and
in 1992
one of the most popular books
best-selling book was The End of History
by Francis Fukuyama
and I have to say I shared the same expectations
but the triumphal
continuation
of the history
of the free world
and liberal democracy
and the rest would be just us doing some great things
but never
to worry again about
threat to the free world
coming from dictators
and other, you know
that's what we expected in 1991-92
it's not what I expected
but no, no, no, no
I was terrified by the fact
that this is what was claimed
because I had thought
how is it that a country like the US
which has needed counterweights
in order for it to be like
you and I both have a Jewish component in our background
there's a weird way in which anti-Semitism
if it's too low
we stop being very Jewish
if it's too high we're in incredible threat
you have two separate
ethnic heritage
which would show you how vulnerable and precarious life can be
somehow
what terrified me
was the idea that we were going to take a bipolar system
which represented the Cold War
and suddenly remove
one part of it
without any plan as to how to manage this
but that's a good point
now, first of all, removing evil component
of this dichotomy was a good idea
I grew up on the Soviet Union
what was bad
is that it required a new plan
it did
and nobody wanted to talk about it
that's the weird part
now being a Monday morning
a quarterback
I know exactly what was wrong
actually I knew about it a few years ago
so in 1991-1992
it was America's role to start reconsidering
its
global participation
no Soviet Union, so what's the plan
and one of the most important things
was to address the reform of the United Nations
because the United Nations was built in 1945
as a successor of the failed League of Nations
to prevent an open war
open military conflict
between USSR and USA
between two superpowers
it was all about freezing conflicts
and it managed
there were conflicts but thanks God
it's been ridiculously successful
exactly in 1962 it came close
with the Caribbean crisis
but it was basically for a couple of weeks
there was no real threat
of World War 3
and global extermination
it's been amazingly quiet since 1945
yes, you look around the world
so the wars actually moved
from Europe to other continents
there was a Korean war
there was a Chinese Civil War
this is then
look, I hate to say it this way
Europe is one of the world's most
dangerous places
and we don't think about it that way
there is no stability that has been anomalous
Europe
that had wars for centuries
was pacified
so thanks to this United Nations
concept of
finding compromise to systems
they were fighting each other
but mostly proxy wars
around the world
that's why we had James Bond movies
and sometimes even James Bond cooperated
with KGB officers to fight global evil
so it's the
we knew how to live in this world
1991, you're right
Soviet Union has gone
so what's next?
it's the idea that evil disappears
it was dead wrong
evil can be buried for a while under the rubbles of Berlin Wall
but the moment we lose our vigilance
it sprouts out
so the United Nations
that was built to freeze conflicts
was not there
to solve problems
and we need to start looking for
solving problems
we need it, I believe
an organization that would be rather called League of Democracies
actually it's
late Senator McCain used it
but I have to say I used it separately
it's an organization
where the members
will not be just paying leapservice
to democracy
so America had to come up with a plan
like in 1946 rebuilding Europe
a global plan of spreading democracy
and freedom
but it's the
then
again, it's a human nature
it's very difficult to tell people
that recognize that for
nearly half a century there was an
existential threat
potential threat of the nuclear war
those who remember 1962 crisis
and Vietnam war
wow, it's all over
so why don't we just celebrate
why don't we get rich
why don't we just do other things
sometimes I think that
if the Soviet Union collapsed
a year later, probably Bush 41
could be reelected
because I think one of the reasons Clinton won
the elections is not just Ross Perot
which was an important factor
but the republicans lost their big card
so the cold war was over
so why do we need Bush
and an economy stupid
motto one the day
exactly
America was still there
it was the only superpower
but it lost its role
as the
stabilizing factor
because Clinton
1992, he won the elections
in 2001
he walked away
1992, America was basically in the position
to do whatever
make any suggestions
that others had no choice but to accept
in 2001
early, Al-Qaeda was ready to strike
but we missed
these years
and also something else happened in these eight years
Russia moved from a very fragile
feeble democracy
into the first
into the next
stage
that would be eventually dominated by KGB
in year 2000 Vladimir Putin
became Russian president
the fact is that in nine years
after the statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky
the founder of KGB
and removed from Lubanka Square
in less than nine years Vladimir Putin
became the president of Russia
H.G.B. Lieutenant Colonel
who immediately said that
the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical
catastrophe of the 20th century
who immediately
returned Soviet Anthem
to make a symbolic gesture
who proudly said that there were no former KGB officers
once KGB, always KGB
quote unquote
so that was already a warning sign
this was another confusion that I had
my model for Russia
is two separate things we Americans often don't understand
one, it's a barbell culture
it's got the highest of the high culture
and the lowest of the low
and two, because of this in some sense
there's a fractal nature to the Putin's
it's like Putin's all the way down
there's always a sort of a look
for strength
and leadership
of a kind of uncomfortable way
not just at the very top
but the uniqueness
of Putinism
of Putin's regime
was that it was not based on any ideology
traditionally Russia always
followed some sort of the grand idea
empire, communism
can I try one and then you tell me why it doesn't work
dehumiliation
no, absolutely
absolutely nonsense
they used it for
it was a propaganda shtick
you don't think that there was a need
to restore some kind of sense of identity
I remember people talking fondly
about Stalin
I thought it was very confusing
because in the last year of Yeltsin
they started just playing with his nostalgia
because KGB was playing a bigger and bigger role
going back to the early 90s in Russia
after Yeltsin shut down
Russian parliament in 1993
they had no theme with the Russian parliament
and I thought Yeltsin was right
because they were full of communists and nationalists
but he ruined just the balance
of power that was just building up in Russia
and it was again
since 1993 it was all power of executives
and the Russian constitution
that in theory
adopted in 1993 was a good document
gave enormous power
to the president
if he wanted to abuse it
it was just
on paper it looked good
but
it almost eliminated
the key elements
of checks and balances
of the control of the executive power
which is in Russia traditionally
was just dominant force
and in 1994
the first Chechen war already showed
that the country was moving in the wrong direction
and 1996 elections was already
it was free but not fair
and then
selecting his successor
which by itself is not a democratic process
selecting him, nominating him
Yeltsin came up with an Yeltsin family
not just immediate family
but family as the group of its advisors
closes oligarchs
they came up with a KGB Lieutenant Colonel
so it was more about
preserving the enormous wealth
that they concentrated at the time
the humiliation
was just for the general public
but it's
Russia and the Putin
the strength of Putin's regime is that
they don't care about ideology
Putin could become nationalist
populist, could be imperialist
at the end of the day he doesn't care about anything
he wants power and wealth
it's more like a mafia state
that's why I say that every country has its own mafia
in Russia mafia has its own country
so that's
it's something quite unique
and Putin believes in only power of money
and he just
discovered at the point quite early
in his presidency that
money can buy anyone
and that's the problem for the free world
losing Russia
also losing Soviet Union
as an existential enemy
the free world lost its sense of
danger
so it's oh now let's make deal
so who cares
we are invincible
well we keep looking for our new
Soviet Union
whether it's China
the environment Islamic terror
we're trying to find it
yes but the free world
you know I remember
it's few years ago
I spoke to one of my friends in New York
and we talked about
after my book was published winter is coming
and we talked about challenges to the free world
and I said
in 1948
Joseph Stalin wanted to take over
West Berlin
he announced a blockade
and Harry Truman said
hell we defend West Berlin
it was the biggest
decision that American president could make
and for 11 months
US and British planes
supplied West Berlin with everything
it needed to survive and Stalin
decided again
shooting this plane so he knew that
Harry Truman was not a man just to play games
exactly so and I said look
Harry Truman faced
I mean Joseph Stalin
and this is Russia today
not Putin Joseph Stalin
Russia today in 2015 is a pale shadow
of Stalin's
Soviet Union
military or economically
and you know what he said
quite sadly you know
sign and said yes but America today
is also pale shadow of America of Harry
this is the horrible truth which is that
in a weird way
Putin appears to be
relatively in my way of thinking
one of the most skilled players left
on the chess board
here I have to disagree
I have to defend the integrity of my game
so Putin is not a chess player
oh sorry sorry
he's an opportunist
no it's the
Putin doesn't create these opportunities
he uses them so he grabs them
okay let me say it differently
Putin's strengths
is a weakness of the free world
yes but KGB had
a tremendous amount of know-how
it was resident within that
yeah but know-how is fine but KGB
has enormous amount of cash now
Vladimir Putin controls more money
than any other individual in the history
richest human
when people say
oh how rich is Putin
Putin is mega rich
but it's not
the same kind of wealth
that Bill Gates
or Karl Slim or Bezos
or whoever because it all depends
on him staying in power
but when you look at the amount of money
Vladimir Putin can move
you probably talking about something
like one trillion dollars
one trillion dollars
you add Russian
you add Russian
Russian hard currency reserves
the fortunes
of some of the top Russian oligarchs
connected to Putin
he's skilled, he's ruthless
he's a single decision maker
and he has this level of control over resource
there's no equal to that
unless it's the Chinese
No, no, let's say he has more power
probably than Xi Jinping
relatively to the country
because Xi Jinping's resources
are just incompatible with Putin
China is much stronger
I think Xi Jinping
and Chinese communists are very happy
to see Putin creating these problems
because it helps them
to shift their attention
China is a strategic threat
if you're using chess language
Putin is more of a tactical threat
but right now
this is a real threat
because if your king is on the threat of being mated
you can't think about long term
consequence of the endgame
Alright, so let's hit another chess term
and then I'll pull the ripcord
if it doesn't work
there's a concept which not everyone knows
called zhuzhuang
where you are in a situation
where you prefer not to have to move
because anything you do
but you have to move
Why do we keep acting as if we're in zhuzhuang
Let me go back to what I said
a few moments ago
Putin's strength is our weakness
Putin is good at looking at opportunities
and then he strikes
he doesn't create them
but the moment he sees weakness
it's animal instinct, he goes for kill
so why Vladimir Putin is in Syria
because America walked away
because America created a vacuum there
so when you look at the global map
because the free world blinked
didn't want to interfere
and that's what we learned
I hope, actually I was wrong
had to learn from the man in service
if we see rising dictatorship
and dictatorship
that is
challenging
the very foundation of our world
and we know we have a choice
of confronting it early
or postponing the decision trying to appease the dictator
every day
every week, every month
every year of a delay
pushing the price up
this is what's very scary to me
about Tulsi Gabbard's candidacy
which is that she's pushing this concept
of regime change wars
and she's trying
after you
this is the moment you mentioned the name
so I almost jumped on my chair
I don't understand
the democrats will not allow
any climate change denier on stage
rightly so
how do they allow a genocide denier
on stage
she acts like
I don't know about the details
of your relations with Assad or Putin
but she's supporting the most brutal dictators
on the planet
what do you think she's doing?
I don't know what she's doing
and I'm not here in another business of analyzing
whether she's in a peril or not
I don't care
what is she saying
she's percentage here and there
she's on the stage
and she's not confronted
she's defending Bashar al-Assad
one of the worst
dictator who used chemical weapons
she's denying it
I didn't hear any democrat taking her
so I was like what the hell are you doing here
and again that's what Putin is
but Gary, what's going on in some sense
is just as you were saying
in 1991-92
it's the economy stupid
we were going to abandon
all of our opportunities
obligations, what have you
we're now not capable
of formulating an America
that makes sense as a continuation
of our previous stuff
it's America from 1946
to 1991
was a thing
it had certainly no policy that it followed
you had Harry Truman set up certain
rules and institutions
and then you had republicans, democrats
republicans following the plan
and it led to a victory in the Cold War
because the strength of democracy
it's a strategy
again using chess terms
because you can rely on continuity
you can change administrations
but you still have the plan
there could be some deviations
there could be just one way or another
somebody could be more aggressive
more defensive
but at the end of the day
we were trying to become captains of the same team
but going back to 1991-92
American foreign policy
became more like a pendulum
shifting from one side
to another based on who is
in the Oval Office
there's no Clinton, Bush, Obama
Trump
and the rest of the world
is watching America
and it's paralyzed in fear
you're looking at a car that's swerving from lane to lane
but people used to know
that America is there
Eisenhower
Kennedy
Nixon
Reagan, Carter, Bush
America was there
and all of a sudden
you can no longer rely on America
you have massive
vacuum holes
and there's no vacuum
You know that no millennials have any
intuition
of where our passion is coming
I'm saying
has broken in terms of
our collective understanding of ourselves
we are having the most
irrelevant, bizarre
non-fact based, non-theory based
conversations
like children
but you said non-fact based
that's one of the problems
that's what putins of this world want us to forget
history
so now you're talking about world war 2
and so who cares, it's not relevant
it is relevant
but now Putin is basically
conquering
not territories
but actually
conquering our minds by
conducting very successful hybridism
let's go to that
what is it that
the Soviet Union and then Russia
understands about the human mind
that the US
needs to understand ASAP
but cannot figure out how to teach its own people
I don't think that we can compare
Soviet propaganda and Putin's
machine
for simple reason, Soviet Union
had an ideology
I took your point
again
my mother
she's 82
she was born under Stalin in 1937
so she still lives in Moscow
she heard it all
Stalin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev
Andropov, Gorbachev
and
she's watching this television
and she keeps telling me that
it's much worse than ever
because
before we had some ideals
yeah, they were false ideals
but it was all about
bright future
every ideology has its future
it could be horrible idea
even like Nazism
but again, they try to sell you the image of the future
Putin doesn't care about the future
it's the Putin's ideology in Russia
it's more like a cult of death
it was surrounded by enemies
what's a cult of confusion
everything is confusing
and they discovered that
instead of selling an ideology
which is always vulnerable
because the moment I give you the idea
you can't tell what the ideas are
everything slips through your fingers
it's a quick silver
so it's in 2004-2005
they had to make a decision
how to fight Russian oppositional internet
just at the time where I was about to stop
my chess career
and as I tried to help Russian oppositional movement
your early 40s
yeah, I'm early 40s in 2004-2005
and they made
call it ingenious decision
based on KGB experience
instead of following Chinese model
firewall, clothes
make people star for information
traditional dictatorships
they said
exactly the opposite
instead of
closing every hole
so what about the flood
flooding this information
by just creating so much
information here and there
for people just to get lost
and you can have
proud newspaper, front page
one story that everyone must follow
9 o'clock news
or you can start dividing
this story into many
poisonous elements
and start spreading them in the true stories
this is now all through our country
is that coming from Russia?
yes, in 2005
what's the transmission mechanism?
2004-2005
I'm going to get super aggressive
because I want to get to this
they decided that they'll start
creating these fake websites
when I say fake websites, they're real websites
but they looked like very liberal websites
they talked about certain things
they could even criticize Putin
some of them you noticed
but they always carried a little bit of a piece of story here and there
you and I have been talking
very critically about
Trump and the Republican phenomena
inhabiting this landscape
part of the problem we've had
is that the Democratic Party
went kleptocratic in the center
and started pursuing
policies that started like, let's say
widening the genie coefficients
so that we had greater inequality
and we started experimenting
with our own American style of nonsense
so right now we have a situation
which let me give you my feelings
I've been a lifelong Democrat
I don't trust my party as far as I can throw them
I don't trust the New York Times, Washington Post
I don't trust Fox News and the Republicans obviously
because that's transparently wrong
there is no ground truth
there's no place to go
people are tuning into this podcast
and by the way, I'm going to force you to come back
to this podcast because we need more time
and right now we're mostly talking to millennials
and the millennials are hungry
because they have an idea of
we came in on this game
we have no idea what we missed
everything makes no sense
where can I find some concept
of overarching
continuity
to make sense of a world that is disintegrating
into wet toilet paper
let's finish this story
about
fake news and troll factories
that's what Putin created
that's what KGB created
and they recognize it's far more effective
let's say they have to deal with Gary Kaspar
on his followers
you can go after Gary saying
he's just an American agent
he's a bad guy
he's working for CIA, for Mossad, whatever
some people will believe
some say no
he sells drugs, he sells guns
many intelligent people say no
he was a great Soviet champion
для them, it's a different story
they managed to create
it's a fake debate
you have a whole page
that is totally designed
elsewhere but it comes to
it's on a social media
somebody says Gary Kaspar
is a bad guy and then somebody is coming
no, no, no, no, he's a great guy
but I'm not so sure
and then you have a whole
if it wasn't for his drinking problem
I wish he had paid his time
but the typical one was
Gary was the greatest champion
but unfortunately he got
the ego went to his head
you understand that some people
refer to me as the alt right
like as if I could possibly be the alt right
the level of nonsense
but the level of nonsense
because people again, there's no gravitas
for us to understand
what is right is this
what does ground zero
nobody's been kept aside
you keep a fire extinguisher
under glass in case of emergencies
there's no adult
that's ready to go when things get bad
they recognize that
the new social media
could offer them enormous opportunities
to spread this fake news
because there's one way to tell the truth
many ways to lie
typical story was
with MH17
the Malaysian boy
that was shot by Russian missile
and it's
they didn't care
to provide
one narrative
that could refute
the widespread conviction
what they did
they spread all sorts of news
and one day on Russian television
on two different channels
they had two competing stories
with experts, with diagrams
again, who cares
if it's a ten different lies
it's a needle in a haystack
and they always give you a haystack
in 2015
I said to Facebook
that your business model
is the honeypot for Russian bear
because it was so obvious
it was an ideal opportunity
so this is how to use it
choose to affect people's mind
with information that could be most
sensitive
this is a very strange thing
I know these guys in Silicon Valley
they're very smart in a very limited way
and they are so childlike
but they didn't understand
that Putin already had a machine
before he attacked America
with this fake news industry
so he already had 10 years
Russia, then Russian speaking minorities
in neighboring countries
then Europe
so attacking America was just a matter of time
and I don't think Putin would expect it
to be so successful because the way
they propaganda handled it
I think they expected Trump to lose elections narrowly
that was the expectation
and that's why Trump already repeated
the Russian narrative rigged elections
how many times Trump said rigged elections
this is the thing that you did
which was very interesting
you said all you need to know
to impeach Trump is one thing
which is how he handled Ukraine
now whether I agree with you or I don't agree with you
your point was look
it's very important not to get caught up
let's keep it super simple
so you can just stay on one point
is that fair representation of your point?
exactly
I think he had other
impeachable offenses
but if you want to win this battle
because right now
the moment you accuse
Trump of numerous crimes
that's I believe he committed
it will be very easy
for Trump's defenders
or Trump's defenders
to dilute
that has to do
that has to do with the corruption
in the democratic side
because you can see
that the New York Times and the Washington Post
are not behaving as honest actors
and it's very clear at the moment that they're not
you have this different problem
which is
I spent almost all my time criticizing
the left not the right
not because I think the right is okay
absolutely isn't
but because if the left continues to pursue
these petty
transparent
ridiculous
many propaganda operations
we've undercut our own credibility
in any place that can actually call this out
what I hate most is hypocrisy
and as there's now
in the next democratic debates
I want to hear one question
to every democratic hopeful on stage
with a simple yes or no
Will you authorize
a sale of little weapons to Ukraine
yes or no
because Trump is on trial
for that will you or not
I'm afraid most of them will say no
and that shows a hypocrisy
that says at the end of the day
Trump's foreign policy
just don't kill me for that
not so different from Obama's
Trump the motivation is different
but Obama retreated because of his beliefs
it's like an ideological retreat
Trump doing these things for profit
but unfortunately
the outcome
you don't believe that Trump is under direct control of Putin
or does it matter
I said for profit
no Trump is a Russian asset
I said it many times
whether he understands it or not it's another story
Trump is a Russian asset
I don't even have to know all the details
your point is that the incentive structures are sufficient
I grew up in the Soviet Union
and I just repeated
again
I met enough KGB colonels
and I know how these people look at you
so the way Putin looks at Trump
is the way KGB handler looks at his asset
he looks at Merkel
at Macron with a contempt
it's a contempt
because he believes he can buy anyone on this planet
unfortunately
they failed to prove him wrong
but the way he looks at Trump
the way he acts
it's this rice smile
Trump is an asset
he believes that Trump for some reasons will do whatever he wants
and by the way
when people say
how can you say that
if you understand that when the Democratic Party asserts
that
when somebody inside
of the traditional left of center
media or political apparatus
starts to assert that Donald Trump
is under the direct control
as opposed to the incentive control
at the end of the day
Trump is
you're not understanding my point
what I'm trying to say is
there's a problem right now
with
we can't form a sense making
we can't form a story
that enough of us can participate in
to start actually dealing with our real problems
we're just in free fall
and whether or not I sign on to everything that you say
about Trump or not
I know that if you and I have enough time
we can at least figure out what we agree on
what the theories are
we have enough common denominator
so that's as clear from our conversation
we may disagree on many things
but at the end of the day we know where we are
where we stand so our disagreements
would be more of a tactical not a strategic character
yes so
what I'm concerned about is that right now
we're a sitting duck because we're not actually
there are no adults that I can find
anywhere on the stage
because again it's the
America has to reinvent itself
America has to reconsider
what is America's role
and again it says you go back to the democratic debates
they're talking about things that
they might be very important again
I understand you should talk about healthcare
you should talk about other issues that are important
for America long term
but right now you have the foundation
of the republic is in jeopardy
you have Trump who is
I don't want to repeat it
he's Russian asset but it's
let's say he's not
it doesn't matter, your assertion is not
that he's a Russian asset in a standard way
but look at what he has been doing
if he were a Russian asset
what he could do differently
so this is
even he's famous
betrayal of Kurds
infamous betrayal of Kurds
so he spoke to Erdogan on October 6
on October 7
Putin's birthday he announced
greatest American retreat
and it's for next couple of days
he was celebrating this
the pictures of Americans camps
was food on the table
saying Americans were running away
because our great leader
keep pushing them out
so that's the
so another coincidence
I always say I believe in coincidences
but I also believe in KGB
and when it's every time
we talk about coincidence and Trump
it ends up with Russia
Gary why are you still alive
it's everything now has its price
so I try not to be
just an easy target
I don't believe this for a second
if he wants you gone he's guiding heavy a gun
thank you very much
so my wife will be very happy to hear that
come on you're grown up
we're having a grown up conversation
I know that
I say what I say
at the end of the day
I have a powerful voice
but if they won't be gone
they can do it
so it doesn't change anything in my behavior
yeah I noticed that
but by the way I just want to say
how much I admire that
again it's what it helps
I don't think you could do anything else
no but I have to do it
do what you must so be
that's what I learned as a kid
from Soviet dissidents
and again going back to this
it's not
Trump is a symptom
of society
how this great country lost its way
and that's why Trump is still there
so you and I have a mutual friend
in Peter Teal
were you very surprised that Peter backed Trump?
disappointed
but look he's a businessman
I understand why he did it
I think it's a wrong decision
it's bad for the country
so maybe good for his business
but from day one
when I heard about it
you know it's not
not just saying things now
from the first day of Trump's campaign
is one of the most vocal critics
by the way speaking about the media
one of the reasons Trump was there
is because
New York Times and Washington Post
and the CNN they liked him
he resuscitated their business model
not only business model
for 16 years
the democratic party has served
as the political branch of Clinton foundation
with one goal
to the president of the United States
in 2008 she lost to Obama
that had to be it
but they tried again
I mean Joe Biden would have trashed Trump
in 2016
so Hillary Clinton was the only chance for Trump
but they wanted Trump because they knew Trump
was the only person she could beat
she would have no chance against
the modern republic
so they wanted Trump
so that's why Trump got all this free publicity
in hundreds of millions
billions of dollars of free publicity
and they could have killed Trump
when he attacked John McCain
if the CNN of this world wanted to go after Trump
in summer 2015
they could have
they could have sank this ship
just before it left horrible
another question
Jeffrey Epstein died under bizarre circumstances
and the amount of follow on
on this story
the entire world wants to know
about the intelligence community
I don't see papers getting the denials
from intelligence communities
I don't see
any very significant attempt
to talk about whether or not
all you need is to get somebody to say
this person was never an asset
they were never under US
or foreign protection
what do we learn
when things that are supposed to happen
because they would sell papers
of interest to everybody and they're the natural thing to do
they simply don't happen in full view of the world
look it's the
do you have an explanation
do you think this is interesting or not interesting
let's you know
it always happened
before
but we didn't have the same knowledge
so the only difference is now
people died in
people of that type
they used to die in prisons
under suspicious circumstances
for decades if not for centuries
but only now we know about it
but at the end of the day
who cares
because it can look public
his murder, suicide or whatever
doesn't interest me that much
that's not the issue
the issue is that it's like dark matter
you don't detect it directly
you see all sorts of other things behaving
bizarrely around it
and so you know that there's something there
look we know it's something there
because again it's the while
again our attention span is so short
that you can move from just one thing to another
so it's just
I wonder how many
how many listeners you will immediately pick up
who's Jeff Raibstein
there were so many scandals and that's what Trump knows
he knows that if he's tried
for one treason thing
it's bad
but if he's tried for 10
better
let me just tell you we have an amazing audience
the people who are attracted to this show
but it's amazing how many things people forget
because you have a new scandal
no I understand that but what I'm trying to say
is that the people who are tuning into this
are people who are
they're sick
of being in the matrix
they want out and that's why it's called the portal
because they're people looking for an exit from the confusion
so I'm going to tell you this
you are coming back to the show
because I am so not finished with you
it's been a fantastic
when you say it's not finished you know
you and I
you and I have unfinished business
Keri Kasparov
is there anything you want to talk about RDI
before I let you go
and send you along your way
after Trump election
with some of my friends
I called them
refugees from the Wall Street Journal
like Brett Stevens, Max Booth, Mark LaSwell
so those who just couldn't
couldn't stand Trump
and a few moderate Democrats
in New York so we got together
and we decided to come up with an organization
we called it Renew Democracy Initiative
so RDI.org now
You don't invite me?
I'm delighted you know just this
and the idea was that you know
I use by my experience
that democracy is under
it's
it's a great danger
it's a great threat when it's attack from both sides
from radicals
people sometimes they think that
he never won elections in Germany
he never won elections you know
it's not a majority the best result of Nazi Party
in 1932 was just over 37%
but at the same elections
communists made nearly 16
which means half of the German population
rejected democracy
so what we saw
is that you know it's a Trump's brutal assault
on liberal democracy
and our freedoms
but at the same time we saw the growing power
of the far left so called progressive
wink attacking the very foundation
of the free market
and these two forces they are just you know
threatening to dilute the very foundation
of American society
This is why it's important to get rid of the
kleptocracy in our center
because you need a center that is intellectually healthy
I've been shouting for years
for more than a decade
too big to fail
it's against the very principle of capitalism
I said it
many times once
it was
at the Kato Institute
that's the Milton Friedman award
for let's say Baltorovich in 2013
I did a keynote and I said that it's
if a small business in North Carolina
is bankrupt
it goes belly up
so much Goldman Sachs
the whole idea that you know
you can use taxpayers money
supporting big corporations
because they are indispensable
but they grew up even bigger now
should Harvard
should Harvard be allowed to fail
should for example the Democratic Party
be allowed to fail financially
as you know Dona Brasil is asserting
that Hillary Clinton was essentially the only thing
propping up the Democratic Party
I don't know this is the again
for people who say capitalism failed us
I say if capitalism hasn't failed us
we fail capitalism
we are violating fundamental principles of free market
which is you know you bankrupt
you fail
that was the whole idea
and right now it's all about your connections
to the government
to those who have money and power
and you can see that money and power
they are just getting closer and closer
it's almost you know
so which organizations are you putting
what are you putting your faith in
do you think Soros is a positive force
Soros is a partisan force
that's a problem
the idea was RDI was to bring people from both sides
so we have a board now that brings people from both sides
2 former senators
Heidi Heidkamp
and Bob Kerr from Nebraska
both Democrats, Blue Dog Democrats
the idea is this and we are working with donors
many of them are just
former Republicans
looking for building something
in the center
it's the problem of the United States
but also look at the United Kingdom
look at Europe
the problem is that radicals on both sides
they are gaining more power by dragging people out of the center
it's what I call the phenomenon of Spanish Civil War
when you have
communism on one side
and fascism on the other side
and somebody who wants to stay in the middle
no, no rule
it's like an A-frame roof
and the A-frame is getting more and more peaked
so the idea is that only the most agile people
can dance on the top
the two-part system in America
always served as the shield
against radicalism
if one party went too far
right
so right now you have elections
potentially elections
what do you have two radicals
and there is so much room in the center now
do you have anyone that you like on the Democratic side?
look again
it's the way I look at these elections
is that it's all about defeating Donald Trump
so you have to make these elections about Donald Trump
you have to look for the best candidate
who can win against Trump
just that one thing
who would that be the moment
statistically, Amy Klobuchar
because she is exactly from the area
where the elections will be decided
it's Midwest, she won a Minnesota 2018
re-election
by carrying many districts that Trump won
in 2016
again, it's about winning elections
what do you think about if we get these candidates away
from this typical CNN
MSNBC
NPR group
I used to be a chess player
but I always
knew that
it's not just about winning, it's about making the difference
but this election is about
winning and saving the republic
if Trump is re-elected
the consequences cannot be
I can't even predict them
Nader will go bust
Trump will withdraw from Europe
and he will destroy every foundation
well, the game theory of him not worrying about re-election
we have no idea what that looks like
by the way, you have to know that a lot of my
my audience is split
a lot of them put up with my anti-Trump stuff
because they believe that I'm at least
trying in good faith
I don't always understand
how they look at this and they say that this is normal
I don't get it
it's just the Trump's ability to corrupt others
I mean, look at attorney general
attorney general now
it sounds like ideological warrior
when attorney general
uses words left or right
he talked about left, violating the law
that's it
Trump succeeded already
in three years
by destroying
what was left of American image abroad
and also in the country
we don't have a shared idea
of where we are, what's going on
and what's relevant, we just don't
that's why it's about restoration
and that's why you need to make sure that Trump is defeated
and this election
and you cannot have a candidate that coming up
with a big idea
but it can't only be
defeating Trump
if the left of the United States
does not stop
with its propagandistic bullshit
there's no way
we're going to be able to put things back together
you cannot come up with a big socialist ideas
because that's Trump's only hope
he's praying
for Sanders war
but it's also a question of denying things
if somebody shoots up
a parade route
or something
and shouts Allah Huakbar at the end
there will be a democratic attempt
to not talk about what the basis is
let's go back to the question
I want to hear what they say about foreign policy
because Trump
is on trial now
he will be impeached in the house
for his crimes
foreign policy related crimes
and they don't talk about it
they talk about something else
they want the country to believe that Trump was guilty
but we don't hear
what would they do differently
but if the democrats, for example
pursue things where Trump actually isn't guilty
so that he's both guilty
and not guilty of things that he's accused of
any attempt to prosecute things
frivolously
which we will see
is going to result in this loss of trust
we have to do something about trust
and if we don't have some
trust is important
