but right now you have the foundation
of the republic is in jeopardy
you have Trump who is
I don't want to repeat it
he's Russian asset but it's
let's say he's not
it doesn't matter, your assertion is not
that he's a Russian asset in a standard way
but look at what he has been doing
if he were a Russian asset
what he could do differently
so this is
even he's famous
betrayal of Kurds
infamous betrayal of Kurds
so he spoke to Erdogan on October 6
on October 7
Putin's birthday he announced
greatest American retreat
and it's for next couple of days
he was celebrating this
the pictures of Americans camps
was food on the table
saying Americans were running away
because our great leader
keep pushing them out
so that's the
so another coincidence
I always say I believe in coincidences
but I also believe in KGB
and when it's every time
we talk about coincidence and Trump
it ends up with Russia
Gary why are you still alive
it's everything now has its price
so I try not to be
just an easy target
I don't believe this for a second
if he wants you gone he's guiding heavy a gun
thank you very much
so my wife will be very happy to hear that
come on you're grown up
we're having a grown up conversation
I know that
I say what I say
at the end of the day
I have a powerful voice
but if they won't be gone
they can do it
so it doesn't change anything in my behavior
yeah I noticed that
but by the way I just want to say
how much I admire that
again it's what it helps
I don't think you could do anything else
no but I have to do it
do what you must so be
that's what I learned as a kid
from Soviet dissidents
and again going back to this
it's not
Trump is a symptom
of society
how this great country lost its way
and that's why Trump is still there
so you and I have a mutual friend
in Peter Teal
were you very surprised that Peter backed Trump?
disappointed
but look he's a businessman
I understand why he did it
I think it's a wrong decision
it's bad for the country
so maybe good for his business
but from day one
when I heard about it
you know it's not
not just saying things now
from the first day of Trump's campaign
is one of the most vocal critics
by the way speaking about the media
one of the reasons Trump was there
is because
New York Times and Washington Post
and the CNN they liked him
he resuscitated their business model
not only business model
for 16 years
the democratic party has served
as the political branch of Clinton foundation
with one goal
to the president of the United States
in 2008 she lost to Obama
that had to be it
but they tried again
I mean Joe Biden would have trashed Trump
in 2016
so Hillary Clinton was the only chance for Trump
but they wanted Trump because they knew Trump
was the only person she could beat
she would have no chance against
the modern republic
so they wanted Trump
so that's why Trump got all this free publicity
in hundreds of millions
billions of dollars of free publicity
and they could have killed Trump
when he attacked John McCain
if the CNN of this world wanted to go after Trump
in summer 2015
they could have
they could have sank this ship
just before it left horrible
another question
Jeffrey Epstein died under bizarre circumstances
and the amount of follow on
on this story
the entire world wants to know
about the intelligence community
I don't see papers getting the denials
from intelligence communities
I don't see
any very significant attempt
to talk about whether or not
all you need is to get somebody to say
this person was never an asset
they were never under US
or foreign protection
what do we learn
when things that are supposed to happen
because they would sell papers
of interest to everybody and they're the natural thing to do
they simply don't happen in full view of the world
look it's the
do you have an explanation
do you think this is interesting or not interesting
let's you know
it always happened
before
but we didn't have the same knowledge
so the only difference is now
people died in
people of that type
they used to die in prisons
under suspicious circumstances
for decades if not for centuries
but only now we know about it
but at the end of the day
who cares
because it can look public
his murder, suicide or whatever
doesn't interest me that much
that's not the issue
the issue is that it's like dark matter
you don't detect it directly
you see all sorts of other things behaving
bizarrely around it
and so you know that there's something there
look we know it's something there
because again it's the while
again our attention span is so short
that you can move from just one thing to another
so it's just
I wonder how many
how many listeners you will immediately pick up
who's Jeff Raibstein
there were so many scandals and that's what Trump knows
he knows that if he's tried
for one treason thing
it's bad
but if he's tried for 10
better
let me just tell you we have an amazing audience
the people who are attracted to this show
but it's amazing how many things people forget
because you have a new scandal
no I understand that but what I'm trying to say
is that the people who are tuning into this
are people who are
they're sick
of being in the matrix
they want out and that's why it's called the portal
because they're people looking for an exit from the confusion
so I'm going to tell you this
you are coming back to the show
because I am so not finished with you
it's been a fantastic
when you say it's not finished you know
you and I
you and I have unfinished business
Keri Kasparov
is there anything you want to talk about RDI
before I let you go
and send you along your way
after Trump election
with some of my friends
I called them
refugees from the Wall Street Journal
like Brett Stevens, Max Booth, Mark LaSwell
so those who just couldn't
