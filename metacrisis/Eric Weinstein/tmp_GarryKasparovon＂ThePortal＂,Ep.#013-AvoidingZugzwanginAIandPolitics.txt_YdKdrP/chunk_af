again 10 to the 46 power
number of legal moves
but because they make few mistakes
so they will be closer to perfection than humans
whether it's much close
or just close it doesn't matter
so they will be always ahead
so same with every other game
so all you need is to provide machine
with the rules and machines will start operating
just on their own
by creating their data
though I have to say that
today alpha 0 is still quite an exception
most of the machines today 99%
if not 99.9%
they are doing not transformation
but optimization
they are still operating with human generated data
but the future
no doubt it's for alpha 0 type computers
they will be
it's like a computer
with AI algorithms
and
they will require
some form of human guidance
it's like I always call this
the future computer experts
shepherds
so they will be nudging the flocks
of intelligent algorithms
one or another
but they will still need to be nudged
so it's
moving from one system to another
it's one close system to another close system
will require human guidance
what is very important for us to recognize
is that our role
percentage wise
is shrinking
but it doesn't mean that we become
expendable
so actually I think
we could become even more important
in this human machine collaboration
because we will be deciding
how this massive brute force
will be moved
right or left
or whatever up and down
if I'm honest about that
which you just said
that in the short term
I think we become more important
because the least interesting things
are taken over by the computers
and then if we're smart
we invest in what it is that we do best
which is often this act of
brilliance induction
opening a closed system
into a larger one
which is temporarily opening it up
and that's exciting
however I do feel
that we can
win for humanity
you find short term to be
well
I worry that this is on the order of decades
not centuries
for you and me it's probably not a very short term
yes
that's why I ask
why do we go too far
so this is again
the strength of humanity was always
to respond to the challenges
that we are here now
I don't want us to spend time
I would say
waste our time debating
what can
or may
may happen, may not happen
30, 40, 50 years from now
we have challenges that we should address
right now and
I think that it's time for us
to understand how we can
maximize the
benefits out of human machine
collaboration
so I had a very funny interaction preparing
for my interview with you today
which is that I spoke to two brilliant
young women
one of whom just released
25,000 new
stock photos of people who don't exist
generated by her AI
she's a PhD from Berkeley
the other of which is a brilliant musician
but arguably also one of the world's most
stunningly beautiful women
a supermodel
and I noticed that the ELO system
that you use for chess
can be used in any situation where
if you asked who would people
find more beautiful person A
or person B and then you have a prediction
so you could use an ELO system
and I asked my friend the supermodel
our name is Charlotte Kempmull
would you be willing
to subject yourself to
a Kasparov versus
the machine type
competition where my other friend will attempt
to generate photographs
that are even more beautiful
than any human being who has ever been
and we could try to figure out
what the ELO rating is
for simply feminine beauty
now that's a very different thing
than a computational problem
on the surface
it may be a computational problem
under the hood
but what happened when I started looking through
the friend's catalogue
of stock photos
is that I could see that you could very easily fall in love
with the images that she generated
even though they correspond to no human being
they were filled with emotion
grace
whatever it is that you associate most
with being human and yet she knew
exactly how they'd been generated
from her neural nets
that's pretty disturbing in some ways
would you not say so?
look
you're talking about images
still images
now
just for proper relations you need more than still images
well that's true but the idea
she's able to animate a lot of these
first of all into video
that becomes interesting
the moment you start animating
and then a couple of our friends
Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan
have put so many hours of data
of their voice into the world
that we can now generate their voice
so that they can't tell the difference between what they've said
and what the machines
so we're starting to get to the point
we also have programs that write sports stories
simply from the statistics
that come off the games
in a credible fashion
that's the data
you know what's here
is that we've associated various things
with our humanity
and I think your point about chess
which I just think is great
is don't make the mistake
of holding those associations
too tightly because the machines will let you know
that some of this
is not having to do with being human at all
yes
the decision making process
is not just
human prerogative forever
we used to think that
machines could do all sorts of work
but not to
challenge our cognitive skills
at the end of the day
what's the difference
machines could
help us
in just making progress
whether it's
in the field
of physical exercises
or mental exercises
though again
if you look at the statistics
I think it's the
