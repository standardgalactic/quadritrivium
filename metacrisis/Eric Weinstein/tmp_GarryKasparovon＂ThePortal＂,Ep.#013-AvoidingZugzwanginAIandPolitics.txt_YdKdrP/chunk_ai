could be reelected
because I think one of the reasons Clinton won
the elections is not just Ross Perot
which was an important factor
but the republicans lost their big card
so the cold war was over
so why do we need Bush
and an economy stupid
motto one the day
exactly
America was still there
it was the only superpower
but it lost its role
as the
stabilizing factor
because Clinton
1992, he won the elections
in 2001
he walked away
1992, America was basically in the position
to do whatever
make any suggestions
that others had no choice but to accept
in 2001
early, Al-Qaeda was ready to strike
but we missed
these years
and also something else happened in these eight years
Russia moved from a very fragile
feeble democracy
into the first
into the next
stage
that would be eventually dominated by KGB
in year 2000 Vladimir Putin
became Russian president
the fact is that in nine years
after the statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky
the founder of KGB
and removed from Lubanka Square
in less than nine years Vladimir Putin
became the president of Russia
H.G.B. Lieutenant Colonel
who immediately said that
the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical
catastrophe of the 20th century
who immediately
returned Soviet Anthem
to make a symbolic gesture
who proudly said that there were no former KGB officers
once KGB, always KGB
quote unquote
so that was already a warning sign
this was another confusion that I had
my model for Russia
is two separate things we Americans often don't understand
one, it's a barbell culture
it's got the highest of the high culture
and the lowest of the low
and two, because of this in some sense
there's a fractal nature to the Putin's
it's like Putin's all the way down
there's always a sort of a look
for strength
and leadership
of a kind of uncomfortable way
not just at the very top
but the uniqueness
of Putinism
of Putin's regime
was that it was not based on any ideology
traditionally Russia always
followed some sort of the grand idea
empire, communism
can I try one and then you tell me why it doesn't work
dehumiliation
no, absolutely
absolutely nonsense
they used it for
it was a propaganda shtick
you don't think that there was a need
to restore some kind of sense of identity
I remember people talking fondly
about Stalin
I thought it was very confusing
because in the last year of Yeltsin
they started just playing with his nostalgia
because KGB was playing a bigger and bigger role
going back to the early 90s in Russia
after Yeltsin shut down
Russian parliament in 1993
they had no theme with the Russian parliament
and I thought Yeltsin was right
because they were full of communists and nationalists
but he ruined just the balance
of power that was just building up in Russia
and it was again
since 1993 it was all power of executives
and the Russian constitution
that in theory
adopted in 1993 was a good document
gave enormous power
to the president
if he wanted to abuse it
it was just
on paper it looked good
but
it almost eliminated
the key elements
of checks and balances
of the control of the executive power
which is in Russia traditionally
was just dominant force
and in 1994
the first Chechen war already showed
that the country was moving in the wrong direction
and 1996 elections was already
it was free but not fair
and then
selecting his successor
which by itself is not a democratic process
selecting him, nominating him
Yeltsin came up with an Yeltsin family
not just immediate family
but family as the group of its advisors
closes oligarchs
they came up with a KGB Lieutenant Colonel
so it was more about
preserving the enormous wealth
that they concentrated at the time
the humiliation
was just for the general public
but it's
Russia and the Putin
the strength of Putin's regime is that
they don't care about ideology
Putin could become nationalist
populist, could be imperialist
at the end of the day he doesn't care about anything
he wants power and wealth
it's more like a mafia state
that's why I say that every country has its own mafia
in Russia mafia has its own country
so that's
it's something quite unique
and Putin believes in only power of money
and he just
discovered at the point quite early
in his presidency that
money can buy anyone
and that's the problem for the free world
losing Russia
also losing Soviet Union
as an existential enemy
the free world lost its sense of
danger
so it's oh now let's make deal
so who cares
we are invincible
well we keep looking for our new
Soviet Union
whether it's China
the environment Islamic terror
we're trying to find it
yes but the free world
you know I remember
it's few years ago
I spoke to one of my friends in New York
and we talked about
after my book was published winter is coming
and we talked about challenges to the free world
and I said
in 1948
Joseph Stalin wanted to take over
West Berlin
he announced a blockade
and Harry Truman said
hell we defend West Berlin
it was the biggest
decision that American president could make
and for 11 months
US and British planes
supplied West Berlin with everything
it needed to survive and Stalin
decided again
shooting this plane so he knew that
Harry Truman was not a man just to play games
exactly so and I said look
Harry Truman faced
I mean Joseph Stalin
and this is Russia today
not Putin Joseph Stalin
Russia today in 2015 is a pale shadow
of Stalin's
Soviet Union
military or economically
and you know what he said
quite sadly you know
sign and said yes but America today
is also pale shadow of America of Harry
