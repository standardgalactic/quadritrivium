the McKinsey's report
of 2016 US job market
showed that
it's the only 4%
of working activities
required medium
human creativity
4%
so it means that
for over decades
we have been training people to work like machines
and now we are shocked
that many of these jobs
they are just you know they do
this is like zombie jobs
they are already dead they just don't know
every repetitive job has that characteristic
repetitive jobs does not
necessarily
it's a physical one
you can have repetitive jobs
radiology is the easy one
intellectually
and when people say
oh yeah but many of these jobs
they are just in grave danger
but you know
thank you for mentioning radiology
yes
we know that human machine collaboration
shows better results
than either one individual
so that means
you will have some experts
and from my experience
you know in chess in combination of human plus machines
you don't need
the strongest minds
so the most talented players
working with machine but someone who knows
enough to give machines
so it's like
it's a to guide machine not interference machine
superior knowledge so that's why you may not need
a top professor but maybe
an assistant professor maybe even experienced
nurse to work with his machine
oh but
I hear time and again
thousands of jobs
you know they will be at grave risk
maybe they will be lost and it's the well-paid jobs
yes but what is the
what is the other side of this
of this coin
the jobs will be lost but the cost
goes down more people
could have access to that and when you look at the
number of lives that can be saved
in this country or especially
in the third world countries
developing countries so
then you know all of a sudden you understand that
it's while certain groups of people could be in danger
because their computation
and machines they bringing
you know
havoc in our professional routine
but as a humanity
we always win
but isn't it weird how many of us are seeking drudgery
that we wish
like you watch what happens when you liberate people
and you find that they go back to these games on their computers
that they play repetitively
you know that there's a way in which humans
we had always thought we wanted to be liberated
to do creativity but there's something terrifying about creativity
and many of us
actually seek repetitive
activity which anesthetizes
us and arguably
we're happiest
when we start behaving in a way
that is machine like
but again it brings us back to us
bring us back to human
because you know it's the
instead of talking about killer robots
terminators, matrix and other
horrors produced by Hollywood
so that's your neighbors here
so brainwashing
generations of
pain of attention to Boston Dynamics
yeah
it's
it's quite primitive
but why don't we talk about
you know about humans
using modern technology
to harm other humans because humans
still have monopoly for evil
and I think it's far more important
to understand how this modern technology
that has been designed
in theory to make our lives better
have been
effectively used to undermine
the very foundation of the free world
so what I
it's a great opportunity to transition
because if there's anything that I'm more interested in
than talking about computers
and poetry and all of these things
it's this bizarre moment that we find ourselves
in the free world
where I've never seen anything like this
in my life it appears
that there are almost no adults left in the system
it appears to me that there's almost no
institution that really cares about ground
truth and it appears to me
that we are right now in the process
of sort of
abandoning everything we've built up
for the most trivial of reasons
and I don't
know whether you subscribe
to this but the transformation of our
country intellectually to me
since slightly before the election of Donald
Trump till the present moment has been
the most unexpected
singularity
in terms of the ability to hold conversations
to analyze
what it is that we in fact hold
in common
our sense making apparatus appears to have been broken down
and a large number of people don't even seem
to be aware of this and
I don't know
how to explain how many different
clusters of beliefs
have now cropped up which appeared to be
incapable of communicating with each other
are you seeing the same thing?
yes
and I've been worrying about it for quite a while
so I wrote the book
winter is coming
just you know before the presidential elections
in 2016
and unfortunately
this warning
nobody understood it?
nobody wanted to hear this because it seemed
that is just like a pink
so far away
the book didn't mention Trump or Syria but you could read
that
because I really talked about Putin
and about his threat
to the free world
that it was just a matter of time
before the techniques
that have been developed in Russia and tested
in neighboring
countries and in other European countries
that these techniques
would be used
to undermine American democracy
and also I talked about
the growing vacuum in the world
that was a result of
the free world led by the United States
to depart from its leadership role
after the end of the Cold War
so it's easy to say
everything is about Donald Trump
but when you look at the Donald Trump phenomena
it has roots
it's a symptom
somehow Trump demonstrated
that the system was already so weak
that it could have
persons so unqualified
to win elections
by the rules
yes with foreign interference
with other things
the adaptive landscape
if you want to take the evolutionary metaphor
was created and then suddenly
there was a creature that inhabited
absolutely
before we go to Trump we should understand
why the system was so weak enough
susceptible
