with few extra editions
in Italy and in France
in the next couple of hundred years.
That's European chess.
That's international chess.
Got it.
But there is also Chinese chess.
Sure.
There is Thai chess.
And some variation of Thai chess.
That is, by the way,
closest to original Arab version,
so that's a very slow version of the game.
And there is a totally separate game
called Shogi,
Japanese chess,
by far the most popular game in Japan,
far more popular than Go.
OK.
So, and the way this Japanese chess
is played,
it probably reflects the way,
you know, the military operations
have been conducted over centuries there.
One of the key elements there is that
you always can bring a piece
that you took from your opponent back
with a parachute move.
Oh, really?
And most of the pieces,
they just move fast.
And straight.
So there's this,
the game doesn't have an end game,
the way we have it in chess.
It's all about attacking the king.
It's like a slow-motion game,
but then it's, the moment,
it's the both sides,
they meet each other,
that'll field.
It's like a samurai,
samurai, just it's bloodshed.
OK.
So there's like a metaphoric aspect
to which kind of chess we play.
Exactly, exactly.
No, but you said exactly.
In the Western European,
Eurocentric world,
chess has been viewed for centuries
as a nexus of human intelligence.
So it's saying,
oh, he or she played chess.
Wow,
because it was like a mystery.
It's not surprising that Alfred Binet,
the father of IQ test,
so at the end of the 19th century,
he was fascinated by the way
the chess player's mind was working.
So he believed that if he could study
the minds of the chess player,
the brains of the chess players,
he could reveal the ultimate secrets
of human intelligence.
It's very interesting.
By the way, it's not true.
It's very flattering for me to say that,
but that's the greatest minds
who always looked at chess
as sort of an open test.
Have you always been as self-critical
as you're being right now?
I'm self-critical.
I'm objective.
It's the aptitude for playing chess.
It's nothing else than aptitude for playing chess.
It's like your capital.
You have intellectual capital.
So you can invest it wisely.
You can invest it poorly.
I like the idea that even IQ, of course,
is not intelligence.
It's a particular measure of a something.
I don't know if you happen to know him,
but I went to graduate school in the same year
as a guy named Noam Elkes, who is...
He's the Israeli chess composer.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Just because I had a book, you know,
of the best Israeli chess studies.
And that's why I recognize him.
Yeah, but he was like the youngest
full professor at Harvard.
It's for him.
It was a hobby.
Some of the great studies.
But he comments on the fact
that he can only achieve
the level of chess master,
even though he's a grandmaster
in problem solving and composing.
And so even there,
there's something very mysterious,
because this is sort of like a
John von Neumann-like level of intelligence.
And he's commenting on the fact
that he's merely a chess master.
And so I found that to be quite shocking
and surprising,
because I know how amazing Noam is.
Look, it's not...
It's not...
Yeah, but absolutely.
Because it's also about competition.
You have to compete.
I mean, his great mind feels probably
more at home by composing.
He's just in his comfort of his study.
He can think about it.
So he can...
There's no time pressure.
There's no opponent just across the board.
No intimidation.
Exactly.
So getting back to brilliancies,
which I don't want you to avoid.
Okay, no, no.
I'm not going to avoid it,
because I have a straightforward answer.
Do you want to say what a brilliancy is
in your own language so that you don't...
No, it's not...
Before we move to my definition of brilliancy.
Sure.
Yes, I think the answer is no.
Straightforward no.
Machines cannot do it for a simple reason.
Because you're talking about brilliancy
and about creativity.
Those are things that, you know,
versus brute force.
Right.
The way machines operate,
they have been operating ever since
and they will be operating
in a different period of time.
It's based on odds.
They know odds.
They know patterns.
They can operate within this like a known universe.
Something that they know within the rules
that they...
Either they have been told about these rules
or the information that they have been provided for them.
But they are always looking for the best move.
So brilliancy based on creativity
and it means that, yes, I can play a very risky,
adventurous game.
Maybe it could be a brilliant game.
Maybe it could be a failure.
You have to accept the chance,
sometimes significant chance of failure
to create a masterpiece.
Машинки не могут оперировать
в этом продукте.
Вы не знают, как указать концепцию
на мастерпище?
Ну, мастерпище
это что-то, что-то, что-то, что-то, что-то.
То есть, это все-таки субъективно?
Да, это все-таки субъективно.
Потому что, ты знаешь,
некоторые люди, ты знаешь,
это о том, что есть субъективно.
Да.
Нет, некоторые игры,
люди говорят,
«Вау, это невероятно!»
Главное, что эти игры
просто, ты знаешь,
include some kind of sacrifices.
Потому что люди всегда
enjoy seeing that the spirit
triumphs over material.
But when you sacrifice pieces,
you know, here and there,
right, left and center,
and eventually you meet opponent's king,
that's the most popular
concept of masterpiece.
But you can have a very slow motion,
positional masterpiece,
you know, by just adding,
you know, just advantage,
micro-advantage after one,
after another,
and strangling your opponent.
