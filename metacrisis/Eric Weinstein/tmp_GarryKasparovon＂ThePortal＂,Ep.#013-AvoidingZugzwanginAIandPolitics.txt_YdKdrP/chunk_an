couldn't stand Trump
and a few moderate Democrats
in New York so we got together
and we decided to come up with an organization
we called it Renew Democracy Initiative
so RDI.org now
You don't invite me?
I'm delighted you know just this
and the idea was that you know
I use by my experience
that democracy is under
it's
it's a great danger
it's a great threat when it's attack from both sides
from radicals
people sometimes they think that
he never won elections in Germany
he never won elections you know
it's not a majority the best result of Nazi Party
in 1932 was just over 37%
but at the same elections
communists made nearly 16
which means half of the German population
rejected democracy
so what we saw
is that you know it's a Trump's brutal assault
on liberal democracy
and our freedoms
but at the same time we saw the growing power
of the far left so called progressive
wink attacking the very foundation
of the free market
and these two forces they are just you know
threatening to dilute the very foundation
of American society
This is why it's important to get rid of the
kleptocracy in our center
because you need a center that is intellectually healthy
I've been shouting for years
for more than a decade
too big to fail
it's against the very principle of capitalism
I said it
many times once
it was
at the Kato Institute
that's the Milton Friedman award
for let's say Baltorovich in 2013
I did a keynote and I said that it's
if a small business in North Carolina
is bankrupt
it goes belly up
so much Goldman Sachs
the whole idea that you know
you can use taxpayers money
supporting big corporations
because they are indispensable
but they grew up even bigger now
should Harvard
should Harvard be allowed to fail
should for example the Democratic Party
be allowed to fail financially
as you know Dona Brasil is asserting
that Hillary Clinton was essentially the only thing
propping up the Democratic Party
I don't know this is the again
for people who say capitalism failed us
I say if capitalism hasn't failed us
we fail capitalism
we are violating fundamental principles of free market
which is you know you bankrupt
you fail
that was the whole idea
and right now it's all about your connections
to the government
to those who have money and power
and you can see that money and power
they are just getting closer and closer
it's almost you know
so which organizations are you putting
what are you putting your faith in
do you think Soros is a positive force
Soros is a partisan force
that's a problem
the idea was RDI was to bring people from both sides
so we have a board now that brings people from both sides
2 former senators
Heidi Heidkamp
and Bob Kerr from Nebraska
both Democrats, Blue Dog Democrats
the idea is this and we are working with donors
many of them are just
former Republicans
looking for building something
in the center
it's the problem of the United States
but also look at the United Kingdom
look at Europe
the problem is that radicals on both sides
they are gaining more power by dragging people out of the center
it's what I call the phenomenon of Spanish Civil War
when you have
communism on one side
and fascism on the other side
and somebody who wants to stay in the middle
no, no rule
it's like an A-frame roof
and the A-frame is getting more and more peaked
so the idea is that only the most agile people
can dance on the top
the two-part system in America
always served as the shield
against radicalism
if one party went too far
right
so right now you have elections
potentially elections
what do you have two radicals
and there is so much room in the center now
do you have anyone that you like on the Democratic side?
look again
it's the way I look at these elections
is that it's all about defeating Donald Trump
so you have to make these elections about Donald Trump
you have to look for the best candidate
who can win against Trump
just that one thing
who would that be the moment
statistically, Amy Klobuchar
because she is exactly from the area
where the elections will be decided
it's Midwest, she won a Minnesota 2018
re-election
by carrying many districts that Trump won
in 2016
again, it's about winning elections
what do you think about if we get these candidates away
from this typical CNN
MSNBC
NPR group
I used to be a chess player
but I always
knew that
it's not just about winning, it's about making the difference
but this election is about
winning and saving the republic
if Trump is re-elected
the consequences cannot be
I can't even predict them
Nader will go bust
Trump will withdraw from Europe
and he will destroy every foundation
well, the game theory of him not worrying about re-election
we have no idea what that looks like
by the way, you have to know that a lot of my
my audience is split
a lot of them put up with my anti-Trump stuff
because they believe that I'm at least
trying in good faith
I don't always understand
how they look at this and they say that this is normal
I don't get it
it's just the Trump's ability to corrupt others
I mean, look at attorney general
attorney general now
it sounds like ideological warrior
when attorney general
uses words left or right
he talked about left, violating the law
that's it
Trump succeeded already
in three years
by destroying
what was left of American image abroad
and also in the country
we don't have a shared idea
of where we are, what's going on
and what's relevant, we just don't
that's why it's about restoration
and that's why you need to make sure that Trump is defeated
and this election
and you cannot have a candidate that coming up
with a big idea
but it can't only be
defeating Trump
if the left of the United States
does not stop
with its propagandistic bullshit
there's no way
we're going to be able to put things back together
you cannot come up with a big socialist ideas
because that's Trump's only hope
he's praying
for Sanders war
but it's also a question of denying things
if somebody shoots up
a parade route
or something
and shouts Allah Huakbar at the end
there will be a democratic attempt
