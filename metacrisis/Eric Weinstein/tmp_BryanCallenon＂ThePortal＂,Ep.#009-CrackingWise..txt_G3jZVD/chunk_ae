who i really like and and i admire but um uh i'm gonna give sam just a quick lesson if i ever
meet him on how not to how not to start a conversation sam don't say let's we had we need a war on
his lawn don't say that right you can't do that because you lose everybody we got to we got to
be a little bit more we got he's he's so he's so painfully honest well you know i went on his show
about this point no no i didn't okay so i did it but i'm a fan so you know i'm a fan of sam's too
i mean we're great friends i i tried to indicate to him that there was something counterproductive
not about his line of thinking but about his chosen motive of expression he gets emotional
honestly sam gets emotional i think that's what it is well but and he sublimates it right so you
you know you you almost never see him i i took video of him find his way through i took a video
of him playing um centipede on an old arcade machine and people loved it because they said oh
my god he's human um he's very he's very zen he's very human yes the issue that i had was
that i didn't think that sam understood what he was projecting and that i said you know you need
to say some things about the positive aspects of this culture well it was like you open up this box
and he's like i love the call to prayer i said what he's like i love the poetry of rumi and so he
starts extolling there you go some of the some of the advantages he's an incredibly religious guy
for an atheist i mean i do his app waking up and i love this book uh spiritually without religion
and i love his podcast and i and i think that he's genuinely sincere about trying to get
an honest conversation going i i fall in the line with so much of his thinking but i i do think that
he i i do think he he could he could uh i think he does i think he gets emotional yeah i think
then he goes on the offensive and that's he is very upset about people not understanding his
central message and i think it few few people understand what it is yeah he is not claiming
that um islam is a terrible thing that it has nothing to offer he's not claiming that religion
is bereft of good ideas or important ritual what he's weirdly saying doesn't get picked up is
i sam harris believe that there is nothing that can be done irrationally through a crazy belief
system that couldn't be done better at scale um using reason but that's why i disagree well i agree
i disagree too i think uval harari would disagree you need myth you need story and and and so so so
the value they're in let's just take christ as an example or the bible or any story or even
Plato's forms were about the idea that you may not be able to touch perfection but my god you
can imagine it you the perfection may very well not exist but you can not only imagine it but you
should reach for it you're going to miss but the reach is what matters so so doing the right thing
a lot of times might be very much against not in your own interests i mean think of the play the
crucible well i mean he's going to die for christ sake but he's not going to give up his you know
he's more than his appetites right it's more on the man for all seasons these are these stories
that we think about the mohondas k gandhi marlon luther king malcolm x jesus christ
would they these people endure and they way we speak of them and sort of with heads bowed because
they put their own interests they it was not there was nothing rational about what they did in a lot
of ways i mean you could say i suppose well well i mean they they they knew that they were putting
themselves they're very somatically they were definitely putting themselves in huge risk they
they exterminate they they erase themselves physically but um there's something about
have you ever read gandhi on violence yes a long time ago yeah you ever seen this riff that he did
where he said there are three things i want to talk about i want to talk about pacifism i want
to talk about violence and i want to talk about non-violence and he says i believe that my philosophy
of non-violence is superior to the other two but given a choice between violence and pacifism i
would always choose violence i don't remember that i know tarot was his a huge influence on him but
so gandhi the gandhi that we think of as this simple kindly uh saintly figure is not actual gandhi
and gandhi he was an anglophile i know he's a lawyer in south africa who yeah well there's that
yeah but he actually believed he said look don't mistake non-violence for pacifism non-violence
requires the most courage because you're going to put yourself in harm's way with a
pre-commitment not to defend yourself and if you can't get to that level of badassery choose violence
and why because the worst thing you can do is to be passive and to let your nation uh
you know be raped as india was by by the brit so this is like well it may have been a strategic
i don't think that that policy of non-violence would have worked against the nazis the germans
would have just shot him uh and they would have just opened up on anybody it worked with the british
empire because the british empire had elections they had parliament well there's a question who
does who does the non-violence and i don't know if you know about the rozenstrasse protest in terms
of you want to talk about weird portal effects i think it was 1943 in berlin a bunch of women
who were married to jewish men or partially jewish men but were not jewish themselves
decided that they would show nazi germany what's what and get their husbands back
and they organized a protest i don't know why this isn't famous it makes me feel
like i'm crazy for bringing it up um they organized a protest in uh the rozenstrasse
uh the street and they made such an embarrassing show in front of the nazis that the nazis i believe
acquiesced and got these men out of the camps and returned to the women so it was like a wow
well this is the thing about the power of wives and mothers and beautiful young women
you know who are you know new bio just means marriageable um we are so
when women organize themselves effectively they can bring male systems you know really
to their knees because there's no good way of saying we're against motherhood we're against
love we're against anything that is aspirationally kind of pure um yeah somebody's draw people have
drawn correlations between women's rights and health care and the advent of health care and
things and which is why the women's march was so confusing to me because that was a tremendous
amount of power to mobilize but without a very clear follow through and with some very dubious
you know i think that a lot of us fear that there was some kind of anti-semitism that was
behind some of the organization of that but just in terms of what could you get the nazis to take
note of i've always been fascinated by who protested the nazis effectively there was another case
which you might know through through boxing um i think the guy's name was johannes trolman
who was a cinti like a roma and he was incredibly good-looking and he was doing the Muhammad Ali
thing years before Muhammad Ali of being very athletic as a boxer so it was kind of a matinee
idol of this time and germans were fantastic audiences for boxing they were very well informed
about the sort of science of the sport and obviously this guy had to go down because he
wasn't pure an arian in german but the crowd the germans loved him yeah and when he was i guess
they're you know the refs gave the fight to the other guy there was an outcry in germany
so they changed the rules about how you could fight and it was to make this guy's fighting
style not work so as a protest i mean just this is such a great story he divorced his wife because
he thought it was a danger to her wow he coded himself in flower to mock the purity of this
you know racially pure german right yeah and he got into the ring with the crowd behind him
and he took the effing was cheese right and he gets sent to a camp and everybody reveres them
it's like you know the south africans respected nelson mandela well the nazis fucking respected
this guy yeah and they germans at least yeah even the nazis yeah you know because in some sense they
know that they're doing the wrong else you know that he can kick their ass with it if well but you
know it's it's what you just said about fragility like here's this guy who's a genius with his fists
who's this unbelievable figure in his heart and what is he doing you know he's mocking them and
he's sacrificing his own life so he ends up in the camps he's he's he's holding fighting clinics and
i think somebody i don't know kills him with a shovel or a pistol or something so it's a terrible
story there's a ring in a park in germany on a slant and it's just the slant is the unfairness
of the situation right wow and he was reinstated his title had been taken away and it's been
reinstated all these years later somebody needs to make a major motion picture how you know what
amazes me is how you're this theoretical mathematician with such a poet's heart well it's amazing dude but
that's but isn't so now who's getting emotional well i love it yeah i love it too yeah and it's
you know it's about heroism it's about violence it's about even in a tragedy celebrating you know
these are the these are the guys whose lives you want to see right and like what a subtle beautiful
nod to a great life because he's not even depicted um that's you know i was gonna i think what i'm
gonna do with the show not every not every episode is going to be transformative and and transcendent
but i think one of the things i want to do is to organize the world and its sites for transcendence
like this monument this this broken ring needs to be on the map people need to know
there and they need to go in pilgrimages yeah those stories need to be right i agree with you
man and you're you're in such a unique place to do this i think this is going to be a great podcast
i think i think you're gonna love oh i hope we've got so many you know you're you're so interested
in so many different things and i think you're look the idea is to get the ideas the good ideas
that are stuck in books and stuck in people's brains who usually don't have an ability to
talk to a lot of people get them out and into the ears and into the brains of the people out there
well and i also want to make sure that i mean i don't want to hide the fact that you know i'm stuck
i'm hypocritical i don't exactly know what we're supposed to do next either it's it's the struggle
discovery it's the right you're trying to look for the portals you don't know where they all are
some of them are going to be false leads but transcendence you know is what you were saying
before transcendence is available to everyone who's willing to look for it it's not available
in every hour of every day well that's my problem with cancel culture because what you're saying is
you know we are who we were we are who we are and we are who we could be and all of us are trying
to be who we could be right or at least most of us and i'm certainly very different i don't know the
guy who i don't know brian count the what the brian count 20 year old brian count 25 year old brian
count what an asshole i mean or at least what a dumb dumb or at least what a what a naive ignorant
arrogant little shithead i i mean i'm i'm just a different person now right because i'm 52 i mean
it took me a long time to become the human being that i am and that's pretty flawed person but at
least i'm a little less flawed made more mistakes i have better pattern recognition i'm a little bit
more compassionate i hope and and but you know we are verbs we're verbs men say more we're not
nouns okay when you cancel me out for yeah something i did or said my god you're suggesting i'm that
way all the time no i'm not i might have been having a moment i might have been confused i might
have been angry and outside of your personality i'm sorry if you think about yourself as as a
conference of different modules like there are modules of all of us that we don't like some some
instruments sometimes are playing louder than the other instruments right or that piccolo is flat
a hundred percent right and the idea is that because of the piccolo player the entire symphony
is canceled i mean i you know and and who's doing this cancelling show me one person who
doesn't have these sets of issues right i know i know exactly and who is behind all these like
it's just the twitter sphere right i keep hearing it's not the real world but but it is my problem
is it is the real world my problem is that you can lose your ability to earn a living when you're
canceled well so this is in your career my theory here is that we've moved from physical violence
to reputational and economic violence of course and so the idea being that the one thing i mean i
don't know that i've fully done this theory anywhere so it'd be great to do it here with you the
the institutions have these rules on them and these rules are causing every institution that
gets formed whether it's a for-profit or a non-profit or in different sectors of the economy
to take on certain characteristics the one thing that doesn't have this this feel to it
is the individual the individual cannot be legislated now the individual may be dependent
on the ability to access the banking system i mean one one show that we have talked about
is an erotic actress who has not been able to easily maintain merchant accounts
or to gain credit and there's a question about should we be harassing people who are legally
employed in jobs that somebody doesn't care for which scares but that everybody everybody watches
when nobody else is watching you know porn stars i mean you know if you're going to criticize
porn stars please never watch porn well this is the thing when i when i was doing these shows
with sam harris i would talk about how we lie and i would say who here who here watches porn hub
and like the audience is silent i feel like this bro me right here i can take my favorite
porn stars too i can tell you everything about it not i i can even go why go through why i don't
watch it anymore because it doesn't get me off because i don't believe the girls but then i got
the girls i do believe any other questions well this is the thing this is what i mean but you
at my salon everybody will raise their hands well this is the thing but because you're an
individual but then when it comes to how you're employed yes depends upon are you on network
tv what are you on cable you know what is it that we can and can't say what i believe is
because the individual is the thing that is still free of this kind of legislated goodness
in other words there is goodness that actually occurs and there's goodness that is only there
because we legislated the people who don't do not like uh things that are outside of their control
are going to reputational attacks because that's the only way of shutting down the individual
that's right and so that that reputational violence has gotten far more extreme for people who speak
out that's right and i think that that's really part of the story behind you brought up jordan
peterson before it's not so much in my opinion that any one of these people is saying something
brilliant although brilliant things are said by some of these people it's more that people say
is there anyone willing to stand up for central values like well core but 60 minutes 60 minutes
had him on and there was the there was the caption i think was 60 minutes there was this
caption and then they did a recap of it maybe it's cnn and under it said alt right professor
how fucking dare well where does this come from how dare you some asshole in the control room
no but brian it's universal it's universal it's not there is some story here and i don't claim to
have it which has to do with how institutional media finds a completely fake narrative and then
just through perseveration repeats it so often that people think it's true well this is why this is
why fake news quote unquote has caught on i i'm not a trump defender let me tell you yeah but uh
when i watch cnn and how slanted they are right and and and watch these lightweight journalists
who just have not done their homework uh and and they've got three minutes or whatever it is their
their opinion pieces and stuff and i could say the same about fox news by the way in a lot of cases
because tucker call some drives me fucking crazy because he doesn't really listen to any of his
guests he won't even let his guest talk but but you know it's like um it it it's it's just not
true you're not being truthful here you are and and people know that people get it people go hold on
like when when when ocasio-cortez calls enough americans racist right well we all go well we the
lot very white states the majority of these very white states voted a black president twice
you're being a little insulting here to all of us that's a terrible thing to call a lot of americans
i travel this country more than she does yeah and i travel country and i and i perform for and talk to
and i'm around real people not the elite i'm around people that work for a living with their hands
etc i can promise you and a lot of them are white i can promise you i promise you they if you called
any of them are racist and i'm talking about people in the town so they they'd look at you and go
no i'm not no i'm not well but you can't get out of it oh so you deny it that just proves you know
that you are well you don't know because you don't know where you're right you know but what i do well
well now what do i do well what i really dislike about this is that the language is so impoverished
like the issue of binary good guy bad guy well it exactly i mean if i'm in a situation where
i have a lot of information about a different community i'm going to form positive and negative
impressions of every single possible community but you're not but see ideologues don't like nuance
well so this is the war on nuance well because nuance you know the way the way i keep encountering
this i've i've made a big point of this they view nuance like the israelis view an olive grove
it's a place for snipers to hide so we have to we have to take down the olive trees so there won't
be any snipers i have to pee so badly and that metaphorses made me forget about my pee which is
why we're taking a break with brian calin taking a break when we return brian calin on the portal
i've always wanted to say this and we're back with brian calin brian if we could i would love to
switch into another area that i don't think we've really touched on much which is your
fascination with um pretty deep science and the way in which it even works its way
into your comedy routines and into your thinking yeah how is it that all right first of all i have
this impression that i grew up in la and i used to come to some of the comedy clubs they'd go to
the improv probably more than anything else and i'd see comedians and they'd suddenly switch
