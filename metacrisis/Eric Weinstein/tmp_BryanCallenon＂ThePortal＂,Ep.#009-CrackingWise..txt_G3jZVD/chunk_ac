effectively functions in a cult-like way which is very few people who are academicians
have ever left uh education in other words they start at kindergarten or pre-k that's what's
going on and if you leave you aren't it's very suspicious if you return yeah you can't take
five years off for most people now occasionally there are exceptions but the system as a system
of selective pressures is selecting specifically for people who never venture outside their
initial environment I have talked to very smart academic all-stars people talk about them all the
time without going into names and uh one didn't really realize that they were they were trying
to raise some money for something they wanted me to host and he didn't he didn't really understand
that there were agents out there that could raise sponsorship he just didn't live in an economic
world but he's very happy to and we had a big argument about it he's very happy to uh advocate
for an 80% tax rate for anybody making over a million dollars because he wants to go back to
what what he thinks to Scandinavian like socialism which is wrong Scandinavia doesn't
have that kind of a tax rate so you're wrong but also um this hunter-gatherer ideal okay all right
you know good luck with that but you shouldn't be making economic policy you're not well so
you're bringing up something which I think is terrifying what happens when the sense making
professions that is the people that we deputize as our experts for taking in raw data and saying
okay tell us what this means and tell us what we should do next and you find this in education you
find this in um let's say journalism and the the the um sort of talking head class all of these
sort of institutional sense makers are caught up in business models which are now selecting for
people who have very little experience outside of this world and I feel like if we don't come up
with jobs for that class that pay very well what you're going to get is you're going to get very
ideological people with very little outside experience who are imagining a collectivist
world that functions beautifully but not thinking about the amount of coercion and violence that
it would take to accomplish that and whether or not it's something you want to even do it to begin
there's that idea there's that saying I love which is um an idea is a very dangerous thing to have
if it's the only one you have it's a very dangerous thing if it's the only one you have I see and I
think that there there is this orthodoxy this homogenous you know kind of collective mind that
comes out of a lot of these places and and you're right I mean there's no room but but I have two
things to say one I think I worry that the a lot of these big companies I mean to express even a
different point of view even to cite the science behind the difference between men and women will
get you fired well this gets you fired I mean it really can affect your your your bottom line so it
is a form of violence or certainly certainly uh what is the word coercion in in it's in in a real
sense you know you conformity mostly but you know what Americans are hard to fool and uh and Americans
don't like extremes and I there is a shitload of pushback not just in this sort of this hard left
kind of like mentality but it's a big pushback um and a lot of intellectual pushback as well in my
opinion and it's only getting stronger I mean I there's a reason that reasonable people who are
responsive to evidence like yourself like Jordan Peterson whoever it might be um there's a reason
these people really hit a chord that people like to listen to them because they're like I knew this
other stuff wasn't making that much sense you know I feel like I'm stuck in this ideological world
and I don't I don't you guys are calling me racist are you calling me are you telling me I'm not
into equality I'm not even thinking about that I'm a fair-minded person etc etc so there's a lot
of pushback well I I mentioned this to Sam Harris and I think I'm going to maybe do a show on this
podcast um called the Hilbert Problems uh the topic would be the Hilbert Problems of Social Justice
and so maybe the easiest one is you can't possibly understand my experience because you don't share
it and you must understand my experience because it's so important and so you just take these two
things and then you say look I want to discuss those that as a couplet I must understand and I
cannot understand because that's your problem after all and what if I can actually write a
screenplay let's say we're doing impression on a stage where you say that was so good that there's
no way you could have inhabited that character without understanding me I felt that way for
example if you remember uh Eddie Murphy is the old Jewish guy yeah I mean he does a better Jew
than any Jew I know of course he does he's an actor and he was around them and you know exactly
right exactly and so this idea that again it goes back to what goes back to the fact that we have a
lot more in common with each other than we well in order to in order to unlock that though don't
we have to have enough safety to and this is kind of this puzzle for me about the weird social
justice movement if you create cancel culture you're telling me that it is not safe to open my
mouth and say something that's right your ideas are harmful therefore I'm not going to even bring
them up to a conscious level because they're far too dangerous what if one of them came out of my
mouth inadvertently or in a joke that went south now you've got a really serious problem which is
what if some kind of bigotry and some kind of prejudice is just it's garden variety it's not
very interesting it's universally distributed everybody has it that's a problem I mean I
have multiple feelings about how I feel about different people in different circumstances
if you don't allow some of this stuff to bubble up come out your mouth and and look at it for the
brain fart that it really is yeah then you're you're going to sit there weirdly guilty
either angry that you can't say that you want to be able to say it or you're going to say wow I
really am ashamed that I actually think I always say we all of us in my my I think I have to joke
all of us have at least 10 thoughts an hour maybe a minute that would get us fired I mean and thank
God by the way thank you know Jonathan height I don't know if you've heard him talk on this
subject but he wrote The Cotling of the American Mind and the Righteous Mind he's just I love him
and and but he said that there is this he compares it to the I think the Corazon of the Philippines
I think that's who they were called who would gain status by killing the most people you know
essentially your enemy and you'd take their heads or you take a trophy maybe a piece of their hair
and you gain status that way you got more women that way and and this is an example of a sick
culture I don't give a shit how how pure it is it's a sick culture right and there are a lot of
examples of that and we seem to be in some pockets of this country there is this this you gain status
by finding the racist by finding the the bad guy according to your orthodoxy according to your
puritanical your puritanical idea of what a human being should be it's a scavenger hunt that's gone
out of control like pokemon for bigots and there aren't enough bigots to play it it's not new though
it's a form of the inquisition it's not new this is this again human beings love purity they love
the idea you get these people who love the idea of trying to purify and create their own utopia
which a lot of historians have written about the most dangerous thing a human being can do
the most dangerous thing a movement can endeavor to do is to purify or create a utopia because what
you'll do uh and if you have any questions see mouse china polpots uh cambodia stallons uh rush
i mean stallion would have people killed because they had the wrong idea of what communism and then
you take whole groups because they've already been corrupted their brains you can't really
reeducate them they're too old so they're all wearing glasses anybody who's wearing glasses
is an intellectual they read a lot they have a lot of this poisonous capitalist stuff in their head
let's just bring them out to the killing fields and let's get rid of them that's what happens
throughout history that's what happens when you have ideologues running things because they're not
smart they're fanatics they don't open themselves up to other points of view i don't know why nobody
ever talks about this it's exactly what you're saying this issue that purity is weirdly the most
dangerous concept we have when people try to purify terrible things happen and we have a ritual on
friday nights we have a weekly shabbat dinner and in our family we we take the shabbat cup of wine
and we put two drops in it there's always this question why do you put two drops of water in
the wine beforehand my interpretation is that it is us learning to live with impurity that these
two drops of water can bother your mind well now now the wine isn't pure it's been watered down
it's adulterated it makes no effing difference to the wine and it's teaching my the way i view it
is it's teaching my children to avoid becoming fanatics about purity when i think about the
off ramp i don't know if you've ever seen this in in saudi arabia on the road to mecca there's this
wonderful off ramp that says uh muslims only mecca this way all others this is your off ramp
and i think about that i think wow i wonder how much of the the the division in islam between the
things that go towards this jihadist craziness and the things that make for this wonderfully rich
welcoming culture some in some ways they're inextricable but i wonder how much of it has to
do with which portions of the culture have learned to live with impurity well i look at our culture
thomas jefferson owned 600 human beings when he wrote all men are created equal
that we hold these truths to be self evidence that all men are created equal and endowed to
that creator of certain inalienable rights among which are life-liberating the pursuit of happiness
he owned 600 human beings when he wrote that i mean we we our peculiar institution i mean slavery
we've been a country with slavery longer than when we've been a country without slavery but you'd
be hard-pressed to find a freer longer-standing democracy throughout history we are a modern
country precisely because we continue to wrestle with that inconsistency so this is something i'd
love to dig into one of the weird things about hearing the patriarchy the patriarchy of patriarchy
is the one place that was an actual patriarchy was the founding of our country and what's
hysterically funny and just sort of beautiful about it is that these guys wrote with enough
generality that they didn't make the mistake of saying all men other than africans are created
equal or all men are created equal and not you women they spoke with a level of generality
where general life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is think about that right you have
the right to life you have the right to liberty and you have the right to pursue happiness not
happiness but to pursue happiness meaning struggle if pursuing happiness is is i don't know living
in water in a pond whatever it is then that's you have that right right and that is that's our
real religion that's that's what we come to defend you know that's his right you hear it
but the the theory in some sense was so much more advanced than the instantiation at the
founding of the country one of the things that i find hysterically funny and also hopeful is that
we we have the opportunity in this country and we don't do it much to teach both every lousy
stupid hypocritical thing we've done as a nation many of them violent many of them deadly
and to teach patriotism on top of that because if you think about this in terms of all countries
have histories uh which contain things that they'd rather sweep under a rug and somehow
patriotism has been sort of try people on the right really try to take it over and as a fan
somebody comes from a very progressive family which suffered because of let's say the McCarthy era
i love this country and i know every lousy thing it's it's ever done yeah um do we have an
opportunity to sort of reboot patriotism at a more mature level where the love of one
country is an adult love rather than a childlike love i think that most people i happen to believe
that most people are patriotic for the right reasons i think america is an idea i mean the
founding fathers solve the political problem the greeks couldn't do it and no one else could do it
the ottomans couldn't do it the roman sure as hell couldn't do it this was this is i mean these are
a bunch of men in the 30s with the exception of benjamin franklin got together what was in a hot
july in philadelphia right and came up with this thing called the constitution and the bill of
rights are you fucking kidding me i mean think about it for a second it's insane it's it's it's
it's astonishing checks and balances you've got a you've got a supreme court and i mean and it was
what was i the the the legend goes you know when ben franklin came out and she's the woman said
what have you created and he said a republic madam if you can keep it yeah it's great but this is
this is an experiment this is a verb uh it has to be constantly defended george washington said
careful or human beings will invent ways to take their own freedom away from themselves in the name
of virtue and everything else so um i think that for the most part what i appreciate about patriotism
in this country and you know is is the that at least people truly believe that we that democracy
having a say right and who governs you and and and the big question in political philosophy who
governs the governor well in our case it's the people now i know we can get into you know lobbying
and how we're losing that ability and special interests of course but for the most part that is
always what's fiercely debated you know we are worried always that washington is becoming an
economy of influence right that that that we are losing our meritocracy but but it's still the fact
that the look at how vicious the press is to donald trump and amen to that whether you like him or
not you never want to lose the ability to this constant nasty battle oh i want to take issue
with this actually this is the first place where i might have a disagreement okay but this nasty
battle this nasty battle between that's fake news you're full of shit he's a scumbag he's a
sex addict all these things he's a rapist i don't think actually it's ever been any different in
uh in in american politics american politics has always been what would they they used to compare
ape linkin to an ape and all kinds of things and they tried to start all these sexual rumors about
different canon this has always been a dirty place but um i think that's probably what you get in a
vibrant democracy the big difference the big difference between our democracy and someone
else's uh let's just take iran yeah is if the hardliners lose they die they don't live to fight
another day when we lose a peaceful transition it's a peaceful transition so far it's incredible
and and and the big the big thing was i think between jefferson and john adams i think john
adams wanted a standing army and jefferson was against that and and but it was they look they
were very worried that they called them these wild eyed jeffersonians i mean they were very
worried that jefferson was going back to this agrarian utopia and i mean he was a kind of a
there was a lot of talk about we got to get rid of these this is this could be a civil war i mean
anytime you have a revolutionary war anytime you have a country that wins their independence almost
always they break into a civil war the two somebody's got to fight for for power this is the this is
the only country i can think of yeah that didn't have that happen and so i don't i don't know where
how we got along on this but but but it's you mean so like india and pakistan during partition
after liberation oh my god a horrible a horrible civil war right and in fact they created the
formation of pakistan right but so so there's something very special about about our patriotism
about our democracy as messy and as nasty and as quote-unquote partisan as it is maybe it's
supposed to be that way maybe maybe government is supposed to move at a snail's pace well i think
when you have some i think we're in a very dysfunctional period where the amount of nonsense
you know i i refer to k-fabrication from the word k-fabe which is the system of lies that
professional wrestling uses to tell its stories right so you i never heard that but i like it
yeah uh so i i do i do have to say before you go into your thing i love when you come up with
these things because when you left the dinner uh malik a professional boxer from you know louisiana
and vegas and my buddy herman who played d1 ball and he's from philly and both of them
both of them were like man i fuck with eric i fuck with that dude he's so fucking smart he
was saying shit i want to i'll we what when can we have another dinner with that dude like everybody
everybody wanted more wine stein so congratulations and your wife by the way she's a superstar
she's she's great she's she's fantastic but keep going we try to get around the show the uh
when it comes to ke to ke to k-fabricate k-fabrication um i think that we're in a period of nonsense
where we're talking about all sorts of things and the best that can be said of us is that we are
inefficient in unraveling ourselves what i worry about is that we actually need something like an
enemy in order to remind ourselves of how to get along despite our differences and i don't know
whether part of the problem is that this unprecedented level of peace even with foreign
entanglements since world war two is in fact deranging us is that possible i i do i've heard
that theory right i've heard i've heard that sort of without war i think it was the british
general i can't remember his name i said without war you know the population becomes very materialistic
and petty and until you have a common enemy that's what unifies the country and gets people
back down to what's actually important values duty honor things like this um i i don't know
i think time i think time will tell i think there's an there are a lot of challenges there's enough
you know you were talking about combat athletes and you know you're all these guys you i think you
said something so funny i felt like i was on the serengeti with a bunch of thoughtful cheetahs
over a kill it was the fucking greatest metaphor i've ever heard it was so great but what you
forget is that all of us think of you as the alpha male no because but it's true because
you come in there and you're not physical but you're funny as everybody you're you're just
cracking everybody up but then at the same time everybody knows everybody knows you got the biggest
