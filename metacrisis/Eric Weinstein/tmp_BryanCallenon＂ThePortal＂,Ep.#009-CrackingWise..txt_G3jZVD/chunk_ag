story and saying i've got to find out what that is is that a real thing sure enough you know there
was an entire topological theory of non-orientable manifolds and the only way that i got to it
was from a humor magazine right yeah yeah that's great well what about the idea that
you're a mathematician so i heard uh there's a there's a great course called the great ideas of
philosophy and it's uh it's from the teaching company and i just quoted a little bit of uh
david robinson uh dan robinson who is uh written more about philosophy than anybody in the past
30 years but um and he said something interesting he was talking about how you know a theoretical
mathematician spends their whole life you know they had a dream about some of this possibility
this mathematical possibility and they spend their whole life coming up with this equation
that they solve and it bears no real relevance to the material world but then they die and okay
and thanks a lot and we have this theorem that i guess you came up with it was probably 300 pages
long or something like that and then about a hundred years later or 20 years later whenever
it it's used to put a rover on mars or something and it does bear direct relevance to the material
world so you know uh again it's it's what we talked about before it was like there are certain
mythologies you you can disprove that all men are created equal with biology and math you can
actually disprove it very easily you can take lebron james and send us through a whole send a
bunch of tests but there's a deeper truth to it when we collectively when we collectively
embrace this mythology this myth right that we are all created equal it provides a better
fucking world it provides a better cut more food on the table more equality more diverse
more interesting culture and ultimately a stronger culture because we're more creative
so that's a truth so so even though i can disprove it mathematically or biologically for whatever
reason it's a different kind of truth it bears sweeter fruit so what of that what of that crazy
idea thank you uvel harari by the way for bringing that to my attention all right did you did you
see the first or did you hear the first uh terrible interaction between jordan peterson
and sam harris sure did sure did okay fighting and that's what that was i was like sam you know
yeah you backed saman you backed jordan in that i i thought they both got mired down and i liked
them both very much but i do think that sam kept putting this flag there and couldn't move on well
sam i understood what jordan was saying though so let's just recapitulate it for the for the folks
at home yeah so my recollection correct me if this isn't yours is that sam was trying to say
that um truth was very important and jordan was trying to say if something doesn't contribute to
human fitness then in some sense it wasn't true uh a little bit different so i think what's what
jordan was saying was there are truths that would that that there are say scientific truths that if
if followed through with might be self extinguish yes we would we would extinguish the world right
and that's not a that's that's so that that's not a truth that that so so he was trying to
marry truth with fitness is it fitness or with with with um well the if i guess positivity
something so yeah i don't want to be unfair to jordan because i don't want to be unfair to either
one of them but what i was looking to get was your actual insight in something that i've struggled with
on sam's show i said i can reduce most of what i care about or perhaps all of it to four different
values that compete with each other and i said it's truth meaning fitness and grace so there are
things that are true that rob my life of meaning and so i have to trade off between them there are
things that are true that might be less fit like you discover some wave blowing the world up that's
very cheap in any high school student could do it that would decrease human fitness um and then
there are things that are true that are not graceful that are not beautiful that that i wish were not
true and well you know but you don't need to talk about this needs to talk about the idea of plural
truths okay i mean but when i when a chemist looks at a painting when you look at a beautiful
painting like the sistine chapel or something that brings you to your knees right a chemist
could also say well what you see what you think is blue is actually not blue your eyes or that's
a trick that your eye is playing and there'd be truth to that as well which is you're not like
let's take the take the david with its famous distortions of form michael angeles david only
works because it is in fact not truly a human form it's a distorted form that is reprocessed to
be perfect right that's right another another way to look at it let's just take dogs for example
it's true the dogs are scavengers pack animals and hunters and it's also true that they've probably
evolved to manipulate you with their little wags and their ears down and and and so they're scheming
you they're fucking manipulating right okay great it's also true that dogs are awesome yeah that's
true that i kissed them and i love the fuck out of them and then when they die i cry so hard i can't
take okay but it's not that's true too so there's room for all the well see but i don't i don't
like this i love the idea that there are things that actually i'm willing to sacrifice truth for
so you're saying it one way jordan's saying when sam's saying one way what i'm trying to they could
have let go of that because they would have got they got mired down they did and then they had a
that you know i remember sam's agonizing should i do a redo yeah what i get out of it and and this
is an uncomfortable place to be but it's interesting because it's uncomfortable to your point about
what to mine in order to get to comedy so maybe i'm just trying to get to a podcast is why did
you imagine that truth was going to be a great guide to everything else in other words why would
you imagine that truth wouldn't be something that you might have to give up a little bit to get a
better outcome i don't believe that the supreme court is the nine wisest druids just because
they wear black robes but on the other hand maybe i get a really better outcome if i learn how to
suspend disbelief when i go to the supreme court which i've attended once just the way
when i go to a movie you know transport me take me away make me believe that this is in fact true
yeah yeah that's that's that's true i mean that's that's very true there's there again it goes back
to these plural truths it depends on where you're standing and the question you're asking maybe
you know there are all these sort of different variations on it but sometimes something to be
true very true for you right then and there i mean it may make no sense but oh i'm just having a
great time yeah or fuck i love you you know that kind of stuff and then you get then you then you
have time to think about i was like i was gonna buy that car i asked that person to marry me but i
well i really felt it in the moment i mean maybe that's just my biology talking but um uh yeah i
think there are different levels there they're truths with the capital t and then they're smaller
truths maybe they're illusions but i like the illusion well i mean i think that one of the
things that you can point to just the way that the way you talked about why do people get carried
away and end up in vegas marrying each other is that in some sense maybe our biology knows that we
can't trust our rational mind and that if we don't feel swept away that one of the reasons that these
impulses are so hard to explain is is that biology has designed this drive to reproduce to be almost
suicidal that you're willing to sacrifice you know if you think about it in terms of biology
you have soma which doesn't reproduce and you have germ lines like what's between your legs
that has a hope of immortality and you have to make sure that the soma is overwhelmed by the
need to perpetuate the germ and so in fact we're born to be self-destructive and irrational in
our somatic selves because it is our line that in some sense has to live forever yeah you're a
series of sensations you know and you chase some sensations and run away from the others a lot of
times i think that that's where meditation and certainly something that's in heresis i do because
of that book that i've always been fascinated where i read a lot of when i was a young man i read
everything about zen and you know i was very into i was martial arts guy and i read a lot about you
know the japanese tradition of zen then zen in the art of archery and motorcycle maintenance and all
that stuff and and i even was one to my period was like the greeks know nothing and you know
i'm gonna meditate you know and all that stuff but um but sam heresis book spirituality without
religion i really really liked because and i really like his app i'm not a practice but i do it every
day and i've been doing it for almost a year now sam if you're out there you're welcome yeah yeah yeah
he's he's he's you know but you guys haven't hung out i i've never met him let's let's let's let's
rectify that i think you guys would be fast friends i think he's and i you know to be honest
i would love to potentially explore with you some of the issues about how to bring
truly high-level math physics biology to a wider audience i haven't really figured out exactly i
don't think you will eric i think that you well you know they say that einstein was really good
and and i it's actually i take that back einstein they say was really good at explaining the theory
of relativity and gravity and things to a to a kindergartner he could use diagrams and i think
if anybody is qualified to do that it's you because you're you you just are a romantic
dude no i'm just because i'm the emotion but i mean but but yeah yeah and there's such an emotional
core to this stuff right i know there is and and you know when you were talking on rogan about um
how you like leaving this world and you like you're in a world of ideas i i just i haven't stopped
thinking about it i have not stopped thinking about what you said and um and and so you are
eminently qualified to simplify these ideas and turn them into something beautiful if that's true
and i don't know that it maybe it's it's a challenge i know it's a challenge but but if it's true it
has to do with a very weird thing i think which is that symbols were not really available to me
as a language because of my learning issues they sort of they they play around and they jump here
and there and i can't really read equations just the way i can't read music and so for me what
happened was i had to find some other route up the mountain because the symbolic route was
blocked off to me you got to make it relevant so so why i always say to people who are not who
haven't gone down the education road i always say i use these little things to young men i know how
to talk to them i go education's good you know why and they say why i go because it teaches you
the difference between a good idea and a bad idea and they are fucking i like that you know and then
i say you should study some math what the fuck math he goes no no no listen study some geometry
algebra why why you know well because it teaches you how to think and they go what does that mean
i go teaches you how to formulate an argument teaches you how to debate and beat somebody
crush somebody and that's how my father did it to me he goes it gives you ammo it'll teach you
not to be a fuzzy thinker okay any masculine he created a masculine energy around math guess
who got an a in math this guy and i wasn't and i was always thought i didn't have a math brain but
as soon as he did that i was like i got to fight the communists i got to have a brain that's i got
to have a rational mind and i got to learn how to how to you know formulate an argument to beat
that guy in the argument i never i didn't understand that you had to i didn't i hadn't read jonathan
height yet well it was very interesting i don't know if you've ever read einsteins i guess it's a
it's not a eulogy it's his um celebration of plonk for his 60th birthday no so he um
um well just you seem to have read everything so i want to have a respectful okay max plonk
yeah at least i know max's first name plonk's first name so ah yes of course plonk it's pronounced
plonk so he um einstein said look in the in the mansion of science uh you find three groups of
people he says the first is the craftsmen and the craftsmen are largely there uh because they
enjoy the beauty of the construction and the purity of it he says then you find the the competitors
and they're there because science makes for a great game with which to beat uh each other in
contest and he says that there's a third group which is the smallest of the three and he said
that group is the searchers and they don't do most of the work he says the only thing about
the searchers is that the mansion wouldn't be there if not for them and it's just this it's
like a gambit gives you but like these guys this is all that matters to me like when i hear that
when you just get used that metaphor but this is oh fuck how can you not be a searcher the problem is
that i'll never be happy because i'm not i'm not enough of a searcher this it's like the great jazz
musicians you ever everything was albert murray who who spoke about the difference and and you
hear this from yeah but that was a dog whistle that you just pulled like the fact that you brought up
louis armstrong yeah louis armstrong is captured in our public imagination as a novelty singer as
opposed to the greatest genius that jazz ever produced who swing like he invented real modern
jazz almost single-handedly he could get the oh again the great the great ones like this like
charlie parker and like they could be number two maybe they would they would they they knew their
notes there was the song and then they would go off they would they would improv of improv over here
thematically and come back to the theme they'd find their way back i mean that's the whole point
of stand up the whole point of any kind of self-expression living in that danger zone
inspiration doing something you didn't think you could do oh you know that with that great
thing in the karate kid i remember when he he breaks all the bottles and he cuts all and
they go how'd you do that he goes i don't know it's the first time i've ever tried it holy fuck
we all went yay you know i mean we all want to live in that danger zone i mean you know but
gee be a good boy play your horn put it back and go home don't be crazy you might not find your way
back um you know but it it's this is what this podcast hopefully you know it's so fun to talk
this way so well the thing is um i i want to make sure that you can escape this as this episode so
i don't go on forever but i would love to have you back and the thing that would be most meaningful
to me would be to find some way for you for you and me to um explore some relatively difficult
scientific ideas together um to see whether or not we could make great audio and video out of
out of it because the the thing that will be most meaningful for me is if some of the really
gorgeous stuff and you know we both are talking about the the craft and the emotion and the thing
is is that if this doesn't end up producing some amount of transcendence and let's be honest most
of these episodes that i'm going to do are not going to get to the level of transcendence that
i'm looking for but if we can do something to push out the best stuff that people don't know is
there the symphonies that are sitting there and i always make this analogy as sheet music that
is never performed like that's how i view academic papers so many of these things are are symphonic
and they there's no public performance that allows you to say oh that's what those people
we're dealing with oh my god is that really part of our world is that really known and settled
that's amazing yeah i would be very moved because i think you've got a mind like
almost nobody i've ever met in terms of uh range conversational ability and the ability
to also just emotionally and analytically touch a subject simultaneously without one
displacing the other well jeez coming from eric oneson that's a huge compliment but uh
you know i don't know but i'd love to i i would enjoy it and especially trying to come up with
as you were talking about coming up with a complicated we'll end with this but coming
up with a complicated mathematical you know discussing or trying to discover or talk about
you know a complicated scientific idea i was thinking about when socrates was trying to prove
the the existence of the soul and the notion that we are all immortal and have been here forever
he took the two slave boys and asked them a complicated mathematical question and one kid
he asked a series of questions and couldn't get the answer and another kid they were both 11 or
something and asked him the questions and and got the answer after led him to the answer through a
series of questions and he said i think it was to me knows the great mathematic mathematician in
you know in Athens he said now do you see that this boy's soul's not been here long enough so he
didn't have the answer in his soul but this boy had the answer and i just had to ask it out of him
therefore his soul has been around a long time i was like so the point is we're gonna see if i'm
an old soul or a young soul and my guess is i'm gonna be a young soul well my guess is that you
are a superposition of all so thank you my friend um what a great time guys you've been through the
portal with uh our friend brian callan look for his special complicated apes and if you happen to be
in the los angeles area or any city brian is visiting his comedy show is astounding i think
you will really enjoy it brian thanks for coming on the show what a blast what a blast
