brain in the room so we start asking you you're asked you about string theory it was so fucking
hilarious because you started talking and all of us like i don't know what he's what's he talking
about what you know you well the loops if you look at the loops in the cones of the sphere
we have a predator i'm like what the fuck hey bro in in english stop with the greek you're speaking
already well there was there was a fair amount of wine there was a fair amount there was indeed
but the point is is that you had your own alpha status there so there was a there was a very you
know that well do you want to get into what i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm to tie that back in um it's
hard it's it's hard enough i don't know that we necessarily need an existential threat trying to
make it in this economy and trying to put food on the table and and gain some leisure time it's
still as hard as it ever has been so maybe that's i don't know i don't know i don't know the answer
i don't know the answer either yeah but i do think that one of the things we need to get back
towards and just riffing again from the ways in which um i was observing your crowd deal with stuff
is twice i've been in a social gathering with you where there's been one female and a bunch of
these guys and i've watched how careful all the men are to elevate um not only the female
but whoever is there with the lone female in the group and the idea being that when it when it when
it was my wife the idea was people were were holding me up and being a little kinder and a
little nicer because you want to make that person look good in the eyes of of the woman at the table
and they're really astute observation well i agree with you that's exactly what was happening well
because because in my mind we've gotten we've broken something a little bit in terms of male
female relations and we are going to be in a process of either rediscovering what was lost or
reinstantiating whatever the abstraction was that was chivalry do you have any thoughts on
where that goes like for instance look my my experience um with the men i know that i'm friends
with and the the hardest toughest guys that i know and stuff like that they're all gentlemen
you know if if uh if you have a guy who's not being a gentleman who's rude to the woman at the
table or who is uh making her feel embarrassed or that that guy's not in our fucking group well
you're first going to correct like oh yeah give a few corrective signals oh and all of my friends
will what i think is super important and attractive about chivalry is the idea of protector well of
protector that that there is a functionally important role i'm going to try to figure how
to get at this thought to the violence that is you know if there's a knock on the door for example
at three in the morning my model is is that mom goes to the nursery and dad goes to the front
door to handle it correct sir and correct there is an expendability of us males that we accept
as part of this bargain that women and children and that's in our dna bro it's in our dna that's in
our dna right you're the first line defense you're the first and last line of defense
that's one hundred percent the case and uh i i don't apologize for that and i don't have a friend
that's not that way um that that's that's uh we want to be the of course we do and that's attractive
and that's noble and that's beautiful and that's men at their best by the way yeah uh that's what
people don't realize when you talk about i always say this man i i you know when we talk about gun
control right i don't like guns dude i don't like them and i don't want spree shooters out there and
i think i i i listen hard to people who are pro gun control because i want to find a solution to
this insanity okay but people have to understand that men like myself who own guns and have them
in the house right i don't own guns because they're shiny and they go pow i own guns because they
make me feel like at least if the shit hits the fan worst case scenario you have recourse i can protect
the people i love that is so deep in me man and and that's what it's about so so give me a little
credit i may be a caveman yeah but um i'm trying to be the best caveman i can be man you know it's
also like the other thing is like you can be a dirtbag but don't be a dirtbag you can be a dirtbag
yeah you got a lot of girls you know but if you are um if you are hurting people's feelings right
humiliating people uh i i i tell you man i i i had a good friend and he had he got gonorrhea yeah
and i call i said to him he goes hey do you have a doctor dude i need these pills i go okay good i
go make sure you gotta tell the girls because the girls you're with uh and he was with like five girls
they can get it and and they can go baron right and he said i'm i'm not doing that
and when he said that right i call it the click i call it the click i go you can have sex with all
of them right but now now you're risking someone's ability to have children dude right and and it's
embarrassing you gotta make the call and when i realized he wasn't gonna make the call i never
i i couldn't do it i couldn't i never that was it that's it you're out so that's that to me is
shivery well so you don't have to be perfect but just take care of your weight bro right so one
way of of looking at that is that um let's imagine that there are a group of men and a group of women
who both sort of sign up for this kind of an agreement like in the story that i was saying
about the knock on the door i perfectly believe that mommy should go to the nursery with a shotgun
if she's worried that somebody's gonna come barging in you know it's not a question of women
should be defenseless it's a question of the first line of defense and who's expendable
and this is just part of the deal and i understand if some people don't like that they don't believe
in it but those of us who do believe in that model should be able to locate each other as a culture
and say hey this is the compact that that we're interested in perpetuating by the way you know
i talk and i'm sorry to bring up my special again but in complicated apes this last thing i talk about
how i'm always amazed that the women's movement hasn't spoken more about the women of the ufc
and i do this whole bit about the idea that i did not expect women are moving into this space
and they're doing it very effectively if you had told me eight years ago that i'd watch women throw
hands and feet and elbows and grapple with the same skill and frosty as men i would have i would
have told you you're crazy i would have said they're not biologically capable or or that interested
or that interested and then you watch rosna majunis uh yonai and genjek valentina shevchenko
amanda nunyes holly holmes i can keep going down the list uh uh micha tates no longer working
ronda rousey ronda rousey you know she might have gotten knocked out by holly home she will go
down in history as the a very significant woman who was beautiful and also fierce she kind of
redefined what she said uh the greatest thing that i ever heard she goes my body's not designed to
fuck millionaires it's designed to beat the shit out of people and it was like hey man sister she's
one of the first people i've ever been starstruck in front of i was just you know she was she was
in my audience one time and i i didn't i didn't perform while i was i've never done that i was
nervous i was like so i was so fanboyed out um but these these women are are proving to
as far as women that are changing hearts and minds the ones that need to be changed like a
bunch of bros like myself etc the guys out there who thought that this arena belonged only to men
they're they have changed our minds and let's talk about lgbtq whatever let's talk about amanda
nunez whose girlfriend is in her corner she kisses her girlfriend her girlfriend's hot and she's a
fighter too you got a couple of lovers kicking ass and changing the world i mean this is this is why
are we not talking about uh violence against women uh when it's done by another woman in a cage
goes a long way and changed in the heart and mind of a chauvinist like myself who we should be talking
about yeah nobody's talking about that because of course they don't watch the UFC well but it's
also you know just there's a confusing aspect which i think is good confusion um how many of these
gals when you see them doing you know they're uh what do i call the pre-fight um thing the way in
the stairwell there's okay the stair down that the way in is the other thing yeah so you weigh
and then you do the stair then you do the stair down how many times if i looked at these gals
in the stair down i said those are two really super attractive super feminine women super attractive
and super feminine and yes and both of them could rip my head off oh my god valentine and chef shank
was so hot to me micha takes so hot to me right they're all so hot i mean the majority of them
are physically beautiful they're they're so attractive to me right i mean it's it's it's
like you're just like are you kidding you you have this skill set and you look like that i've seen
them i've i've seen you know cats and gano i i know some of them i've actually gotten to move
around a little bit and train with some of them and and it's just like they're they're beautiful
well it also it you know it calls men to hire purposes if if one one of the great things that
could come out of this is that if men want to retain some sense of you know being the protector
that they're gonna have to up their game and yes they're gonna have and that people are gonna have
to uh you know raise better boys well that's gonna be inevitable i think um you you have uh i will
say i i had this sort of visceral reaction to the feminist movement because i'm a guy and
it's not my generation and i it makes me feel insecure and stuff but there is something really
cool about women stepping into these spaces and maybe men can take a breather you know ester
parel at all know the name she's uh sort of a next level um relationship expert i know ester
parel yeah yeah um i was hanging with her and she was trying out an idea which i thought was
was pretty good which she said i was trying to she said i asked her i was trying to figure out
masculinity what i realized is that masculinity is both incredibly powerful and incredibly fragile
and that comes with a lot of fear men are very terrified terrified they'll be revealed to be
a coward we're terrified of every aspect i mean well we don't sit in sad we're not allowed to sit
in sad right so women i think have more license so they're allowed culturally sit in sad to cry
to feel and to eat ice cream or whatever it might be men are we can be sad for a couple minutes
then we have to convert that sad to action rage right or target it toward the person or thing
making us sad and attack and kill it and i i i think i feel that very very deeply and and
directly i think that's been that has been what i've had to deal with my whole life i hate to
say it but that's but that's been handed down to me do you accept i'm as i get older i'm trying
to wrestle with having a relationship with that side of me you know um my father was a marine my
father uh um you know he told me a story recently about when you say you know um visiting war memorials
he went to iwo jima and i think only if you're a marine you're allowed to and you can go there's
one day a year i think when when people are allowed to walk the island and he was there
and uh or a family of a marine or something and he was there and an old woman she was about 90
she was walking on the beach and she was having trouble because the sand is very deep and it's
volcanic and and he said um can i help you what what brings you to the island and she said my
husband was here and he was 19 he was killed and and she said um she said i always wanted to walk
where he died i always wanted to walk and i'm walking this whole perimeter so that i can
feel like i stepped where he was i don't know where it was but at least i'm there see how you
get emotional that's what happened to me when my father told me that story i got i started to get
emotional but i couldn't do it in front of him i couldn't i couldn't cry but just telling you
that story makes me want to cry yeah because it's just it was so it was such a beautiful thing and my
father walked her all the way across the island or you know wherever that was man and and there are
some things worth crying about like and this is one of them this is one of them you know um some
things are just too much to bear and and some things are too beautiful and some things are too um
they they just they just remind you of how awesome and awe-inspiring uh humanity can be
and and what happens in the face of terrible tragedy that's sort of bonding the beautiful
stories the beautiful stories of of of that's why i studied uh nazi germany that was my area of focus
and yeah and so when you when you when you hear about the girl whose sister it was her birthday
and she found a blueberry in the fields they were having a work and she wrapped it in a goddamn leaf
and gave it to her sister for her birthday those little things man those little things are what
we stay alive for and those stories about those little things are are probably why a lot of us
are artists you know trying to figure out a way to get people to laugh and cry that's that's the
whole deal that is our respite from from this constant this drudgery this tragedy this uncertainty
this fear it's what it's what Schopenhauer and especially Nietzsche talked about is that yes
there's the will we've got to sleep eat fuck right and and then we die but there are there isn't
there is a way out there there are portals if i may uh and those are artistic inspiration
and conversations like this and great meals with friends yeah have salons and that that's
what we stay alive for and you can turn your life into a circus now you may die young and
leave a good look in corpse right but i'd rather that i'd rather live dangerous and not have enough
transcendence in existence fuck yeah yeah and you can't do that you can't do that living in this
purified echo chamber in a world where you're terrified to insult offend everybody under the
sun you won't have the kind of sex you want you sure as hell won't have the kind of laughs
that you need and that you deserve you'll live in a sexless barren place where you're constantly
trying to be right and not offend anybody you won't even be able to raise your fucking voice
and i think that's bad for us well i think it's bad for our culture you know somebody put that to
music please they will trust me i know they can't believe you didn't start playing the the harmonica
something right here i know um you know i was going to potentially open the series with my cousin
her name was Eva core and i spoke to her right before we launched i guess the the portal and
she said look i'm going on my annual annual pilgrimage and when i get back i'd love to
and she's from indiana i never met her i've spoken to her a bunch on the phone
and she was a mangle a twin and her sister um Miriam um was in the camp with her she was saying
that she looked forward to an annual pilgrimage to Auschwitz where she was and that Miriam her
sister had stopped thriving in the medical experiments and the only way to save her was to
steal food to the point about the the blueberry the sister so she stole potatoes and she was
telling the story about stealing potatoes and that the penalty for stealing potatoes was death
yeah and so she stole these potatoes and got caught so she was clearly going to die and then
she was scolded and let let go now she was just a little kid and she said ah being part of the
medical experiment means i'm protected by dr mangola and so nobody can touch me so she continued
to steal potatoes in order to save her sister and she's telling me this crazy story and i think
i'm going to do an episode because she went to the extraordinary length of forgiving mangola
and this caused a huge human cry her name was Eva Kor and i was dying to start the podcast and then
i get this phone call from her son um and i find out that she's died uh in poland on this last trip
so i i don't get to bring the story the way i wanted to yeah man was this chick tough
like you know the whole idea and when when i tell the story i'll i think i'll do it on a separate
episode uh of the importance of forgiveness and as a almost like a weapon and as a a structural
transformative ritualistic option if you've been victimized this woman gave nothing up in terms of
toughness and then went to these extraordinary counter intuitive lengths one of our last posts
i think is her eating um maybe a mcdonald's meal in auschwitz and sort of laughing about how how
amazing that there's a mcdonald's near where uh we had automated human ritualistic kill well
and frank you know and frank uh i think she wrote i still believe in my heart human beings
were all good at the core right you know and her father said she shames me with her positive
you know outlook uh but i i think that's the that's probably one of the reasons christianity seems
to endure the idea that uh christ preached forgiveness that's a powerful thing what you're
really saying i mean i know as an actor for example you know i had an actor as an actor if
you're playing mangla right if you're playing polpot stalin or hitler right you can't play him
like a monster you know you play him you play him as a man trying to solve a problem for humanity's
sake that's way more interesting and that very well may be what was going on in their twisted
hearts even the nazis had i had a sense that they were doing god's work that they were being
somewhat morally getting rid of this problem called the jews etc and this is why ideas
and if you just rely on logic and rationality you better be careful man because human beings come
up with very very logical and rational reasons to get rid of those people over there it's one of
the things i love about the thing that religion has to offer which is that all life is sacred
the buddhas talk about sentient sentient beings the christians talk about you know whether or not
you're in a coma even if you're unborn listen you know these these things there and they're
unwavering about those things sometimes that is the vanguard sometimes that is the reason
you have to be stalwarted in in in those kinds of ideas they're not convenient a lot of times i'm
a pro-choice guy but i understand the value of these kinds of things because they do protect you
against uh you know the rationalists that come in the scientists the engineers who come in and
start trying to run the world well don't trust your own brain i think it was paul paul who said
don't trust your own heart yeah i'm not a christian by the way just you're not but no i'm not i haven't
been a church i don't go to church i've been a church twice in my life i i but i i respect and
understand what these fixed truths have to offer it's my only contention with sam harris
