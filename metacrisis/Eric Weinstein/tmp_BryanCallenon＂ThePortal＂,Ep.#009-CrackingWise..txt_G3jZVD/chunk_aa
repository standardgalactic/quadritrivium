Weinstein impression uh no I don't you're gonna say the fifth you're too
staid right he is not yet that's right there's something about you that's
very um you're too thoughtful in a good way say it again so thoughtful you're a
warrior of the mind right I have to do the head turn okay I think I can't what
is the head turn just start hi this is Eric Weinstein and you found the portal
today I am joined by none other than my friend Brian Callan Brian welcome it's
good to be in the portal my friend yeah I'm not worthy first of all let me say
that I'm let me apologize to your guests I'm not worthy I'm nothing but a lowly
comic athletic yes but that's about all supple dangerous at times giving always
well I think this is the first time we've started with that level of insincere
groveling but thank you Brian for breaking new territory it's good I've
been a fan of yours for a long time and I yours sir stop okay now here's the thing
first of all I want to say that I so love your conversational style that
anytime you start hosting this feel free but we're just we're just beginning
the portal and what we're trying to do with with the show in the series is two
separate things one I think we're gonna have a great time being here and
interviewing lots of interesting people but there's a sort of a theme running
through it which is that I think a lot of people have realized that we've been in
some kind of a stasis and that some of us may have found ways to break out of
whatever this kind of malaise or miasma that settled over the country is and
we're trying to find the people and the concepts that might give people some
some new options to think about how to break free of whatever might be holding
them in place or their communities or the country even so at all different
levels and scales one of the things that has been most impressive to me about you
is the way you use certain techniques for breaking new ground socially and I
was just thinking recently I happened to be invited over to your place and you
had a group of very talented combat sports guys just an eclectic group it
was an eclectic group but it was but there was a common theme and the common
theme seemed to be people who were very skilled in a ring or in combat like
situations and it struck me that it was also incredibly diverse that in terms of
a diversity standard other than than the gendered issue it was people of
different hues different religions different cultural backgrounds different
age groups and it was one of the greatest salons and dinners I've been to in a
long time and it consisted largely of as the British say people taking the
piss out of each other yeah yeah and as a result the intimacy in the room was
off the charts people were really opening up people were being vulnerable
people were actually building each other up and somehow there is no
explanation for this behavior in the current cultural moment it's like we
forgotten what this is can you say a little bit about what you think is going
on well first of all I think that it's unfortunately most people don't think
they can make a difference with their ideas with their conversation with their
point of view with their actions that you know that that's that's a cynicism
it's a deep cynicism that seems to and I've always been an optimist and I've
always thought if you look at history it's usually a small group of people
with with a with a passionate set of ideas that get things moving I mean
sometimes it's not for the good in my opinion for example Russia in 1914 I mean
he had a very small group of intellectuals who got the communist
revolution started I might have been part of that back then if you looked at
the way you know Russia was but these are people that had the gumption and I
mean if you look at the abolitionist movement it was really started in in
England in I think in the 1840s it started but it was about these sort of
like evangelical Christians who said look you know no matter what we can do
this if you look even in this country John Brown these were fanatics but they
were a small energized group of people the Quakers they set these examples you
can even go into you know if you look think about the ramifications of the
marriage between I think it was Ibn Saud and and Wahab the marriage of those
kids and he they made a deal and he said let me preach let me preach my pure
Salafi Islam my puritanical version of Wahhabi Islam is back in the 1700 this
was in so well they met I think in 1744 but you know they subsequently so this
was a small group of very energetic people now I don't think a lot of times
the outcome is so positive in those in those instances but I for better or for
worse I think the way you beat a bad idea is with a better idea I'm quoting
Amos Oz who's the Israeli writer I never forgot him when he said that and the
way to come up with better ideas yeah is not to purify your echo chamber it's
not to get it's very tempting for guys like you and I you know it's very
exciting for me to be able to even be around guys like you I love Sam Harris
and you know I love Jordan Peterson and you're very you you guys are very
intelligent you're highly educated and aside from the fact that personally I
like you but but it would be very easy for all a button when you have a dinner
typically what you see is people who've read the same books listen to the same
Ted talks yeah watch the same programs and have a similar background
educational background I think that's boring I think I just do man I just love
getting a Navy SEAL a Pro Boxer who's never read a book and then I put him
with a D1 basketball player then I get a mathematician over there and then I get
an economist over here and then I'll throw in a 90 year old sometimes I like
to do that a guy who's lived forever who's an actor like my friend Jack Betts
and then I'll and then I'll throw in just two usually I'll get two people who I
know aren't going to say much but they want to listen you need an audience
and what you get right is idea sex you get an idea orgy we had an idea and
people know nobody looks at their phones man and it's 1.30 in the morning and
guess what everybody's learning from Eric Weinstein and I knew that was going
to happen because you come in you everybody there is you know heavy
arm and tighten the belly and everybody can talk about Manny Pacquiao but all
but all these all these controlled savages are like quoting poetry or
they're talking about history to me and you know it's just funny to hear you
say it I you know you say guys like you and I always felt the comedians and the
musicians and the people who you know even study chess or or jujitsu this is
all one family of people who have you know as I've called it before a
relationship with the unforgiving like in chess you make a move you take the
consequences of the move with rock climbing you make a reach for a bad
handhold you have to deal with whatever comes next comedy same thing
mathematics etc and so to me there is a commonality which is are you engaged in
some activity that is not that the where the feedback is not mediated by
somebody's choice like there's no judge when you're a rock climber who says well
I think that was an 8.3 yeah it's the rock yeah it's the rock yeah well I don't
I think sometimes anytime you have a group of people that are all in the same
discipline you know the one great thing so so you know we talk about fighting I
love to box and one of the guys there at Malik I don't know if you remember
Malik sure tall yeah tall thin look tall thin black guy about six one hundred
and fifty four pounds Malik's been boxing since he was seven now Malik was
gonna be on his way to be a world champion he gets world champions ready
I know from other people that Malik gives world champions or did give world
champions fits in the gym as in he'd light him up as in he's something
special and what's fun for me is trying to box with him and I talk trash and I
put in my mouthpiece in my headgear and I and and I I try to I cheat and I step
on his foot I kick him sometimes I do everything I can anytime he wants he
can he can put me to sleep anytime right and he's nice enough just to pat pat me
around and I I'm the old man I'm swinging I try to hit him I do everything I
can to try to hit him right when we're done he's taught me a couple things I'm
building my tree of knowledge when it comes to boxing I love doing anything
I'm bad at because it's humbling and somehow I think it opens other portals
you know it kind of somehow stimulates it I become better at comedy I become
better at things I don't know why and then what happens is we sit down and he
asks me because he's on this education kick because he didn't have the benefit
of an education because he was always boxing and so then it's time for me to
sort of tutor him as we're warming down and we just talk over a meal so it's a
beautiful kind of symbiotic relationship where I get so much from him and so
much wisdom and he gets so much from me now I'm also 20 years older it's the
only reason he can beat me all right whatever but the point is that there
there so I don't know if I'm answering your question question no you're
actually getting to another topic which I'm fascinated by you can continue the
riff or I can jump no please so there's a there's a I don't know how to say it
exactly but kind of a pattern that I've noticed I haven't heard much commented
upon which is that social interactions get really rich when people can pass
power back and forth in other words if you have some kind of power and you and
you sit on it it's not nearly as powerful as if I somehow give it away to
you and you give it back to me so for example if you look at a happy couple
maybe the man praises his wife to the hill talks about how he married up etc.
etc. and in return you know she talks about how you know what an honor it is
being with a man she can look up to and the idea is that they've both exchanged
power and built something in the diet but okay that's a very important that's
a very important idea and at the crux of why I put all these people from
different elks together right great same one so so one person has a hundred
million dollars the other person is having trouble making rent what I like
about putting all those people together that are so different is that yes yes
Eric you might be smarter at theoretical math but you have deficits too we all do
we all do so you're you may be a superstar over here yes Malik can knock
me out with a right hand but that is relevant only when we're in the ring
right right it's a little bit like so all of us have these deficits all of us
have these weaknesses where are you smart where are you brave where are you
strong well it depends but we are all dumb weak cowards depending somewhere
yes and so when you try to get good at something you learn very quickly what
your limitations are what your strengths are you learn a lot about yourself and
one of the cool things about people who've been in a ring or in a cage or on a mat
is they are very aware of how tough they're not there is no one who you know who fights who hasn't
been surprised surprised knocked out humbled you're not getting good at combat
which I'm not but you're not getting good at combat with a big ego enjoy that because what's
going to happen is they're going to figure you out you've got to constantly stay humble the best
fighters are the ones the ones that I know are the ones who are always going back to class always
learning so of course they're going to be humble of course they're going to give back of course
they're going it's like my buddy Amir Peretz who is uh who's this like Israeli you know badass
soldier but now teaches self-defense he's the most humble loving giving person in the world
because he has a very very intimate understanding of what real violence is about and how easy it is
how easy it is to take a life I mean we're just flesh and bone so there's no such thing is tough
there just isn't there just isn't I don't like those words there's no such thing probably as
strong that we are all terribly vulnerable you know I always talk about having children and
I hate loving something that much because it's like watching a balloon float around a hot lamp
well we're all that way well you're the first person actually who's uh said this this is what I
always tell people about having kids the main problem is that you don't want to love anything
as much as you end up loving your child I mean you know thanks for giving me something I I can't
bear to lose right you know Jesus so did you get emotional just now well yeah I mean because I
actually lived it you know I thought about a relative who lost a son and um you know we've
had two losses from auto accidents and you you see people just trans just transformed by a loss
that they couldn't control there's no way to protect against it and what it left me with
was this idea that nobody you're the most enviable person in the world is one knock on the door away
from being somebody that you would pity yeah you know you would just think that's so true and so
that's what that's what that's the weird thing for me about envy which is um I've never had a billion
dollars but I have a good friend with a billion dollars and he's let me borrow his lifestyle
for short periods of time I had another friend who owned an island and so you know he let me
borrow his island and so I've at least seen and felt a little bit through pretend and play what
it would be like to have a fantastic amount of money and I wish I could give this as a present
to everybody to just try out the lifestyle for a day or two and figure out what it would do for you
and what it doesn't do for you and one thing it doesn't do for you is that there's no way to keep
your children safe you can just do the there's there's no way dude that's that's for sure that
we are always I think Jordan Peterson was talking about you know in the bible the garden of Eden
still it's as great as it was a snake still got in yeah I mean as as even god couldn't keep a snake
out of the garden of Eden I mean there is always danger lurking and you have to come to terms with
that and one of the things that I think um I like about understanding violence at least shooting a
gun right getting knocked out getting tapped out getting close to that a little bit I went
to a war zone you know did stand up in Afghanistan in 2007 you at least you something about it makes
you feel way more alive man you feel a lot more alive um and maybe the closer to death you are the
more alive you feel and I gotta tell you after I came back I was talking to my buddy dove david
we were terrified all the time because the suicide bombings were at a high and he'd be in
these humvees and stuff I started getting addicted to that fear I mean I got I don't want to be
disrespectful anybody's been in a combat zone but just my the little bit I was there I think 11 or
