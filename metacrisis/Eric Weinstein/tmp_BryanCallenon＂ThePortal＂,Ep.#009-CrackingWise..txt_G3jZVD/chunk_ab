12 days I got and then we did a simulation firefight with you know lasers and stuff and I
I could feel that adrenaline I was I was jonesing for it for a long time afterwards and so was my
friend we talked about it I can't imagine going through a real firefight you know pga worked
that the author so he I wish I think it may have been tenison that he was actually referencing but
he he said um we used to discuss the drunk delight of battle before we decided that war was a bad
thing and you know I'm on record of saying that I like everything about war except for the death
and destruction that in some sense you need life and death risk at least to catalyze certain
things and then there's a question about does the life and death risk need to involve conflict
between people and one of the things I'm curious about is the structure of the buddy picture which
is a Hollywood staple and in the buddy picture you have to establish the two people really detest
each other and then they have to go through some sort of transformational conflict and only then
do they realize that they both have sort of a complementarity that allows them to be truly
close that's right look at what happens to guys who who hate each other before a fight in the UFC
beat the crap out of each other I mean they're full of blood what do they do they hug yeah they
hug well again most of the time there are times when no but most of the time they hug and we want
them to hug you know no no that well I mean boy there's so much to do right here you saw this
weird um briefest fight in the UFC this aspirin right yeah that was different that it wasn't
even a fight it was a surprise attack yeah that's Jorge Mazvedal that's that's you can't talk trash
to Jorge Mazvedal for three weeks before the fight the way aspirin does and then expect him not to
show boat a little bit you can't do that to Jorge for Jorge Mazvedal that's a real fight
and he he still doesn't like it like he said he goes if I see him in super margarine he might get
slapped up because I don't like him yeah well so this is the issue that some fights are transformational
and they they produce a closeness and some fights don't resolve whatever the tension is and so
one of the things I'm super curious about is is it your experience like if I think about the
fist fights I got in um growing up I would say that I ended up closer to about half of the people
that I fought and it had to do with some I don't know intangible ineffable quality I can't quite
put my finger on can you say when it is that you find that a fight can be transformational in male
intimacy I don't know I think I think it I think look I mean we are fighting is the purest of sport
in a way I mean what is football it's a game of inches yes but it's it's simulated war it's like
multiple layers of indirection from war that's right basketball baseball these are even more
these are very I mean the competition is very heated these guys are giving it their all
there's something about fighting where especially when it's MMA or something
but for that matter really boxing I think where you where you're coming as close as you can get
almost to what it's like to see a man kill another man or a woman nowadays kill another
woman with their bare hands there is something primordial to that that brings us back to when we
were you know when when we first evolved you know well so we talked sometimes about the
chomsky and pregrammer of language and I've in other places talked about the is there a chomsky
and pregrammer of religion and is there a chomsky and pregrammer of violence where whether we've
we I think we were probably communicating way before language developed language well that's
I mean I can I can there are parts of the world I know I can get in a fight right away just
just by holding a stair and the way I'm standing I promise I can get a guy to go what's a you got
a problem you want to get in the fight really very quickly I'll take you down I'll take it to
Brooklyn I'll take it to Long Island I'll take you to I'll take it up anywhere in Boston or Philly
I promise for that matter Jersey right and and by the way not necessarily in LA but let me take it
the Inland Empire yeah just stand and stare for a little bit right just posture up something's
going to happen you know so we are very aware I think we have antenna that has been have been
developed over millennia for when somebody's trying to take what's ours and I always say this
about I'm writing about vulnerability now yeah I'm writing about what it what you know men are
supposed to be vulnerable and we're supposed to sit with our sad and cry and get in touch with all
okay all right man but I'm doing points I'm dealing with a lot of genetic residue for a long time
you know I had to hunt you know with with a spear or whatever and I had to you know I
have to believe that a lot of this is wired and and if you think of what it was to be a human
being in most cases throughout our history whether we were in a small village or whatever if you were
in a vulnerable if you were in a forget for that matter you could have been in Baghdad in 1258
and the Mongols are Constantinople and what was it 14 something when the the Ottomans broke down
the wall the our history has been here they come over the hill they're gonna they're gonna break
down our walls and kill us and take our women and children as slaves right that's the story of history
yeah if you'll forgive me if I'm not a little bit ready all the time to fight for my life well so
this is boy am I glad we're we're here sometimes I think about the idea that vulnerability has to
be earned through strength so for example if you look at Vin Diesel if he's wearing a feather boa
it's only because he's Vin Diesel he can't wear a feather boa if you're not really you gotta have
a little another man's blood on the on the feather well you know or I don't know if you ever saw
what was it with Tim Roth as the swordsman and there's a great duel in the end is it Rob Roy
and he's like he's he's there with his like frilly cuffs and thing but he's got better
swords sword ability than anybody and he's just completely deadly yeah and so in some weird way
in order to be comfortable with that vulnerability you actually it it's almost like the dessert
that comes from having proven yourself as somebody to be not to be trifled well I think
that it's an interesting thing because when you really study the language of vulnerability the
dog again the fighters that you know I know enough combat navy seals and these guys
I think they have a real sense of their own mortality I mean because they've
either had to take lives or they've seen their friend I mean it's so it happens so quickly
it's a combination of they become vulnerable but they don't sweat the small stuff I think a lot
of this politically correct insanity about you said this word and that makes you a racist or
whatever it is we're just we're so offended all the time most of those people it goes back to what
you were saying we don't have an existential threat anymore and so most of those people don't
really know and haven't really suffered because they're mostly white they haven't really suffered
this this egregious racism slash Ezra Klein God bless him but Ezra you know he he I listened to his
his him talk and stuff and I mean Ezra is so painfully educated and I can tell he's read every
book in the world and he lives in Washington DC and he probably has great dinner parties and he's
friends with all kinds of intelligent intelligentsia and and he can talk about how vicious slave
holder Thomas Jefferson was and would beat me at any debate but I don't think Ezra necessarily
really is friends with anybody who works with their hands who smokes or who has punched people
in the face for a living and it's not a knock on him and I might be wrong about him I just
I think that that his I think if we were under in different circumstances we wouldn't have time
for this shit we wouldn't have time for the shit let me make another point sure when I
this is a better way to say it I watch when I'm in a restaurant and I'm and and it's a busy
restaurant and I see a woman from Malaysia another one from the Philippines another guy's black
another guy's Chinese and otherwise I don't know what they look like there's a wonderful
composite then there's a couple white people and they're all trying to get food to the customers
I promise you no one there is thinking about what your sexual orientation is what your color
fuck off I'm trying to get food on the table bro right and this noise this noise over here you
people are making that well that this is not fair this is what we're like dude okay good I got work
to do man I got work to do I'm making a living here can you get the fuck away from me and let
let the economy do what it's supposed to do right that's why ultimately I'm a free market guy get
out of my way with your I don't think we're free anymore I think we're taking our freedoms away
from you can't say anything you can't express an unpopular point of view well so this would be
a portal point and something I'd be super interested in developing for a while we started
we started hearing comedians saying I won't play colleges anymore yeah that colleges have become
unfun it it throws me off my comedy game it's not something I want to be doing because people
are so easily offended and part of the function of comedy was to explore that which is offensive
and to give people access where normally they would sort of block it off and not be able to do it
and then Joe Rogan our mutual friend said uh something interesting to me he said it is now
the golden age of comedy I said what and he said well we've started figuring out how to tell these
jokes after a period where we couldn't figure out what had gone wrong and the best people
are now able to explore these things because some new skill level had been unlocked does that resonate
with you as a stand-up I don't know as you're saying it I was thinking hmm that's an interesting
thing it's certainly way more lucrative now and it's easier to reach a wider audience and also
your own audience so you know you can niche so you and Joe might have different audiences well
well we may have the same I don't know but we probably have a similar audience but I think
it's much easier to find your niche and so that can be a little bit deceptive okay right
so I don't know the answer he might be right about that I do think there's some great comedy out
there and I think it's needed I think people like Bill Burr and Jim Jeffries and Rogan are needed
because they're satirists and and it's probably the last place on earth where you can really
speak your mind and express unpopular points of view without uh suffering the kinds of ramifications
you would if you worked at Google Facebook uh or the People's Republic of Apple you know
wherever it might be these places are pretty tyrannical it seems I don't know I haven't worked
well you mentioned Bill Burr so I again I I don't know if you know this but I did 10 to 15 minutes
of stand-up that's all I've ever done I didn't know that it was you're very funny it's very it was
very terrifying and very and very fun um but it was more or less impromptu uh one of the things
that I felt um as an outsider though other than that I have no experience is that when I saw Bill
Burr talking about particularly gendered issues I felt like I was watching Alex Honnold the rock
climber go up El Capitan it was so it was so fraught it was so dangerous of course it was um
can we can we geek out for a second who is who is innovating really new stuff and and not from
the perspective of being in the audience but you know like there there's a secret bar behind the
comedy club we were just discussing and I was was invited back there I got a chance to listen to
what are comedians talking about in terms of craft can you take us in to this world what is going
on in Chappelle Chappelle and rock are still doing it there's still they're still taking on whatever
whatever is sacred territory um I don't know that there are I don't know that there are any
innovations I think I think the the only the only thing you can do with stand-up is to you know I
always say write about what you're ashamed of what you're afraid of who you're who you're pretending
to be versus who you really are these deeper questions how do you want to die what do you want
to say when you die what don't you want to say when you die you know these are the kinds of things
what do you want god to say to you when you die if there is such a such a thing what if there is
god and you don't believe these are the questions that I like to play on fears and ask questions I
think that's where you get um that's and it goes back to the salon thing that's where I think you
start sort of uh striking common ground with your audience right so when we one of the things I
truly believe and it comes from the fact that I lived in seven different countries until I was 14
years old really yeah I was born the Philippines I then moved to Calcutta then Bombay or Mumbai
and then uh say Mumbai I know right well so it's Bombay well our family so you know my wife and my
wife from Bombay she's the one who told me right so she's the one who corrected me well so by now
I say Bombay so the weird thing is that it's one of these things where educated people think that
Mumbai is the hot happening that's what I say sophisticated way and I think her perspective
is that that was actually the result of the Shiv Sena who had a Maharashtra from Maharashtra's
campaign so Bombay sorry he didn't mean that people I don't know I don't know I'm trying to be popular
what's your point of view I'm trying to jump on your bandwagon well just just that it's like New
York state realizing that New York City is captured okay and deciding that's going to enforce New
York state culture on New York City which is much more cosmopolitan so Bombay all right but you
were so you've lived in so the Bombay then Lebanon then Pakistan then Lebanon again the war broke
out stuck there for six months evacuated to Greece then Saudi Arabia then I'm 14 years old I go to
boarding school in Massachusetts then college down in Washington DC and then and then of course LA
New York New York LA back and forth and finally I'm the international movie star that I am now well
TV but but so so so my experience my experience being around all those people all those Muslims
and all those Hindus and all those Christians and all those all those Arabs and all those
Pakistanis and all those Indians and all those Filipinos and all those Afghanis and all those
Ethiopians and Eritreans and Somalis like the 12 days yeah and by the way in in that I travel to
communist Russia communist China when it really was communist Russia and communist China Yemen
Syria I was everywhere I mean you can Jordan you name it seeing things like leprosy advanced
stages of leprosy in the marketplaces of Yemen I mean terrifying things and feeling so lucky to be an
American and and knowing not knowing why I was never hungry but seeing real starvation in Kenya
and Tanzania and the outskirts and and the guilt the fucking guilt of going what why am I so protected
why do I feel safe and so so full of food and I'm watching you know I'm a pretty compassionate
imaginative person I hope enough to be enough to feel guilty right but the one thing I got from
that experience was that essentially I don't give a shit what your religion what your culture is
essentially we're all very much the same we all enjoy humorous insults we all which just goes back
to you know and we all want a better life for our kids and we all love to laugh and we all want to
feel safe and all you have to do with anybody from a different culture and I don't care where they're
from right is see them acknowledge that they are like you compliment them a little bit maybe
know a little bit about where they're from or ask them some questions about what it's like to be who
they are and man oh man well all the doors open and so that's why in my salons yeah as it were
I I I love proving that over and over again by taking the most eclectic group I can and throwing
them all together and watching all those ideas find you know I guess life and that that's the secret
well so one of the things that I think about in this area is how much
to get this formula to work it really requires skill and there's an old definition of a gentleman
that I'm very partial to which is a gentleman is someone is a man who is never rude by accident
and I think one of the problems we're having is that there are people at very different skill
levels and so if you think about you know the terrifying words that one must not say
that really is sort of an admonition when everyone is now broadcasting via social media or their
you know podcasting or twitter feed whatever it is that we're now frightened that people are very
low skill and low experience are going to start opining at scale about things that in in ways
that are really destructive so for example if you think about how far we've come from George
Carlin's observations Carlin died right before the financial crisis and you know his perspective
was that there wasn't a word you can't say there are no bad words there are bad contexts there
bad people there may be bad intentions we're now in a world where Bill Maher is lectured
by a guy who founds NWA as to what words he can't say how does how does that shake out
I think that's just a bad idea that will will be scrapped eventually I don't know how much damage
it will do it's a fat a lot of these bad ideas are repackaged and and they will cause their damage
but hopefully because we have enough history to draw from hopefully uh they will lose their
relevance I worry that there's this there's this strange movement to go back to old-fashioned
collectivism I mean this old-fashioned idea of socialism and even communism and Marxism and
and I uh I don't know what this is these are young people who don't and as I really I really pay
attention to it they don't have a command of history they don't know a lot they just don't
maybe I'm just older and I've done more reading or living but I lived in those socialist utopias
and and and I went to those countries when they were very earnestly socialist and communist and
and I'm always amazed that these ideas and they come out of academia they come out of these
professors and I know a lot of them and I've arguments with them on my other podcast um
they they are people who just don't have a lot of it I don't care how smart you are I don't care
how many books you read you my friend don't make the trains run on time you my friend I've never
had to make turn a profit with a real business you live behind walls in a university and those
people are important but they can also be just as dangerous as somebody with no ideas so it's very
what would you point out just to riff off of that is that um what if you have a system which
