into other languages they'd switch into discussions of science or really abstract discussions of
history for the material and i came to think of comedians very often as being kind of unregulated
super minds is that something that you think is i mean is that i don't think so do you know where
it comes from and i've been i've been in the business too long to think that most most comedians
aren't interested in anything but i mean steve martin yes like banjo and the robin williams
who switch into a million different head spaces in space well i mean look at the the i always say
that i'm in the business the the one thing i that drives me is original self-expression okay
that's what i'm interested in i'm interested in expressing myself fully and originally
and that responsibility is always pretty daunting you know you want and so whatever it takes you
know there's there's uh you get to a point as a comic where you know how to make people laugh i can
write stuff and that's a bag of tricks then can you be thematic can you be original can you be
saying something um and though that's where the real challenge is you get older you're writing
an hour of comedy well you know okay let's see what happens now what what are you trying to
talk about i mean i spend all this time boxing and trying to stay in shape and
going beyond my biology and being ready and you know and keeping my home safe and whatever it might
be but there are too many flanks to cover well where's the funny in that you know i'm gonna die
i'm getting older and i'm way more vulnerable than i can even imagine so um again like let's see
if i can be original about that and let's see if i can discover something and shock myself and
surprise myself with with my next uh 60 minutes of comedy that that i guess so so unregulated
super minds i don't think of it that way i just think about um how i'm gonna say dysregulated
oh dysregulated okay yeah dysregulated yeah i i just uh it's a huge privilege to belong to this
very small fraternity this small group of people that can get up in front of anybody in the world
and make them laugh i i that's never lost on me right so i i i feel very lucky that i can do that
and that i'm part of this small group of people that that does that over and over again so you
have have shown like essentially no interest promoting your own stuff i wonder if i could just
ask you to take a couple of younger colleagues and maybe lift them up for our audience who
should we be watching who's coming up who you think is really deep in terms of observation
and saying use use the comedy directly car michael was doing stand-up for a long time and
i think he said he wanted to quit which is a tragedy because he was so unique uh and his
success is not an accident i he was opening for myself and a guy named dove david off one of my
favorite comics and favorite people and and uh i just immediately was shocked at how smart this
kid was no money uh i think he comes from north carolina and he he was spike lee found him and
he did some specials but they don't do it justice he's just a very special guy um
but uh in terms of sort of the younger up-and-coming folk uh i i i think ali mckofsky is really
funny i think a guy named chappell lacy is really funny i think um i think faheem anwar is really
funny uh there are some really these are people of the comedy store go to the comedy store okay
and on a tuesday night on a wednesday night on a thursday night and sit in the original room
and uh i promise you you'll see some people you've never heard of that'll crack your ribs
and uh and those those names come to mind immediately just funny i mean funny and then
you've got the people like sebastian and all these other people that are working and i have
already arrived but but yeah there there are a lot of young people who are who are again responding
to a confusing time right they're responding to this confusion it's coming into the comedy world
i mean you know those old things you say things you can't say and i mean geez all right well you
know i mean i don't think there should be any rules well i think that the rule that i like
is that the more skilled you are and the more your comedy ultimately uplifts people the more
not only should you be allowed to say but the the more you're obligated for the rest of us to show us
how to find the humor the absurdity and i was was talking to gotta be humor for christ's sake
and you hear stories about people who are in hijack situation hostage situations
even in even in even in prisoners of war they tell fucking jokes right it's all you've got man
sometime well you know has you ever read this short piece again by pjowork which i think is
titled is it serious no and his point is um lies are said with incredible earnestness but it is
truth that is uttered with a dismissive giggle and i just loved geez it was really good he talks
about um this was it thomas more you know being executed or forget who and he says um you know
what his last his last utterances were were jokes about make sure not to miss your mark because i
wouldn't want to create a mess or something like that and you know i think about that as
i tend to believe people who are kind of smirking and giggling without being mean about it just as
a sign of like well hey i'm actually plugged into the madness of all of the tensions in the world
rather than just ideologically saying i know which way to go yeah do you um yeah tell me about
your fascination with science which you're trying to hide and cover up well um i just think that
it's um like maybe like mathematics i mean there's a there's a there's first of all there's a lot of
people who claim that this is scientific and things like that and blah blah blah but um
i like science because at the heart of science it seems that the you start with doubt and you
continue with doubt and uh and usually the i guess i would define science or the scientific method as
that which you can measure and that which you can replicate under the same circumstances i think
i'm right about that i mean to an extent at least that there's a there's a truth to that that you
can't deny well you know if you're if you're anti-vaccine please pick up a history book you
or just a piece of literature to see what smallpox diphtheria measles mumps and all these other
terrible diseases did to people i mean if you really are anti-antibiotics if you don't like
antibiotics well i don't know if you know what consumption is but it's tuberculosis and it killed
a lot of people including Chopin and some of the greatest minds so um we've pushed way beyond our
biology and the those scientists like Fleming etc um those scientists those physicists uh
we owe them a great debt of gratitude the people that invented things like the geiger counter and
x-rays and you know these these and and and and a thousand who experimented on their own family
i mean i was just thinking about i think it's ronkins wife's hand being x-rayed there's a giant
ring on it yeah um yeah and then got you know leukemia or something well you know Marie Curie
yeah i was gonna say another one of these curie you know i don't know if you know benjamin jesty
so this was a like a gentleman farmer who was a physician and he noticed that the milkmaids
never got smallpox that's right that's right and so he injected his own family with the puss from
cows to give them all cowpox reasoning the cowpox protected you against deadly smallpox
how crazy is it that you're willing to experiment on your family or this guy who did um
the that ulcers are not actually caused by stress by a bacteria right lori or something
exactly you know this the badass school of science where you actually have cured hepatitis c which
killed my cousin is that right yes we've cured hepatitis c hep C is at least in northern europeans
i don't know if it's still because i know interferon didn't work at all with african americans but it
worked with uh northern europeans to an extent if you have any other different things you different
biologies but um i mean we have i think it's a nine month regimen where we've we cure it ladies and
gentlemen cure it so i remember the AIDS epidemic i i watched my neighbors die slowly and without
dignity i watched how horrible that disease was i was in new york city i was in a theater scene i was
was an acting class i watched young beautiful men die horribly they had carpose sarcoma they had
lesions all over their faces they had one thing after another i had another friend who wouldn't
let us see him in the hospital because he was when i went to college with him and he just
he just looked like he looked it would give you trauma to look at him i watched it i saw them die
and then i saw uh something called protease inhibitors come along and these motherfuckers had
to rebuy their property because they all sold it and they had to rebuy it and now they all live
normal lives and in fact the AIDS virus has been compromised so often uh because of these different
kinds of cocktail drugs uh that are becoming less and less toxic it's it's had to compromise
itself so often that it is now something you probably can live with like diabetes only the
difference is you don't have to take drugs because it's become such a weakened virus that's what
happens yay yay to western science yay to science forget western science yay to science
doesn't belong to anybody doesn't belong to the west or the east yay to to experimentation
yay to doubt yay to reason and compassion where reason serves compassion i mean this is
the thing that makes me bananas if we had started to tell ourselves i mean i don't know if you
remember this one of the lies about AIDS was that it just began in the homosexual community
and that there was no difference between heterosexual and homosexual transmission
and that was a an attempt at a compassionate lie yeah but it was not actually wasn't true well but
it was also not compassionate because the more that you told these sort of superficial lies
the less you could actually get at who was at risk why and well news organizations and and i
read a book about it i think it was called the news about the news i'm not sure i was
worked at cbs or and and there was a lot of pressure on news organizations to go out and find
heterosexuals with AIDS right and they combed the the landscape for it and found a couple of
women who were straight who had AIDS just to make sure that it wasn't just a gay disease
well in fact it wasn't well but but but but so why so they they couldn't figure out why it was a
heterosexual disease in southeast asia and africa but it wasn't in in north nor in europe
in european populations in the middle east well why why was it also a certain
and gay men got it uh but in fact the gay men that did get it were the ones taking
you know the bottoms if you will right tops a lot of times survive the epidemic and i know a
number of them who did it through my theater days we couldn't figure it out was it a secondary
infection was it health care in africa no what what happened was the bubonic plague i think
what you and i talked about and they have what if you survive the bubonic plague uh and you you
have some gene variation that developed where you have a resistance to the actual disease
unless it's pushed into your body with a hyperdermic needle or or somebody's dick if you will you
know but but otherwise it's going to be hard to contract it that's why the army couldn't figure
out they've test everybody for AIDS and it was the the cases were slim to vanishing and at least
people that were admittedly heterosexual right uh and then we started to see that there was
something going on here that that it was it did discriminate the disease did discriminate
not because god said it so but because there was a genetic there was a generic genetic mutation
thanks to the bubonic plague uh but anyway so so why do i like science i guess it gives me some
answers no but it's more than you like science i mean you're pretty uh you incorporate science
into your comedy yeah and i was curious as to whether those two parts of your brain play
harmoniously and i i would be so lucky you have i mean i'm nowhere i'm not even your area code
in terms of your ability to jump between the romantics and i've never seen anything like it
i've never seen how many comics have you jumped between this i mean you you're all over the place
i don't know man you have a deeper i mean your ability to movies and literature and poetry and
music and so i actually never met anybody like that i'm very flat you're a polymath that's
how i feel about you the the thing i was trying to figure out though and it's something i haven't
cracked uh it would be um can we use comedy as a means of delivering deeper analytic truths is
there a natural fit so for example if i make something rhyme the brain remembers it more easily
i i i set people by saying things that rhyme are more likely to be true and what i really mean
is that when people work out a very pithy aphorism or or a rhyme to remember something
it meant somebody said this was important enough to construct something that the brain will find
sticky and a joke like almost every joke contains an element of surprise if you saw it coming it
wouldn't be fun that's right that's right that's right yes and the answer is of course comedy is
the lubrication comedy is lubricant of course look if you want to change somebody's mind
as jonathan height said you gotta you've gotta make them feel safe you know this is this is
this is where i'd have sam harris and he does a good job for the most part but i'd have him read
the righteous mind again if he hasn't i mean you know jonathan heights damn right about the fact
that if you want to change somebody's mind strike some common ground first you can't tell somebody
who's religious who because their religion gives them meaning and it gives them a feeling of safety
right you cannot tell them you cannot tell them that they are like like laurence krauss and people
like that you know you can't say you believe in a fairy tale it was a book written by peasants
two thousand years ago that makes me really angry when people well that's what laurence
krauss did on my podcast and i said laurence you're you are not building a fucking bridge here
dude i mean you are you can sit there and be right as a physicist all day long but i mean
okay cool dude i mean you're doing zero you're doing you're doing a great job of destroying
you're doing nothing to persuade and destruction is way easier than persuasion it really is it's
my problem with cancel life cancel culture etc so so this is interesting i hadn't heard this before
in some weird way and correct me if i'm wrong there is something about the rationality movement
the skeptical movement that is interested in cancellation of its own but it's canceling religious
culture i think so i i get very worried when somebody uses the word rational over and over
again because they they are religious in their own way they're praying to the god of rationality
i don't think that all the answers lie there yes if you want to figure out a way to have fresh
fruit and vegetable vegetables in the wintertime rationality math science yes if you want to push
ourselves beyond our biology with vaccines and antibiotics of course but man listen listen listen
don't take my mythology away from me do not try to take my romance i like not knowing i love i like
i love not knowing what's not being able to explain certain things look it's like this
if i take a piano and smash it into a thousand pieces and and put it in a big sack i could say
this is a piano but it's not a piano it's not a piano when it's sitting in in a corner it's a
piano only when somebody gets sits down and learns how to touch it just so it's exactly like i think
was alice huxley who was darwin's bulldog you know and and they had this good nature debate at
this this college that and and matthew arnold the american you know poet slash writer slash
philosopher and and there was this great debate where alice huxley said uh you know we were man
started as protozoa and became this pointy eared long-tailed hominid and then we we became
man and i i had that proof because it's called the origin of the species yes absolutely or
there's no question that uh evolution is true uh i believe in evolution but as matthew arnold said
maybe it is true we started we started as pros over became monkeys but there was something about
that monkey that inspired it to greek there was something about that monkey yeah that created
the deep and dark writings of esclis and sophokles uh shakespear the parthenon bethoven motzart duke
ellington uh louis armstrong and the list fucking goes on eric weinstein and it goes on and off
there was something about that that that that um that created beauty for its own sake you know it's
that beautiful that beautiful schiller line man is it man is truly is never more himself than when
at play and play being defined as that thing which you do for its own sake um don't take that
shit away from me i don't want to explain anything bro look it's worse than this we are driving
mysticism narrative fiction out of science when the really amazing science the stuff that is
you know that that is like going to church is increasingly put under pressure from the sort
of skeptic uh rationality community and i skepticism and rationality are super important
to both of us yeah but there's this other impulse which is the imaginative impulse and when you
sick rationality and skepticism on the imaginative impulse at an early stage you are killing the
thing that built all of the rationality to begin with inspiration do you know what this is this
is a climb bottle and the weird thing about it is is that it only really exists in four dimensions
so this is a model of climb bottle we technically we would say it is immersed in our three because
this handle should not be going through this part of the bottle and so there's no inside and no
outside it's like a two mobius bands sewn together the only reason i learned about the climb bottle
was that i was given my father xerox something in his office when i was growing up for the national
lampoon it was this it was a fundraiser for terminal flatulence that looked really official
right that you showed a toilet blown apart and uh you know people suffer from terminal flatulence
but it is potentially curable so at the end of this crazy like foundation promotion fundraiser
on the back page of this thing was a short story about a climb bottle that was used as a
contraceptive device and the idea is that it would take the sperm and send it to the fourth
dimension so no one would get pregnant but this guy gets stuck in the climb bottle now this is a
completely crazy insane thing but i'd never heard of a climb bottle yeah and i remember reading the
