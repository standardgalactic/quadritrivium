Weinstein impression uh no I don't you're gonna say the fifth you're too
staid right he is not yet that's right there's something about you that's
very um you're too thoughtful in a good way say it again so thoughtful you're a
warrior of the mind right I have to do the head turn okay I think I can't what
is the head turn just start hi this is Eric Weinstein and you found the portal
today I am joined by none other than my friend Brian Callan Brian welcome it's
good to be in the portal my friend yeah I'm not worthy first of all let me say
that I'm let me apologize to your guests I'm not worthy I'm nothing but a lowly
comic athletic yes but that's about all supple dangerous at times giving always
well I think this is the first time we've started with that level of insincere
groveling but thank you Brian for breaking new territory it's good I've
been a fan of yours for a long time and I yours sir stop okay now here's the thing
first of all I want to say that I so love your conversational style that
anytime you start hosting this feel free but we're just we're just beginning
the portal and what we're trying to do with with the show in the series is two
separate things one I think we're gonna have a great time being here and
interviewing lots of interesting people but there's a sort of a theme running
through it which is that I think a lot of people have realized that we've been in
some kind of a stasis and that some of us may have found ways to break out of
whatever this kind of malaise or miasma that settled over the country is and
we're trying to find the people and the concepts that might give people some
some new options to think about how to break free of whatever might be holding
them in place or their communities or the country even so at all different
levels and scales one of the things that has been most impressive to me about you
is the way you use certain techniques for breaking new ground socially and I
was just thinking recently I happened to be invited over to your place and you
had a group of very talented combat sports guys just an eclectic group it
was an eclectic group but it was but there was a common theme and the common
theme seemed to be people who were very skilled in a ring or in combat like
situations and it struck me that it was also incredibly diverse that in terms of
a diversity standard other than than the gendered issue it was people of
different hues different religions different cultural backgrounds different
age groups and it was one of the greatest salons and dinners I've been to in a
long time and it consisted largely of as the British say people taking the
piss out of each other yeah yeah and as a result the intimacy in the room was
off the charts people were really opening up people were being vulnerable
people were actually building each other up and somehow there is no
explanation for this behavior in the current cultural moment it's like we
forgotten what this is can you say a little bit about what you think is going
on well first of all I think that it's unfortunately most people don't think
they can make a difference with their ideas with their conversation with their
point of view with their actions that you know that that's that's a cynicism
it's a deep cynicism that seems to and I've always been an optimist and I've
always thought if you look at history it's usually a small group of people
with with a with a passionate set of ideas that get things moving I mean
sometimes it's not for the good in my opinion for example Russia in 1914 I mean
he had a very small group of intellectuals who got the communist
revolution started I might have been part of that back then if you looked at
the way you know Russia was but these are people that had the gumption and I
mean if you look at the abolitionist movement it was really started in in
England in I think in the 1840s it started but it was about these sort of
like evangelical Christians who said look you know no matter what we can do
this if you look even in this country John Brown these were fanatics but they
were a small energized group of people the Quakers they set these examples you
can even go into you know if you look think about the ramifications of the
marriage between I think it was Ibn Saud and and Wahab the marriage of those
kids and he they made a deal and he said let me preach let me preach my pure
Salafi Islam my puritanical version of Wahhabi Islam is back in the 1700 this
was in so well they met I think in 1744 but you know they subsequently so this
was a small group of very energetic people now I don't think a lot of times
the outcome is so positive in those in those instances but I for better or for
worse I think the way you beat a bad idea is with a better idea I'm quoting
Amos Oz who's the Israeli writer I never forgot him when he said that and the
way to come up with better ideas yeah is not to purify your echo chamber it's
not to get it's very tempting for guys like you and I you know it's very
exciting for me to be able to even be around guys like you I love Sam Harris
and you know I love Jordan Peterson and you're very you you guys are very
intelligent you're highly educated and aside from the fact that personally I
like you but but it would be very easy for all a button when you have a dinner
typically what you see is people who've read the same books listen to the same
Ted talks yeah watch the same programs and have a similar background
educational background I think that's boring I think I just do man I just love
getting a Navy SEAL a Pro Boxer who's never read a book and then I put him
with a D1 basketball player then I get a mathematician over there and then I get
an economist over here and then I'll throw in a 90 year old sometimes I like
to do that a guy who's lived forever who's an actor like my friend Jack Betts
and then I'll and then I'll throw in just two usually I'll get two people who I
know aren't going to say much but they want to listen you need an audience
and what you get right is idea sex you get an idea orgy we had an idea and
people know nobody looks at their phones man and it's 1.30 in the morning and
guess what everybody's learning from Eric Weinstein and I knew that was going
to happen because you come in you everybody there is you know heavy
arm and tighten the belly and everybody can talk about Manny Pacquiao but all
but all these all these controlled savages are like quoting poetry or
they're talking about history to me and you know it's just funny to hear you
say it I you know you say guys like you and I always felt the comedians and the
musicians and the people who you know even study chess or or jujitsu this is
all one family of people who have you know as I've called it before a
relationship with the unforgiving like in chess you make a move you take the
consequences of the move with rock climbing you make a reach for a bad
handhold you have to deal with whatever comes next comedy same thing
mathematics etc and so to me there is a commonality which is are you engaged in
some activity that is not that the where the feedback is not mediated by
somebody's choice like there's no judge when you're a rock climber who says well
I think that was an 8.3 yeah it's the rock yeah it's the rock yeah well I don't
I think sometimes anytime you have a group of people that are all in the same
discipline you know the one great thing so so you know we talk about fighting I
love to box and one of the guys there at Malik I don't know if you remember
Malik sure tall yeah tall thin look tall thin black guy about six one hundred
and fifty four pounds Malik's been boxing since he was seven now Malik was
gonna be on his way to be a world champion he gets world champions ready
I know from other people that Malik gives world champions or did give world
champions fits in the gym as in he'd light him up as in he's something
special and what's fun for me is trying to box with him and I talk trash and I
put in my mouthpiece in my headgear and I and and I I try to I cheat and I step
on his foot I kick him sometimes I do everything I can anytime he wants he
can he can put me to sleep anytime right and he's nice enough just to pat pat me
around and I I'm the old man I'm swinging I try to hit him I do everything I
can to try to hit him right when we're done he's taught me a couple things I'm
building my tree of knowledge when it comes to boxing I love doing anything
I'm bad at because it's humbling and somehow I think it opens other portals
you know it kind of somehow stimulates it I become better at comedy I become
better at things I don't know why and then what happens is we sit down and he
asks me because he's on this education kick because he didn't have the benefit
of an education because he was always boxing and so then it's time for me to
sort of tutor him as we're warming down and we just talk over a meal so it's a
beautiful kind of symbiotic relationship where I get so much from him and so
much wisdom and he gets so much from me now I'm also 20 years older it's the
only reason he can beat me all right whatever but the point is that there
there so I don't know if I'm answering your question question no you're
actually getting to another topic which I'm fascinated by you can continue the
riff or I can jump no please so there's a there's a I don't know how to say it
exactly but kind of a pattern that I've noticed I haven't heard much commented
upon which is that social interactions get really rich when people can pass
power back and forth in other words if you have some kind of power and you and
you sit on it it's not nearly as powerful as if I somehow give it away to
you and you give it back to me so for example if you look at a happy couple
maybe the man praises his wife to the hill talks about how he married up etc.
etc. and in return you know she talks about how you know what an honor it is
being with a man she can look up to and the idea is that they've both exchanged
power and built something in the diet but okay that's a very important that's
a very important idea and at the crux of why I put all these people from
different elks together right great same one so so one person has a hundred
million dollars the other person is having trouble making rent what I like
about putting all those people together that are so different is that yes yes
Eric you might be smarter at theoretical math but you have deficits too we all do
we all do so you're you may be a superstar over here yes Malik can knock
me out with a right hand but that is relevant only when we're in the ring
right right it's a little bit like so all of us have these deficits all of us
have these weaknesses where are you smart where are you brave where are you
strong well it depends but we are all dumb weak cowards depending somewhere
yes and so when you try to get good at something you learn very quickly what
your limitations are what your strengths are you learn a lot about yourself and
one of the cool things about people who've been in a ring or in a cage or on a mat
is they are very aware of how tough they're not there is no one who you know who fights who hasn't
been surprised surprised knocked out humbled you're not getting good at combat
which I'm not but you're not getting good at combat with a big ego enjoy that because what's
going to happen is they're going to figure you out you've got to constantly stay humble the best
fighters are the ones the ones that I know are the ones who are always going back to class always
learning so of course they're going to be humble of course they're going to give back of course
they're going it's like my buddy Amir Peretz who is uh who's this like Israeli you know badass
soldier but now teaches self-defense he's the most humble loving giving person in the world
because he has a very very intimate understanding of what real violence is about and how easy it is
how easy it is to take a life I mean we're just flesh and bone so there's no such thing is tough
there just isn't there just isn't I don't like those words there's no such thing probably as
strong that we are all terribly vulnerable you know I always talk about having children and
I hate loving something that much because it's like watching a balloon float around a hot lamp
well we're all that way well you're the first person actually who's uh said this this is what I
always tell people about having kids the main problem is that you don't want to love anything
as much as you end up loving your child I mean you know thanks for giving me something I I can't
bear to lose right you know Jesus so did you get emotional just now well yeah I mean because I
actually lived it you know I thought about a relative who lost a son and um you know we've
had two losses from auto accidents and you you see people just trans just transformed by a loss
that they couldn't control there's no way to protect against it and what it left me with
was this idea that nobody you're the most enviable person in the world is one knock on the door away
from being somebody that you would pity yeah you know you would just think that's so true and so
that's what that's what that's the weird thing for me about envy which is um I've never had a billion
dollars but I have a good friend with a billion dollars and he's let me borrow his lifestyle
for short periods of time I had another friend who owned an island and so you know he let me
borrow his island and so I've at least seen and felt a little bit through pretend and play what
it would be like to have a fantastic amount of money and I wish I could give this as a present
to everybody to just try out the lifestyle for a day or two and figure out what it would do for you
and what it doesn't do for you and one thing it doesn't do for you is that there's no way to keep
your children safe you can just do the there's there's no way dude that's that's for sure that
we are always I think Jordan Peterson was talking about you know in the bible the garden of Eden
still it's as great as it was a snake still got in yeah I mean as as even god couldn't keep a snake
out of the garden of Eden I mean there is always danger lurking and you have to come to terms with
that and one of the things that I think um I like about understanding violence at least shooting a
gun right getting knocked out getting tapped out getting close to that a little bit I went
to a war zone you know did stand up in Afghanistan in 2007 you at least you something about it makes
you feel way more alive man you feel a lot more alive um and maybe the closer to death you are the
more alive you feel and I gotta tell you after I came back I was talking to my buddy dove david
we were terrified all the time because the suicide bombings were at a high and he'd be in
these humvees and stuff I started getting addicted to that fear I mean I got I don't want to be
disrespectful anybody's been in a combat zone but just my the little bit I was there I think 11 or
12 days I got and then we did a simulation firefight with you know lasers and stuff and I
I could feel that adrenaline I was I was jonesing for it for a long time afterwards and so was my
friend we talked about it I can't imagine going through a real firefight you know pga worked
that the author so he I wish I think it may have been tenison that he was actually referencing but
he he said um we used to discuss the drunk delight of battle before we decided that war was a bad
thing and you know I'm on record of saying that I like everything about war except for the death
and destruction that in some sense you need life and death risk at least to catalyze certain
things and then there's a question about does the life and death risk need to involve conflict
between people and one of the things I'm curious about is the structure of the buddy picture which
is a Hollywood staple and in the buddy picture you have to establish the two people really detest
each other and then they have to go through some sort of transformational conflict and only then
do they realize that they both have sort of a complementarity that allows them to be truly
close that's right look at what happens to guys who who hate each other before a fight in the UFC
beat the crap out of each other I mean they're full of blood what do they do they hug yeah they
hug well again most of the time there are times when no but most of the time they hug and we want
them to hug you know no no that well I mean boy there's so much to do right here you saw this
weird um briefest fight in the UFC this aspirin right yeah that was different that it wasn't
even a fight it was a surprise attack yeah that's Jorge Mazvedal that's that's you can't talk trash
to Jorge Mazvedal for three weeks before the fight the way aspirin does and then expect him not to
show boat a little bit you can't do that to Jorge for Jorge Mazvedal that's a real fight
and he he still doesn't like it like he said he goes if I see him in super margarine he might get
slapped up because I don't like him yeah well so this is the issue that some fights are transformational
and they they produce a closeness and some fights don't resolve whatever the tension is and so
one of the things I'm super curious about is is it your experience like if I think about the
fist fights I got in um growing up I would say that I ended up closer to about half of the people
that I fought and it had to do with some I don't know intangible ineffable quality I can't quite
put my finger on can you say when it is that you find that a fight can be transformational in male
intimacy I don't know I think I think it I think look I mean we are fighting is the purest of sport
in a way I mean what is football it's a game of inches yes but it's it's simulated war it's like
multiple layers of indirection from war that's right basketball baseball these are even more
these are very I mean the competition is very heated these guys are giving it their all
there's something about fighting where especially when it's MMA or something
but for that matter really boxing I think where you where you're coming as close as you can get
almost to what it's like to see a man kill another man or a woman nowadays kill another
woman with their bare hands there is something primordial to that that brings us back to when we
were you know when when we first evolved you know well so we talked sometimes about the
chomsky and pregrammer of language and I've in other places talked about the is there a chomsky
and pregrammer of religion and is there a chomsky and pregrammer of violence where whether we've
we I think we were probably communicating way before language developed language well that's
I mean I can I can there are parts of the world I know I can get in a fight right away just
just by holding a stair and the way I'm standing I promise I can get a guy to go what's a you got
a problem you want to get in the fight really very quickly I'll take you down I'll take it to
Brooklyn I'll take it to Long Island I'll take you to I'll take it up anywhere in Boston or Philly
I promise for that matter Jersey right and and by the way not necessarily in LA but let me take it
the Inland Empire yeah just stand and stare for a little bit right just posture up something's
going to happen you know so we are very aware I think we have antenna that has been have been
developed over millennia for when somebody's trying to take what's ours and I always say this
about I'm writing about vulnerability now yeah I'm writing about what it what you know men are
supposed to be vulnerable and we're supposed to sit with our sad and cry and get in touch with all
okay all right man but I'm doing points I'm dealing with a lot of genetic residue for a long time
you know I had to hunt you know with with a spear or whatever and I had to you know I
have to believe that a lot of this is wired and and if you think of what it was to be a human
being in most cases throughout our history whether we were in a small village or whatever if you were
in a vulnerable if you were in a forget for that matter you could have been in Baghdad in 1258
and the Mongols are Constantinople and what was it 14 something when the the Ottomans broke down
the wall the our history has been here they come over the hill they're gonna they're gonna break
down our walls and kill us and take our women and children as slaves right that's the story of history
yeah if you'll forgive me if I'm not a little bit ready all the time to fight for my life well so
this is boy am I glad we're we're here sometimes I think about the idea that vulnerability has to
be earned through strength so for example if you look at Vin Diesel if he's wearing a feather boa
it's only because he's Vin Diesel he can't wear a feather boa if you're not really you gotta have
a little another man's blood on the on the feather well you know or I don't know if you ever saw
what was it with Tim Roth as the swordsman and there's a great duel in the end is it Rob Roy
and he's like he's he's there with his like frilly cuffs and thing but he's got better
swords sword ability than anybody and he's just completely deadly yeah and so in some weird way
in order to be comfortable with that vulnerability you actually it it's almost like the dessert
that comes from having proven yourself as somebody to be not to be trifled well I think
that it's an interesting thing because when you really study the language of vulnerability the
dog again the fighters that you know I know enough combat navy seals and these guys
I think they have a real sense of their own mortality I mean because they've
either had to take lives or they've seen their friend I mean it's so it happens so quickly
it's a combination of they become vulnerable but they don't sweat the small stuff I think a lot
of this politically correct insanity about you said this word and that makes you a racist or
whatever it is we're just we're so offended all the time most of those people it goes back to what
you were saying we don't have an existential threat anymore and so most of those people don't
really know and haven't really suffered because they're mostly white they haven't really suffered
this this egregious racism slash Ezra Klein God bless him but Ezra you know he he I listened to his
his him talk and stuff and I mean Ezra is so painfully educated and I can tell he's read every
book in the world and he lives in Washington DC and he probably has great dinner parties and he's
friends with all kinds of intelligent intelligentsia and and he can talk about how vicious slave
holder Thomas Jefferson was and would beat me at any debate but I don't think Ezra necessarily
really is friends with anybody who works with their hands who smokes or who has punched people
in the face for a living and it's not a knock on him and I might be wrong about him I just
I think that that his I think if we were under in different circumstances we wouldn't have time
for this shit we wouldn't have time for the shit let me make another point sure when I
this is a better way to say it I watch when I'm in a restaurant and I'm and and it's a busy
restaurant and I see a woman from Malaysia another one from the Philippines another guy's black
another guy's Chinese and otherwise I don't know what they look like there's a wonderful
composite then there's a couple white people and they're all trying to get food to the customers
I promise you no one there is thinking about what your sexual orientation is what your color
fuck off I'm trying to get food on the table bro right and this noise this noise over here you
people are making that well that this is not fair this is what we're like dude okay good I got work
to do man I got work to do I'm making a living here can you get the fuck away from me and let
let the economy do what it's supposed to do right that's why ultimately I'm a free market guy get
out of my way with your I don't think we're free anymore I think we're taking our freedoms away
from you can't say anything you can't express an unpopular point of view well so this would be
a portal point and something I'd be super interested in developing for a while we started
we started hearing comedians saying I won't play colleges anymore yeah that colleges have become
unfun it it throws me off my comedy game it's not something I want to be doing because people
are so easily offended and part of the function of comedy was to explore that which is offensive
and to give people access where normally they would sort of block it off and not be able to do it
and then Joe Rogan our mutual friend said uh something interesting to me he said it is now
the golden age of comedy I said what and he said well we've started figuring out how to tell these
jokes after a period where we couldn't figure out what had gone wrong and the best people
are now able to explore these things because some new skill level had been unlocked does that resonate
with you as a stand-up I don't know as you're saying it I was thinking hmm that's an interesting
thing it's certainly way more lucrative now and it's easier to reach a wider audience and also
your own audience so you know you can niche so you and Joe might have different audiences well
well we may have the same I don't know but we probably have a similar audience but I think
it's much easier to find your niche and so that can be a little bit deceptive okay right
so I don't know the answer he might be right about that I do think there's some great comedy out
there and I think it's needed I think people like Bill Burr and Jim Jeffries and Rogan are needed
because they're satirists and and it's probably the last place on earth where you can really
speak your mind and express unpopular points of view without uh suffering the kinds of ramifications
you would if you worked at Google Facebook uh or the People's Republic of Apple you know
wherever it might be these places are pretty tyrannical it seems I don't know I haven't worked
well you mentioned Bill Burr so I again I I don't know if you know this but I did 10 to 15 minutes
of stand-up that's all I've ever done I didn't know that it was you're very funny it's very it was
very terrifying and very and very fun um but it was more or less impromptu uh one of the things
that I felt um as an outsider though other than that I have no experience is that when I saw Bill
Burr talking about particularly gendered issues I felt like I was watching Alex Honnold the rock
climber go up El Capitan it was so it was so fraught it was so dangerous of course it was um
can we can we geek out for a second who is who is innovating really new stuff and and not from
the perspective of being in the audience but you know like there there's a secret bar behind the
comedy club we were just discussing and I was was invited back there I got a chance to listen to
what are comedians talking about in terms of craft can you take us in to this world what is going
on in Chappelle Chappelle and rock are still doing it there's still they're still taking on whatever
whatever is sacred territory um I don't know that there are I don't know that there are any
innovations I think I think the the only the only thing you can do with stand-up is to you know I
always say write about what you're ashamed of what you're afraid of who you're who you're pretending
to be versus who you really are these deeper questions how do you want to die what do you want
to say when you die what don't you want to say when you die you know these are the kinds of things
what do you want god to say to you when you die if there is such a such a thing what if there is
god and you don't believe these are the questions that I like to play on fears and ask questions I
think that's where you get um that's and it goes back to the salon thing that's where I think you
start sort of uh striking common ground with your audience right so when we one of the things I
truly believe and it comes from the fact that I lived in seven different countries until I was 14
years old really yeah I was born the Philippines I then moved to Calcutta then Bombay or Mumbai
and then uh say Mumbai I know right well so it's Bombay well our family so you know my wife and my
wife from Bombay she's the one who told me right so she's the one who corrected me well so by now
I say Bombay so the weird thing is that it's one of these things where educated people think that
Mumbai is the hot happening that's what I say sophisticated way and I think her perspective
is that that was actually the result of the Shiv Sena who had a Maharashtra from Maharashtra's
campaign so Bombay sorry he didn't mean that people I don't know I don't know I'm trying to be popular
what's your point of view I'm trying to jump on your bandwagon well just just that it's like New
York state realizing that New York City is captured okay and deciding that's going to enforce New
York state culture on New York City which is much more cosmopolitan so Bombay all right but you
were so you've lived in so the Bombay then Lebanon then Pakistan then Lebanon again the war broke
out stuck there for six months evacuated to Greece then Saudi Arabia then I'm 14 years old I go to
boarding school in Massachusetts then college down in Washington DC and then and then of course LA
New York New York LA back and forth and finally I'm the international movie star that I am now well
TV but but so so so my experience my experience being around all those people all those Muslims
and all those Hindus and all those Christians and all those all those Arabs and all those
Pakistanis and all those Indians and all those Filipinos and all those Afghanis and all those
Ethiopians and Eritreans and Somalis like the 12 days yeah and by the way in in that I travel to
communist Russia communist China when it really was communist Russia and communist China Yemen
Syria I was everywhere I mean you can Jordan you name it seeing things like leprosy advanced
stages of leprosy in the marketplaces of Yemen I mean terrifying things and feeling so lucky to be an
American and and knowing not knowing why I was never hungry but seeing real starvation in Kenya
and Tanzania and the outskirts and and the guilt the fucking guilt of going what why am I so protected
why do I feel safe and so so full of food and I'm watching you know I'm a pretty compassionate
imaginative person I hope enough to be enough to feel guilty right but the one thing I got from
that experience was that essentially I don't give a shit what your religion what your culture is
essentially we're all very much the same we all enjoy humorous insults we all which just goes back
to you know and we all want a better life for our kids and we all love to laugh and we all want to
feel safe and all you have to do with anybody from a different culture and I don't care where they're
from right is see them acknowledge that they are like you compliment them a little bit maybe
know a little bit about where they're from or ask them some questions about what it's like to be who
they are and man oh man well all the doors open and so that's why in my salons yeah as it were
I I I love proving that over and over again by taking the most eclectic group I can and throwing
them all together and watching all those ideas find you know I guess life and that that's the secret
well so one of the things that I think about in this area is how much
to get this formula to work it really requires skill and there's an old definition of a gentleman
that I'm very partial to which is a gentleman is someone is a man who is never rude by accident
and I think one of the problems we're having is that there are people at very different skill
levels and so if you think about you know the terrifying words that one must not say
that really is sort of an admonition when everyone is now broadcasting via social media or their
you know podcasting or twitter feed whatever it is that we're now frightened that people are very
low skill and low experience are going to start opining at scale about things that in in ways
that are really destructive so for example if you think about how far we've come from George
Carlin's observations Carlin died right before the financial crisis and you know his perspective
was that there wasn't a word you can't say there are no bad words there are bad contexts there
bad people there may be bad intentions we're now in a world where Bill Maher is lectured
by a guy who founds NWA as to what words he can't say how does how does that shake out
I think that's just a bad idea that will will be scrapped eventually I don't know how much damage
it will do it's a fat a lot of these bad ideas are repackaged and and they will cause their damage
but hopefully because we have enough history to draw from hopefully uh they will lose their
relevance I worry that there's this there's this strange movement to go back to old-fashioned
collectivism I mean this old-fashioned idea of socialism and even communism and Marxism and
and I uh I don't know what this is these are young people who don't and as I really I really pay
attention to it they don't have a command of history they don't know a lot they just don't
maybe I'm just older and I've done more reading or living but I lived in those socialist utopias
and and and I went to those countries when they were very earnestly socialist and communist and
and I'm always amazed that these ideas and they come out of academia they come out of these
professors and I know a lot of them and I've arguments with them on my other podcast um
they they are people who just don't have a lot of it I don't care how smart you are I don't care
how many books you read you my friend don't make the trains run on time you my friend I've never
had to make turn a profit with a real business you live behind walls in a university and those
people are important but they can also be just as dangerous as somebody with no ideas so it's very
what would you point out just to riff off of that is that um what if you have a system which
effectively functions in a cult-like way which is very few people who are academicians
have ever left uh education in other words they start at kindergarten or pre-k that's what's
going on and if you leave you aren't it's very suspicious if you return yeah you can't take
five years off for most people now occasionally there are exceptions but the system as a system
of selective pressures is selecting specifically for people who never venture outside their
initial environment I have talked to very smart academic all-stars people talk about them all the
time without going into names and uh one didn't really realize that they were they were trying
to raise some money for something they wanted me to host and he didn't he didn't really understand
that there were agents out there that could raise sponsorship he just didn't live in an economic
world but he's very happy to and we had a big argument about it he's very happy to uh advocate
for an 80% tax rate for anybody making over a million dollars because he wants to go back to
what what he thinks to Scandinavian like socialism which is wrong Scandinavia doesn't
have that kind of a tax rate so you're wrong but also um this hunter-gatherer ideal okay all right
you know good luck with that but you shouldn't be making economic policy you're not well so
you're bringing up something which I think is terrifying what happens when the sense making
professions that is the people that we deputize as our experts for taking in raw data and saying
okay tell us what this means and tell us what we should do next and you find this in education you
find this in um let's say journalism and the the the um sort of talking head class all of these
sort of institutional sense makers are caught up in business models which are now selecting for
people who have very little experience outside of this world and I feel like if we don't come up
with jobs for that class that pay very well what you're going to get is you're going to get very
ideological people with very little outside experience who are imagining a collectivist
world that functions beautifully but not thinking about the amount of coercion and violence that
it would take to accomplish that and whether or not it's something you want to even do it to begin
there's that idea there's that saying I love which is um an idea is a very dangerous thing to have
if it's the only one you have it's a very dangerous thing if it's the only one you have I see and I
think that there there is this orthodoxy this homogenous you know kind of collective mind that
comes out of a lot of these places and and you're right I mean there's no room but but I have two
things to say one I think I worry that the a lot of these big companies I mean to express even a
different point of view even to cite the science behind the difference between men and women will
get you fired well this gets you fired I mean it really can affect your your your bottom line so it
is a form of violence or certainly certainly uh what is the word coercion in in it's in in a real
sense you know you conformity mostly but you know what Americans are hard to fool and uh and Americans
don't like extremes and I there is a shitload of pushback not just in this sort of this hard left
kind of like mentality but it's a big pushback um and a lot of intellectual pushback as well in my
opinion and it's only getting stronger I mean I there's a reason that reasonable people who are
responsive to evidence like yourself like Jordan Peterson whoever it might be um there's a reason
these people really hit a chord that people like to listen to them because they're like I knew this
other stuff wasn't making that much sense you know I feel like I'm stuck in this ideological world
and I don't I don't you guys are calling me racist are you calling me are you telling me I'm not
into equality I'm not even thinking about that I'm a fair-minded person etc etc so there's a lot
of pushback well I I mentioned this to Sam Harris and I think I'm going to maybe do a show on this
podcast um called the Hilbert Problems uh the topic would be the Hilbert Problems of Social Justice
and so maybe the easiest one is you can't possibly understand my experience because you don't share
it and you must understand my experience because it's so important and so you just take these two
things and then you say look I want to discuss those that as a couplet I must understand and I
cannot understand because that's your problem after all and what if I can actually write a
screenplay let's say we're doing impression on a stage where you say that was so good that there's
no way you could have inhabited that character without understanding me I felt that way for
example if you remember uh Eddie Murphy is the old Jewish guy yeah I mean he does a better Jew
than any Jew I know of course he does he's an actor and he was around them and you know exactly
right exactly and so this idea that again it goes back to what goes back to the fact that we have a
lot more in common with each other than we well in order to in order to unlock that though don't
we have to have enough safety to and this is kind of this puzzle for me about the weird social
justice movement if you create cancel culture you're telling me that it is not safe to open my
mouth and say something that's right your ideas are harmful therefore I'm not going to even bring
them up to a conscious level because they're far too dangerous what if one of them came out of my
mouth inadvertently or in a joke that went south now you've got a really serious problem which is
what if some kind of bigotry and some kind of prejudice is just it's garden variety it's not
very interesting it's universally distributed everybody has it that's a problem I mean I
have multiple feelings about how I feel about different people in different circumstances
if you don't allow some of this stuff to bubble up come out your mouth and and look at it for the
brain fart that it really is yeah then you're you're going to sit there weirdly guilty
either angry that you can't say that you want to be able to say it or you're going to say wow I
really am ashamed that I actually think I always say we all of us in my my I think I have to joke
all of us have at least 10 thoughts an hour maybe a minute that would get us fired I mean and thank
God by the way thank you know Jonathan height I don't know if you've heard him talk on this
subject but he wrote The Cotling of the American Mind and the Righteous Mind he's just I love him
and and but he said that there is this he compares it to the I think the Corazon of the Philippines
I think that's who they were called who would gain status by killing the most people you know
essentially your enemy and you'd take their heads or you take a trophy maybe a piece of their hair
and you gain status that way you got more women that way and and this is an example of a sick
culture I don't give a shit how how pure it is it's a sick culture right and there are a lot of
examples of that and we seem to be in some pockets of this country there is this this you gain status
by finding the racist by finding the the bad guy according to your orthodoxy according to your
puritanical your puritanical idea of what a human being should be it's a scavenger hunt that's gone
out of control like pokemon for bigots and there aren't enough bigots to play it it's not new though
it's a form of the inquisition it's not new this is this again human beings love purity they love
the idea you get these people who love the idea of trying to purify and create their own utopia
which a lot of historians have written about the most dangerous thing a human being can do
the most dangerous thing a movement can endeavor to do is to purify or create a utopia because what
you'll do uh and if you have any questions see mouse china polpots uh cambodia stallons uh rush
i mean stallion would have people killed because they had the wrong idea of what communism and then
you take whole groups because they've already been corrupted their brains you can't really
reeducate them they're too old so they're all wearing glasses anybody who's wearing glasses
is an intellectual they read a lot they have a lot of this poisonous capitalist stuff in their head
let's just bring them out to the killing fields and let's get rid of them that's what happens
throughout history that's what happens when you have ideologues running things because they're not
smart they're fanatics they don't open themselves up to other points of view i don't know why nobody
ever talks about this it's exactly what you're saying this issue that purity is weirdly the most
dangerous concept we have when people try to purify terrible things happen and we have a ritual on
friday nights we have a weekly shabbat dinner and in our family we we take the shabbat cup of wine
and we put two drops in it there's always this question why do you put two drops of water in
the wine beforehand my interpretation is that it is us learning to live with impurity that these
two drops of water can bother your mind well now now the wine isn't pure it's been watered down
it's adulterated it makes no effing difference to the wine and it's teaching my the way i view it
is it's teaching my children to avoid becoming fanatics about purity when i think about the
off ramp i don't know if you've ever seen this in in saudi arabia on the road to mecca there's this
wonderful off ramp that says uh muslims only mecca this way all others this is your off ramp
and i think about that i think wow i wonder how much of the the the division in islam between the
things that go towards this jihadist craziness and the things that make for this wonderfully rich
welcoming culture some in some ways they're inextricable but i wonder how much of it has to
do with which portions of the culture have learned to live with impurity well i look at our culture
thomas jefferson owned 600 human beings when he wrote all men are created equal
that we hold these truths to be self evidence that all men are created equal and endowed to
that creator of certain inalienable rights among which are life-liberating the pursuit of happiness
he owned 600 human beings when he wrote that i mean we we our peculiar institution i mean slavery
we've been a country with slavery longer than when we've been a country without slavery but you'd
be hard-pressed to find a freer longer-standing democracy throughout history we are a modern
country precisely because we continue to wrestle with that inconsistency so this is something i'd
love to dig into one of the weird things about hearing the patriarchy the patriarchy of patriarchy
is the one place that was an actual patriarchy was the founding of our country and what's
hysterically funny and just sort of beautiful about it is that these guys wrote with enough
generality that they didn't make the mistake of saying all men other than africans are created
equal or all men are created equal and not you women they spoke with a level of generality
where general life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is think about that right you have
the right to life you have the right to liberty and you have the right to pursue happiness not
happiness but to pursue happiness meaning struggle if pursuing happiness is is i don't know living
in water in a pond whatever it is then that's you have that right right and that is that's our
real religion that's that's what we come to defend you know that's his right you hear it
but the the theory in some sense was so much more advanced than the instantiation at the
founding of the country one of the things that i find hysterically funny and also hopeful is that
we we have the opportunity in this country and we don't do it much to teach both every lousy
stupid hypocritical thing we've done as a nation many of them violent many of them deadly
and to teach patriotism on top of that because if you think about this in terms of all countries
have histories uh which contain things that they'd rather sweep under a rug and somehow
patriotism has been sort of try people on the right really try to take it over and as a fan
somebody comes from a very progressive family which suffered because of let's say the McCarthy era
i love this country and i know every lousy thing it's it's ever done yeah um do we have an
opportunity to sort of reboot patriotism at a more mature level where the love of one
country is an adult love rather than a childlike love i think that most people i happen to believe
that most people are patriotic for the right reasons i think america is an idea i mean the
founding fathers solve the political problem the greeks couldn't do it and no one else could do it
the ottomans couldn't do it the roman sure as hell couldn't do it this was this is i mean these are
a bunch of men in the 30s with the exception of benjamin franklin got together what was in a hot
july in philadelphia right and came up with this thing called the constitution and the bill of
rights are you fucking kidding me i mean think about it for a second it's insane it's it's it's
it's astonishing checks and balances you've got a you've got a supreme court and i mean and it was
what was i the the the legend goes you know when ben franklin came out and she's the woman said
what have you created and he said a republic madam if you can keep it yeah it's great but this is
this is an experiment this is a verb uh it has to be constantly defended george washington said
careful or human beings will invent ways to take their own freedom away from themselves in the name
of virtue and everything else so um i think that for the most part what i appreciate about patriotism
in this country and you know is is the that at least people truly believe that we that democracy
having a say right and who governs you and and and the big question in political philosophy who
governs the governor well in our case it's the people now i know we can get into you know lobbying
and how we're losing that ability and special interests of course but for the most part that is
always what's fiercely debated you know we are worried always that washington is becoming an
economy of influence right that that that we are losing our meritocracy but but it's still the fact
that the look at how vicious the press is to donald trump and amen to that whether you like him or
not you never want to lose the ability to this constant nasty battle oh i want to take issue
with this actually this is the first place where i might have a disagreement okay but this nasty
battle this nasty battle between that's fake news you're full of shit he's a scumbag he's a
sex addict all these things he's a rapist i don't think actually it's ever been any different in
uh in in american politics american politics has always been what would they they used to compare
ape linkin to an ape and all kinds of things and they tried to start all these sexual rumors about
different canon this has always been a dirty place but um i think that's probably what you get in a
vibrant democracy the big difference the big difference between our democracy and someone
else's uh let's just take iran yeah is if the hardliners lose they die they don't live to fight
another day when we lose a peaceful transition it's a peaceful transition so far it's incredible
and and and the big the big thing was i think between jefferson and john adams i think john
adams wanted a standing army and jefferson was against that and and but it was they look they
were very worried that they called them these wild eyed jeffersonians i mean they were very
worried that jefferson was going back to this agrarian utopia and i mean he was a kind of a
there was a lot of talk about we got to get rid of these this is this could be a civil war i mean
anytime you have a revolutionary war anytime you have a country that wins their independence almost
always they break into a civil war the two somebody's got to fight for for power this is the this is
the only country i can think of yeah that didn't have that happen and so i don't i don't know where
how we got along on this but but but it's you mean so like india and pakistan during partition
after liberation oh my god a horrible a horrible civil war right and in fact they created the
formation of pakistan right but so so there's something very special about about our patriotism
about our democracy as messy and as nasty and as quote-unquote partisan as it is maybe it's
supposed to be that way maybe maybe government is supposed to move at a snail's pace well i think
when you have some i think we're in a very dysfunctional period where the amount of nonsense
you know i i refer to k-fabrication from the word k-fabe which is the system of lies that
professional wrestling uses to tell its stories right so you i never heard that but i like it
yeah uh so i i do i do have to say before you go into your thing i love when you come up with
these things because when you left the dinner uh malik a professional boxer from you know louisiana
and vegas and my buddy herman who played d1 ball and he's from philly and both of them
both of them were like man i fuck with eric i fuck with that dude he's so fucking smart he
was saying shit i want to i'll we what when can we have another dinner with that dude like everybody
everybody wanted more wine stein so congratulations and your wife by the way she's a superstar
she's she's great she's she's fantastic but keep going we try to get around the show the uh
when it comes to ke to ke to k-fabricate k-fabrication um i think that we're in a period of nonsense
where we're talking about all sorts of things and the best that can be said of us is that we are
inefficient in unraveling ourselves what i worry about is that we actually need something like an
enemy in order to remind ourselves of how to get along despite our differences and i don't know
whether part of the problem is that this unprecedented level of peace even with foreign
entanglements since world war two is in fact deranging us is that possible i i do i've heard
that theory right i've heard i've heard that sort of without war i think it was the british
general i can't remember his name i said without war you know the population becomes very materialistic
and petty and until you have a common enemy that's what unifies the country and gets people
back down to what's actually important values duty honor things like this um i i don't know
i think time i think time will tell i think there's an there are a lot of challenges there's enough
you know you were talking about combat athletes and you know you're all these guys you i think you
said something so funny i felt like i was on the serengeti with a bunch of thoughtful cheetahs
over a kill it was the fucking greatest metaphor i've ever heard it was so great but what you
forget is that all of us think of you as the alpha male no because but it's true because
you come in there and you're not physical but you're funny as everybody you're you're just
cracking everybody up but then at the same time everybody knows everybody knows you got the biggest
brain in the room so we start asking you you're asked you about string theory it was so fucking
hilarious because you started talking and all of us like i don't know what he's what's he talking
about what you know you well the loops if you look at the loops in the cones of the sphere
we have a predator i'm like what the fuck hey bro in in english stop with the greek you're speaking
already well there was there was a fair amount of wine there was a fair amount there was indeed
but the point is is that you had your own alpha status there so there was a there was a very you
know that well do you want to get into what i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm to tie that back in um it's
hard it's it's hard enough i don't know that we necessarily need an existential threat trying to
make it in this economy and trying to put food on the table and and gain some leisure time it's
still as hard as it ever has been so maybe that's i don't know i don't know i don't know the answer
i don't know the answer either yeah but i do think that one of the things we need to get back
towards and just riffing again from the ways in which um i was observing your crowd deal with stuff
is twice i've been in a social gathering with you where there's been one female and a bunch of
these guys and i've watched how careful all the men are to elevate um not only the female
but whoever is there with the lone female in the group and the idea being that when it when it when
it was my wife the idea was people were were holding me up and being a little kinder and a
little nicer because you want to make that person look good in the eyes of of the woman at the table
and they're really astute observation well i agree with you that's exactly what was happening well
because because in my mind we've gotten we've broken something a little bit in terms of male
female relations and we are going to be in a process of either rediscovering what was lost or
reinstantiating whatever the abstraction was that was chivalry do you have any thoughts on
where that goes like for instance look my my experience um with the men i know that i'm friends
with and the the hardest toughest guys that i know and stuff like that they're all gentlemen
you know if if uh if you have a guy who's not being a gentleman who's rude to the woman at the
table or who is uh making her feel embarrassed or that that guy's not in our fucking group well
you're first going to correct like oh yeah give a few corrective signals oh and all of my friends
will what i think is super important and attractive about chivalry is the idea of protector well of
protector that that there is a functionally important role i'm going to try to figure how
to get at this thought to the violence that is you know if there's a knock on the door for example
at three in the morning my model is is that mom goes to the nursery and dad goes to the front
door to handle it correct sir and correct there is an expendability of us males that we accept
as part of this bargain that women and children and that's in our dna bro it's in our dna that's in
our dna right you're the first line defense you're the first and last line of defense
that's one hundred percent the case and uh i i don't apologize for that and i don't have a friend
that's not that way um that that's that's uh we want to be the of course we do and that's attractive
and that's noble and that's beautiful and that's men at their best by the way yeah uh that's what
people don't realize when you talk about i always say this man i i you know when we talk about gun
control right i don't like guns dude i don't like them and i don't want spree shooters out there and
i think i i i listen hard to people who are pro gun control because i want to find a solution to
this insanity okay but people have to understand that men like myself who own guns and have them
in the house right i don't own guns because they're shiny and they go pow i own guns because they
make me feel like at least if the shit hits the fan worst case scenario you have recourse i can protect
the people i love that is so deep in me man and and that's what it's about so so give me a little
credit i may be a caveman yeah but um i'm trying to be the best caveman i can be man you know it's
also like the other thing is like you can be a dirtbag but don't be a dirtbag you can be a dirtbag
yeah you got a lot of girls you know but if you are um if you are hurting people's feelings right
humiliating people uh i i i tell you man i i i had a good friend and he had he got gonorrhea yeah
and i call i said to him he goes hey do you have a doctor dude i need these pills i go okay good i
go make sure you gotta tell the girls because the girls you're with uh and he was with like five girls
they can get it and and they can go baron right and he said i'm i'm not doing that
and when he said that right i call it the click i call it the click i go you can have sex with all
of them right but now now you're risking someone's ability to have children dude right and and it's
embarrassing you gotta make the call and when i realized he wasn't gonna make the call i never
i i couldn't do it i couldn't i never that was it that's it you're out so that's that to me is
shivery well so you don't have to be perfect but just take care of your weight bro right so one
way of of looking at that is that um let's imagine that there are a group of men and a group of women
who both sort of sign up for this kind of an agreement like in the story that i was saying
about the knock on the door i perfectly believe that mommy should go to the nursery with a shotgun
if she's worried that somebody's gonna come barging in you know it's not a question of women
should be defenseless it's a question of the first line of defense and who's expendable
and this is just part of the deal and i understand if some people don't like that they don't believe
in it but those of us who do believe in that model should be able to locate each other as a culture
and say hey this is the compact that that we're interested in perpetuating by the way you know
i talk and i'm sorry to bring up my special again but in complicated apes this last thing i talk about
how i'm always amazed that the women's movement hasn't spoken more about the women of the ufc
and i do this whole bit about the idea that i did not expect women are moving into this space
and they're doing it very effectively if you had told me eight years ago that i'd watch women throw
hands and feet and elbows and grapple with the same skill and frosty as men i would have i would
have told you you're crazy i would have said they're not biologically capable or or that interested
or that interested and then you watch rosna majunis uh yonai and genjek valentina shevchenko
amanda nunyes holly holmes i can keep going down the list uh uh micha tates no longer working
ronda rousey ronda rousey you know she might have gotten knocked out by holly home she will go
down in history as the a very significant woman who was beautiful and also fierce she kind of
redefined what she said uh the greatest thing that i ever heard she goes my body's not designed to
fuck millionaires it's designed to beat the shit out of people and it was like hey man sister she's
one of the first people i've ever been starstruck in front of i was just you know she was she was
in my audience one time and i i didn't i didn't perform while i was i've never done that i was
nervous i was like so i was so fanboyed out um but these these women are are proving to
as far as women that are changing hearts and minds the ones that need to be changed like a
bunch of bros like myself etc the guys out there who thought that this arena belonged only to men
they're they have changed our minds and let's talk about lgbtq whatever let's talk about amanda
nunez whose girlfriend is in her corner she kisses her girlfriend her girlfriend's hot and she's a
fighter too you got a couple of lovers kicking ass and changing the world i mean this is this is why
are we not talking about uh violence against women uh when it's done by another woman in a cage
goes a long way and changed in the heart and mind of a chauvinist like myself who we should be talking
about yeah nobody's talking about that because of course they don't watch the UFC well but it's
also you know just there's a confusing aspect which i think is good confusion um how many of these
gals when you see them doing you know they're uh what do i call the pre-fight um thing the way in
the stairwell there's okay the stair down that the way in is the other thing yeah so you weigh
and then you do the stair then you do the stair down how many times if i looked at these gals
in the stair down i said those are two really super attractive super feminine women super attractive
and super feminine and yes and both of them could rip my head off oh my god valentine and chef shank
was so hot to me micha takes so hot to me right they're all so hot i mean the majority of them
are physically beautiful they're they're so attractive to me right i mean it's it's it's
like you're just like are you kidding you you have this skill set and you look like that i've seen
them i've i've seen you know cats and gano i i know some of them i've actually gotten to move
around a little bit and train with some of them and and it's just like they're they're beautiful
well it also it you know it calls men to hire purposes if if one one of the great things that
could come out of this is that if men want to retain some sense of you know being the protector
that they're gonna have to up their game and yes they're gonna have and that people are gonna have
to uh you know raise better boys well that's gonna be inevitable i think um you you have uh i will
say i i had this sort of visceral reaction to the feminist movement because i'm a guy and
it's not my generation and i it makes me feel insecure and stuff but there is something really
cool about women stepping into these spaces and maybe men can take a breather you know ester
parel at all know the name she's uh sort of a next level um relationship expert i know ester
parel yeah yeah um i was hanging with her and she was trying out an idea which i thought was
was pretty good which she said i was trying to she said i asked her i was trying to figure out
masculinity what i realized is that masculinity is both incredibly powerful and incredibly fragile
and that comes with a lot of fear men are very terrified terrified they'll be revealed to be
a coward we're terrified of every aspect i mean well we don't sit in sad we're not allowed to sit
in sad right so women i think have more license so they're allowed culturally sit in sad to cry
to feel and to eat ice cream or whatever it might be men are we can be sad for a couple minutes
then we have to convert that sad to action rage right or target it toward the person or thing
making us sad and attack and kill it and i i i think i feel that very very deeply and and
directly i think that's been that has been what i've had to deal with my whole life i hate to
say it but that's but that's been handed down to me do you accept i'm as i get older i'm trying
to wrestle with having a relationship with that side of me you know um my father was a marine my
father uh um you know he told me a story recently about when you say you know um visiting war memorials
he went to iwo jima and i think only if you're a marine you're allowed to and you can go there's
one day a year i think when when people are allowed to walk the island and he was there
and uh or a family of a marine or something and he was there and an old woman she was about 90
she was walking on the beach and she was having trouble because the sand is very deep and it's
volcanic and and he said um can i help you what what brings you to the island and she said my
husband was here and he was 19 he was killed and and she said um she said i always wanted to walk
where he died i always wanted to walk and i'm walking this whole perimeter so that i can
feel like i stepped where he was i don't know where it was but at least i'm there see how you
get emotional that's what happened to me when my father told me that story i got i started to get
emotional but i couldn't do it in front of him i couldn't i couldn't cry but just telling you
that story makes me want to cry yeah because it's just it was so it was such a beautiful thing and my
father walked her all the way across the island or you know wherever that was man and and there are
some things worth crying about like and this is one of them this is one of them you know um some
things are just too much to bear and and some things are too beautiful and some things are too um
they they just they just remind you of how awesome and awe-inspiring uh humanity can be
and and what happens in the face of terrible tragedy that's sort of bonding the beautiful
stories the beautiful stories of of of that's why i studied uh nazi germany that was my area of focus
and yeah and so when you when you when you hear about the girl whose sister it was her birthday
and she found a blueberry in the fields they were having a work and she wrapped it in a goddamn leaf
and gave it to her sister for her birthday those little things man those little things are what
we stay alive for and those stories about those little things are are probably why a lot of us
are artists you know trying to figure out a way to get people to laugh and cry that's that's the
whole deal that is our respite from from this constant this drudgery this tragedy this uncertainty
this fear it's what it's what Schopenhauer and especially Nietzsche talked about is that yes
there's the will we've got to sleep eat fuck right and and then we die but there are there isn't
there is a way out there there are portals if i may uh and those are artistic inspiration
and conversations like this and great meals with friends yeah have salons and that that's
what we stay alive for and you can turn your life into a circus now you may die young and
leave a good look in corpse right but i'd rather that i'd rather live dangerous and not have enough
transcendence in existence fuck yeah yeah and you can't do that you can't do that living in this
purified echo chamber in a world where you're terrified to insult offend everybody under the
sun you won't have the kind of sex you want you sure as hell won't have the kind of laughs
that you need and that you deserve you'll live in a sexless barren place where you're constantly
trying to be right and not offend anybody you won't even be able to raise your fucking voice
and i think that's bad for us well i think it's bad for our culture you know somebody put that to
music please they will trust me i know they can't believe you didn't start playing the the harmonica
something right here i know um you know i was going to potentially open the series with my cousin
her name was Eva core and i spoke to her right before we launched i guess the the portal and
she said look i'm going on my annual annual pilgrimage and when i get back i'd love to
and she's from indiana i never met her i've spoken to her a bunch on the phone
and she was a mangle a twin and her sister um Miriam um was in the camp with her she was saying
that she looked forward to an annual pilgrimage to Auschwitz where she was and that Miriam her
sister had stopped thriving in the medical experiments and the only way to save her was to
steal food to the point about the the blueberry the sister so she stole potatoes and she was
telling the story about stealing potatoes and that the penalty for stealing potatoes was death
yeah and so she stole these potatoes and got caught so she was clearly going to die and then
she was scolded and let let go now she was just a little kid and she said ah being part of the
medical experiment means i'm protected by dr mangola and so nobody can touch me so she continued
to steal potatoes in order to save her sister and she's telling me this crazy story and i think
i'm going to do an episode because she went to the extraordinary length of forgiving mangola
and this caused a huge human cry her name was Eva Kor and i was dying to start the podcast and then
i get this phone call from her son um and i find out that she's died uh in poland on this last trip
so i i don't get to bring the story the way i wanted to yeah man was this chick tough
like you know the whole idea and when when i tell the story i'll i think i'll do it on a separate
episode uh of the importance of forgiveness and as a almost like a weapon and as a a structural
transformative ritualistic option if you've been victimized this woman gave nothing up in terms of
toughness and then went to these extraordinary counter intuitive lengths one of our last posts
i think is her eating um maybe a mcdonald's meal in auschwitz and sort of laughing about how how
amazing that there's a mcdonald's near where uh we had automated human ritualistic kill well
and frank you know and frank uh i think she wrote i still believe in my heart human beings
were all good at the core right you know and her father said she shames me with her positive
you know outlook uh but i i think that's the that's probably one of the reasons christianity seems
to endure the idea that uh christ preached forgiveness that's a powerful thing what you're
really saying i mean i know as an actor for example you know i had an actor as an actor if
you're playing mangla right if you're playing polpot stalin or hitler right you can't play him
like a monster you know you play him you play him as a man trying to solve a problem for humanity's
sake that's way more interesting and that very well may be what was going on in their twisted
hearts even the nazis had i had a sense that they were doing god's work that they were being
somewhat morally getting rid of this problem called the jews etc and this is why ideas
and if you just rely on logic and rationality you better be careful man because human beings come
up with very very logical and rational reasons to get rid of those people over there it's one of
the things i love about the thing that religion has to offer which is that all life is sacred
the buddhas talk about sentient sentient beings the christians talk about you know whether or not
you're in a coma even if you're unborn listen you know these these things there and they're
unwavering about those things sometimes that is the vanguard sometimes that is the reason
you have to be stalwarted in in in those kinds of ideas they're not convenient a lot of times i'm
a pro-choice guy but i understand the value of these kinds of things because they do protect you
against uh you know the rationalists that come in the scientists the engineers who come in and
start trying to run the world well don't trust your own brain i think it was paul paul who said
don't trust your own heart yeah i'm not a christian by the way just you're not but no i'm not i haven't
been a church i don't go to church i've been a church twice in my life i i but i i respect and
understand what these fixed truths have to offer it's my only contention with sam harris
who i really like and and i admire but um uh i'm gonna give sam just a quick lesson if i ever
meet him on how not to how not to start a conversation sam don't say let's we had we need a war on
his lawn don't say that right you can't do that because you lose everybody we got to we got to
be a little bit more we got he's he's so he's so painfully honest well you know i went on his show
about this point no no i didn't okay so i did it but i'm a fan so you know i'm a fan of sam's too
i mean we're great friends i i tried to indicate to him that there was something counterproductive
not about his line of thinking but about his chosen motive of expression he gets emotional
honestly sam gets emotional i think that's what it is well but and he sublimates it right so you
you know you you almost never see him i i took video of him find his way through i took a video
of him playing um centipede on an old arcade machine and people loved it because they said oh
my god he's human um he's very he's very zen he's very human yes the issue that i had was
that i didn't think that sam understood what he was projecting and that i said you know you need
to say some things about the positive aspects of this culture well it was like you open up this box
and he's like i love the call to prayer i said what he's like i love the poetry of rumi and so he
starts extolling there you go some of the some of the advantages he's an incredibly religious guy
for an atheist i mean i do his app waking up and i love this book uh spiritually without religion
and i love his podcast and i and i think that he's genuinely sincere about trying to get
an honest conversation going i i fall in the line with so much of his thinking but i i do think that
he i i do think he he could he could uh i think he does i think he gets emotional yeah i think
then he goes on the offensive and that's he is very upset about people not understanding his
central message and i think it few few people understand what it is yeah he is not claiming
that um islam is a terrible thing that it has nothing to offer he's not claiming that religion
is bereft of good ideas or important ritual what he's weirdly saying doesn't get picked up is
i sam harris believe that there is nothing that can be done irrationally through a crazy belief
system that couldn't be done better at scale um using reason but that's why i disagree well i agree
i disagree too i think uval harari would disagree you need myth you need story and and and so so so
the value they're in let's just take christ as an example or the bible or any story or even
Plato's forms were about the idea that you may not be able to touch perfection but my god you
can imagine it you the perfection may very well not exist but you can not only imagine it but you
should reach for it you're going to miss but the reach is what matters so so doing the right thing
a lot of times might be very much against not in your own interests i mean think of the play the
crucible well i mean he's going to die for christ sake but he's not going to give up his you know
he's more than his appetites right it's more on the man for all seasons these are these stories
that we think about the mohondas k gandhi marlon luther king malcolm x jesus christ
would they these people endure and they way we speak of them and sort of with heads bowed because
they put their own interests they it was not there was nothing rational about what they did in a lot
of ways i mean you could say i suppose well well i mean they they they knew that they were putting
themselves they're very somatically they were definitely putting themselves in huge risk they
they exterminate they they erase themselves physically but um there's something about
have you ever read gandhi on violence yes a long time ago yeah you ever seen this riff that he did
where he said there are three things i want to talk about i want to talk about pacifism i want
to talk about violence and i want to talk about non-violence and he says i believe that my philosophy
of non-violence is superior to the other two but given a choice between violence and pacifism i
would always choose violence i don't remember that i know tarot was his a huge influence on him but
so gandhi the gandhi that we think of as this simple kindly uh saintly figure is not actual gandhi
and gandhi he was an anglophile i know he's a lawyer in south africa who yeah well there's that
yeah but he actually believed he said look don't mistake non-violence for pacifism non-violence
requires the most courage because you're going to put yourself in harm's way with a
pre-commitment not to defend yourself and if you can't get to that level of badassery choose violence
and why because the worst thing you can do is to be passive and to let your nation uh
you know be raped as india was by by the brit so this is like well it may have been a strategic
i don't think that that policy of non-violence would have worked against the nazis the germans
would have just shot him uh and they would have just opened up on anybody it worked with the british
empire because the british empire had elections they had parliament well there's a question who
does who does the non-violence and i don't know if you know about the rozenstrasse protest in terms
of you want to talk about weird portal effects i think it was 1943 in berlin a bunch of women
who were married to jewish men or partially jewish men but were not jewish themselves
decided that they would show nazi germany what's what and get their husbands back
and they organized a protest i don't know why this isn't famous it makes me feel
like i'm crazy for bringing it up um they organized a protest in uh the rozenstrasse
uh the street and they made such an embarrassing show in front of the nazis that the nazis i believe
acquiesced and got these men out of the camps and returned to the women so it was like a wow
well this is the thing about the power of wives and mothers and beautiful young women
you know who are you know new bio just means marriageable um we are so
when women organize themselves effectively they can bring male systems you know really
to their knees because there's no good way of saying we're against motherhood we're against
love we're against anything that is aspirationally kind of pure um yeah somebody's draw people have
drawn correlations between women's rights and health care and the advent of health care and
things and which is why the women's march was so confusing to me because that was a tremendous
amount of power to mobilize but without a very clear follow through and with some very dubious
you know i think that a lot of us fear that there was some kind of anti-semitism that was
behind some of the organization of that but just in terms of what could you get the nazis to take
note of i've always been fascinated by who protested the nazis effectively there was another case
which you might know through through boxing um i think the guy's name was johannes trolman
who was a cinti like a roma and he was incredibly good-looking and he was doing the Muhammad Ali
thing years before Muhammad Ali of being very athletic as a boxer so it was kind of a matinee
idol of this time and germans were fantastic audiences for boxing they were very well informed
about the sort of science of the sport and obviously this guy had to go down because he
wasn't pure an arian in german but the crowd the germans loved him yeah and when he was i guess
they're you know the refs gave the fight to the other guy there was an outcry in germany
so they changed the rules about how you could fight and it was to make this guy's fighting
style not work so as a protest i mean just this is such a great story he divorced his wife because
he thought it was a danger to her wow he coded himself in flower to mock the purity of this
you know racially pure german right yeah and he got into the ring with the crowd behind him
and he took the effing was cheese right and he gets sent to a camp and everybody reveres them
it's like you know the south africans respected nelson mandela well the nazis fucking respected
this guy yeah and they germans at least yeah even the nazis yeah you know because in some sense they
know that they're doing the wrong else you know that he can kick their ass with it if well but you
know it's it's what you just said about fragility like here's this guy who's a genius with his fists
who's this unbelievable figure in his heart and what is he doing you know he's mocking them and
he's sacrificing his own life so he ends up in the camps he's he's he's holding fighting clinics and
i think somebody i don't know kills him with a shovel or a pistol or something so it's a terrible
story there's a ring in a park in germany on a slant and it's just the slant is the unfairness
of the situation right wow and he was reinstated his title had been taken away and it's been
reinstated all these years later somebody needs to make a major motion picture how you know what
amazes me is how you're this theoretical mathematician with such a poet's heart well it's amazing dude but
that's but isn't so now who's getting emotional well i love it yeah i love it too yeah and it's
you know it's about heroism it's about violence it's about even in a tragedy celebrating you know
these are the these are the guys whose lives you want to see right and like what a subtle beautiful
nod to a great life because he's not even depicted um that's you know i was gonna i think what i'm
gonna do with the show not every not every episode is going to be transformative and and transcendent
but i think one of the things i want to do is to organize the world and its sites for transcendence
like this monument this this broken ring needs to be on the map people need to know
there and they need to go in pilgrimages yeah those stories need to be right i agree with you
man and you're you're in such a unique place to do this i think this is going to be a great podcast
i think i think you're gonna love oh i hope we've got so many you know you're you're so interested
in so many different things and i think you're look the idea is to get the ideas the good ideas
that are stuck in books and stuck in people's brains who usually don't have an ability to
talk to a lot of people get them out and into the ears and into the brains of the people out there
well and i also want to make sure that i mean i don't want to hide the fact that you know i'm stuck
i'm hypocritical i don't exactly know what we're supposed to do next either it's it's the struggle
discovery it's the right you're trying to look for the portals you don't know where they all are
some of them are going to be false leads but transcendence you know is what you were saying
before transcendence is available to everyone who's willing to look for it it's not available
in every hour of every day well that's my problem with cancel culture because what you're saying is
you know we are who we were we are who we are and we are who we could be and all of us are trying
to be who we could be right or at least most of us and i'm certainly very different i don't know the
guy who i don't know brian count the what the brian count 20 year old brian count 25 year old brian
count what an asshole i mean or at least what a dumb dumb or at least what a what a naive ignorant
arrogant little shithead i i mean i'm i'm just a different person now right because i'm 52 i mean
it took me a long time to become the human being that i am and that's pretty flawed person but at
least i'm a little less flawed made more mistakes i have better pattern recognition i'm a little bit
more compassionate i hope and and but you know we are verbs we're verbs men say more we're not
nouns okay when you cancel me out for yeah something i did or said my god you're suggesting i'm that
way all the time no i'm not i might have been having a moment i might have been confused i might
have been angry and outside of your personality i'm sorry if you think about yourself as as a
conference of different modules like there are modules of all of us that we don't like some some
instruments sometimes are playing louder than the other instruments right or that piccolo is flat
a hundred percent right and the idea is that because of the piccolo player the entire symphony
is canceled i mean i you know and and who's doing this cancelling show me one person who
doesn't have these sets of issues right i know i know exactly and who is behind all these like
it's just the twitter sphere right i keep hearing it's not the real world but but it is my problem
is it is the real world my problem is that you can lose your ability to earn a living when you're
canceled well so this is in your career my theory here is that we've moved from physical violence
to reputational and economic violence of course and so the idea being that the one thing i mean i
don't know that i've fully done this theory anywhere so it'd be great to do it here with you the
the institutions have these rules on them and these rules are causing every institution that
gets formed whether it's a for-profit or a non-profit or in different sectors of the economy
to take on certain characteristics the one thing that doesn't have this this feel to it
is the individual the individual cannot be legislated now the individual may be dependent
on the ability to access the banking system i mean one one show that we have talked about
is an erotic actress who has not been able to easily maintain merchant accounts
or to gain credit and there's a question about should we be harassing people who are legally
employed in jobs that somebody doesn't care for which scares but that everybody everybody watches
when nobody else is watching you know porn stars i mean you know if you're going to criticize
porn stars please never watch porn well this is the thing when i when i was doing these shows
with sam harris i would talk about how we lie and i would say who here who here watches porn hub
and like the audience is silent i feel like this bro me right here i can take my favorite
porn stars too i can tell you everything about it not i i can even go why go through why i don't
watch it anymore because it doesn't get me off because i don't believe the girls but then i got
the girls i do believe any other questions well this is the thing this is what i mean but you
at my salon everybody will raise their hands well this is the thing but because you're an
individual but then when it comes to how you're employed yes depends upon are you on network
tv what are you on cable you know what is it that we can and can't say what i believe is
because the individual is the thing that is still free of this kind of legislated goodness
in other words there is goodness that actually occurs and there's goodness that is only there
because we legislated the people who don't do not like uh things that are outside of their control
are going to reputational attacks because that's the only way of shutting down the individual
that's right and so that that reputational violence has gotten far more extreme for people who speak
out that's right and i think that that's really part of the story behind you brought up jordan
peterson before it's not so much in my opinion that any one of these people is saying something
brilliant although brilliant things are said by some of these people it's more that people say
is there anyone willing to stand up for central values like well core but 60 minutes 60 minutes
had him on and there was the there was the caption i think was 60 minutes there was this
caption and then they did a recap of it maybe it's cnn and under it said alt right professor
how fucking dare well where does this come from how dare you some asshole in the control room
no but brian it's universal it's universal it's not there is some story here and i don't claim to
have it which has to do with how institutional media finds a completely fake narrative and then
just through perseveration repeats it so often that people think it's true well this is why this is
why fake news quote unquote has caught on i i'm not a trump defender let me tell you yeah but uh
when i watch cnn and how slanted they are right and and and watch these lightweight journalists
who just have not done their homework uh and and they've got three minutes or whatever it is their
their opinion pieces and stuff and i could say the same about fox news by the way in a lot of cases
because tucker call some drives me fucking crazy because he doesn't really listen to any of his
guests he won't even let his guest talk but but you know it's like um it it it's it's just not
true you're not being truthful here you are and and people know that people get it people go hold on
like when when when ocasio-cortez calls enough americans racist right well we all go well we the
lot very white states the majority of these very white states voted a black president twice
you're being a little insulting here to all of us that's a terrible thing to call a lot of americans
i travel this country more than she does yeah and i travel country and i and i perform for and talk to
and i'm around real people not the elite i'm around people that work for a living with their hands
etc i can promise you and a lot of them are white i can promise you i promise you they if you called
any of them are racist and i'm talking about people in the town so they they'd look at you and go
no i'm not no i'm not well but you can't get out of it oh so you deny it that just proves you know
that you are well you don't know because you don't know where you're right you know but what i do well
well now what do i do well what i really dislike about this is that the language is so impoverished
like the issue of binary good guy bad guy well it exactly i mean if i'm in a situation where
i have a lot of information about a different community i'm going to form positive and negative
impressions of every single possible community but you're not but see ideologues don't like nuance
well so this is the war on nuance well because nuance you know the way the way i keep encountering
this i've i've made a big point of this they view nuance like the israelis view an olive grove
it's a place for snipers to hide so we have to we have to take down the olive trees so there won't
be any snipers i have to pee so badly and that metaphorses made me forget about my pee which is
why we're taking a break with brian calin taking a break when we return brian calin on the portal
i've always wanted to say this and we're back with brian calin brian if we could i would love to
switch into another area that i don't think we've really touched on much which is your
fascination with um pretty deep science and the way in which it even works its way
into your comedy routines and into your thinking yeah how is it that all right first of all i have
this impression that i grew up in la and i used to come to some of the comedy clubs they'd go to
the improv probably more than anything else and i'd see comedians and they'd suddenly switch
into other languages they'd switch into discussions of science or really abstract discussions of
history for the material and i came to think of comedians very often as being kind of unregulated
super minds is that something that you think is i mean is that i don't think so do you know where
it comes from and i've been i've been in the business too long to think that most most comedians
aren't interested in anything but i mean steve martin yes like banjo and the robin williams
who switch into a million different head spaces in space well i mean look at the the i always say
that i'm in the business the the one thing i that drives me is original self-expression okay
that's what i'm interested in i'm interested in expressing myself fully and originally
and that responsibility is always pretty daunting you know you want and so whatever it takes you
know there's there's uh you get to a point as a comic where you know how to make people laugh i can
write stuff and that's a bag of tricks then can you be thematic can you be original can you be
saying something um and though that's where the real challenge is you get older you're writing
an hour of comedy well you know okay let's see what happens now what what are you trying to
talk about i mean i spend all this time boxing and trying to stay in shape and
going beyond my biology and being ready and you know and keeping my home safe and whatever it might
be but there are too many flanks to cover well where's the funny in that you know i'm gonna die
i'm getting older and i'm way more vulnerable than i can even imagine so um again like let's see
if i can be original about that and let's see if i can discover something and shock myself and
surprise myself with with my next uh 60 minutes of comedy that that i guess so so unregulated
super minds i don't think of it that way i just think about um how i'm gonna say dysregulated
oh dysregulated okay yeah dysregulated yeah i i just uh it's a huge privilege to belong to this
very small fraternity this small group of people that can get up in front of anybody in the world
and make them laugh i i that's never lost on me right so i i i feel very lucky that i can do that
and that i'm part of this small group of people that that does that over and over again so you
have have shown like essentially no interest promoting your own stuff i wonder if i could just
ask you to take a couple of younger colleagues and maybe lift them up for our audience who
should we be watching who's coming up who you think is really deep in terms of observation
and saying use use the comedy directly car michael was doing stand-up for a long time and
i think he said he wanted to quit which is a tragedy because he was so unique uh and his
success is not an accident i he was opening for myself and a guy named dove david off one of my
favorite comics and favorite people and and uh i just immediately was shocked at how smart this
kid was no money uh i think he comes from north carolina and he he was spike lee found him and
he did some specials but they don't do it justice he's just a very special guy um
but uh in terms of sort of the younger up-and-coming folk uh i i i think ali mckofsky is really
funny i think a guy named chappell lacy is really funny i think um i think faheem anwar is really
funny uh there are some really these are people of the comedy store go to the comedy store okay
and on a tuesday night on a wednesday night on a thursday night and sit in the original room
and uh i promise you you'll see some people you've never heard of that'll crack your ribs
and uh and those those names come to mind immediately just funny i mean funny and then
you've got the people like sebastian and all these other people that are working and i have
already arrived but but yeah there there are a lot of young people who are who are again responding
to a confusing time right they're responding to this confusion it's coming into the comedy world
i mean you know those old things you say things you can't say and i mean geez all right well you
know i mean i don't think there should be any rules well i think that the rule that i like
is that the more skilled you are and the more your comedy ultimately uplifts people the more
not only should you be allowed to say but the the more you're obligated for the rest of us to show us
how to find the humor the absurdity and i was was talking to gotta be humor for christ's sake
and you hear stories about people who are in hijack situation hostage situations
even in even in even in prisoners of war they tell fucking jokes right it's all you've got man
sometime well you know has you ever read this short piece again by pjowork which i think is
titled is it serious no and his point is um lies are said with incredible earnestness but it is
truth that is uttered with a dismissive giggle and i just loved geez it was really good he talks
about um this was it thomas more you know being executed or forget who and he says um you know
what his last his last utterances were were jokes about make sure not to miss your mark because i
wouldn't want to create a mess or something like that and you know i think about that as
i tend to believe people who are kind of smirking and giggling without being mean about it just as
a sign of like well hey i'm actually plugged into the madness of all of the tensions in the world
rather than just ideologically saying i know which way to go yeah do you um yeah tell me about
your fascination with science which you're trying to hide and cover up well um i just think that
it's um like maybe like mathematics i mean there's a there's a there's first of all there's a lot of
people who claim that this is scientific and things like that and blah blah blah but um
i like science because at the heart of science it seems that the you start with doubt and you
continue with doubt and uh and usually the i guess i would define science or the scientific method as
that which you can measure and that which you can replicate under the same circumstances i think
i'm right about that i mean to an extent at least that there's a there's a truth to that that you
can't deny well you know if you're if you're anti-vaccine please pick up a history book you
or just a piece of literature to see what smallpox diphtheria measles mumps and all these other
terrible diseases did to people i mean if you really are anti-antibiotics if you don't like
antibiotics well i don't know if you know what consumption is but it's tuberculosis and it killed
a lot of people including Chopin and some of the greatest minds so um we've pushed way beyond our
biology and the those scientists like Fleming etc um those scientists those physicists uh
we owe them a great debt of gratitude the people that invented things like the geiger counter and
x-rays and you know these these and and and and a thousand who experimented on their own family
i mean i was just thinking about i think it's ronkins wife's hand being x-rayed there's a giant
ring on it yeah um yeah and then got you know leukemia or something well you know Marie Curie
yeah i was gonna say another one of these curie you know i don't know if you know benjamin jesty
so this was a like a gentleman farmer who was a physician and he noticed that the milkmaids
never got smallpox that's right that's right and so he injected his own family with the puss from
cows to give them all cowpox reasoning the cowpox protected you against deadly smallpox
how crazy is it that you're willing to experiment on your family or this guy who did um
the that ulcers are not actually caused by stress by a bacteria right lori or something
exactly you know this the badass school of science where you actually have cured hepatitis c which
killed my cousin is that right yes we've cured hepatitis c hep C is at least in northern europeans
i don't know if it's still because i know interferon didn't work at all with african americans but it
worked with uh northern europeans to an extent if you have any other different things you different
biologies but um i mean we have i think it's a nine month regimen where we've we cure it ladies and
gentlemen cure it so i remember the AIDS epidemic i i watched my neighbors die slowly and without
dignity i watched how horrible that disease was i was in new york city i was in a theater scene i was
was an acting class i watched young beautiful men die horribly they had carpose sarcoma they had
lesions all over their faces they had one thing after another i had another friend who wouldn't
let us see him in the hospital because he was when i went to college with him and he just
he just looked like he looked it would give you trauma to look at him i watched it i saw them die
and then i saw uh something called protease inhibitors come along and these motherfuckers had
to rebuy their property because they all sold it and they had to rebuy it and now they all live
normal lives and in fact the AIDS virus has been compromised so often uh because of these different
kinds of cocktail drugs uh that are becoming less and less toxic it's it's had to compromise
itself so often that it is now something you probably can live with like diabetes only the
difference is you don't have to take drugs because it's become such a weakened virus that's what
happens yay yay to western science yay to science forget western science yay to science
doesn't belong to anybody doesn't belong to the west or the east yay to to experimentation
yay to doubt yay to reason and compassion where reason serves compassion i mean this is
the thing that makes me bananas if we had started to tell ourselves i mean i don't know if you
remember this one of the lies about AIDS was that it just began in the homosexual community
and that there was no difference between heterosexual and homosexual transmission
and that was a an attempt at a compassionate lie yeah but it was not actually wasn't true well but
it was also not compassionate because the more that you told these sort of superficial lies
the less you could actually get at who was at risk why and well news organizations and and i
read a book about it i think it was called the news about the news i'm not sure i was
worked at cbs or and and there was a lot of pressure on news organizations to go out and find
heterosexuals with AIDS right and they combed the the landscape for it and found a couple of
women who were straight who had AIDS just to make sure that it wasn't just a gay disease
well in fact it wasn't well but but but but so why so they they couldn't figure out why it was a
heterosexual disease in southeast asia and africa but it wasn't in in north nor in europe
in european populations in the middle east well why why was it also a certain
and gay men got it uh but in fact the gay men that did get it were the ones taking
you know the bottoms if you will right tops a lot of times survive the epidemic and i know a
number of them who did it through my theater days we couldn't figure it out was it a secondary
infection was it health care in africa no what what happened was the bubonic plague i think
what you and i talked about and they have what if you survive the bubonic plague uh and you you
have some gene variation that developed where you have a resistance to the actual disease
unless it's pushed into your body with a hyperdermic needle or or somebody's dick if you will you
know but but otherwise it's going to be hard to contract it that's why the army couldn't figure
out they've test everybody for AIDS and it was the the cases were slim to vanishing and at least
people that were admittedly heterosexual right uh and then we started to see that there was
something going on here that that it was it did discriminate the disease did discriminate
not because god said it so but because there was a genetic there was a generic genetic mutation
thanks to the bubonic plague uh but anyway so so why do i like science i guess it gives me some
answers no but it's more than you like science i mean you're pretty uh you incorporate science
into your comedy yeah and i was curious as to whether those two parts of your brain play
harmoniously and i i would be so lucky you have i mean i'm nowhere i'm not even your area code
in terms of your ability to jump between the romantics and i've never seen anything like it
i've never seen how many comics have you jumped between this i mean you you're all over the place
i don't know man you have a deeper i mean your ability to movies and literature and poetry and
music and so i actually never met anybody like that i'm very flat you're a polymath that's
how i feel about you the the thing i was trying to figure out though and it's something i haven't
cracked uh it would be um can we use comedy as a means of delivering deeper analytic truths is
there a natural fit so for example if i make something rhyme the brain remembers it more easily
i i i set people by saying things that rhyme are more likely to be true and what i really mean
is that when people work out a very pithy aphorism or or a rhyme to remember something
it meant somebody said this was important enough to construct something that the brain will find
sticky and a joke like almost every joke contains an element of surprise if you saw it coming it
wouldn't be fun that's right that's right that's right yes and the answer is of course comedy is
the lubrication comedy is lubricant of course look if you want to change somebody's mind
as jonathan height said you gotta you've gotta make them feel safe you know this is this is
this is where i'd have sam harris and he does a good job for the most part but i'd have him read
the righteous mind again if he hasn't i mean you know jonathan heights damn right about the fact
that if you want to change somebody's mind strike some common ground first you can't tell somebody
who's religious who because their religion gives them meaning and it gives them a feeling of safety
right you cannot tell them you cannot tell them that they are like like laurence krauss and people
like that you know you can't say you believe in a fairy tale it was a book written by peasants
two thousand years ago that makes me really angry when people well that's what laurence
krauss did on my podcast and i said laurence you're you are not building a fucking bridge here
dude i mean you are you can sit there and be right as a physicist all day long but i mean
okay cool dude i mean you're doing zero you're doing you're doing a great job of destroying
you're doing nothing to persuade and destruction is way easier than persuasion it really is it's
my problem with cancel life cancel culture etc so so this is interesting i hadn't heard this before
in some weird way and correct me if i'm wrong there is something about the rationality movement
the skeptical movement that is interested in cancellation of its own but it's canceling religious
culture i think so i i get very worried when somebody uses the word rational over and over
again because they they are religious in their own way they're praying to the god of rationality
i don't think that all the answers lie there yes if you want to figure out a way to have fresh
fruit and vegetable vegetables in the wintertime rationality math science yes if you want to push
ourselves beyond our biology with vaccines and antibiotics of course but man listen listen listen
don't take my mythology away from me do not try to take my romance i like not knowing i love i like
i love not knowing what's not being able to explain certain things look it's like this
if i take a piano and smash it into a thousand pieces and and put it in a big sack i could say
this is a piano but it's not a piano it's not a piano when it's sitting in in a corner it's a
piano only when somebody gets sits down and learns how to touch it just so it's exactly like i think
was alice huxley who was darwin's bulldog you know and and they had this good nature debate at
this this college that and and matthew arnold the american you know poet slash writer slash
philosopher and and there was this great debate where alice huxley said uh you know we were man
started as protozoa and became this pointy eared long-tailed hominid and then we we became
man and i i had that proof because it's called the origin of the species yes absolutely or
there's no question that uh evolution is true uh i believe in evolution but as matthew arnold said
maybe it is true we started we started as pros over became monkeys but there was something about
that monkey that inspired it to greek there was something about that monkey yeah that created
the deep and dark writings of esclis and sophokles uh shakespear the parthenon bethoven motzart duke
ellington uh louis armstrong and the list fucking goes on eric weinstein and it goes on and off
there was something about that that that that um that created beauty for its own sake you know it's
that beautiful that beautiful schiller line man is it man is truly is never more himself than when
at play and play being defined as that thing which you do for its own sake um don't take that
shit away from me i don't want to explain anything bro look it's worse than this we are driving
mysticism narrative fiction out of science when the really amazing science the stuff that is
you know that that is like going to church is increasingly put under pressure from the sort
of skeptic uh rationality community and i skepticism and rationality are super important
to both of us yeah but there's this other impulse which is the imaginative impulse and when you
sick rationality and skepticism on the imaginative impulse at an early stage you are killing the
thing that built all of the rationality to begin with inspiration do you know what this is this
is a climb bottle and the weird thing about it is is that it only really exists in four dimensions
so this is a model of climb bottle we technically we would say it is immersed in our three because
this handle should not be going through this part of the bottle and so there's no inside and no
outside it's like a two mobius bands sewn together the only reason i learned about the climb bottle
was that i was given my father xerox something in his office when i was growing up for the national
lampoon it was this it was a fundraiser for terminal flatulence that looked really official
right that you showed a toilet blown apart and uh you know people suffer from terminal flatulence
but it is potentially curable so at the end of this crazy like foundation promotion fundraiser
on the back page of this thing was a short story about a climb bottle that was used as a
contraceptive device and the idea is that it would take the sperm and send it to the fourth
dimension so no one would get pregnant but this guy gets stuck in the climb bottle now this is a
completely crazy insane thing but i'd never heard of a climb bottle yeah and i remember reading the
story and saying i've got to find out what that is is that a real thing sure enough you know there
was an entire topological theory of non-orientable manifolds and the only way that i got to it
was from a humor magazine right yeah yeah that's great well what about the idea that
you're a mathematician so i heard uh there's a there's a great course called the great ideas of
philosophy and it's uh it's from the teaching company and i just quoted a little bit of uh
david robinson uh dan robinson who is uh written more about philosophy than anybody in the past
30 years but um and he said something interesting he was talking about how you know a theoretical
mathematician spends their whole life you know they had a dream about some of this possibility
this mathematical possibility and they spend their whole life coming up with this equation
that they solve and it bears no real relevance to the material world but then they die and okay
and thanks a lot and we have this theorem that i guess you came up with it was probably 300 pages
long or something like that and then about a hundred years later or 20 years later whenever
it it's used to put a rover on mars or something and it does bear direct relevance to the material
world so you know uh again it's it's what we talked about before it was like there are certain
mythologies you you can disprove that all men are created equal with biology and math you can
actually disprove it very easily you can take lebron james and send us through a whole send a
bunch of tests but there's a deeper truth to it when we collectively when we collectively
embrace this mythology this myth right that we are all created equal it provides a better
fucking world it provides a better cut more food on the table more equality more diverse
more interesting culture and ultimately a stronger culture because we're more creative
so that's a truth so so even though i can disprove it mathematically or biologically for whatever
reason it's a different kind of truth it bears sweeter fruit so what of that what of that crazy
idea thank you uvel harari by the way for bringing that to my attention all right did you did you
see the first or did you hear the first uh terrible interaction between jordan peterson
and sam harris sure did sure did okay fighting and that's what that was i was like sam you know
yeah you backed saman you backed jordan in that i i thought they both got mired down and i liked
them both very much but i do think that sam kept putting this flag there and couldn't move on well
sam i understood what jordan was saying though so let's just recapitulate it for the for the folks
at home yeah so my recollection correct me if this isn't yours is that sam was trying to say
that um truth was very important and jordan was trying to say if something doesn't contribute to
human fitness then in some sense it wasn't true uh a little bit different so i think what's what
jordan was saying was there are truths that would that that there are say scientific truths that if
if followed through with might be self extinguish yes we would we would extinguish the world right
and that's not a that's that's so that that's not a truth that that so so he was trying to
marry truth with fitness is it fitness or with with with um well the if i guess positivity
something so yeah i don't want to be unfair to jordan because i don't want to be unfair to either
one of them but what i was looking to get was your actual insight in something that i've struggled with
on sam's show i said i can reduce most of what i care about or perhaps all of it to four different
values that compete with each other and i said it's truth meaning fitness and grace so there are
things that are true that rob my life of meaning and so i have to trade off between them there are
things that are true that might be less fit like you discover some wave blowing the world up that's
very cheap in any high school student could do it that would decrease human fitness um and then
there are things that are true that are not graceful that are not beautiful that that i wish were not
true and well you know but you don't need to talk about this needs to talk about the idea of plural
truths okay i mean but when i when a chemist looks at a painting when you look at a beautiful
painting like the sistine chapel or something that brings you to your knees right a chemist
could also say well what you see what you think is blue is actually not blue your eyes or that's
a trick that your eye is playing and there'd be truth to that as well which is you're not like
let's take the take the david with its famous distortions of form michael angeles david only
works because it is in fact not truly a human form it's a distorted form that is reprocessed to
be perfect right that's right another another way to look at it let's just take dogs for example
it's true the dogs are scavengers pack animals and hunters and it's also true that they've probably
evolved to manipulate you with their little wags and their ears down and and and so they're scheming
you they're fucking manipulating right okay great it's also true that dogs are awesome yeah that's
true that i kissed them and i love the fuck out of them and then when they die i cry so hard i can't
take okay but it's not that's true too so there's room for all the well see but i don't i don't
like this i love the idea that there are things that actually i'm willing to sacrifice truth for
so you're saying it one way jordan's saying when sam's saying one way what i'm trying to they could
have let go of that because they would have got they got mired down they did and then they had a
that you know i remember sam's agonizing should i do a redo yeah what i get out of it and and this
is an uncomfortable place to be but it's interesting because it's uncomfortable to your point about
what to mine in order to get to comedy so maybe i'm just trying to get to a podcast is why did
you imagine that truth was going to be a great guide to everything else in other words why would
you imagine that truth wouldn't be something that you might have to give up a little bit to get a
better outcome i don't believe that the supreme court is the nine wisest druids just because
they wear black robes but on the other hand maybe i get a really better outcome if i learn how to
suspend disbelief when i go to the supreme court which i've attended once just the way
when i go to a movie you know transport me take me away make me believe that this is in fact true
yeah yeah that's that's that's true i mean that's that's very true there's there again it goes back
to these plural truths it depends on where you're standing and the question you're asking maybe
you know there are all these sort of different variations on it but sometimes something to be
true very true for you right then and there i mean it may make no sense but oh i'm just having a
great time yeah or fuck i love you you know that kind of stuff and then you get then you then you
have time to think about i was like i was gonna buy that car i asked that person to marry me but i
well i really felt it in the moment i mean maybe that's just my biology talking but um uh yeah i
think there are different levels there they're truths with the capital t and then they're smaller
truths maybe they're illusions but i like the illusion well i mean i think that one of the
things that you can point to just the way that the way you talked about why do people get carried
away and end up in vegas marrying each other is that in some sense maybe our biology knows that we
can't trust our rational mind and that if we don't feel swept away that one of the reasons that these
impulses are so hard to explain is is that biology has designed this drive to reproduce to be almost
suicidal that you're willing to sacrifice you know if you think about it in terms of biology
you have soma which doesn't reproduce and you have germ lines like what's between your legs
that has a hope of immortality and you have to make sure that the soma is overwhelmed by the
need to perpetuate the germ and so in fact we're born to be self-destructive and irrational in
our somatic selves because it is our line that in some sense has to live forever yeah you're a
series of sensations you know and you chase some sensations and run away from the others a lot of
times i think that that's where meditation and certainly something that's in heresis i do because
of that book that i've always been fascinated where i read a lot of when i was a young man i read
everything about zen and you know i was very into i was martial arts guy and i read a lot about you
know the japanese tradition of zen then zen in the art of archery and motorcycle maintenance and all
that stuff and and i even was one to my period was like the greeks know nothing and you know
i'm gonna meditate you know and all that stuff but um but sam heresis book spirituality without
religion i really really liked because and i really like his app i'm not a practice but i do it every
day and i've been doing it for almost a year now sam if you're out there you're welcome yeah yeah yeah
he's he's he's you know but you guys haven't hung out i i've never met him let's let's let's let's
rectify that i think you guys would be fast friends i think he's and i you know to be honest
i would love to potentially explore with you some of the issues about how to bring
truly high-level math physics biology to a wider audience i haven't really figured out exactly i
don't think you will eric i think that you well you know they say that einstein was really good
and and i it's actually i take that back einstein they say was really good at explaining the theory
of relativity and gravity and things to a to a kindergartner he could use diagrams and i think
if anybody is qualified to do that it's you because you're you you just are a romantic
dude no i'm just because i'm the emotion but i mean but but yeah yeah and there's such an emotional
core to this stuff right i know there is and and you know when you were talking on rogan about um
how you like leaving this world and you like you're in a world of ideas i i just i haven't stopped
thinking about it i have not stopped thinking about what you said and um and and so you are
eminently qualified to simplify these ideas and turn them into something beautiful if that's true
and i don't know that it maybe it's it's a challenge i know it's a challenge but but if it's true it
has to do with a very weird thing i think which is that symbols were not really available to me
as a language because of my learning issues they sort of they they play around and they jump here
and there and i can't really read equations just the way i can't read music and so for me what
happened was i had to find some other route up the mountain because the symbolic route was
blocked off to me you got to make it relevant so so why i always say to people who are not who
haven't gone down the education road i always say i use these little things to young men i know how
to talk to them i go education's good you know why and they say why i go because it teaches you
the difference between a good idea and a bad idea and they are fucking i like that you know and then
i say you should study some math what the fuck math he goes no no no listen study some geometry
algebra why why you know well because it teaches you how to think and they go what does that mean
i go teaches you how to formulate an argument teaches you how to debate and beat somebody
crush somebody and that's how my father did it to me he goes it gives you ammo it'll teach you
not to be a fuzzy thinker okay any masculine he created a masculine energy around math guess
who got an a in math this guy and i wasn't and i was always thought i didn't have a math brain but
as soon as he did that i was like i got to fight the communists i got to have a brain that's i got
to have a rational mind and i got to learn how to how to you know formulate an argument to beat
that guy in the argument i never i didn't understand that you had to i didn't i hadn't read jonathan
height yet well it was very interesting i don't know if you've ever read einsteins i guess it's a
it's not a eulogy it's his um celebration of plonk for his 60th birthday no so he um
um well just you seem to have read everything so i want to have a respectful okay max plonk
yeah at least i know max's first name plonk's first name so ah yes of course plonk it's pronounced
plonk so he um einstein said look in the in the mansion of science uh you find three groups of
people he says the first is the craftsmen and the craftsmen are largely there uh because they
enjoy the beauty of the construction and the purity of it he says then you find the the competitors
and they're there because science makes for a great game with which to beat uh each other in
contest and he says that there's a third group which is the smallest of the three and he said
that group is the searchers and they don't do most of the work he says the only thing about
the searchers is that the mansion wouldn't be there if not for them and it's just this it's
like a gambit gives you but like these guys this is all that matters to me like when i hear that
when you just get used that metaphor but this is oh fuck how can you not be a searcher the problem is
that i'll never be happy because i'm not i'm not enough of a searcher this it's like the great jazz
musicians you ever everything was albert murray who who spoke about the difference and and you
hear this from yeah but that was a dog whistle that you just pulled like the fact that you brought up
louis armstrong yeah louis armstrong is captured in our public imagination as a novelty singer as
opposed to the greatest genius that jazz ever produced who swing like he invented real modern
jazz almost single-handedly he could get the oh again the great the great ones like this like
charlie parker and like they could be number two maybe they would they would they they knew their
notes there was the song and then they would go off they would they would improv of improv over here
thematically and come back to the theme they'd find their way back i mean that's the whole point
of stand up the whole point of any kind of self-expression living in that danger zone
inspiration doing something you didn't think you could do oh you know that with that great
thing in the karate kid i remember when he he breaks all the bottles and he cuts all and
they go how'd you do that he goes i don't know it's the first time i've ever tried it holy fuck
we all went yay you know i mean we all want to live in that danger zone i mean you know but
gee be a good boy play your horn put it back and go home don't be crazy you might not find your way
back um you know but it it's this is what this podcast hopefully you know it's so fun to talk
this way so well the thing is um i i want to make sure that you can escape this as this episode so
i don't go on forever but i would love to have you back and the thing that would be most meaningful
to me would be to find some way for you for you and me to um explore some relatively difficult
scientific ideas together um to see whether or not we could make great audio and video out of
out of it because the the thing that will be most meaningful for me is if some of the really
gorgeous stuff and you know we both are talking about the the craft and the emotion and the thing
is is that if this doesn't end up producing some amount of transcendence and let's be honest most
of these episodes that i'm going to do are not going to get to the level of transcendence that
i'm looking for but if we can do something to push out the best stuff that people don't know is
there the symphonies that are sitting there and i always make this analogy as sheet music that
is never performed like that's how i view academic papers so many of these things are are symphonic
and they there's no public performance that allows you to say oh that's what those people
we're dealing with oh my god is that really part of our world is that really known and settled
that's amazing yeah i would be very moved because i think you've got a mind like
almost nobody i've ever met in terms of uh range conversational ability and the ability
to also just emotionally and analytically touch a subject simultaneously without one
displacing the other well jeez coming from eric oneson that's a huge compliment but uh
you know i don't know but i'd love to i i would enjoy it and especially trying to come up with
as you were talking about coming up with a complicated we'll end with this but coming
up with a complicated mathematical you know discussing or trying to discover or talk about
you know a complicated scientific idea i was thinking about when socrates was trying to prove
the the existence of the soul and the notion that we are all immortal and have been here forever
he took the two slave boys and asked them a complicated mathematical question and one kid
he asked a series of questions and couldn't get the answer and another kid they were both 11 or
something and asked him the questions and and got the answer after led him to the answer through a
series of questions and he said i think it was to me knows the great mathematic mathematician in
you know in Athens he said now do you see that this boy's soul's not been here long enough so he
