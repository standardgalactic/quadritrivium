culture. There's a lot of things that happened in Germany that were unbelievable that happened well
before Adolf Hitler ever came to power and there you know if I could just even talk about
things that Nazis did that are incredibly beautiful and profound. So for example there's a guy named
Pascal Jordan who contributed some of the algebra around quantum mechanics that finds its way into
beautiful exceptional algebraic structures. I love his work. He was a straight up Nazi or I've
you know communicated with Carl Christian von Weizsiker the economist who was the son of
I guess a Nazi physicist. It's very clear that this kind of German precision enters into the work
that this economist was doing with one of the few people who could evaluate some of my work.
So there are ways in which we have to be in dialogue even with our purest representation of
true evil and have to be able to have a more nuanced relationship with it lest the childlike
relationship of you know this is pure bad and can't be talked about no now it's going to come
erupting out of Pandora's box trying to figure how to put that to bed by having these more
difficult more nuanced conversations is a lot of what what the portal is supposed to be about.
I wonder if we could turn it just towards the end to to your mom. The sadness that I feel
in listening to your story is you know at one level it's cosmic it's about you know two important
cultures that were intertwined in some kind of crazy memetic rivalry and earlier world war
reparations and the disaster that came from that but then there's just this very personal thing
about you and your mom and a question of how do we reconceptualize the work I don't even think
you had a choice in I think you had to do this work I think you were compelled and it was inexorable
in some sense. One thing you talk talk to me about was the idea that in Germany is that in all
cultures there's a concept of besmirching one's family and you can you say what the word for this
is? Nest Bischmütze which means one who dirties the nest and I was thinking about this from the
perspective of this restoration work and art that what you're doing is is that the nest
was Bischmütze if you would by
by the cheap coat of paint over the top of it and I don't think your goal is to focus just on the
whole I think your goal is to restore the nest and that that work may be pretty tough is that a fair
read? Yes and yes it's my goal I if I try to conceptualize that restoration as we're all going
to be able to sit around the table and be loving to each other and have natural relationships with
one another in my at least with the with the generation that came before me so my mother's
generation then I probably won't succeed and I'm not going to try and create that expectation
in my heart a restoration has taken place in the sense that I have sympathy I don't hate
I'm not furious and angry at everybody who came before me I see they're different facades
you can't forgive what some of them did but it's not for me to forgive so there's nothing to do
about it it's the victims who should decide whether to forgive or not like your relative
but when it comes to my own family my children and my husband who are my family now that is
my nest and it's sharing a nest of course with with the others too and that part is
becoming more like the beautiful painting at the beginning of the series the complex painting
when I first had to appear on television when the book was released in Sweden in January in
Swedish language I was asked to come and have an interview on morning television and it was
the first time when the story really hit the headlines everywhere in Sweden and so there's
a big deal in Sweden it's quite a big deal and suddenly after I came off this interview I
became very frightened about how my children would feel because I didn't anticipate that this
would be such a big deal and suddenly it was and I thought how will my children feel all
their friends will know everybody who knows them know that I'm their mother and how do they react
to this because I had not you know talked to them constantly about this through the years neither
had I hidden it from them but now we were in a different situation and well my daughter fixed it
my daughter my daughter showed me that we will move forward be able to hold this complexity
and she showed me by calling me up and saying mom I'm proud of you and it wasn't so much
that the need to feel that my daughter was proud of me that was so important
but what was important was that she could feel the emotion of pride in our family about
being open about what happened and that she doesn't feel
any form of hatred or anger or anything to any of the characters in the story rather she can see
and she can behold it and she knows and she can then draw strength from that and move forward
with that into a society that's changing very quickly and so if there's anything that I any
restoration work that I hope I've succeeded in it's in in that piece in in in making the part of
the nest that's inhabited by my children and me and my husband more true
yes I mean look I can't tell you how well it's not even you I really want to be talking to I
think it's really like I want to be talking to your mom and I want to be letting somebody know
that on the other side of this it's not just a question of shame and sticking somebody's head
in the toilet bowl for the rest of eternity forcing them to relive the worst parts of everything
it's a question of it really needs to be understood that this happened it was as bad as we say it was
and that that is not the entire story and in particular this issue of passing power back and
forth when people who have lineage and connection to the perpetrators of what happened during this
darkest of periods in human history talk about these things and own them from the lineage perspective
because you can't own it personally because it wasn't you and it allows the rest of us to do the
other part of the work which is to say you know I've always felt vaguely guilty about how attached
I am to Schubert leader or you know music is huge for me so you know whether it's Bach or Beethoven
or yeah me too Richard Strauss is my favorite right there you go and you know I remember the
first time I was in Berlin and somebody said my Germanic last name I never wanted to go to Germany
because of my trauma and suddenly I had this question did that sound awful or did it sound
awesome you know it's a very weird thing to be bound up I think that in part Yiddish which is
really some version of Judaic middle-high German we've gotten divorced from Yiddish kite the culture
that in part you know surrounds this language because of this horrible history so I think
that there's so much to be gained from people like you you know sort of owning the connection to it
and talking about the the deepening of understanding of it and the rest of us are in a position
to do the other part of that work which just letting your mom know I couldn't very easily
celebrate things that are Germanic which have had a huge impact and a hugely positive impact on the
world without people like your daughter writing books like this and having the courage to go on
the lecture circuit talking about the unspeakable and so I think it's really important that we
figure out how to restore Germany to her rightful place in the world order as the last people
to have touched the Holocaust from any side you know take their take their last bows
the one thing out let's let's leave on is you told me something I didn't know about child rearing
in Germany and empathy and I wonder if you could just share that a little bit with our listeners
and then I'll say a couple of words and we'll finish it out well I didn't know about it either
really except through observation in my own family my own experience until
Dietzeit major German daily newspaper finally published the research findings that show that
child raising techniques that were practiced in some of the more radical Nazi families but this
was this was these were techniques that were summarized in a book that was written by somebody
called Dr. Johanna Harer in 1934 this book was published and it was a book that made its way into
many Nazi households especially households of SS families and these were ideas about
how to raise children but not only how to raise children it was how to raise them for the struggle
because the the motivating idea behind Hitler society was that there was a constant struggle
going on between the races and the you know the the Aryans and the other degenerate peoples and
and so the the effect of these practices if if you take them in their sum total
is to remove empathy from people and there were all kinds of ways in which this took place mothers
weren't supposed to look into their infant's eyes and things like that and of course I don't think
that most mothers that implemented these things were conscious that that's what they were doing
but that was the that was the effect and I'm not saying that those babies ended up with no empathy
but what the research is showing is that those babies that are now elderly people
are moving into in their 70s if I don't know if you regard a person in their 70s as elderly but
anyway they're about I used to but I'm not that's why I added that but but um what is emerging is
that in families where these techniques were implemented in a systematic manner the effects
on the children were very serious and this there was research available about this already back
in the early 90s but no German paper wanted to touch it no one wanted to publish it wow and it was
at the beginning of this year Dietzite had the courage to publish an article about this which
was almost immediately translated into English and published in Scientific American and um
without going into the details when I read about it I recognized a lot of things and just
emotionally from from from things reactions the behaviors I'd seen in the generation that came
before me the behavior between my grandmother and her children things that I then experienced
because no one in my family really confronted you have to confront what came before you in order
not to repeat it and unfortunately that didn't happen so I am familiar with some of these things
and I think this is going to be very a very big thing and very important for a lot of families
that this is coming up out into the open now I think it's also important because there are other
places where extremism exists in the world and questions about whether the children of extremists
should be should remain with those extremists or not and I must say with my with with what I know
I would question whether that's a good idea in all cases because maybe some of those children would
be better off being raised in other families depends on a number of factors you're the grandchild of
extremists I know I don't know what to say about that but but I think what I can can say is that
the tendrils of that time are so long and so many yeah that
the remembering yeah will go on in another way and it's going to go on for a very long time
and it is the remembering will happen through those kinds of things these child rearing practices
were something that have left an imprint on families through generations what is more shocking
is that in 1945 when the war was over right and this this particular book which was called the
German mother and her first child should have been put on a big heap and well maybe we shouldn't
burn books but it should have just been it no I want to read it anymore and instead the worst
Nazi ideology was taken out of it it was republished and also translated to a number of European
languages and sold continued to be sold throughout Europe so these ideas continued to affect
you know people into the 1960s and then the 70s there was a break with this you know late 60s
there were the student revolts in Germany and then there was a sort of and and also student
revolts in different parts of Europe and so yeah exactly and so then this stuff started to be
people distanced themselves from this but it continued to have an impact after the war so
there are these continuities that means that the tendrils of the Nazis reached even further
that's not to say that the techniques that were in there are solely attributable to the Nazis because
they also drew on thinking that came before them there's you know there's an intertwining of responsible
and even very high German thought with this very dangerous and low Nazism authoritarian and authoritarianism
and of course you know it's not like there's no country on earth that's been immunized from
the authoritarian tendencies and you know there are founding murders and atrocities found everywhere
I don't want to overdo the idea that this is totally singular to Germany but just with this
empathy riff maybe we could close it out by me asking for something that I would never be able
to ask for if you hadn't done the hard work and might show a payoff to your family and anyone
else who's interested I would never want to hear a humanizing story about your life with your great
with with your grandmother and not a Germanic one but because of this work I wonder if we
shouldn't sort of explore a payoff of it which is can you take me into something that's really
precious and sweet to you about your relationship with your grandma as you said a committed Nazi
till 103 or whatever it is this work opens up to show what the benefit is of actually confronting
this that this is something that would be of interest to somebody who would would never be of interest
to me and under any other circumstance when I was writing the last chapter of my book and
actually it was that was the short version of the book so that's no longer the last chapter but
now it's somewhere in the middle of the book but it is the part of of the pendulum
where I reflect on my grandmother's death because she passed away in 2014 somewhere in the middle
of where I was doing my research and when I first excuse me when I first wrote
this section about my reflection on her passing I hurled my fury at her and then I took those pages
and I sat in the couch and I thought that's a lie that's a lie you're just doing that for
everybody else because everybody else wants you to hate her yeah but you don't hate her you don't
you love her but you also realize that she did she supported very bad things yep and so I wrote
rewrote it and what I wrote there was a recognition that my grandmother had influenced me and formed
my life in ways that I can never quantify she was an enormous influence on my life yeah yes she was
and well partly led me into this research after all it was her willingness to speak with me
over very very many years about many things just not
just not certain pieces of the the essential truth was just that they were an ss couple
but she was willing to speak with me about very many things opened up for me the gray zone that
women inhabited under Nazism that they were both victims and perpetrators at the same time because
Nazism also promoted male violence including at home and so I'm very formed by her and I
recognized it there and I went back to one particular memory which is which is a sweet
memory of her that I try to keep in my mind I don't cling to it because I can actually today
hold both the memory of her sitting there
in a harsh voice trying to convince me the Holocaust didn't happen as well as this sweet
memory but you can't let one memory erase the other one because then you're not you're not
dealing with the reality you're not facing the truth so the other memory is when I was a young
girl and I was I was kind of chubby as some young girls are and my mother sent me to stay with her
rather than in the apartment where the rest of the family were staying because my grandmother
was into health food into healthy food and she had a way of handling food in a very sparing way as
many people from a war generation people the person who's been through two world wars is very
sparing with food and she would prepare a muesli for the following day the night before because it
had to it had to rest before you ate it on the next morning it was a way of handling the fruits of
the earth with respect in a way that we don't do in our consumer society that's a problem
and we sat there grating an apple together and I would watch her grating this apple with such
reverence into this bowl because she really appreciated every ingredient and she would
talk quietly to me in her tiny little kitchen about you know not having food the absence of food
why this apple was healthy and the next day the next morning we would eat it together together
in this apartment and to me it's a positive memory it's a simple memory it's full of it's full of
things that we have lost in our society that perhaps we need to find our way back to
greater reverence for things that the earth produces and so I keep that with me next to
the other memories as well well thank you for trusting me with in my audience with a beautiful
vignette from your life with your grandma and for making it possible just to understand the
complexity you know the old adage that hurt people hurt people there were a lot of hurt
people in Germany before the Nazis came to power and people got swept up in things and there's
responsibility and a lack of responsibility and I assume we'll spend many years trying to sort out
what's what but I want to just say thank you at like the most human of levels I have so much love
