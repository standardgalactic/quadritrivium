and stigler that allows us to make assumptions about human beings that are known to be wildly
untrue and the way out strangely enough is through differential geometry the differential
geometry of markets so that's something that i think we're going to be very interested in bringing
to you i don't know whether the idea of geometric markets is something that can be easily explained
to a mass audience but this theory of geometric marginalism is in fact a starter theory
that if that is successful might allow us to discuss an even more profound attempt
which would be this concept that i've called geometric unity now when i talk about getting
off the planet i have no idea whether or not it is in fact possible to go beyond the solar system
nobody's ever done it it's been relatively irresponsible to think in these terms ever
since we've understood what we're up against in particular in the form of einstein's restrictions
through the general and special theories of relativity but i do know this if we are to have
a hope of visiting all of those exotic locations we can see in the night sky when we're far from
a city and the moon is not blocking out all of the stars and galaxies i do know that if we are
going to have a hope of visiting someplace truly remote it's probably going to come through a
better understanding of the source code of reality now up until this point we've talked about this
in terms of the so-called theory of everything and if you'll notice we have a very funny pattern
about this a very small number of highly regarded physicists have been entitled to talk and dream
openly about a theory of everything most commonly in the form of string theory yet the current
string theoretic revolution which began in 1984 with something called the anomaly cancellation
has largely petered out true some people diarads in the field will continue to say that this is the
best time to enter theoretical physics and that even if some of the original hype was misplaced
that there's no reason to think that the long-term prospects are dim well that's not true we all know
that that's not true why well we had to buy an enormous accelerator in geneva in which to test
some of our earlier theories and in fact while it found the what appears to be the higgs particle
it's found very little else beyond the standard model in fact nothing of significance are we
going to continue to fund such machines when our successes become more remote are we going to continue
to be able to attract the top minds as we have always been able to attract them into theoretical
physics again i think that as other occupations continue to offer more money and physics offers
less stability and less interest and excitement as a field it's going to be very difficult to
compete for talent if we're going to do something now is the time we still have the expertise we
still have enough of the infrastructure sure in my opinion it may be decaying and i don't even really
particularly get along with this community but this is the community of greatest agency of
greatest intelligence and it has to be reinvigorated we need to get this community more money we need
to get them more security and we need to get them once again dreaming up the future now they brought
us the future when they brought us the world wide web which came out of cern when they developed
the semiconductor they effectively invented molecular biology as a side project they ended
world war two and they gave us the communications technology in which our phones communicate
with remote towers and allow us to connect to people a world away with very little delay
in essence our entire economy owes itself to theoretical physics and are we going to let this
field wither and die on the fine because it hasn't been able to succeed in roughly 45 years i would
say that this is the place that we have to bring the fight people have not understood how vulnerable
we are when we start to lose our most dynamic communities and we find ourselves incapable
of fighting for the resources either in terms of neurons or in terms of dollars that are necessary
to sustain our hope of progress further i think we're going to explain a lot of our theorizing
some of which has been covered in the annual edge essays for edge.org in which
effectively we've engaged in a 10 year strategy i've always wondered what would be the best way
of sneaking a weapon through airport security even though i've never attempted to do anything like
that i always thought that the best way of doing it would be to do it in pieces where each piece is
not entirely understandable as being part of something that is being screened for well that's
what i chose to do in the edge essays that we'll be discussing i think the first essay i wrote was
called go virtual young man which was in response to what i was just learning about in terms of
bitcoin another one was about kayfabe or the system of lies that is the substrate of professional
wrestling that was about my fear of an election cycle in which effectively everyone would know
that everything was fake but we would still be somehow dependent on the pantomime and theatrics
in order to conduct the business of our society another one was on russell conjugation a russell
conjugation if you don't know has to do with how we emotionally shade our language so that people
can can understand what our content is but they don't realize that we are emotionally coercing
them to feel differently about things than they would if they simply thought about them from first
principles so there's a large number of essays that i want to discuss with you including one on
anthropic capitalism now the question of anthropic capitalism is simply this was the last 200 years
in anomaly was it a very bizarre time in which effectively markets were without parallel in
organizing human activity and is it possible when we say something like late stage capitalism
that we've actually blown through this period where capitalism it's itself a danger to our
society now we have nothing else to pick up from it if we look outside our windows in any major
metropolitan area we'll see that people are engaged in some self-organizing activity and if
our only two possibilities of keeping that going are either to allow the market to run a relatively
unfettered or to begin telling people what to do as if central command was viable then we're in a
really tough spot i think we're gonna have to start thinking about new systems and i don't
know what those systems will be but since we've been able to reach major candidates like the
up and coming andrew yang on the democratic side i'm at least hopeful that there are places
in which these new ideas might have a hearing so to sum up what is the portal the portal is
a search for some way out of the stasis in which we have lived if our lives have largely been
lived in an intellectual bubble that dates from the early 70s it's time to pop that bubble and to
find out what's on the outside i hope you'll join me trying to find the portal and we can go through
together thank you
um
You
