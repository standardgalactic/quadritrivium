Hi. It's Eric Weinstein. Just to put it simply, we're blown away. We've just released the
first episode of The Portal, which is my new show, and we had a response and a reaction
that we really couldn't have imagined. So while we have several shows in the can and
we have some great interviews lined up, instead, one of the producers asked me to simply come
in and do an extended extemporaneous riff to say what the show is likely to be about. Now,
there was no script, there was no preparation, and there'll be a little bit of light editing,
but more or less what we thought might be interesting is to have you in on the ground
floor. If you're listening and subscribing at this point in our history, you deserve to know
how we're thinking and what's up next without having all of the rough edges rounded and polished
for your listening pleasure. So it's going to be a little bit imperfect, but I hope you'll enjoy
what comes next, which is an improvisational riff on where we may be going with the show,
The Portal. Hope you like it.
Hello, I'm Eric Weinstein, and you've found The Portal. This is our second episode. Perhaps
you caught our first one, which I interviewed my friend Peter Thiel. In that conversation,
Peter and I discussed a great many things, but one of the, let's say overarching themes is that
somehow the world around us seems to have been completely mis-explained and not only
mis-explained for a short period of time, but perhaps mis-explained for decades without anyone
much noticing. At least that was our contention. The contention is that because of a dizzying
amount of change in a small number of sectors, we have misinterpreted what is going on much more
generally as change across a great number of sectors. Likewise, while we have generally enjoyed
a period of relative peace and prosperity, we have been somewhat inert to the growing danger
that comes from the sheer amount of violent potential that has so far been kept under wraps
in the stasis that followed World War II. So these two features of our world, that is a generally
peaceful world in which the potential for violence and destruction has gotten ever greater,
and a world in which a small number of sectors are advancing at a breakneck pace,
but leaving behind the majority of sectors where nothing much seems to be happening, seems to be
a relatively uncommon picture to be discussed at least in official channels. What the Portal is
going to be about is breaking this bubble. This is a bubble that we believe in some sense has been
around since the early 1970s and almost all of us have grown up having our lives defined and
determined by the set of common misconceptions about the world in which we live. So what is the
Portal? The Portal is an attempt to end this bubble, to look beyond the intellectual laziness
and stasis that is available everywhere through the institutional media, through let's say legacy
sense-making structures, and to start listening in on a different conversation, perhaps a conversation
that many of you are relatively unfamiliar with in which different players, different names,
are rotated into the spotlight and the familiar pundits and talking heads are rotated out.
Now what is it that this group of people is thinking about? What are they working on? What
do they believe? Well in part many of them are worried about the idea of complacency and excited
about the idea of breaking through a Portal into a different space. Sometimes that's in an area like
radical life extension where so far up until the present almost no one has gotten beyond the
biblical age of Moses set at 120 years by convention. If that's been the hard stop,
some people are now dreaming about life expectancies that could go into 200 or 300 years if we could
only find access to the right molecular mechanisms. Likewise in areas like physics
we have the possibility that there are two main dominant theories that are irreconcilable and therefore
incomplete. What if we had an ability to bridge those theories and come up with a much more detailed
and accurate theory that spanned both the phenomena covered by Einstein's general relativity
and the quantum theory known as the standard model? Would there be something to do,
something wholly unexpected? We don't know. We also dream of limitless energy, perhaps fusion
technology or incredible storage devices would allow us to harness much greener energy sources.
Perhaps we would find some way of living in a world of abundance in which we could print things
freeing us from drudgery using artificial intelligence and machine learning and learn
to have much more harmonious and fulfilling existences. Or perhaps this would unleash some
sort of economic problem whereby very few of us would be able to earn a living in this new world
and that the abundance that we thought we craved would in fact be a curse in disguise.
What I want to do is to talk to you very simply and plainly about the problems that we currently
face that almost no one is willing to discuss. And that is that we have a world largely built
for rapid growth in which that kind of broad growth is no longer found easily simply by looking
with better instruments, with more patience and more detail at the world in which we live.
Let me give you a slightly different picture of where we are as a society,
one that you've probably not thought of. Imagine somebody who has graduated from high school but
one, two, three years later hasn't found something else to do with their life and they're hanging
around the same high school as fewer and fewer of the students that they once knew continue to
attend classes. Effectively this is getting creepier and creepier and I think that that's in large
measure where we are with the technological revolutions that we have undertaken. At some
point it was incredibly cool to figure out how to place a long-distance call between continents
but this has become commonplace. Likewise many of the fantastic things that once got us excited
about the release of every new iPhone now has us relatively unexcited about the new suite of apps
and features that every new phone promises will be slightly different than the one before.
So I think what's important to think about is how optimistic we once were. What did we think
we were going to do? I think we thought we were going to be curing diseases. Wouldn't it be great
not to have lost anyone in your family from cancer when we declared a war on cancer in the early 1970s?
What did we think we were going to be doing with energy? Didn't we think that fusion was around
the corner? If you think about all of the things that we could be doing we've learned in most of
these areas that it is no longer mature to hope. To imagine that somehow we are going to be able
to make the future very different than the present. Yes things will get a little bit better but are
they going to get dramatically better? Are we going to be leading a life in our here and our now
that would allow a kind of escapist lifestyle that we saw on Star Trek or even in Star Wars which
came out in the 60s and 70s respectively? I think that in general most of us have realized that these
dreams have remained dreams for so long that we've consigned them to the world of children.
Perhaps very dim people believe these things. What I'm interested in is trying to get the smartest,
most dynamic, and most agentic people in our society once again talking to each other and
ignoring the people who are most focused on dampening all of our enthusiasm. Now perhaps you
think, look this doesn't sound very scientific. Shouldn't we be relying on the best systems we
have? For example isn't peer reviewed science the gold standard? Well I would say no. Peer review
is a relatively recent invention and I would even say an intrusion into the hard sciences.
In 1953 when the double helix was elucidated by Watson and Crick they submitted it to the journal
Nature but it was never peer reviewed. Why? Because an editor's job was to figure out
whether it was worthy of publication and in fact the editor at the time if I recall correctly
said that anybody who saw this paper would be so influenced by it that he couldn't take the risk
sending it out for any kind of review. Well if that's true let's say peer review isn't
really the centerpiece of our science. Is the scientific method the centerpiece of our science?
Well at some level sure it's like proof checking but a lot of the work that we do in science has
been incredibly imaginative and you might even say it's been irresponsible until it comes into
final form and can be reconciled with experiment but instead we've developed a culture in which
immediately upon proposing something we are told that the sinquanon of science is that there be
agreement between theory and experiment. Well this is wholly untrue in fact if you go back
to Paul Dirac's great scientific American article in the early 60s he says that it is much more
important that a physical theory have mathematical beauty and that we learn to trust a theory even
when it doesn't agree with experiment if it has a kind of intellectual coherence to it.
But how often are people pointed to something like Dirac's 1963 paper in fact you could look
to Jim Watson who's told us that in order to make great advances we have to be irresponsible.
Now this is a very odd feature of the world many of our top people do not seem to play by the rules
that have been set for everyone else and the question is if we are in a situation in which we
have unleashed such incredible destructive power as we did with the hydrogen bomb and in potentially
unlocking the cell why is it that we are so incredibly timid about what it is that we might
do next we have all the destructive power that we need already at our fingertips what we don't
have is the ability to escape our fate in fact what we need is to find the portal to find a way out
to find new economic vistas that will allow far larger numbers of people to participate
without causing an ecological disaster if you take all the people let's say in India China Bangladesh
what have you who are lead leading lives at a far lower economic level than we are if you
were to elevate them to our current level as we have in the United States you would be causing
an ecological disaster well clearly we are not going to leave these people behind we need them
to be full participants in whatever beautiful future we're trying to create and that future has
to be ecologically sound because we don't have the ability to spoil the planet as we dream about
universal human prosperity so what are we going to do well i think that the most irresponsible
thing to do is to stop dreaming to get our dreams to be so small that we're not embarrassed to share
them in public i think what we need to do is to start dreaming much more aggressively dream much
bigger and start dreaming in public with each other harmoniously if we can for have our dreams
fight each other but at least start unlocking the potential of human imagination and not immediately
grounding every new idea in some sort of race to see whether we can invalidate it give it enough
of a room to grow you know this is how we used to talk about protecting infant industries before
we decided that free trade should always be the rule of the day and that we should have no barriers
to protect new ideas in a nursery where they might learn to thrive before testing to see
whether they can survive as adults what we're going to do in this program is effectively to
declare war war on stasis war on groupthink war on everything that has innervated our society
and we're going to do it because we have the ability now to compete with the networks that
previously grew up to distribute whatever it was that was portrayed as sense-making you can tell
that there's something wrong with both cnn and fox if you're reading the new york times carefully
you can tell that the narrative arcs in the daily newspaper clearly have to have been thought out
to cover many days and long before the facts are known somehow we are living in somebody else's
reality what we need to do is to return to our own future now there's no question that we might
make some serious mistakes people may die there may be very serious consequences of experimenting
but it's certain that if we stay here and we do not attempt to grow beyond the problems
that we've previously created for ourselves in decades past that the future is not going to be
appealing or powerful enough to evade some of the fates that some people are seeing as being
nearly inescapable if we cannot create a larger pie we're going to have to engage in a lot of zero
sum games we're going to have to deal an incredible amount with some kind of social engineering project
which quite frankly i don't see having any hope of succeeding we're barely able to hold a conversation
could we actually hold a constitutional convention if our new technology required that we rethink
the boundaries of what constitutes search and seizure whether hate speech should be included
with free speech and our foundational documents have we really gotten to a place in which we can
only look back because we are afraid to look forward the portal is going to attempt to answer
these questions so it might well be asked how are we going to try to do something different on
the portal that might actually have a significant impact on our society and i'm going to begin in a
kind of unexpected place how are we going to get the portal to be self-supporting well oddly when
we proposed this podcast a friend of the program decided that he was in a position through business
success to fund the portal and to in fact remove the need for advertising from our desire to
broadcast and i thought about this long and hard of course it's very appealing to imagine that somebody
cares so much about what's happening on the program that they're willing to bankroll it
however i think we've decided against it at least initially and i wanted to share some of my reasoning
the reasoning is that very few programs could possibly afford to do that and as important as
this program is it's really not about me it's about what can we do with sense making done
individualistically and outside of any kind of institutional control my belief is that the more
people are able to podcast the more people are able to use these new channels for outreach
the greater the likelihood that we can create an ecosystem of interesting disruptive ideas to
change everything so in fact it's much more important that we figure out some way of fixing
the business model where all of these podcasts are somehow delivering value that people are at
least initially unwilling to pay for because we've all been taught to expect that these things that
we consume electronically are free well we want to have the same problem at least initially as
everyone else so that we can work on it can we teach advertisers and capitalists to stay the
course when somebody says something controversial but responsible to weather a storm of a boycott
can we create what i've called risk vertizers who actually pledge some loyalty to the people that
you most want to see talking about the issues you most want to hear discussed if they can do so
responsibly these risk vertizers are people that we're going to go in search of so if you have a
product that you think is terrific then you want to reach people with tremendous brand loyalty
i hope you'll consider being a risk vertizer for the portal podcast and that means effectively
getting to know us our audience and not immediately buckling at the first sign that there's some sort
of social media storm coming your way furthermore i think we're going to talk about science and we're
not going to be dumbing it down i'm very frustrated that very often when you see top quality scientists
going into let's say public outreach mode that they very often adulterate the subject matter in
an attempt to make it more understandable now of course that's inevitable when you have people
specializing in very difficult subjects that they've studied for years but i also feel that
partially what happened is is that we got into a habit of underestimating the intelligence of the
audience rather than giving the audience the need to look up some terminology to make some forays
of their own with a search engine we've gotten them into a complacent state where if they don't
immediately understand something then somehow the fault is with the broadcaster well i think
we reject this for a very simple reason do you remember when tv was called the idiot box i know
that i'm of an age uh that that was a very common thing to do once upon a time but if you look at
all the amazing things that have been happening on tv it's totally changed the format to watch
something like game of thrones or the sopranos or madmen now why is that because the character
lines and the story lines and the development are so much more complex than anything people are able
to do in a smaller format that in fact television quite surprisingly became the most distinguished
media in which one can now write well likewise i think we need to do the same thing for the public
discussion of science we need to draw more of you in and count on the fact that we've been
underestimating the intelligence of our followers for quite some time and start playing up to your
level and we may lose you along the way but i have faith that with our ability to monitor your
comments and listen to your feedback that we can find an entirely new level of explication in which
many of you will find that far from being left behind by specialists you are actually able to
participate in conversations that have previously been restricted only to experts so i think we're
going to try to pitch it at a higher level we're going to try to rescue a business model
so that we can get more people with the ability to experiment in front of a camera as i'm doing now
but we've also decided to explore some topics that i think could break some serious ground
in particular i think that one of the things we're really interested in doing is talking
about a couple of new economic models that have been shared with the world rather narrowly up
until now one of which involves what might be called cosian immigration which i'll explain later
shows that simply opening borders is in no way a free market solution that you have to securitize
rights and allow people to trade them in order to get free market economics to work in the
immigration area another of which has to do with bilateral trade and the geometry of markets
culminating eventually in a model of humans in which they are allowed to change their tastes
now it sounds very strange to say that economic theory falls apart when human beings change their
tastes but since at least the late 1970s we've had an excuse in place in the work of becker
and stigler that allows us to make assumptions about human beings that are known to be wildly
untrue and the way out strangely enough is through differential geometry the differential
geometry of markets so that's something that i think we're going to be very interested in bringing
to you i don't know whether the idea of geometric markets is something that can be easily explained
to a mass audience but this theory of geometric marginalism is in fact a starter theory
that if that is successful might allow us to discuss an even more profound attempt
which would be this concept that i've called geometric unity now when i talk about getting
off the planet i have no idea whether or not it is in fact possible to go beyond the solar system
nobody's ever done it it's been relatively irresponsible to think in these terms ever
since we've understood what we're up against in particular in the form of einstein's restrictions
through the general and special theories of relativity but i do know this if we are to have
a hope of visiting all of those exotic locations we can see in the night sky when we're far from
a city and the moon is not blocking out all of the stars and galaxies i do know that if we are
going to have a hope of visiting someplace truly remote it's probably going to come through a
better understanding of the source code of reality now up until this point we've talked about this
in terms of the so-called theory of everything and if you'll notice we have a very funny pattern
about this a very small number of highly regarded physicists have been entitled to talk and dream
openly about a theory of everything most commonly in the form of string theory yet the current
string theoretic revolution which began in 1984 with something called the anomaly cancellation
has largely petered out true some people diarads in the field will continue to say that this is the
best time to enter theoretical physics and that even if some of the original hype was misplaced
that there's no reason to think that the long-term prospects are dim well that's not true we all know
that that's not true why well we had to buy an enormous accelerator in geneva in which to test
some of our earlier theories and in fact while it found the what appears to be the higgs particle
it's found very little else beyond the standard model in fact nothing of significance are we
going to continue to fund such machines when our successes become more remote are we going to continue
to be able to attract the top minds as we have always been able to attract them into theoretical
physics again i think that as other occupations continue to offer more money and physics offers
less stability and less interest and excitement as a field it's going to be very difficult to
compete for talent if we're going to do something now is the time we still have the expertise we
still have enough of the infrastructure sure in my opinion it may be decaying and i don't even really
particularly get along with this community but this is the community of greatest agency of
greatest intelligence and it has to be reinvigorated we need to get this community more money we need
to get them more security and we need to get them once again dreaming up the future now they brought
us the future when they brought us the world wide web which came out of cern when they developed
the semiconductor they effectively invented molecular biology as a side project they ended
world war two and they gave us the communications technology in which our phones communicate
with remote towers and allow us to connect to people a world away with very little delay
in essence our entire economy owes itself to theoretical physics and are we going to let this
field wither and die on the fine because it hasn't been able to succeed in roughly 45 years i would
say that this is the place that we have to bring the fight people have not understood how vulnerable
we are when we start to lose our most dynamic communities and we find ourselves incapable
of fighting for the resources either in terms of neurons or in terms of dollars that are necessary
to sustain our hope of progress further i think we're going to explain a lot of our theorizing
some of which has been covered in the annual edge essays for edge.org in which
effectively we've engaged in a 10 year strategy i've always wondered what would be the best way
of sneaking a weapon through airport security even though i've never attempted to do anything like
that i always thought that the best way of doing it would be to do it in pieces where each piece is
not entirely understandable as being part of something that is being screened for well that's
what i chose to do in the edge essays that we'll be discussing i think the first essay i wrote was
called go virtual young man which was in response to what i was just learning about in terms of
bitcoin another one was about kayfabe or the system of lies that is the substrate of professional
wrestling that was about my fear of an election cycle in which effectively everyone would know
that everything was fake but we would still be somehow dependent on the pantomime and theatrics
in order to conduct the business of our society another one was on russell conjugation a russell
conjugation if you don't know has to do with how we emotionally shade our language so that people
can can understand what our content is but they don't realize that we are emotionally coercing
them to feel differently about things than they would if they simply thought about them from first
principles so there's a large number of essays that i want to discuss with you including one on
anthropic capitalism now the question of anthropic capitalism is simply this was the last 200 years
in anomaly was it a very bizarre time in which effectively markets were without parallel in
organizing human activity and is it possible when we say something like late stage capitalism
that we've actually blown through this period where capitalism it's itself a danger to our
society now we have nothing else to pick up from it if we look outside our windows in any major
metropolitan area we'll see that people are engaged in some self-organizing activity and if
our only two possibilities of keeping that going are either to allow the market to run a relatively
unfettered or to begin telling people what to do as if central command was viable then we're in a
really tough spot i think we're gonna have to start thinking about new systems and i don't
know what those systems will be but since we've been able to reach major candidates like the
up and coming andrew yang on the democratic side i'm at least hopeful that there are places
in which these new ideas might have a hearing so to sum up what is the portal the portal is
a search for some way out of the stasis in which we have lived if our lives have largely been
lived in an intellectual bubble that dates from the early 70s it's time to pop that bubble and to
find out what's on the outside i hope you'll join me trying to find the portal and we can go through
together thank you
um
You
