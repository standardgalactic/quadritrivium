that this is all being driven by profit I believe that there is some force that we don't understand
that keeps the gated institutional narrative gated yes I think profit is one part of it and
that's why I say we have to think of profit as one aspect of kind of power or rivalrous dynamic
more largely because it's I think government or academia or religious or cultural groups or
profit can all influence the nature of narrative and information I think there's an economy of
shame and terror say more about that I believe that the real reason that this
works the way it does is we have not even gotten to a very basic point where it is considered
acceptable to say I want immigration restricted
now I point this out because I think it's very funny most people who want immigration restricted
and enjoy food from other cultures they they have friends who come from other places
they enjoy travel there's nothing xenophobic about them in general they are xenophilic
and the idea that you can be both xenophilic fascinated and interested in the world's cultures
and want immigration to your country restricted and that this is the generic position that the
average person holds this position is a story that appears nowhere so nobody has an idea that
xenophilic restrictionists might be a plurality or a majority in the country because there is a rule
that says anyone who calls for restriction of immigration must be tarred as a xenophobe right
and I think it's time to double dog dare the people who are keeping this level of discipline
to say why cannot why is it impossible to be a xenophilic restrictionist what I think is is that
the economy of shame is such that whoever acts first to make this point is in such danger for
their livelihood their reputation that they are going to be tarred and feathered and one of the
things that I'm trying to show people is is that you can you can make these points now I can't do
this on CNN but I can do this on pirate radio this is basically audio samos dot it to take the
Russian underground mimeograph movement as a template we can say things here but there's only
a matter of time before this starts to become problematic to the institutional structure
and it responds by debiting my account oh well that that's that alt right guy
yeah he seems disgruntled or you know he seems a gloomy and out of touch and then the fear
uncertainty and doubt campaign starts and that's what is actually keeping everybody in line it's
not that there isn't money to be made there's tons of money to be made what what's happened is
is that it's been too easy to pick off the initial adopters I agree and I'm curious what your
explanation of how that phenomenon emerged oh that's a really so
let's really get into it we did have a
dissension suppression unit inside of the FBI which was called co-intel pro
and it tried to induce Martin Luther King Jr to suicide through a letter from Sullivan
who was I think number one or number two maybe under Hoover this thing lived inside of the FBI
it probably tried to tell John Lennon that he was a traitorous it tried to humiliate Gene Seberg
who was a Black Panther supporter by planning false information inside of mainstream media
Newsweek in Los Angeles Times it tried to get La Cosa Nostra to kill Dick Gregory the famous
comedian and black civil rights leader so we did have a dirty tricks unit inside of the United
States that needs to be known broadly which was pretty thoroughly investigated in the mid 1970s
and once we saw that we were engaged in these dirty tricks against our own people
we were kind of shocked and flipped out and the economy wasn't in great shape
and then Ronald Reagan came writing in and I think he pardoned Mark Felt
who had been the head of co-intel pro after Hoover but he was also deep throat and so you had this
very strange situation that we got this reboot during the Reagan years where we went back to some
sort of more traditional more patriotic imagined version of our country and my belief is that in
part when Bill Clinton decided that he couldn't take yet another loss to the Republican party
he was going to start experimenting with Republicanism inside of the Democratic party
by that point we had two parties that more or less were two flavors of the same thing I refer to
the that collective as the looting party and the looting party the neoliberals the neoconservatives
sort of intergenerational warfare within the country in the US and my take on it is that
the common ideology is that profit had to be found abroad and so you had to loosen the bonds to
your fellow citizens and that's where all of this kind of the market always knows best we need to
offshore and downsize and securitize what I've called the new gimmick economy so that right now
we're waking up from the new gimmick economy and having never lived in anything really authentic
unless we're quite old so my belief is is that during that period of time there was very swift
retribution for anyone who dissented famously a prominent trade theorist who
was talking about the benefits of restriction of trade restrictions for infant industries let's say
apparently got a call from one of the people high up in the field say oh you seem to be a very
bright young man it'd be a shame if anything happened to your career and so this kind of
idea suppression is the hallmark well it is what I think these two generations the baby boomers and
the silent generation may become best known for in the future that this was a period in which
new corrective ideas had to be suppressed because of the fragility of the system we saw the fragility
break out in 2008 we saw how vulnerable we were in 2001 and we see that the whole sense making
apparatus is breaking down from the Trump election so these have been the three moments
when the gated institutional narrative has broken because it just got overwhelmed by events
but other than that the key was making sure that people like you or like me or like Peter
are not mainstream the cost of listening to us has to be driven to astronomical levels
so we have to we have to look wild eyed we have to you know they can't call me uneducated if I have
a Harvard PhD which is one of the funny parts of the system but the idea is that you have to say
well you know maybe he used to be smart but he's gone fringe so the the social cost it's a more
it's amazing how effective such small amounts of that can be well it's also just funny I mean it just
there's so many hours of audio of us and I was just astounded for example with the number of
people who would try to portray let's say my brother as right wing I mean from my perspective
can you imagine making that decision that you guys far left is Brett and you're going to spend
your credibility pretending that he's like allied with the Nazis I just I just it doesn't even make
sense to me because it's it's simply to me a way to incinerate your credibility and yet
the way the system works is you incinerate people's viability it's economic warfare that
if your reputation is damaged you can't be trusted you know and and that's how that's
how this this enforcement has worked so you asked me the question how does it work to keep this in
line it's too trivially easy to destroy individuals and my question has always been
is there a program which I have tentatively called no living heroes I don't know if you've
heard this riff before Charles Lindbergh who was not a great human being
almost kept the US out of World War two he said why is this why is this America's problem
and if you think about it he had self minted credibility and that he got into a plane and
he flew it over an ocean solo and became a hero and that level of visibility allowed him to compete
with the state okay I think that there was a program after Lindbergh that said
individuals should not be able to amass sufficient mindshare to affect the course of government
policy and this is a question in my mind is there a program that got started that said
we're going to wait and see if anything starts to bubble up that seems to have integrity
seems to have mindshare it seems to be opposed to our policies and if and when we find such a thing
it has to be redirected co-opted destroyed reputationally or made ineffectual and the
phrase that I really appreciated that was used about Gene Sieberg who was you know one of Hollywood's
great leading ladies of the time was we have to cheapen her image yeah this is the federal
government talking about cheapening the image of a Hollywood star because she was interested in
radical black politics sorry no it kind of reminds me when you were saying if when we
look at biology it's disturbing when we look at history too and we realize that those people
that did the crusades were genetically identical to us and we think about the kind of civilized
way that we want to think of ourselves that we wouldn't do something like have a government
try and discredit someone but then we look at just how we have behaved as people throughout most
of history and it's been like it's been pretty draconian through most of it and I think we're
at a time where having it more hidden has been useful but that doesn't mean that it hasn't still
been happening well it's very interesting to me as we go from we have these two phases the first
phase is like you think people are still doing that you have an overactive imagination
then when it's discovered they say what you think that governments don't do this they've
always done this and I've always watched as people get their cognitive dissonance to zero
using two totally different mental strategies do you find this of course yeah all right Daniel
assuming that we are in some sense breaking out of this narrative that's been imposed
institutionally and you're starting to be able to hear new voices is there an opportunity in
some way to start hacking our way into a less rivalrous well let me try it again
I'll start from the beginning so a little bit of gas I also had a little bit of gas
all right Daniel so if we agree that there is something a little bit bizarre about the extent
to which there's been discipline in this gated institutional narrative and it's been hard to
get kind of a different message out to people that they need to start exploring new systems
of organization maybe beyond market democracy who knows what what are the most hopeful systems that
we currently have to use they can be used to build even better systems and how do we get that
message out where do you see the hope in trying to confront the real problems we face to find
an exit into our our next stage of human development
so we've been talking about where there is incentive for disinformation or information
suppression or narrative suppression the the last chunk of things you were sharing regarding
shame was kind of a narrative warfare tool so away I think of it and say there was a group that
seemed like it didn't have power of one kind then it tries to find power of some other kind so
reconfiguring in groups competing with whatever tools they can against outgroups but
imagine if we could create a situation where there was no incentive for disinformation
I'll talk about in a moment how I think we could do that and not just no incentive for disinformation
but also no incentive for information withholding and something pretty unique about humans is how
good we are at being able to add intention to signal
lie but all the subtle versions right which is most of the signal that is coming to me is just
bouncing off of stuff and reflecting and doesn't have that much disinformation in it and obviously
animals have camouflage and strategies like that but every time we're communicating we are usually
communicating towards some intention that we have and so I want you to think certain things where you
thinking those things I think will advantage me but then to the extent that you take what I'm saying
as adequately informing you like accurately informing you about reality I not be right like
there's a discrepancy between why I'm communicating to you and what would be maximum benefit to you
so and even if we're not doing spin and Russell conjugation disinformation even if it's just IP
and trade secrets and information withholding this lowers our coordination capacity to do
interesting things tremendously and then there's so much coordination cost that goes into the
competition so we say well let's imagine and we can I think we can say up to a tribal scale
people did could do I'm not saying they always did I don't want to be romantic people could do a better
job of accurate information sharing because there was less incentive to disinform each other inside
of the tribe because it would probably get found out and we actually depended on each other pretty
significantly but the Dunbar limit seems to be a pretty hard limit on that kind of information
so you mean this supposed Dunbar number that is the limit of our ancestral
mind or group to track the number of interactions we have so yeah maybe maybe I can keep track of 200
or 300 people yeah not much more yeah whether whether it's 150 or 50 or 200 or whatever it is
and you know I think we've attributed this to different things why tribes never got beyond
a certain scale within a certain kind of organization and if they would start to they would cleave
and then if they were going to get larger they had to have a different kind of organization
I think how one thing that we commonly think about is that kind of a limit of care and tracking
right up to that number up to 150 people or whatever I can actually know everybody pretty
well they can all know me and if I were to hurt anybody I'm hurting the people that I've known
for my whole life so something like universal interest of that group or almost like a commute
communalist idea makes sense if there's no anonymous people and there's no very far spaces
where I can externalize harm I basically can't externalize harm in the social commons when I
know everybody well I also probably can't lie and have that be advantageous I think there's
another thing which is there's a communication protocol that anyone who has information about
something within that setting can inform a choice where that information would be relevant that
the tribe would be making because they can actually communicate with everybody fairly easily
and if there's a really big choice to make everybody can sit around a tribal circle and
actually be able to say something about it and as you get larger you just can't do that
and I think there's a strong cleaving basis for not wanting to be part of a group that
would make decisions that I'll be subjected to that I don't get any say in unless it's really
important to do that like we're gonna have there's a situation where tribal warfare is
starting to occur more often and so having a larger group is really important or you know
some something like that in which case the bonding energy exceeds the cleaving energy
but let's say that we could actually have a situation where we had incentive to share
to not disinform and to share accurate information with each other and that could scale beyond a
Dunbar size I so now we have something where we don't have fractal disinformation inside of a company
we don't have people competing for cancer cures that aren't sharing information with each other
I think that system would outcompete all the systems that we've had in terms of innovation
and in terms of resource utilization resource per capita utilization so much that if we could
do such a thing it'd become the new attractive basin to which civilizations would want to flow
and I think the limit of Dunbar dynamics were communication protocols and I think we do have
technological capacity and I'm I mean both social technologies and physical technologies
to develop systems and and so like this is kind of at the heart of it to develop systems where
there was more incentive to share honest information and obviously this is a
example of anti-rival risk where I had my well-being and your well-being and the well-being
of the commons more tightly coupled to each other yeah that's the first part of it okay so
so try to figure out how to get very large scale human collectives to behave like small
scale human collectives well let's yeah if we think about two groups of people that sounds to
me like trip advisor where I travel to some country I'm I've never been to and I'm never
going back again and there's some sort of reputational cost that a hotel would have had
if it had gamed their guests so it becomes a bad idea to game your guests because you have a
fractional relationship with the world in some sense where somebody has left a review that says
but you know be careful they try to upsell you on the wi-fi and it's a scam and here's how to
look out for it and suddenly you have got a problem if you're a dishonest actor because
there is this sort of reputational game that is technologically enabled yeah so I think this is
why people like blockchain is the idea of an uncorruptible ledger is that disinformation
and information withholding or would be really benefit beneficial to the public and any kind of
bad acting does less well with good accounting systems I have to be able to kind of corrupt
the accounting in some way to be able to have it be advantageous and so can we make
can we make systems that make the accounting much better as part of it but it's not
the whole basis because then of course you still have incentive to figure out how to
game the game whatever it is as long as we still have separate interest and the separate interest
which is that any in-group can advantage itself at the expense of an out-group or any individual
can advantage itself at the expense of other individuals which is grounded all the way down to
like a private balance sheet I do think is an inexorable basis of rivalry and I do think that
rivalry in a world of exponential tech does self-terminate and given that I don't think we can stop
the progress of tech I do think we have to create fundamentally anti-rivalry systems and I don't
think you can do that with capitalism or that or private property ownership is the primary
basis to how we get access to things I don't think you can do it with communism or socialism or
