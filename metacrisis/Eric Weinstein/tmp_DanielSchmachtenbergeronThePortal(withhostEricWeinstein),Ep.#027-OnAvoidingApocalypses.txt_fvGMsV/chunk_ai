about the rapture story or the Mayan calendar or any of those stories in a metaphoric sense
as just like let's say you and I were in the Bronze Age and we had just seen a larger war than
had ever happened because there were some new better weapons and they could shoot further
distance and there were deserts where there didn't used to be deserts because we had got
new better axes and saws and had been able to cut down more trees and we just thought about and we
said we're we're still developing better weapons and we're developing better economic extraction
tools we're using our power in ways that are constructive in a narrow sense and destructive
in a larger sense but everybody is doing that this doesn't get to happen forever so this phase
defined by increasing power on all sides used in destructive ways constructive narrowly but
destructive broadly that phase comes to an end and there's something like a hard fork where
if we keep doing anything similar to that it'll come to an end cumulatively whether existential
or catastrophic more likely catastrophic right not full everything in but a lot and to be able
to have that much power and not use it in ways that destroy the system requires being actually
good stewards of power so then the whole question for me becomes how do we make a social system like
what is the the bodhisattva engineering how do we make a social system that is conditioning not
just individual humans but also collectives to do good choice making omnipositive kind of choice
making well i have to have a sense making system that can factor things like externalities ahead
of time better and that doesn't have things like multipolar traps where if anybody is doing the
fucked up thing that everybody has to do it and so i can start to think about what architectures
such a system would have to have to be able to do sense making as to what externalities would be
and be able to internalize them and where then i can actually confer resources to those right
choice making and that we're developing humans so again we think about the the education associated
with some religions bringing about less violence the education associated with some cultures bringing
about higher average cognitive capacity and being able to bring those together as much as i know
this sounds like hippie and silly i don't actually see anything other than a radical increase in
our good stewardship of power that makes it i love the idea that you think that there might be
something here but let me come back it with my and again i'm not trying to be negative i had an
experience at some point your answer requires a warp drive so we we both recognize the inexorability
of this thing and then are saying okay so what is the fundamental thing no every look i'm not
making fun of you because what you're saying is insane what i'm saying is insane and the people
who are saying the most common supposedly adult things are the craziest of us all so i at least
accept the idea that we have to be here and i want you on that branch and i want other people on
other branches because we need to fan out and start exploring at least start to care but i guess
what i what this makes me think of it was a particular moment in my life where uh one of my
closest friends um brought his father to dinner and his father was a guy who was um legendary
in the film industry and one of the things he taught his son was never let the other guy get
the first punch in and i thought wow first strike you teaching your child to strike first
nobody had ever suggested anything remotely like that in all of my upbringing i never heard
anything like this and i instantly recognized it for what it was somebody was going to parasitize
whatever i had been taught and say wow great eric's been taught self-restraint eric's been taught
to turn the other cheek to make sure that you de-escalate a conflict and goody goody
more for me your multipolar trap right okay there's a way out of it tell me i'm dying to hear it
okay so do we retrofit the system no impossible foundational axioms are all the wrong axioms
can we can we make a situation in which we can raise children quite differently yes go to see
kids who grew up in in amazonian tribe or you know some very different conditioning environment
you'll see very different types of human behavior can we change already set adults much harder not
impossible but harder um so can we could we find adults that are that would be the most likely to
be fast adopters of a new system like this and capable so both kind of at the cutting edge of
um their capacity to have abstract wide empathy and bind that to their action
and you know deeply considerate about actual cause and effect dynamics factor complexity
and work with other people well can we find the ones that are closest there and then train them
up additionally in some systems that are developed for how to do a different process of collaboration
that doesn't lead to one one way of talking about it is that when we go to command and
control hierarchy systems to get beyond the dunbar number we get diminishing returns on
collective intelligence as a as a function of the number of people which creates an incentive to
defect against that system even internal defection and so then we get a problem if we could get
collective intelligence scaling linearly we get something radically different so we get
just the number of people that are needed to be able to do something like that
train to do that and we build a civilization a full stack ground up civilization because
obviously i'm talking about not private balance sheets and private property as the dominant system
i'm also going to talk about not democracy because the nature of voting is inherently
polarizing to populations because we make propositions where both voting for it and voting
against it suck for somebody for something because they're based on theory of trade-offs where we
didn't even try to figure out what a good proposition for everybody would be in the first place so
better systems of sense making and choice making which we could get to and so let's say you have a
full stack civilization of people who are capable and oriented to implement it and you have not only
much higher quality of life for the people who are there but innovative capacity to solve certain
problems the world can't currently solve well because of no disinformation in the system and
better coordination well then that system can export solutions that other places in the world
that would normally have an enmity relationship with it actually need that they can't solve for
themselves so it can create a dependence relationship rather than an enmity relationship
and then they're like well why the fuck are you figuring out these pieces of tech and we aren't
we're like well we figured out a better social system and if you want it you're welcome to use
it we were open sourcing the technology here's how here's how it works but given that the technology
as a social technology is a social technology of how people share information and share resources
and coordinate differently it can't be weaponized because it is kind of the
solvent to weaponization itself and so any other group using it is just now that kind of social
architecture starting to spore or to scale and so yeah I think you get out of the multi-polar
trap by you don't have to win at the game of power against some external force to avoid losing at the
game of power so far if people didn't focus on militarizing they lost to whoever militarized
um and if they didn't lose to whoever militarizes because they militarized which means their culture
became a culture that supports the ideas of militarization right but if I focus on being able
to have whoever would militarize against me be able to offer them things that are particularly
valuable that are novel to a collective intelligence that can do better innovation yeah
you get out of a multi-polar trap that way I want to try
aggregating all the little bits uh that I'm getting from you and seeing whether I'm coming
anywhere close okay all right so the way I'm seeing it Daniel is the following first of all
you're going to point out to me that there are all sorts of interesting things that have not
been really effectively scaled up so your point about Buddhism and Jains and what have you it
might be possible to use this enormous and luxurious developmental period for something
radically different and that something you haven't said but I'll throw into the mix and see whether
you reject it is that man's capacity for self that is somatic eradication through fanaticism
tells you how powerful the software can be that you can teach people to die for a cause let's say
and which is obviously against genetic imperatives no it's obviously against individual genetic
imperative but the genetics doesn't work at the level of the individual it's obviously against
the somatic the assumed somatic imperatives it could actually benefit inclusive fitness I think
there's a very good reason to imagine that you actually benefit your clan if your deed is known
so I don't I don't want to get into that but fanaticism exists and maybe fungible I think the
Tamils for example probably showed us uh that fanaticism can be used at a political level
as long as you get access to children in Sri Lanka yeah okay so access to children was a key thing
I think so yeah right so the idea is that you in effect and I don't mean to put words in your
mouth one of the lessons of human history is that the develop developmental process if not used
for the traditional Darwinian imperative is available for other uses and it is
of arbitrary power yeah now I'm going to get into the ethics of it but first I just want to get
into feasibility so first of all there's an enormous you know I'm going to keep going back
to square zero if I don't get this all right first thing is you're pointing out we're not on the
efficient frontier we're screwing up everywhere we could be doing a lot better appreciate that
next point is there are a ton of different things that we haven't really looked at pushing
and we could afford to push on all of these things principle among those things is we should be using
development for something radically different and studying cultures which have an intrinsically
sort of non-rival risk ethos to them to see what have we already been able to do and then we can
engineer on top of that atoms are different than bits atoms have a some somewhat finite field to
them bits feels effectively infinite so to the extent that we can move things from atoms to bits
and not be coupled to a market system where you have this problem of that abundance creates
public goods and services which causes markets to fail but then something else succeeds in
its stead that we can start to have abundance particularly where we decouple and learn more
about recycling so that finite resources are much better appreciated for what they are
that we can get to a point where we can start to take pleasure in each other's pleasure
particularly if somebody is producing something that is extremely positive for that society I
want to see Jackie Chan given more money to make Jackie Chan films so I'm not angry about that
so now we're scaling up all of these things the things that haven't been noticed hacks this that
the other thing I like it maybe it'll buy us some time here are the things that really disturb me
about it one you don't have to grimace I mean I want to I'm not grimacing I'm smiling okay
one is the the what is the minimal level of violence and coercion needed to bring about
some of these changes so this was something that I brought up in my discussion with Peter Teal
and his in my sort of somewhat mutual framework really I learned something from him but I
tried to put my own thing back into it is take take a beautiful dream ask what the minimal
level of violence and coercion needed to accomplish it add that in as part of the cost and ask
yourself is it still beautiful so that's one of the questions that I would ask you
and then I get to the issue of certain things like lakefront property in the atomic world anyway
are valuable and unique and it becomes problematic to imagine a world in which all of our previous
experience was about competing for these things to imagine 100 percent
adherence to this new way of thinking well let's go pro-topian not utopian let's go that
there are some say which mean by pro-topian moving in the right direction all right
let's say that there are some things that are harder to make adequately abundant than other
things but there's a lot of low-hanging fruit that we can start moving and as we do it we'll get
there's good reason to think that there is a basis to do that in more areas
so in a system where when something is more scarce it is worth more then if I'm on the supply
side of that I have an incentive to manufacture artificial scarcity and to definitely prevent
abundance that would debase the value of the thing that I have in a world where we remove
the association of value and scarcity then where there are actual scarcities the goal is to engineer
the scarcity out of the system and so if we're talking about limited amount of oceanfront
then this is where we say well can we do seasteading and create a lot of oceanfront that is really
awesome where there is actually more desires just like more people are shopping at the store
then we need more shopping carts and so part of the answer is how do we actually increase the
abundance but not an exponential abundance because we're talking about also steady state
population and using and a lot of shared resources and it's that coupled with
psychologically healthier more mature people that relate to these things differently both of those
are necessary neither would be sufficient on their own well I like that a lot and I I do quite
honestly take some hope in that I'm finding that what people are now rivalrous about has changed
a lot I think over the course of my life I think millennials are much more interested in what
what experiences have you had recently rather than what have you bought and purchased recently
uh in part because the economy kind of turned against them but travel got cheap
right and so that that's been interesting to see do you believe that we have a huge
nearly universal level up in maturity and wisdom available to us through development hacking
yeah and so it is both how we develop that socially which I don't think will happen uniformly
I think will happen in pockets that become strange attractors that other groups want to then implement
once seen because they're so clearly better at both quality of life and innovation
um and how long that takes to develop widely is a while like this is a multi-generation thing
okay um I think that that would not be sufficient on its own but it's necessary
better sense making systems where we can actually solve problems without causing worse
problems which we're not historically good at is also necessary and this is both some
evolution in our epistemics and our actual processes of collective sense making and
collective coordination um
so yes I see level ups in both of those possible now I'm going to ask a very difficult question
but we have to get to it yeah in essence I've got a riff which I don't think I've said publicly
which is that the the biggest problem with discussing sexuality is is that sex is sexy
and if you have something that's central to the world that is almost impossible to talk about
yeah um it's a very strange state of affairs assume that we solve all of these problems that
don't have to do with status sex and reproduction according to your most optimistic scenario
but we have trouble over here that there's one last little pesky problem yeah does this situation
work yes now I will speak to it because as you said it is central and am I wrong about that it is
central of course okay but my speaking to it is probably going to change the comment section
of this video but so be it you know what if they don't want to come along for the ride they
I I think that the most important thing is to just try to do this I don't mean to say this
to be horrible but let's try to take some of the stupid fun at discussing sexuality by talking
about it for what it is and a central system that um has to be discussed because it is the engine
of human behavior so your brother and I had this conversation um when we met and obviously with
his background in evolutionary biology and primate mating and whatever um I was very interested in
his perspective and it took a little while but for what it's worth and let me just jump in one
second Brett were he here yeah would break the theory of selection into two pieces that would be the
stuff that follows natural selection the way we expected from Darwin and then you would break
it into a second piece which is the stuff that goes completely counterintuitive due to sexual
selection right and that division is actually part of the standard evolutionary toolkit he
does it a little bit better and a little bit differently right but that that division into
natural and sexual selection is part of the the territory and it really matters for when we think
about resource scarcity because the resources that people need to deal with the first part the
survival part are not that much right actually but the resources that people need to deal with the
mating part is more than the other guy historically which is why the guy with the 150 foot yacht
might feel bad when the 200 foot yacht pulls up well this is and let's say this is as close
you're not an evolutionary theorist I'm not but we can do our best there is a version of evolutionary
theory which states that there needs to be crisis there needs to be a function for showing that
you are better in order to keep individuals max you know sort of on that razor's edge
of performance and that mating opportunities means that there's always a crisis there's never
enough abundance because somebody with 13 homes is more desirable than somebody with
nine homes if you're just trying to figure out if there were a crisis right who would do better
right so we have to overcome that because that drives a Malthusian situation of no amount of
resource ever brings sufficiency about right and drives a fundamental rivalry which is why you
said we have to address it um so what I'm my take on this as I explored it my process with myself
has been asking okay as soon as I saw that the dynamics of this world that seemed intuitive
