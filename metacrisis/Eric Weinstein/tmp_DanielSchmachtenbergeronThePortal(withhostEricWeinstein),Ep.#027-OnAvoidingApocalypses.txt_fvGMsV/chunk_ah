and which means not a linear materials economy so i'm starting to i'm starting to guess where
you're going to go so if i if i understand you correctly the idea is that you're going to look
at all of the places we've been a little bit sloppy like recycling wasn't a place that we
put too much attention and increasingly as we understand that stuff is limited we
we have more of a reason to be careful about our land use rare rare resources i think i get that
part of it then you have another idea here about development is kind of unused and we could do
something far greater and then you just had another one that's slipping my brain
population oh that we would start to see a fertility below replacement rates so that you
would actually go into population decline as a means of taking pressure off of the system yeah
so i see the possibility for a steady state population that is within the carrying capacity
of a closed-loop materials economy but that is fueled by renewable energy so you basically have
a finite amount of atoms so you circle the atoms you don't have a finite amount of energy
because you're getting more energy every day but you have a finite amount per day and so you have
to be able to cycle the atoms within the energy bandwidth and you're cycling it from one bit
pattern into another bit pattern right like from one form into another form and the forms are stored
as bits so you have atoms energy and bits and you don't really have a limited number of the bits
that you can have and so we can have a economy where it's getting continuously better but not
by getting bigger but by getting better we continuously make more and more interesting
things with the same fundamental stuff look we've always had the possibility of decoupling
economic growth from let's say burning uh fossil fuels we just haven't gotten around
doing very well okay what i'm starting to hear is that you believe potentially that maybe we
should embrace declining populations as a means of either i don't want to put words in your mouth
but i'm just trying to guess ahead one possibility is is that we need to amplify the people who can
live peaceably and that maybe the idea is that people who can't live peaceably need to be incentivized
to maybe have fabulous somatic lives but without reproducing i don't know so that we can drive
certain traits towards zero um maybe the idea is we just need to take ambient pressure off
the system and so we need to go into a world where eight billion becomes six billion becomes one
billion and we start dropping down again um i think we see that obviously birth rate is higher
where there's poverty and we might lose some kids right and so as we just get out of abject poverty
birth rates go down and then as total economic quality of life and the choice possibilities for
women and education and other things go up we start getting to uh much lower birth rates and
no i'm not concerned that the birth rate will just collapse forever will come to some steady state
birth rates but that those are happening as a function of increased good things increased
quality of life so in other words if you make the opportunity cost for child bearing enormous
by making sure that let's say females have outrageously great career prospects and
it starts to become much more fulfilling and she doesn't want to spend her whole life pregnant
well look i mean there's different issues with um women not realizing that most of their children
will survive which is happening in the demographic transition uh so people miscalculated for a period
of time leading to fears about runaway population booms so that's that's one effect and then there's
another one about if you give people education um if you give if you educate women the opportunity
costs of staying home and raising children starts to impress itself and so people will have fewer
children yeah but i think where you're where you're headed is super interesting and part maybe it's
one of the reasons that people might find it rather disturbing making life awesome for females
might mean having far fewer children yeah all right so that's a a good thing in schmockton burgers
well yeah this is so both i mean the malthusian trap right the malthusian situation is both
the geometric production reproduction of humans and the arithmetic reproduction of resources
and i think neither of those are true inexorably true i think we can keep cycling the resources
and so basically we can have a steady state human population within a renewable materials economy
carrying capacity but where we're keep but we keep innovating on bit so we keep making more and
more positive and interesting things so we keep getting an increase in quality of life but not
by increasing the quality the quantity of the pie and the quantity of people consuming it
but the quality of it well in the world of adams i can't have bill gates home in washington state
but in the world of bits maybe i can live there uh in my virtual reality and even have much more
fantastic places and so i agree that bits have some ability to create wild abundance that goes
non rivalrous but i've brought up a very different concern which you may be familiar with which is
abundance can kill you if you have if you look out these windows and you see all of these people
engaged in activities without being told to do so by a central authority what is it that ties
that together for the most parts markets with some amount of state control of violence in the
form of policing okay so now you create abundance abundance has this weird effect that it turns
private goods and services into public goods and services where price and value are no longer equal
and suddenly you have people who are producing things that are very valuable and can't get paid
right and so how do we handle the takeover uh in in this hypothetical world where we get to
an economy of abundance that doesn't actually cause a collapse of civilization you can you
can die from abundance no a market can die from abundance but i'm not proposing a market society
i okay so i like that so the idea is that we welcome the destruction of the markets yeah
to be replaced by and it's important to say obviously if i have a situation where
where valuation is at least largely proportional to scarcity then i have a basis to continue to
manufacture artificial scarcity and if something becomes abundant enough it loses value then of
course abundance and markets don't go together i'm very excited about any credible thing that is
better than markets because markets well laden with problems have been pretty amazing in what
they've produced yeah i'm not going to criticize the evolutionary path here to say we can argue
straightforwardly why this path can't continue why the nature of it self-terminates i agree but
the big problem here has always been that we have so little experience with um self-terminating our
rival risk desires well so this is why i bring the buddhists up all right and i think the buddhist
got past one part of the dunbar number if we think about you think of a couple of buddhist
countries for our listeners at home that they can keep in mind while you're talking about buddhism
mostly they don't have countries anymore there are buddhists in a lot of southeast asian countries
so there are buddhists in india there are buddhists there's a lot of buddhists in napal
um obviously to bet was buddhist before to bet stopped existing in that form um
but and you know i could bring up janes or others but there are so few of them
that it's a little bit easier to throw it out as an outlier but basically cultures that were
widely peaceful but it is important to say the widely peaceful ones did largely get either killed
by warring cultures or somehow taken over by them or they became warring at a certain point
and this is why your escape hypothesis which your escape hypothesis only works if we can
make a much better civilization but it needs to not have proximity to the thing to external
sources of rivalry so that it can develop and i want to say you know that one of the reasons
i keep pushing you on these things is not because i'm trying to do a gotcha style interview the
concern let me just be open about it is that there are so few people who are thinking who are
attempting to think rigorously about what we actually are and what we must become if we are
to have a long-term future that i'm not i believe that you are somebody who is trying not to flinch
when it comes to a description of how we got to this place from the arms race that is red of
tooth and claw called called nature and yet your point is maybe we can hack ourselves into a situation
with a future where with exponential tech as you call it we don't have a future and here is the basis
for rigorous idealism and hope and so that's what i'm trying to tease out no great great yeah i don't
think that we are inexorably rivalrous
can we take this weirdly into the the realm in which it is hardest to imagine that we are not
rivalrous which is sex as the precursor to reproduction the floor is yours sir you okay
this is going to make the conversation weird no no um look i think that where you're heading
let me rephrase this every branch of the decision tree has gotten hyper weird and anybody who's
not looking at the fact that there is no non-weird branch of the decision tree is missing the story
of who we are and what time it is in human history so i think to not explore the weird to not dream
about what might be is the least responsible least adult thing we can do if we don't dream
and we don't explore the weird we're doomed yeah all right with that the floor is yours
okay i wanted to go somewhere with buddhism and why not an inexorably rivalrous and that then if
they were to actually get the other side of the dunbar number which is not just getting
care beyond the dunbar number which they could do through abstract empathy but also
the ability to calculate and coordinate which they couldn't because they didn't have the
tech to do it and i'm basically going to say we can get something like
abs oh well okay i'll do the sex thing and the buddhism thing together because they actually
go together i think we get something like a certain level of empathy up to the dunbar number just
through mirror on type effects through the fact that i know these people they know me we've lived
together if they're hurting i am gonna see it because they aren't somewhere far away got it
and similarly i'm less likely to pollute in an area i'm in than through an industrial supply chain
that pollutes somewhere that i'm not so just the proximity where the cause and effect has a feedback
loop as we start to get to much larger scales where i haven't a cause and there's an effect but i
don't get a feedback loop on it the broken open feedback loop is a problem so i think the buddhists
were able to train abstract empathy not just empathy for the people who i see hurting but
empathy for all sentient beings throughout time and space right feeling their connectedness with
them that's the nature of the vows of the bodhisattva and they're not the only one right this is
different religions have tried to do this but it's an example of a group succeeding at it
where they were able to have a sense of positive coupling of my well-being and the well-being of
another rather than inverse coupling they get ahead and it's decreasing my ability to get ahead
what they the other side of the dunbar number was not just who we care about but also our ability
to coordinate and i don't think they were able to figure out coordination mechanisms that are
adequately effective at scale okay i think if we do both of those things we can make a
fundamentally different kind of civilization and rivalry mostly comes down to today private
balance sheets which is i can get ahead economically and the money equals optionality for most of the
things that i want all right and i can get ahead economically independent of you getting ahead and
even at the expense of you getting ahead or the expense of the commons right and so my near term
incentive can oftentimes be a long-term disadvantage to others or the whole so now this basis of
where my well-being and the well-being of others or the commons the delta between those
is the basis for rivalry but then dealing with that rivalry keeps increasing coordination costs
keeps you know creating disinformation systems where we can't coordinate effectively
um so how we deal with the balance sheet part there's a few things
right now for me to have access to stuff i have to mostly with a few exceptions possess the stuff
right so possession and access are coupled and if i possess something i don't have to be using it
i'm just reserving the optionality to use it the drill that sits in my garage that i might not
have used in a couple years but at least it's convenient that when i wanted it's there right
but me possessing something means that i have access to it means you don't have access to it
and so with a finite amount of stuff the more stuff you possess the less stuff i have access to
rival risk basis but we all know library type examples or shopping carts where if i have enough
shopping carts at the grocery store for peak demand time i don't have to bring my own shopping cart
which would be a pain in the ass and would require 10 000 shopping carts per grocery store rather than
300 um everybody bringing them so what matters is you having access to the shopping cart doesn't
decrease my access and we start to see a potential for this if we think about something like an uber
and then we think about self-driving uber that then has a blockchain that disintermediates it
being a central company and being a commonwealth resource where those where you having access to
it doesn't decrease my access so we're not rival risk anymore but then we take the next step and say
if you having access to transportation then also allows you to go to the maker's studio that you
have access to to the science studio to the educational places to the art studios where you
then have more access to be creative but the things that you create you aren't creating for you to
get more money and get ahead because you already have access to all the things that you want and
you don't differentiate yourself by getting stuff you differentiate yourself by the things
that you offer because you already have access to stuff so there's a fundamentally different
motive structure then you having access to more resources creates a richer commons that I have
access to so now we go from rival risk not just to non-rival risk which is uncoupled
but anti-rival risk meaning you getting ahead necessarily equals me getting ahead
and so when we look at getting out of the Malthusian type dynamics part of it is
that we can actually get out of the population dynamics part of it is that we can actually
get a closed-loop materials economy with renewable energy that can continue to upcycle
and part of it is that we can utilize our resources much more effectively and much less
rivalrously where we start decoupling access from possession that'll start easily in some areas be
harder in other areas but we start in the areas that it happens and so we start getting more and
more of a situation where I want you to have access to more things because as you're more
creative then I get access to more things that are the results of your creativity
so where so this is an example of removing some of the basis of rivalry associated with
balance sheets okay I can go to sex underneath that now if you want me to you should go where
is most natural to take the conversation okay I will just try to follow
and the problem is if you go to sex directly from where you are you are describing the value let's
say of prostitution which is that people do not have to make a commitment to asexual partner
many people can have the same sexual partner you start to get into all of these very funny areas
where status for example is a very weird commodity do I want you to have more status
because somehow that will give me more status do I stop caring about status if there is exactly one
parcel of land which has a unequivocally the best view is that something that I want you to have
rather than me having it yeah so
let's talk about status for a moment
if I'm comparing you and me in terms of who has more dollars or who's taller or who can run faster
or some I can compare us on the same metric right now and if status is number of followers on Twitter
then whatever Kim Kardashian's most interesting human being that's ever lived and so I think we
know that reductionist metrics on status are also gamified and inappropriate but if we say like
MC Escher or Dolly like what was more brilliant art I think it's a meaningless question
because they both offered something completely novel to the world and something meaningful
and beautiful that the neither of the other ones offered or could offer and I can't compare them
because I can't metricize them and the reduction of that's the thing is I can't reduce totally
unique things to a fungible metric so one of the problems I think is actually fungibility and metric
reduction and so if you have status associated with unique things that you offer to the world
awesome I'm not competing with you writ large for more status I'm going to people are going to have
a relationship to me for the things that I offer and those are really the people that I want to
have a relationship with me and if you're offering things to the world that people have a relationship
to you for and I see that the world is getting better as a result of what you're offering and
I have access to more a better world as a result of it I'm totally stoked on that
this is where it starts to feel not real to me and no yeah okay but let's but let's go through
this so here's why it sounds not real all right I think so do we have a slowing and technological
progress yes and you know less so in some areas than in other areas but do we still have exponentially
growing technology in terms of both cumulative amount associated with number of people in
globalization and in terms of just technologies that are still continuing to grow yes of course
we do so is it 50 years or 100 years we don't know but I really like I have to think of this
in a kind of a mythopoetic frame that's how it occurs to me is that as we as technology is empowering
our choices and we are getting something like the power of gods you have to have something like the
love and the wisdom of gods to wield that are you self-destruct and so when I think about I think
