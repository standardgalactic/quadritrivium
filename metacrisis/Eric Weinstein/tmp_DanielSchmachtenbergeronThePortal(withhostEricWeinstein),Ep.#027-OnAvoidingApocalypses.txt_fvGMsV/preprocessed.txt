Hello, this is Eric with a few thoughts for our housekeeping section this week.
As this is our second episode to be released during a bizarre and near-global patchwork
of local quarantines, I wanted to update you on my evolving thinking and understanding
surrounding our shared pandemic.
But perhaps more importantly, I want to begin putting this response to the virus in the
context of what we've already talked about on the portal.
In particular, the disc, or distributed idea suppression complex introduced in episode
18, appears to be in full swing.
So how do we know that this is happening?
Well, Twitter, and this is just as an example, has now refined their terms of service to
broaden their definition of harm itself to address in their words, and I quote,
"...content that goes directly against guidance from authoritative sources of global and local
public health information.
Rather than reports, we will enforce this in close coordination with trusted partners,
including public health authorities and governments, and continue to use and consult
with information from those sources when reviewing content.
Under this new guidance, we will require people to remove tweets."
Now, of course, in a pandemic, that sounds sensible, at least to my ears.
In such a situation, who wants marginal GAD flies like Mike Cernovich or the infamous
Menchus Mulbug, aka Curtis Jarvan, contradicting the mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio,
or the Washington Post, in a time crying out for coordinated and authoritative response?
Well, here's the awkward part.
Many of the people who called this epidemic early and correctly were the very marginal
internet personalities that the legacy media folks loved to deride as trolls, grifters,
and GAD flies.
As for the mayor of New York City, well, after Cernovich and Mulbug had correctly called
for drastic action, Bill de Blasio wrote, "...I'm encouraging New Yorkers to go on with
your lives and get out on the town despite coronavirus," and that was in early March,
a sentiment that was echoed by the Washington Post that viewed concern over the virus as
a kind of neurosis that had to be addressed psychologically.
In short, the gated institutional narrative, or GIN, was not close to being the first to
see COVID as the giant threat requiring a planetary response.
It was those outside the GIN that not only saw this early, but proved that it was seeable
early by many different individuals who generally seemed to sit outside the institutional and
respectable worlds.
So just why was this?
Well, first of all, the portal has argued many times before that we have had an almost
universally unworkable leadership class now in place for just under 50 years and that
it arose to disguise the end of the post-war economic growth regime.
This is a collection of people who have refactored the institutions that they've led within
our system specifically to evade the embedded growth obligations or egos that were set in
the previous era and who rewarded each other generally for doing exactly the wrong things
in terms of the public good.
With an end to mandatory retirements, the same people have been promoted for borrowing
against the future and playing games of Russian roulette with financial markets and healthcare,
while self-dealing within the system that they were handed as stewards for the generations
to come.
Using a false god of fake economic efficiency that reliably and deliberately fails to adequately
incorporate actual economics like negative externalities, von Neumann-Morgenster and
sub-utility functions, principal-agent problems, moral hazard, etc., etc., our ubiquitous economists
have hidden behind the mask of technocrats working for the public good while merely pretending
to practice their own profession.
Healthcare mandarins too regularly ignore the warnings coming out of their own literature.
I mean, heading over to Google Scholar, which readiness czar or hospital head could forget
titles like Mechanical Ventilation in an Airborne Epidemic by Fua in 2008, or Preparing Intensive
Care for the Next Pandemic Influenza by Taylor Kane and Robert Fowler in 2019, or those back-to-back
hits of Meltzer at all, stockpiling ventilators for influenza pandemics, and estimates of
the demand for mechanical ventilation in the United States during an influenza pandemic
in 2017 and 2015 respectively.
In short, we got here not because we couldn't foresee this future.
In fact, we extensively studied it.
We got here because we decided to ignore the future that we knew was coming.
The specific class of people that we had at the helm of our institutions were constitutionally
incapable of putting their foot down and asserting that we needed deeper reserves in
order to handle what they called surge capacity.
So do I know what's going on?
What I said during this section of our last episode still holds true this week.
My continuing discussions with a number of people I respect deeply seem surprisingly
inconclusive to me even at this late date.
So my mind wanders to the second-order question of why it would be so difficult to sketch
a straightforward narrative to guide us.
In fact, Dr. Peter Attia's most recent video evidences some of this confusion, where he
shares that as a physician, he feels so spun around by what he is hearing that even he
is forced to think in political rather than medical or scientific terms to explain the
situation.
To oversimplify slightly, there are three great risks with the COVID virus.
One of underreaction, one of overreaction, and one of inappropriate reaction.
The first threatens an enormous body count from the virus with severe respiratory and
other damage to many of the recovered.
The second threatens a worldwide depression which could well lead to armed clashes and
even wars of various sizes.
The last leads to many of our efforts being wasted or even captured by profiteers at a
time when we are demanded not to deeply question the coordinating authorities.
And oddly, we are being prepared to participate in both under and overreactions simultaneously
just as many of us are worrying about allocations of financial assistance that are now valued
in the trillions.
I mean, this is crazy at some level, no?
We are somehow discussing ill-conceived multi-trillion dollar assistance packages at the same time
as we are being ready to go back to work while also hearing that New York is now apocalyptic.
I mean, that's pretty confusing.
We are going to transfer vast amounts of wealth, so please note that everything will
be fine when you get back to work shortly.
But in the meantime, the borough of Queens is experiencing Armageddon.
Even by high school dating standards, that's a lot of mixed and conflicting messages.
Now what could explain this odd state of affairs?
I found myself compelled by a very simple idea from whose grip I cannot easily escape.
The idea is straightforward.
What if our leadership is treating this as much as an accountability crisis as a medical
one when it comes to their actions?
I mean, what if the issue over which we are being quarantined isn't actually the number
of deaths they are trying to prevent, but the type of deaths?
Perhaps there is one special category of death then that our leaders are more afraid of than
all others for reasons of accountability rather than simple loss of life.
In order to explore this idea, it might help to make it somewhat concrete.
Therefore, imagine that you had drafted a blank tweet on Twitter called New York Blue
Check Death List for at least minorly well-known accounts that you follow from New York State
that are eventually brought low by the COVID virus and that it initially has no other content.
Of course, it would start out blank, but now imagine that every time one of these account
owners dies of COVID, you plan to add them to your soon-to-be-growing list.
That's pretty morbid, but hey, it's now a pandemic after all.
Oddly, these aren't even really the deaths that I'm talking about quite yet.
Perhaps the first few are old people who have lived long and full lives, but as your list
begins to fill up, there may come a first gruesome death that happened to a vital younger person
who desperately needed a ventilator or an ICU bed or a trained MD or nurse to have a
fighting chance.
Let us call these triage deaths if they result from a missing resource that could have and
should have been stocked for just such emergencies.
These losses are beginning to outline the class of deaths that I believe may now be
driving this difficult-to-understand response from our political and medical leadership.
While deaths from the virus may be tragic, these specific triage deaths may be considered
career-ending deaths of accountability for medical, scientific, business, and political
leaders who specifically failed to heed warnings from the group studying our preparedness.
As such, they may have mattered most in determining the shape of our current response as they
are all deaths that come from failing to implement copious previous work in identifying our vulnerabilities
meant to shape our disaster preparedness.
These would be quite bad because they would involve people that we feel we know, but it
could actually get much worse for our leaders than that.
If you were now to swap out the blue check requirement and exchange it instead for the
most sympathetic person you could imagine, what happens when death swoops down on a young
girl of eight named Aruna who needs a ventilator desperately but can't get one?
Or perhaps the entire Gomez family is turned away from a queen's ER or made to wait for
ICU beds that never materialize while there is still time to save three out of their four
members?
What if it is these triage deaths which are actually closer to negligent homicide than
mere viral losses that are actually terrifying our leaders into draconian action rather
than the total number of dead as they say?
This hypothesis has the advantage of at least being consistent with the otherwise confusing
and seemingly conflicting themes developed before.
Burdens from our leaders who were caught having utterly failed in their mission to keep us
prepared would have to be shifted onto our entire society as a whole.
The public would be asked for broad participation in something like flatten the curve.
And why?
To cover for the lack of the same ICU beds, masks, PPE, and ventilators that were called
for in numerous academic papers over the last 20 years studying just such viral pandemic
scenarios.
As the authorities now scramble at top speed to finally get the missing resources in place
that should have been banked all along, they would also simultaneously be preparing us
to go back to work to risk regular viral rather than triage deaths just as soon as the shortfalls
could be made up as there doesn't seem to be a highly credible plan to defeat the virus.
To see the implications of this triage death avoidance hypothesis, conduct a thought experiment.
Imagine that all of the rate limiting resources for efficient ICU treatment were suddenly
parachuted out on pallets from helicopters all over the world.
The question is, would we continue to shelter in place given that we have no cure or vaccine?
Or would we be told to toughen up and go back to work?
Now I don't know the answer, but I believe the question is not devoid of interest.
Think about it.
I will as well.
This episode introduces a relatively unknown guest to our portal audience.
Many of you are familiar with the concept of true fame versus other kinds of fame.
For example, there's Big in Europe or Internet Famous.
Well, in a certain West Coast subculture, there is a concept of California Famous and
such names would include Laura Deming, Michael Vassar, Aliezer Yudkowski, Alex Green currently
in federal prison, Jordan Greenhall, Julia Galef, Tristan Harris, Daniel Barquet, Tom
Chee, Grant Sanderson, Rick Doblin, Brett Victor, and many others.
My guest on this episode is my friend Daniel Schmockdenberger, an important node in the
system.
Now, the odd thing about Daniel is that wherever he or I found ourselves riffing with others
on topics existential, someone would often tell us about the other and that we needed
to become friends as well, and I think that was probably a pretty good call on their part.
I have sat on this episode for months, however, because I was hoping that I would have a second
chance to record with Daniel, given that he was on very little sleep from the night before
this discussion was recorded.
However, we now find ourselves in a viral outbreak, and Daniel is one of the few people
I deal with trying to make progress on how humans can have a permanent future on the
small and dangerous planet, particularly amidst the fatal temptations of nuclear and biological
warfare, which I have termed the twin nuclei problem elsewhere.
Now, the coronavirus may or may not turn out to be related to laboratory strains, but the
problems it poses and foreshadows are directly within or adjacent to Daniel's area of focus.
Daniel, in particular, favors the wisdom and design branch of the human fate decision
tree, a branch that I think probably deserves the second most attention after my personal
favorite, which is the need for new physics with the possibility of escape to the distant
cosmos.
That is, Daniel is searching for something like the wisdom needed to re-engineer a non-rival
risk or anti-rival risk society to live in harmony with its newfound godlike powers.
Sometimes the search for a so-called escape through wisdom goes under the name of Game
B.
Now, the idea behind Game B is something like the following.
Natural and sexual selection must be assumed to have engineered us for a cycle of competition
and misery, which we might term Game A, played red of tooth and claw under the law of the
jungle.
Game B is, by contrast, a mythical second state where the agents originally built within Game
A teach themselves to do something far less brutal, rivalrous, unsustainable and wasteful,
but without themselves getting outcompeted by those who wish to remain in Game A.
As such, Game B falls clearly within the confines of the so-called human potential movement.
While I have taken an interest in this counterculture, I am not myself a part of it, as I fear that
it does not fully make sense to me that Game B is really a possibility.
Nevertheless, the quest for a less rivalrous world is probably a noble one and one of which
I am at least partially personally supportive.
In any event, I thought that this is the episode that is probably most in keeping with the
semi-apocalyptic mood that many of us find ourselves within during these days of quarantine.
I don't know if it will be everyone's cup of tea, but I think Daniel has many interesting
perspectives and it is a pleasure to introduce him to our portal community.
So please sit back and relax as we bring you an uninterrupted discussion with Daniel Schmockenberger.
Hello, you've found the portal. I'm your host, Eric Weinstein, and today we'll be sitting down
with a name that will not be familiar to many of you.
My friend, Daniel Schmockenberger. Daniel, welcome to the portal.
Thanks for having me, Eric.
So, Daniel, I have to admit that the way in which I came to know you was a little bit odd.
I would start to talk about various ideas and people would simply say to me,
that's really interesting. Have you ever talked to Daniel Schmockenberger?
So far as I knew, you weren't affiliated with any famous institution. You did not have a large
outreach into the public, and yet somehow my network was very attuned to your thinking.
Do you have any sense of what it was that caused your name among all names to come up
frequently in context that we share?
Well, I think we do happen to have some good friends in common and people who have similar
interests in terms of how to do better thinking, how to make civilization better, make society better,
concerns about civilization risk, and probably mostly have friends that appreciate
heterodox thinking, but clear heterodox thinking. And yeah, my goal was never a lot of broadcasts.
My goal was to communicate with people that I also thought were earnestly endeavoring to think
well and see if we could think better about things and maybe make progress on things together.
Well, I suppose that the way I view it is that there are very few people at the moment
who are really trying to integrate any kind of rigorous thinking across many different
disciplines to solve what I would think would be society-wide problems and opportunities
for everybody. And I find that very surprising because we keep being told what a prosperous
society we are, and you would think that in a prosperous society there would be lots of people
experimenting with radically new ideas about societal organization at any given time,
given that so much is on the line whenever we talk about climate or multipolar geopolitical
conflict. It seems very strange that there are so few people who are interested in what I would
think are really existential questions for humans. Do you find, first of all, that
you think that our world and our society is thinking properly about where it is at this
point in human history? No, I obviously don't think that we're thinking very well about it.
Most any of the schools, not the kind of environmental reactionary, not the left,
not the right, not the techno-capitalist, singularitarian optimists, I think there is
some signal and a good bit of noise and also not just epistemic bias but epistemic and adequacy
coming from whatever domain specialty looking at something that's so much more complex than any
domain specialty by itself is going to do a good job of. I think you speak well to why there are
not more different ideas trying to figure things out is you end up getting some kind of dominant
system that is this auto-poetic, self-perpetuating. You want to say what you mean by auto-poetic?
Self-perpetuating, self-authoring. When we say system, it's like what system are we talking
about the academic system? Are we talking about the monetary system? Are we talking about our
government system? Are we talking about culture? Are we talking about media and information
communication? Yes, it's the intersection of all those into a kind of civilizational system
and that I think can be best thought of if we want to think of it in simple terms as
the system that confers power to things. Of course, everything that supports that system
gets more power within the system and everything that would possibly threaten the core
relevancy or validity of the system threatens people who are doing well in the system and so it
gets kind of spit out by the system and so I think that's a very strong normative force.
All right, so let me give a little bit of my frame. We can try to pass things back and forth
and feel free to take over if you like but here's what I see that I think of as being really
interesting and rather mysterious. I see a decision tree in which I think at a society-wide
level I can't accept any of the major branches. One branch would be that we have a self-extinguishing
human event, let's say an all-out nuclear war where people miscalculate and the planet is
unrecognizable. Then there's a different branch that says that there's some sort of an environmental
collapse, maybe with a nuclear exchange or some sort of synthetic biology. Who knows what
where there are survivors but it's not the world that we see out our window here.
Then there's another one which says maybe we managed to trundle on for another
thousand years somehow limping along without any major new ideas. We're still using markets,
things are getting incrementally better, maybe there are some big breakthroughs here and there
but there's no big breakthrough in human wisdom so that we have the same dangerous objects but
we continue to be lucky that nobody weaponizes these things and that there's no broad collapse.
Then there's an escape branch where we end up on Mars or maybe we escape even farther out
in the universe or maybe we get uploaded into silicon. There's no part of this tree that looks
sensible to me. Every single branch is somewhere in sci-fi. Are you seeing something that looks
like that or do you have some branches that you think are more probable and more hopeful?
More hopeful yes, probable no but I can't do a probability calculation because they're unprecedented
so I don't have priors. You have to impute. The first two that you said existential risk
and catastrophic risk. There's certainly lots of different ways for both of those to occur that
are getting increasingly likely as time goes on as I model it and I think we should get into that.
The idea that it continues relatively similar to how it is for a thousand years, I don't see
possible at all and I can say why I think this civilization system is actually self-terminating
in a much shorter time than that inexorably like there is no way that it could continue for very long.
The escape models I'm fairly dubious of not because we couldn't with near-term tech get some people
into space but we certainly couldn't get something that doesn't depend on earth that if we fucked
things up here it's doing well within the time frames that I think will fuck things up on earth.
At least the trajectory as I see it. Then the question you ask is there some other thing like
progress to a totally different type of social system here or totally different type of civilization
system that can continue for a long time that isn't self-terminating and that isn't generating
catastrophic and existential risks as the byproduct of the architecture of the system itself is
really the only path. What I spend most of my time working on is what the architectures of a
system like that must be and what the transition would look like.
So I'm quite happy with that description and that also sort of sets up what
at least our initial superficial division is that is that of the branches of the decision tree that
I can't accept the most hopeful branch to me is that we learn our source code and use it to do
something that has never been done that something that has never been done before which is potentially
travel outside the solar system or potentially through some as yet unknown physical possibility.
You have an idea about hacking social systems with so far our biology the way it is in our
structure the way it is in our governance but somehow delivering us to a new structure.
I don't know whether that's going to be through human enhancement through a cultural change
through re-incentivizing the world. So am I right that those those those I think that your
branch of the decision tree is very interesting. I just I'm very pessimistic about it and I think
you should be pessimistic about mine. Well when you say hacking the source code you mean the source
code of physics so we can get something like a warp drive and I'm down right like I'll totally
work with you on a galactic cruiser if we can do that. Well I'm not saying warp drive but okay
is a placeholder. As a placeholder. I think the thing that I'm talking about also requires
something like understanding source code at a different level. Sure. Not source code of physics
but source code of things related to psychology and evolution and the nature of tool making and
the nature of collective sense making and choice making type dynamics. Okay. And but to start to
go into what it would look like we have to do I would have to to have it make any sense describe
what I think the problems are why the current system is self-terminating and why all the systems
that we have ever had have been self-terminating because God actually defined the problem properly
to be able to say because that gives me necessary insufficient criteria for what an adequate solution
would have to address. Well you're teeing up my next question which is
um take us through your reasoning as to why we can't luck out
over several hundred years and simply kind of bumble on as before. Okay a couple different ways
of looking at this that all converge. If we look at the kind of club of Rome limits of growth
type model I think that this is more fundamental than we're used to thinking about. So you and Peter
were talking the other day about the need for ongoing. Let's just say Peter Thiel for those
who haven't seen the inaugural episode of the show. Talking about the need for ongoing economic
growth so that we can stay in positive some dynamics because if we don't have economic growth
and people keep wanting more stuff then it goes zero sum and that creates conflict.
So just to to make sure that we're I'm understanding your terminology positive
some dynamics means that whatever the mythical pie of it keeps getting bigger. Yes okay.
And I think that obviously we can go positive some and still have it all be captured by a few
right like not actually have anything like appropriate to distribution and we know that wealth
has a power law distribution and there's some very fundamental things about why it's always
going to have a power law distribution if it has social architectures like we currently have.
I'm comfortable with this but by power law distribution we mean that the winners are so
much bigger as winners than let's say a normal probability normal bell shaped curve would tell
us. The curve looks like this you have a few people who have almost everything and most people
have quite little and that as you know if we look at like the increase in wealth that has happened
since the internet it has not been pretty evenly distributed over most of the people.
It's been you know increasing wealth and so is there a name for the pie that's growing but
we're almost every bit in slice except for a few people's shrinking. Well I mean we could call it
global GDP is one very simplified metric and we could say okay so we want global GDP to increase
because that represents total goods and services that represent some way of thinking about value.
It's a really bad way of thinking about value and I think we should discuss that. Okay.
If obviously up until the industrial revolution there were about a half a billion people on the
planet at most. Okay. And then we go as soon as the industrial revolution and our ability to
extract resources at faster than their reproduction amounts from the biosphere we go from
half a billion people over whatever 300,000 years of homo sapien history to eight billion people
in almost no time at all. And so that's like there's a real issue there that is we are subsidizing
our growth with savings accounts that are finite and there's a bunch of different ways of thinking
about that but if we look at biodiversity loss or species extinction or growing dead zones in the
ocean or any of these issues not just climate change we can see that we have a linear materials
economy that takes resources from the earth unrenowably and produces a bunch of pollution,
waste, heat whatever in the process of manufacturing transportation and then turns them into trash on
the side and so we get both accumulation dynamics and depletion dynamics and you can't keep running
accumulation and depletion dynamics on a finite biosphere indefinitely.
Okay. Now of course you see the immediate next argument which is make a closed loop economy.
Well that you needed to burn fossil fuels for a period of time in order to become wealthy enough
to figure out how to do something clean, green and sustainable. Right and so the idea is that
these are really just intermediate phases and it looks pretty dirty and grubby now but in fact
good news human ingenuity is boundless and so we'll just think our way out of whatever
new problems we've created. So we can all easily say we can't keep running a linear materials
economy with exponential growth on the planet that's pretty straightforward and that we're
actually very near limits of our capacity to keep doing that on a bunch of different atomic cycles.
So then we say okay well we have to go closed loop where the new stuff that we make comes
from the old stuff, the old stuff turns into new stuff and that we're able to do that closed
loop cycling of matter using renewable energy and so this is one necessary dynamic but this
already doesn't look like the model that you're mentioning of society hobbling along mostly
the same because that's actually really really different. That would already be a significant
change not maybe a significant as a warp drive but it would be a fundamentally different type
of civilization and so I would say that that movement to a closed loop materials economy
is necessary but nowhere close to sufficient. One thing that's going to come is if I want to
run anything like capitalism just from a materials economy basis where I'm going to
have to keep growing the capital supply year over year just to keep up with interest right?
There's an exponential expansion of the monetary basis that is required for capitalism to exist
so then to not debase the currency we have to keep growing the goods and services and I can't
actually in a closed loop materials economy that is near the carrying capacity I can't keep
growing the goods and services indefinitely so then of course the argument is well we can do
it almost all digitally and there's a bit of a complex argument but I would say there are some
coupling coefficients between how much virtual value we have that keeps being value that doesn't go
into diminishing returns relative to how much physical value that there's some coupling coefficients
between atoms energy and bits that make up the materials economy and then also time human attention
so I don't think that we can keep running a exponential capital expansion but I'll make a
a simpler argument capitalism and nationalism but feudalism is also an example our rival risk
game theoretic structures some in group competing against some out group and we can play coordination
games where we'll coordinate with each other if it's more advantageous but we reserve the right
to defect and go zero sum on each other if that's more advantageous and we have been employing
more and more powerful technology to play rival risk games that means more and more potent warfare
more and more potent extraction environmental extraction and more and more potent information
tech that can do narrative and information warfare narrative control something I would say is that
rival risk game dynamics necessarily are causing some harm in the system either I'm harming you
directly you're harming me or we're externalizing harm to a commons and information or an ecological
commons you can't keep externalizing harm exponentially and so rival risk game dynamics
multiplied by exponential tech end up self terminating we can't do exponential warfare
exponential extraction or exponential disinformation we've already gotten so far with exponential
disinformation that we almost can't make sense of anything because you have a system that incents
disinformation okay well this is the first place that I start to hear an argument that has a hope
of dealing with the congenital institutional optimism sure there are naysayers but I say
that America's greatest days are in front of her have we not always found solutions to our problems
and you know you cue the the brass band and everybody feels enlivened and I always found
these arguments kind of bizarre not that things haven't worked out I think things have worked out
to be honest quite a bit better than I would have ever predicted if you'd put me down in 1945 and
said what's gonna happen over the next 50 years let's be honest we've been pretty lucky and it's
been pretty pretty terrific on balance that said I also can't figure out a way in which we just
become more powerful in our ability to extract our ability to confuse our ability to meet out harm
from the strong to the weak so my guess is that even if I guessed wrong again and we could get
another 50 years out of it sooner or later either something like what you're talking about a change
in the basic structure of rival risk interaction maybe we should talk a little bit about what
what that means but I think people probably intuit it or you know just requires an increasing
amount of luck as we get farther away from the events that may have caused the last 50 years I
think that people who had direct experience of the depression in world war two and maybe world
war one they weren't fooled into thinking that this was an easy game and that life was simple
they had had enough primary experience with really catastrophic events that they knew that
they were playing with the full stack okay there's a there's a bunch of directions that I'm
interested in going so one is world war two was the first time that we actually had existential
level technology as a species in our recorded history that's a big deal because we couldn't
have actually blown ourselves up before then and in evolutionary time or even civilization time
that's just like a few minutes right like this is not very long that we've had that I agree and
if you read like if you read Ellsberg's doomsday machine it is kind of lucky that we haven't
blown ourselves up because there were a lot of just mistakes that should have blown us up right
but it's really hard to build nukes right it really takes nation state level capacity and
mostly only a few nation states so they could do it yeah and this is the point is that if you only
have a few actors that have nukes everybody can monitor each other and have something like mutually
assured destruction to force an equilibrium but this is the thing about exponential tech is we
don't just get exponentially more powerful tech we get exponentially more distribution on powerful
tech Daniel I want to keep going with this but I'm going to keep slowing you down when you use
a term that may not be familiar to a sufficient number of our listeners what do you mean by exponential
tech so tech that helps us make better tech so we get a return curve on the technology so
we see this kind of exponential very famously Moore's law in computing we see this kind of
exponential rate of growth of computing power because like nuclear bombs don't actually give us
better insight into how to make nuclear bombs directly but computers give us better insight
into how to make better computers and so there are different areas of exponential tech where the
technology itself increases our capacity to make more of the technology or some underlying dynamic
where we get some exponential increases in our capacity so we can see for varying reasons exponential
increases in compute power exponential increases in certain types of biotech like specifically
things associated with like CRISPR genetic engineering gene drives nanotech and those
things all you get exponentials also because there we're dealing with things that could self-replicate
right and so a nuclear bomb is a big deal but it doesn't self-replicate but a synthetic biology
device can self-replicate or a genetically engineered thing can and so we can have exponential
growth of the effect of something and so if we if we take a look at the growth in
biotechnology capacity and we specifically look at breakthroughs like CRISPR tech
and the capacity for things like gene drives to be able to modify foundational biology well
that makes it to where by a warfare capacity like very high level by a warfare capacity
becomes much much much simpler so things that nation states used to be able to do
non-nation states are gaining the capacity to be able to do even drone tech like we had the
the first everybody who's thought about it has been like when are we going to have a really big
problem with drones and a couple years ago it was the first time in the Ukraine where a commercial
drone with a homemade thermite bomb dropped it on a munitions factory and because it hit a munitions
factory and detonated the whole thing you get a billion dollars of damage from just I mean there
can be one person doing a very simple thing in their garage without any kind of really traceable
exotic materials but we can do we can we can do much worse things than that with exponentially
increasing technological power so the main thing when I say exponential tech is just
we are getting an exponential increase in how powerful the choices we make can be
and that's a good way to think about technology as a lever on our choice making right so no
technology at all I can make different choices if I want to be violent I can hit somebody
stone tool allows me to extend my hitting capacity and hit much harder right a gun
takes that much further and an intercontinental ballistic missile takes that much further which
it's a similar type of choice to make which is solve this problem through violence extended by
a much much bigger lever and what I would say is if you look at the kind of people we have ever
been like look at the Romans look at the Sumerians look at the mines look at any kind of people
we've been and look at the distribution of ways we've made choices take any of those people and
give them exponentially more power factoring how they've used their power and they self terminate
like they don't use they're not good stewards of power and well I agree that we're not good
stewards of power I think that there is a mystery here that if we don't make eye contact with it
it's going to dog the conversation we've got a lot of missing stinger missiles I believe from the
Afghan theater during the time that we were arming the Mujahideen I don't know how many but I think
I heard that it was in the hundreds yet we didn't see a ton of use maybe you know TWA flight 800
had something to do with it maybe not we don't know it's a mysterious situation there are plenty
of reservoirs to poison people always talk about that we haven't seen that behavior it seems to me
that these terrible shootings that we experience I'm always astounded that the numbers are as low
as they are and you could make an argument that said that in general people who are not in a position
to benefit who are engaged in some sort of self terminating activity people who are planning
to go out with a with a a bang if you will are not very successful usually in doing huge amounts
of damage now that may change so like we know that from the Murrah federal building that fertilizer
is a pretty potent bomb ingredient and yet we didn't see a huge string of copycats after that
is there something in us that it is sort of capable in an act of desperation and depression
of killing tens of people that struggles to kill thousands or millions
you understand what the question I there is a mystery yeah yeah I think there's some positive
things we have going for us which is there generally tends to be an inverse correlation between
people who are really good at tech and people who want to blow things up like typically those
that people who want to blow things up mostly
don't figure out how to make really good bio weapons right and the people who are really
engaged in how to make more powerful breakthroughs in science and tech are usually engaged in some
creative enterprise where they're not oriented to blow things up that's actually like really
important I think that's going well for us I think that depends upon certain social things
staying in place that we can't guarantee are going to stay in place
a relatively viable society for the people who have the technological capacities
this is something that fascinates me we seem to be very willing to destroy the lives of very
capable people these days yeah and I always wonder like are we going to be surprised when
somebody whose life we've ruined over nothing comes back at us and saying wow you really you
wrote me off and you destroyed my reputation my ability to earn a living I can't have a security
clearance I can't do what it is that I enjoy doing and now I'm on the outs I am terrified for example
then you know the famously the James DeMore situation where you start going after very
bright sort of spectromy people and you tell them that they're horrible and you ruin them publicly
that's a very bad recipe I think it is a bad recipe and and of course James DeMore is not a
particular risk but there are a lot of people who are very capable yeah who took one look at that
situation said oh so now no longer can I be can I count on getting things largely right maybe I get
some stuff wrong around the edges but no longer can I count on making interesting points and having
a job when I get up the next morning well like when you're mentioning shootings if I can just go buy
an AR-15 even if I don't know how to make one right then I can kill a lot more people than I
can with a knife right and so the that's an increase in technological capacity that can empower
someone who is psychologically damaged somehow to be able to do things they couldn't do without it
and I think as more powerful technology requires less scientific insight to be able to
modify then you're certainly going to see more of those types of dynamics increase
I think one of the other things is that when we think about the Cold War we really had two
nuclear superpowers that could be locked in mutually assured destruction because with just
two forces you kind of have an easy Nash equilibrium but as soon as you have a lot of forces and it's
more multipolar it's a much much harder thing this is the thing that terrifies me which is that
I would much rather have two very skilled hyper lethal powers
in some kind of weird community game-theoretic communication with each other than lots of
less skilled players with much less power but significant ability to do damage right
which we have now and we have increasingly so right so we went from one country with nukes at
the end of World War II to then two quickly in Cold War type dynamics to you know whatever nine
on record if you don't count where all the missing uranium from the USSR that is in whatever places
that it's in that and that we're not just talking about nukes we're talking about lots of other
things so I think I think the gist is that rivalrous type dynamics whether we're talking about
a rivalry that's a kinetic warfare like this right like a physical warfare right or an economic
warfare or an information warfare end up resulting in progressively more harm as we have more power
because the gist is if we're in some kind of warfare of whatever kind then I need to figure out some
asymmetric capacity to be able to beat you but the moment I deploy that asymmetric capacity it gets
reverse engineered by all sides and upratcheted so we get this exponential upratcheting of the
game of power itself yeah if it doesn't end the game right and and that's what we see is we see
an exponential increase in destructive capacity without a fundamental change in the basis of
how we use it so let's just look at information tech for a moment and I think this is really key
to the how we change civilization part if information about reality is a source of competitive
advantage like from I know where the water is and so but we don't think there's enough for everybody
so not only do we want to withhold that information from the other tribe we want to misinform them
as to where it is so they don't accidentally find it right you see in every competitive game
whether it's a poker bluff or a football game where you fake one way and go the other way
a incentive to disinform right and as we start having exponential information tech so we can
intentionally disinform specific audiences in ways that are much more believable to them so
you talk about russia conjugation russia conjugation is do you want to I don't know that we've talked
about it too much on this program you do a great job with it I since you're going to take it somewhere
when do you say a little bit of what it is I can disinform without even lying yeah right I can
formally lie but I can also just make someone more likely to interpret something in a particular
way by couching a question or couching an idea in a way that's likely to bring a reaction so you
gave I think a great example of if I talk about illegal aliens the problem of illegal aliens versus
um the need for amnesty for migrant workers undocumented undocumented workers then just the
nature of the wording choice on the exact same reality evokes very different kinds of sensibilities
and people so they'll vote differently they'll poll differently so it's pretty easy to influence
what people think and how they feel through of course lying but also through not just lying
but sharing partial data so the preponderance of data gives them a sense of things it is other than
it really is and through things like russia conjugation where we're really just kind of hijacking
their limbic system a very fun very funny one is the use of the democrat party where you emphasize
the word rat rather than saying the democratic party and so it's great fun for republicans to say
yes the democrat con you know it's like whoa that doesn't sound good um and yet it's a defensible
position what are you talking about it's just the way I say it right um okay so plausible
deniability on engaging in a kind of narrative warfare right and it's supposed to be that we're
both on team usa right working together to make the best country possible maybe in rivalry with
other countries but hopefully even in some kind of economic trade prosperous relationship right
but we're obviously not both on team usa we're actually engaged in really dreadful zero sum
dynamics with each other while intentionally confusing and misinforming the public and
increasing animosity even towards the point of civil conflict for some game theoretic win for our
team and we see that that's not just true with republican and democrat but even like multiple
intelligence agencies it should be sharing intelligence perfectly with each other but
they're actually competing for who gets a larger percentage of the black budget so they'll withhold
information and maybe even engage in internal espionage all the way it's just like corporate
politics where people aren't really making a choice in a big corporation of what's best for the
corporation as a whole they're making choices that are best for them and their boss their fealty
relationships in and then engaging in corporate politics it might actually be hurting the company
so long as they can have plausible deniability to get away with it so whenever we have perverse
incentives we're going to have some situation by which we're being incentivized by a system of
selective pressures to do certain things that may not be in the stated interests or the you know
whatever the directive is of our of our institution so the directive is to do the business of the
country but in fact you're loyal to the team that you're on because that's what brought you to this
place and it were you to lose your team inside of this internal game you couldn't really function
yeah and it's actually not even the fault of some bad people it's a fault of a system where it's like
i say okay well if i don't do that then i lose the game to the other guys that are doing that and i
actually think i'm more qualified to get that promotion than he is so this is the compromise i
have to make which is which is this is the thing we think of as politics right my brother is called
this i think he did a beautiful job describing this um he called this the personal responsibility
vortex where if you start behaving if you listen to people to say well you know even if you're
incentivized to do the wrong thing you should still do the right thing yeah brett's point was
if that becomes self-extinguishing then you'll simply be replaced by something less ethical than you
are right so it's actually incumbent upon you not to be so virtuous that you remove yourself from the
game leaving open a niche for some less scrupulous person to swoop in so this is how an unethical
system convinces ethical people to compromise their ethics to become a tool for the system
well he's so this is this this big division that's coming up which is that what we call
democracy and capitalism and the enlightenment and all of these things that we've been able
to do up until this point some people in our mutual world that might be vaguely affiliated with the
human potential movement that's the closest giant umbrella rubric that i can put over it
some percentage of those people refer to this world that we have now as game a and then there's
this hypothetical game b which might not be rivalrous and hopefully isn't self-extinguishing
and it might not be entirely market-based or maybe the markets take into better account
of things like uh resource questions and negative externalities uh are you
are you hopeful about game b is that a good way of phrasing it is there a better way of talking
about this yes and to be able to define what game b what criteria it must have
understanding the thing that is self-extinguishing in game a like let's take a couple of the examples
you just gave and go a little further because they're they were right along the lines
connected to where we were you talk about internalizing externalities right so if i
if i am figuring out how to externalize some cost of the thing that i'm doing to the commons and
so for example you're polluting as part of a furniture plant that employs lots of people
and makes something people need right so there's a real cost right it there's a cost to a whole
ecosystem into the people into the future generations it will be affected by the pollution
but i don't pay the cost and because i'm not paying the cost i get to have the profit margins
that i have if i had to pay the cost which mean i had to employ a technology that currently
exists to clean all that up and whatever that costs my business might be radically not profitable
right now so so then maybe we'll try and create a law to make it to where i can't do that pollution
but i'm not doing the pollution as a person i have some corporation that has some liability limiting
functions of any of the people within the corporation so the corporation
is breaking the law and you can't put a corporation in jail so there's a fine
but if the fine is less expensive than processing the waste would be then it's just a cost of doing
business and then the corporation will employ lobbyists to go change the law because
laws are going to be created by lobbyists that are paid for by somebody and they're going to
be created by politicians who have a campaign budget that is controlled by somebody so basically
economics has perverse incentives we try to create law to bind it but economics is deeper
in the stack of power than law is so you end up getting this legal system that is supposed to bind
the perverse economic incentive that mostly ends up legislating in in the benefit of it
so but this is a fundamental problem with the liberal democracy idea
well when things get really visual things can actually change if you start being able to point to
oh i don't know let's say uh children with malformed limbs that happened with phalidomide
the visual on that was enough to push that up the the attention stack to say hey we we got a
serious problem here and we've got to talk about this right now because the the externality of this
pharmaceutical is is horrific do you have anything better than waiting for absolutely horrendous
things with the with visuals that that hit oh yeah so you know it's funny right like
we see ads from the 50s where better living through chemistry and people are spraying
dbt on the kids to keep the mosquitoes off and then we recognize how lethal the dbt is so then
we sell it to mexico that doesn't have the law and then we buy the produce back from mexico
but then we come up with some new chemical that we say is less toxic just because the
long-term studies on its toxicity haven't come out yet and um mostly they don't look as visible
as thalidomide this is the thing we sometimes i say this as um we keep searching for our own
blind spot so that we can do business there right and so what it is that we can't measure
very often becomes a place to do business because almost everything produces negative
externalities and so it has to be disguised now this is a concept i wanted to bring up in terms
of what you were saying about your brother and so there's this idea of a multipolar trap which is
some scenario where some agent in the system whether the agent is a person or a nation or
a tribe or a corporation does something that is really bad for the whole over the long term
but it's actually really advantageous to them over the near term and if they do that they will get so
far ahead of and use that power against everybody else that now everybody else has to race to do
that thing and you get a race to the cliff so an arms race is a classic example right we really
don't want a world with AI weapons it's a much less good world with AI weapons but we would have
to ensure that nobody makes it we'd have to make an agreement where if anyone doesn't join the
agreement and says no we're going to make the AI weapon then everybody has to not only make them
but also make the countermeasures and race to make them faster and even if we make the agreement
we're pretty sure the other guy is secretly defecting on the agreement in the basement
so we make the agreement while secretly defecting on it in the basement while spying on them and
trying to confuse their spies and it's like how the fuck do we get out of that and the same is
true of the tragedy of the commons if I figure out how to externalize some of my cost and so my
margins go up all of my competitors have to figure out how to externalize some cost or we have to
try and figure out how to make some law to bind it but it's very hard to make laws to bind these
things and so the same is true with ethical issues right if I am perfectly ethical I'm going to lose
in politics because I won't be able to get anybody to support me whatever so I make certain kinds
of compromises and so one thing I would look at is if we want to look at catastrophic risk or at
large we can look at multipolar traps drive as a general game theoretic phenomena driving lots of
different ways that catastrophic risk can happen so one thing game B has to do is solve multipolar
traps so in other words look at the universal class of such things rather than begin then
getting bewitched by any particular instance correct but we have to solve for the class of
multipolar traps are at large because it's not just we don't want an arms race on AI weapons we
also don't want an arms race on bio weapons or nanotech weapons I think it's well phrased does
it buy us anything does it buy us anything no sorry I want to be clear not buy us B I A S but
buy B U Y us does it buy us anything in the sense of does that avoid catastrophic risk by itself
or can we actually do it formulating deciding to work over the class yeah of really dangerous
to use your language multipolar traps does that actually point us to some game
theoretic thing that all all of our friends who did the game theory of the Cold War might have missed
I'm not aware of any major game theoretic advance in what you're calling multipolar traps
it's not a major game theoretic advance what we're saying is that
we have that phenomena creates a lot of different race to the bottom type scenarios
but with exponentially more power the race to the bottoms are much deeper bottoms so in the
past we've had boom and bust cycles associated with those right and so everybody starts doing
the pollution thing until you get a bust that's associated which creates some new market advantage
to clean the pollution up at a certain point because people are willing to pay for that and so
you'll get these kind of boom and bust cycles that's kind of the best that a market can give you
with regard to multipolar traps but the level of bust that we get with exponential technologies
and this many people basically is unviable and so we've never figured out how to solve for that
class and I'm saying that that's one of the things you're asking is there a game b that I
believe in it would have to solve for a number of things it would have to actually remove rival
risk dynamics which is which would solve for multipolar traps because multipolar traps are a
situation where the well-being of each agent can be optimized independently of and even at the
expense of the other agents in the comments as long as that's the case we have an incentive to do
fucked up stuff with increasing power that is one way of thinking about an underlying generator
of all the catastrophic risks we face. Well let's assume that I buy in because quite honestly this
has been always been my problem with game b is that I look at the game theory and I look at our
history in terms of what has brought us to this point and I would say that if you believe any
version of the theory of natural and sexual selection you'd have to say that we are the
product of an arms race and the idea that we would be wise enough to stop the arms race
when I can hear in my mind's ear all these people saying wow chicken little's at it again
everything's great you know Stephen Pinker tells us that we were in a much more peaceful world
uh we won the cold war what are you guys going on about I mean things are a little bit screwy
in politics and suddenly it's all gloom and doom I I just I hear that voice and then I hear this
other voice which is this optimism about maybe we could become wise maybe we could become the people
wise enough to have synthetic biology and nuclear weapons and instant communication and
data warfare and all these things and survive and thrive and I don't see how help me out where's
the hope here I I think that you and I probably don't need to talk about this much but that
what I would call a naive techno optimism is bananas cherry picking data is easy from a big
data set well and the great negative externality is potential violence as long as you don't see
potential violence as having increased um now I you know I I then you don't see the problem
one argument you could make is that sub lethal technology
has increased our ability to shoot beanbags at protesters means that you don't actually have
to kill protesters you know that there there are some weird arguments but what you you never lost
the ability to kill them you just may have not outfitted riot police with lethal technology
in their first in the first wave of things that you send against an unruly crowd and
the most awesome thing like about the current system is we don't even have to deal with protesters
with tear gas or beanbags or whatever mostly because mostly um addiction and student debt
and information overwhelm and those things deal with the people adequately um so they
they don't actually understand enough or care enough or have the capacity to organize very
meaningfully we just legalize weed and make porn free and everyone's demotivated those are a
couple examples okay um I think we need to talk about you make it sound like a good thing
like maybe maybe it's keeping this no we're going critical no no no um I'm saying that
every dominant system has an intrinsic propensity to figure out how to stay being
the dominant system which means that it has a intrinsic propensity to get better at being able
to deal with dissent and um we can look at different kinds of conflict theory you and
peter we're talking about gerardian conflict we can look at this as kind of a marxist class
type conflict but I think it's it's deeper than that the system that is self-perpetuating is inanimate
the system which is self-perpetuating is not itself animate or sentient but it is auto poetic
but it is auto poetic and this is the fascinating thing to get is it's like
let's take let's take nick bostrom's paperclip maximizer as an analogy so I know you know this
but for the people who don't um when looking at concerning ai risk scenarios one of them is this
you know kind of funny idea of a paperclip maximizer paperclip is representative of any
widget so make an ai that basically can do two things it can optimize the production of something
here a paperclip and so it can use its intelligence to do that so it can make more efficient supply
chains whatever and it can use its intelligence to increase its own intelligence so you'll get
a exponential curve on intelligence which also then means an exponential curve on its capacity
to optimize whatever narrow metric it's optimizing and so of course after it just makes increases
in efficiency which are awesome then it starts making so many paperclips that it needs new
substrate to make paperclips out of and it eventually turns the whole world into paperclips
because it can it can grow its intelligence to out compete whoever's competing for those paperclips
faster than they can that's a very short version of it you're gonna say something well just
I guess what I find very bizarre about all of this is that I live in multiple social worlds
and intellectual worlds and in some of my worlds this stuff strikes people as loopy
oh here comes the stuff about the agi the robots are going to kill us all and in some other portion
of my world it's like well clearly we're on the verge of agi and that's going to be the existential
risk and this is in part to go back to your original point something that you and I share
a failure a catastrophic failure of communal sense making right so what I've claimed is
is that the revolution that we're in is is based around the idea that we don't have what I've called
semi-reliable communal sense making we can't all agree now even if it's slightly wrong or maybe even
deeply wrong as to what it is that we're seeing where we are in human history what our issues are
and so the first part of this decision tree that goes really wrong is that a lot of people think
that we're in great shape okay so this is I I'm actually going to come back to the
paperclip maximizer because it explains why we don't have communal sense making
if instead of thinking about an artificial intelligence that can increase its capacity
while optimizing something we think of a collective intelligence that can some way that humans are
processing information together in a group a market is a kind of collective intelligence
right the whole idea of what the invisible hand of the market the the market will figure out what
stuff people really want it's expressed as demand and then which version of the various supplies is
best I wouldn't say it's an intelligence it's not a central intelligence but the idea is that
there is kind of an emergent intelligence there is an emergent property of this thing
and you know it computes things like prices and allocations and if that's what you mean by
intelligence then I that's what I mean yeah so it's it is a bottom-up coordination system that
does end up having new information emerge as the result of the bottom-up coordination okay
and I can take a market as a as kind of at the center I can take capitalism at the center of
the more general class of what I would call rival risk dynamics as a whole as a kind of
collective intelligence okay because the thing that wins at the game of rivalry gets selected
for and so there is this kind of learning of how to get better at rival risk games
learning across the system as a whole which which things win in war which things keep more people
believing the thing which keep people from a tritting out of the thing like that that makes
sense yes and so I would say that we have if we just take the capitalism part capitalism is a
paperclip maximizer that is converting the natural world and human resources into capital
while getting better at doing so so it goes from barter to currency to fiat currency to fractional
reserve process to complex financial instruments to high-speed trading on those those are like
the increase in its capacity to do that but specifically now it is a incentive for all
the humans to do certain things so if leaving the whale alive in the ocean confers no economic
advantage on me but killing it and selling it as meat is a million dollars of economic
advantage and if I don't kill it the whale still won't be alive because somebody else
is going to kill it anyways and then they might actually even use that economic power against
me now I've got I have an incentive system that is encouraging all the humans to behave in certain
kinds of ways and now not only do we need to kill the whales we need to race at getting better to
do it and making better militaries and extracting all the resources and so I see this as a kind of
so if I'm understanding where you're headed what you're saying is is that the market is kind of a
precursor to an AGI it is a collective intelligence that is
eventually self-terminating in the same way that a cancer is right the cancer cells are
self-replicating and they're growing faster than normal cells but they end up killing the host which
kills themselves and so the the reason I'm bringing this up in terms of collective sense-making
is those who do the will of capitalism like those who do the will of the paperclip maximizer
mo-locks or on whatever kind of analogy we want to use here those who do well at the game of power
get more power and then they use that legislative power media power capital power to make systems
that to modify the systems in ways that help them more right those who oppose the system of power
also oppose those who are doing well at it so even though the system is inanimate the people
who are doing well at it are animate so then they take those people out which is we see how
Martin Luther King and Gandhi and Jesus and etc died people who actually oppose to the system of
power right and so you end up having a system that is selecting for or is conferring more power to
those who are good at getting more power which ends up meaning who are selecting for conferring
power to sociopathy yeah I don't find this part of the argument well maybe I'm just stuck somewhere
let me be I mean I think I'm on your side so I want to help make a different part of this case
I think a lot of this comes down to magical thinking because of the non-use of nuclear weapons
against humans since 1945 I think that one thing if 9-11 had been a nuclear attack rather than a
weird conventional attack we would know where we were in human history and by virtue of our luck
and our luck alone we are completely confused as to how perilous the present moment is because
our luck has been amazing and if you believe surprising yeah if you believe that somehow
it can't be luck because it's this good then you believe that there's some unknown principle
keeping us safe and you don't know what the name of that principle is maybe it's human ingenuity
maybe it's some sort of secret collective that keeps the world sensible maybe it's that markets
have tied us all together I don't know what your story is yeah but whatever your story is it's wrong
and it's it's obviously wrong right the the idea that we didn't have anything like 9-11 and then
we had a sudden 9-11 kind of attack is itself paradigmatic that these things with which you
have no data familiarity I mean look there was no suicide bombing in the modern world before the
1980s and I think this is the point is that it's generally more advantageous within a market to
believe that markets are good and the world is healthy and things are awesome right I'll usually
do better in academia if I say academia is good right which is a point that you make if I really
criticize it heavily I'm gonna get less 10 years Peter's point more than my point okay yeah I will
usually do better in markets if I say they're awesome and do better in a corporation if I say
it's awesome and so there is kind of an incentive for optimism about the dominant system if I want
to do well in the dominant system and if I have critiques of the dominant system I'm usually
gonna do less well in it which means less power will get conferred to those ideas and so there's
kind of a memetic selection right like the memes that that do well end up being the memes that
propagate but do well within a current system well that look this is why I've called for
a return to above-ground nuclear testing because my belief is is that we you laugh but I'm not
kidding right I mean if we don't get our amygdala is really engaged with where we are this magical
thinking which by the way I suffer from this magical thing I'm not it's not something I'm
claiming everyone else has I have the idea that nothing too bad can can come that you know I always
ask this this weird question which is how many foreign nuclear devices are currently on US soil
people always think about that nukes will have to come through an ICBM I'm not at all convinced
that that would have to be true people just don't think about these things because we've been in such
a rare period of time that these things haven't like everybody who's talked in these terms
sort of to me like there's a part of me that sounds like okay well that's the kind of a
conversation you have on on a dorm floor during a bull session like grown-ups realize that something
is keeping the world together which is funny right because it's basically saying
grown-ups have bought into magical thinking exactly yeah and so and by the way a lot of the people
that I think of as being the smartest most interesting people have not bought into this magical
thinking right what has happened is is that those people have been pushed out of the institutions
that form this sort of weird conversation that I refer to as the gated institutional narrative
in the depopulation of dissenters like really serious dissenters from inside the institutional
complex is one of the defining features of our age to me but something that you can't get any
commentary on because the commentary you're really looking for is is that conversation so
what I just try to do is to show people that no matter what you do the gated institutional
narrative cannot look at certain very basic facts right so you get a very dangerous kind of group
think there and even if someone disagrees with it they have a lot more incentive to not publicly
disagree with it within that group thing what's the hell with those people I mean this is why we're
doing the portal podcast which is um let's be honest this is pirate radio yeah and I don't know why
it hasn't been shut down at the moment the best thing that the gated institutional conversation
has going for it is that all of these interesting people are simply humans and you can destroy
any human reputation and so the cheapest thing to do is not to kill anybody right but just as
somebody starts to accumulate mindshare the gated institutional narrative goes into into hyperdrive
and it just starts pumping out um fear uncertainty and doubt which is the you know fud is the major
tool for destroying an individual's ability to communicate reality yeah something I think about
is the people who went through what happened in Syria recently or say collapse in Libya or
wherever where you had an actual pretty developed nation that didn't also expect that it was going
to go through war and collapse and then it did I bet that if we talked to those people they would
have a very different intuition for the state of the fragility here because they actually have
first person experience it's something that seemed really stable and like it wasn't going to collapse
actually did and most of us haven't actually been through anything like a collapse in our life and
we don't have a good intuition for things that are only in history books and so this is a place
where our intuition by itself like our intuition is informed by our experience but our experience is
very short right and if we study past civilizations one of the things we know and you know we can read
tainter and the collapse of complex societies or you know other kind of good insights on how
civilizational collapse works but none of the previous civilizations are still here like that's
that's one of the important things to get is that they go through a lifecycle and that they mostly
collapse for self-induced reasons and that even if someone else overtook them oftentimes the group
that overtook them was smaller than rivals that they had fended off previously because they had
already started going through institutional collapse or civilizational collapse and if we look
across all of them there are some things we can generalize about what leads to civilizational
collapse but I think the difference now versus any of those other times is that due to globalization
yeah in some ways the US and China are different civilizations but both of them would fail without
each other currently and like we don't make our own computational substrate we don't make our own
lots of things right like they don't do their own fundamental well but this is part of the hope
but the architects of many of these systems believed that a kind of economic
mutually assured destruction yeah was the best way of producing I think that's been true
well so I was going to bring up the case of Europe so one of the arguments for the European
experiment is that you Europe is actually arguably the world's most dangerous region
um people are very competent and they're long-standing rivalries and hatreds
and you had some desire to create something that seems impossible which is a United States of Europe
and nobody was going to sign up for that so how do you do that well you back you back them into
a financial union without political union you give them their ability the ability to issue their own
debt but not an ability to print their currencies and then you wait for the collapse to come
and then you hope in this storyline anyway you create a federation which becomes a political
federation the United States of Europe is created because of a sovereign debt crisis and we sort of
went through that which I believe was a was sort of a sought after outcome which is maybe hopefully
people will print their own their own debt and they'll issue debt and they won't be able to print
their own currencies in order to inflate their way out of it ergo something positive will have to
happen that seems to me to be also a recipe for disaster and that the architects of these plans
seemingly died and everybody's on autopilot not understanding you know I've seen this in the in
in terms of certain us policies where people create a policy for reasons that nobody's really
understanding and a short time later nobody even knows why the policy was created the real reason
and to begin with do you see that this kind of a world I think that's actually one of the
meaningful dynamics in institutional decay and in civilizational decay is that a new civilization
is formed coming out coming out of a war or after a migration or through a famine or after
like some really difficult thing yeah and to really be able to build something new took real
capacities what you would call the contact of the unforgiving right like real empirical capacities
and so studied my lingo sir a bit yeah and I think that's really good lingo because
like the I can't I can't lie to physics and have it reward me for it right like
either I can grow corn or I can't grow corn either I can win at a war or I can't but
there's a real situation and so oftentimes when we go from non wartime where the generals are
politicians to wartime where the politician generals who maybe suck at war start losing
battles and we cycle through looking for ones who are good at it then we get some who are actually
good at war those difficult situations select for real empirical capacity but when you don't have
those difficult situations then you're actually selecting for who can do politics best which
means convince everyone of something whether it's true or not well this is what I call sharp
minds versus sharp elbows yeah and so you have the people who are at the beginning of figuring
out how to do some new civilization and those people had some capacity to be in direct contact
with reality and figure stuff out and then oftentimes what they pass on is the stuff they
figured out but not the psychology in them and the capacities to figure stuff out to the generator
function of the civilization models lost and so now we start getting copying errors and people
are hopefully trying to at least copy it earnestly so now we've got a constitution or a set of law or
a set of market practices or whatever it is but we don't really understand how we generated that
effective thing and so that also means that as the environment changes we won't be able to adapt
it adequately and that also means that we're not going to know how to deal with failures of it so
then some people recognizing that start realizing that they can do better by defecting on the system
and kind of preying on it then by participating with the system and so and this is what we think
of as corruption right where they can start maximizing their own bonus structure or do a
backend deal or whatever and so long as it's adequately hidden they can get away with it and
now that collapses the civilization even further so it goes from loss of generator function to
copying errors to incentive for internal defection and disinformation and you know like I think that
every civilization has faced this a loss of intergenerational knowledge transfer because
it's not just the knowledge it's the generator function of how well but it's also the case that
real knowledge I think has become too dangerous to transmit and real knowledge
doesn't know what the social norms are and you know certainly the biological world
is so disturbing I mean there's no corner of the biological world that you can look at
and not come away thinking wow that's incredibly disturbing and what we're seeing right now a
situation in which we can't cope with any discussion of biology every single attempt to have a real
biological discussion given all of the social issues that it would bring up immediately ends
in madness I've just seen no ability to talk real biology in public and so this is the earliest
place where I can see here's a subject a science that actually can't be discussed I don't have
anything in particular in mind it's just you know like you know bob trivers work on parent child
conflict if we have a beautiful story about how mothers would do anything for their children
and somebody comes along and says no it's actually a struggle where mothers want to hold on to their
resources because they're going to have many children and the child attempts to gain as much
resource as possible without regard for the mother that's so against the hallmark card version of
motherhood for mother's day that we can't have a discussion about parent child conflict in biology
it's not that one isn't about gender it's not about race it's not about you know power dynamics it's
about it just immediately runs into one of our cherished nonsensical points of view
or that the market is self-correcting the market is always self-correcting and knows best that the
leading thinkers are all sitting in institutional chairs that every previous civilization was
the Hobbesian bias brutish nasty short dreadful lives and that everything is awesome just in the
last little bit because of this system so don't criticize the system too much exactly so this
the weird thing that I'm finding is that you can't start interesting conversations not only
about the pessimism of the impending collapse if we keep this up but about the optimism about well
what might we do differently like we can't get energized to actually use this period of time
to do something novel and interesting and hopeful okay so think about this the you know the definition
of infidel for kind of a jihadist ideology is anybody that's not supporting the jihadist ideology
the definition of which to the crusaders was kind of a similar thing right the I have a friend who
went and looked at a bunch of the intelligence agency documents in Yugoslavia and some of the
Baltic nations that had been declassified after the USSR collapsed specifically regarding how
the intelligence agencies influenced the definition of psychiatry and their equivalent of the DSM
and so there was something like their definition of diagnostic and statistical manual for psychology
which tells you when somebody is meant to be as a personality disorder neuroses you remember the
previous definition of female mania during the Victorian period right which basically translated
to she had a sex drive and so that was like a mental illness and but uh so they their definition
of something that translated to schizophrenia the first symptom was had negative feelings about the
state and the second symptoms might take a while to show up and so what I think happens is that the
dominant system ends up eating psychology and saying that the psychology that supports the
dominant system is healthy psychology and anything that is dissenting to it's not healthy it ends up
eating spirituality and virtue and ethics and academia and whatever to basically say the the
behaviors that support the system are good so the thinking that supports those behaviors is good and
anything that's dissenting is bad and like it's so easy to see it in the crusades or in jihadism
or even in Victorian time period it's just very hard for us to see it about ourselves now but I
think that's actually like one of these fundamental things in terms of you're saying like why don't
we have group sense making is because you have a you have a self-perpetuating system that includes
the self-perpetuation of the memes that support the system I understand well look I also have
I ask it not because I have no ideas why we don't have communal sense making
what I'm confused by is why we are not more successful I mean people in our group and I mean
this in a relatively large and inclusive sense because you and I come from different corners
of this large collection of people I think people are relatively well spoken some of them
have fancy degrees some of them have made money some of them have become relatively well known
for their their thinking and yet that institutional conversation I mean I always liken it a bit to
the difference between wrestling and professional wrestling where in the institutional conversation
you need to know what's going to happen ahead of schedule so that you can know whether you're
going to have that part of the conversation or not or whether it's going to be that the private
conversation that we can't talk about versus the public conversation in this concept that I've
called split-level argument other people have called Mott and Bailey style tactics where you have
some version of the argument that you can make in public and then you have some other argument that
you really have to is governing why you're saying and doing what you're doing all of these things
lead to this very unhealthy situation whereby there is no communal sense making there is a gated
institutional narrative it seems to be decaying progressively year by year nobody's suddenly coming
up to me and saying wow I think CNN and Fox are doing a great job this year where's the hope
where does this get fun and when do we get a chance to to find a portal to a better world
as you see it most likely yeah well I want to start by saying I think this is important
right I think that you doing this it as a portal to a better world where you are supporting
earnest thinking that is outside of institutional context and maybe heterodox but at least earnest
and seeking to be well grounded and the fact that people are interested in it I think is really
important when we come back to the difference between personal incentive and collective incentive
right you say why aren't we more successful obviously it's like okay so what is the incentive
for someone to agree with us that for the most part expressing these things would make them do
less well at politics and their job and maybe even their social club and maybe even be part of the
in group that they're part of whether it's the left or the right or the whatever it is because
then they would be saying things that there's almost no in group that they would be aligned with
or very very small and so you still end up having that there's more selective pressure for the
individuals to continue to be part of institutions even an institutional thought doesn't make sense
here's the part that doesn't make sense to me and very kind of you to say what you just said
but let's imagine that you have a perfect SAT scores you kept your nose clean your whole life
you've gone to Harvard and Yale you've got a position where you're commenting as a professor
with a column in a major publication if that person for example calls me alt right you know
or uh I don't know I mean like I have a Jewish last name I voted for Bernie there's some point
where that person's self-esteem I would imagine they would be so embarrassed to put their
life's accomplishments at risk by just being obviously stupidly wrong
like it just there seems to be no bottom at the moment okay so this is this is important
about obviously stupidly wrong I understand obviously stupidly wrong when your ability
to demonstrate your power is to go out in the public square and say the dumbest most ridiculous
most obviously incorrect thing you can think of and nobody says a word
yeah well one of the things I find interesting is you know if we ask a question like even what's
actually causing coral die off how much of it is temperature versus pH versus nitrogen
messing up the phosphorus cycle versus trophic cascades right how long do we have before the
coral die off what are the consequences of that you know like really important questions right
or what are the actual what really happened in North Korea like why there was such a change
just recently and what are the actual tactical nuclear capabilities that they have or or how
much leakage actually occurred at Fukushima or like any of these things nobody fucking knows
and you'll hear different narratives and you'll hear kind of equally compelling disagreeable
narratives on those yeah and almost no one has the time or the will or the epistemic capacity
to really figure that out so one point is the sense making is actually hard you have a situation in
which a lot of these things are complex enough and there's so much disinformation that when people
try to actually figure it out they just get a they get a information overwhelm and then it's
very hard for them to continue so when you're saying like obviously stupid well there aren't
there's a lot of places where people can hold a train of thought that seems cogent enough
even if it's in direct opposition with another cogent train of thought and like just the plausible
deniability that it might be one of the true ones since nobody can really sense make seems to be
enough and so this is one of the really tricky things is in a world where if I have the incentive
to disinform yeah at various different levels right and then I have exponential information
tech so I can do exponential disinformation now this is when I say that the system's inanimate
any of this example everybody who's seen Tristan Harris's stuff will know this but
if we think about disinformation via the nature Tristan Harris is a mutual colleague
he heads a movement called time well spent and he's trying to show you that your attention
has been effectively weaponized against you where the big tech platforms are figuring out
how to keep your eyeballs on their system right to your detriment right center for
humane technology you can see stuff but like I think I think a lot of people know that news
stations as for-profit companies have to make money right and they make money by monetizing
attention and basically they they sell advertising and the advertisers pay more the more people who
are watching for more total minutes so the incentive of the news station is to make stuff
that is both inflaming and scary and entertaining and whatever will engage people to spend a lot of
time watching it and to not say things it would not be to the advantage of the advertisers that
can afford to pay for them right so they have like they have an incentive to not share really
complex nuance things that will have most people click off but to share things if I see I don't
buy this thing I really don't okay let me give you an argument one of the things that I say that I
think people find interesting is that I believe the National Academy of Sciences and the National
Science Foundation effectively conspired against American scientists and engineers on behalf of
scientific and engineering employers that's a fascinating story I shout it in the public square
now you know I've been asked four times to the National Academy of Sciences to discuss this
so they are certainly taking this quite seriously I've talked to the actual people who are involved
with this it is amazingly interesting you could sell clicks you could you could you could just
get advertisers to buy for the clicks on this story nobody's going to run the story nobody
has run the story and I don't know more than 20 years it's sitting there on servers I don't believe
that this is all being driven by profit I believe that there is some force that we don't understand
that keeps the gated institutional narrative gated yes I think profit is one part of it and
that's why I say we have to think of profit as one aspect of kind of power or rivalrous dynamic
more largely because it's I think government or academia or religious or cultural groups or
profit can all influence the nature of narrative and information I think there's an economy of
shame and terror say more about that I believe that the real reason that this
works the way it does is we have not even gotten to a very basic point where it is considered
acceptable to say I want immigration restricted
now I point this out because I think it's very funny most people who want immigration restricted
and enjoy food from other cultures they they have friends who come from other places
they enjoy travel there's nothing xenophobic about them in general they are xenophilic
and the idea that you can be both xenophilic fascinated and interested in the world's cultures
and want immigration to your country restricted and that this is the generic position that the
average person holds this position is a story that appears nowhere so nobody has an idea that
xenophilic restrictionists might be a plurality or a majority in the country because there is a rule
that says anyone who calls for restriction of immigration must be tarred as a xenophobe right
and I think it's time to double dog dare the people who are keeping this level of discipline
to say why cannot why is it impossible to be a xenophilic restrictionist what I think is is that
the economy of shame is such that whoever acts first to make this point is in such danger for
their livelihood their reputation that they are going to be tarred and feathered and one of the
things that I'm trying to show people is is that you can you can make these points now I can't do
this on CNN but I can do this on pirate radio this is basically audio samos dot it to take the
Russian underground mimeograph movement as a template we can say things here but there's only
a matter of time before this starts to become problematic to the institutional structure
and it responds by debiting my account oh well that that's that alt right guy
yeah he seems disgruntled or you know he seems a gloomy and out of touch and then the fear
uncertainty and doubt campaign starts and that's what is actually keeping everybody in line it's
not that there isn't money to be made there's tons of money to be made what what's happened is
is that it's been too easy to pick off the initial adopters I agree and I'm curious what your
explanation of how that phenomenon emerged oh that's a really so
let's really get into it we did have a
dissension suppression unit inside of the FBI which was called co-intel pro
and it tried to induce Martin Luther King Jr to suicide through a letter from Sullivan
who was I think number one or number two maybe under Hoover this thing lived inside of the FBI
it probably tried to tell John Lennon that he was a traitorous it tried to humiliate Gene Seberg
who was a Black Panther supporter by planning false information inside of mainstream media
Newsweek in Los Angeles Times it tried to get La Cosa Nostra to kill Dick Gregory the famous
comedian and black civil rights leader so we did have a dirty tricks unit inside of the United
States that needs to be known broadly which was pretty thoroughly investigated in the mid 1970s
and once we saw that we were engaged in these dirty tricks against our own people
we were kind of shocked and flipped out and the economy wasn't in great shape
and then Ronald Reagan came writing in and I think he pardoned Mark Felt
who had been the head of co-intel pro after Hoover but he was also deep throat and so you had this
very strange situation that we got this reboot during the Reagan years where we went back to some
sort of more traditional more patriotic imagined version of our country and my belief is that in
part when Bill Clinton decided that he couldn't take yet another loss to the Republican party
he was going to start experimenting with Republicanism inside of the Democratic party
by that point we had two parties that more or less were two flavors of the same thing I refer to
the that collective as the looting party and the looting party the neoliberals the neoconservatives
sort of intergenerational warfare within the country in the US and my take on it is that
the common ideology is that profit had to be found abroad and so you had to loosen the bonds to
your fellow citizens and that's where all of this kind of the market always knows best we need to
offshore and downsize and securitize what I've called the new gimmick economy so that right now
we're waking up from the new gimmick economy and having never lived in anything really authentic
unless we're quite old so my belief is is that during that period of time there was very swift
retribution for anyone who dissented famously a prominent trade theorist who
was talking about the benefits of restriction of trade restrictions for infant industries let's say
apparently got a call from one of the people high up in the field say oh you seem to be a very
bright young man it'd be a shame if anything happened to your career and so this kind of
idea suppression is the hallmark well it is what I think these two generations the baby boomers and
the silent generation may become best known for in the future that this was a period in which
new corrective ideas had to be suppressed because of the fragility of the system we saw the fragility
break out in 2008 we saw how vulnerable we were in 2001 and we see that the whole sense making
apparatus is breaking down from the Trump election so these have been the three moments
when the gated institutional narrative has broken because it just got overwhelmed by events
but other than that the key was making sure that people like you or like me or like Peter
are not mainstream the cost of listening to us has to be driven to astronomical levels
so we have to we have to look wild eyed we have to you know they can't call me uneducated if I have
a Harvard PhD which is one of the funny parts of the system but the idea is that you have to say
well you know maybe he used to be smart but he's gone fringe so the the social cost it's a more
it's amazing how effective such small amounts of that can be well it's also just funny I mean it just
there's so many hours of audio of us and I was just astounded for example with the number of
people who would try to portray let's say my brother as right wing I mean from my perspective
can you imagine making that decision that you guys far left is Brett and you're going to spend
your credibility pretending that he's like allied with the Nazis I just I just it doesn't even make
sense to me because it's it's simply to me a way to incinerate your credibility and yet
the way the system works is you incinerate people's viability it's economic warfare that
if your reputation is damaged you can't be trusted you know and and that's how that's
how this this enforcement has worked so you asked me the question how does it work to keep this in
line it's too trivially easy to destroy individuals and my question has always been
is there a program which I have tentatively called no living heroes I don't know if you've
heard this riff before Charles Lindbergh who was not a great human being
almost kept the US out of World War two he said why is this why is this America's problem
and if you think about it he had self minted credibility and that he got into a plane and
he flew it over an ocean solo and became a hero and that level of visibility allowed him to compete
with the state okay I think that there was a program after Lindbergh that said
individuals should not be able to amass sufficient mindshare to affect the course of government
policy and this is a question in my mind is there a program that got started that said
we're going to wait and see if anything starts to bubble up that seems to have integrity
seems to have mindshare it seems to be opposed to our policies and if and when we find such a thing
it has to be redirected co-opted destroyed reputationally or made ineffectual and the
phrase that I really appreciated that was used about Gene Sieberg who was you know one of Hollywood's
great leading ladies of the time was we have to cheapen her image yeah this is the federal
government talking about cheapening the image of a Hollywood star because she was interested in
radical black politics sorry no it kind of reminds me when you were saying if when we
look at biology it's disturbing when we look at history too and we realize that those people
that did the crusades were genetically identical to us and we think about the kind of civilized
way that we want to think of ourselves that we wouldn't do something like have a government
try and discredit someone but then we look at just how we have behaved as people throughout most
of history and it's been like it's been pretty draconian through most of it and I think we're
at a time where having it more hidden has been useful but that doesn't mean that it hasn't still
been happening well it's very interesting to me as we go from we have these two phases the first
phase is like you think people are still doing that you have an overactive imagination
then when it's discovered they say what you think that governments don't do this they've
always done this and I've always watched as people get their cognitive dissonance to zero
using two totally different mental strategies do you find this of course yeah all right Daniel
assuming that we are in some sense breaking out of this narrative that's been imposed
institutionally and you're starting to be able to hear new voices is there an opportunity in
some way to start hacking our way into a less rivalrous well let me try it again
I'll start from the beginning so a little bit of gas I also had a little bit of gas
all right Daniel so if we agree that there is something a little bit bizarre about the extent
to which there's been discipline in this gated institutional narrative and it's been hard to
get kind of a different message out to people that they need to start exploring new systems
of organization maybe beyond market democracy who knows what what are the most hopeful systems that
we currently have to use they can be used to build even better systems and how do we get that
message out where do you see the hope in trying to confront the real problems we face to find
an exit into our our next stage of human development
so we've been talking about where there is incentive for disinformation or information
suppression or narrative suppression the the last chunk of things you were sharing regarding
shame was kind of a narrative warfare tool so away I think of it and say there was a group that
seemed like it didn't have power of one kind then it tries to find power of some other kind so
reconfiguring in groups competing with whatever tools they can against outgroups but
imagine if we could create a situation where there was no incentive for disinformation
I'll talk about in a moment how I think we could do that and not just no incentive for disinformation
but also no incentive for information withholding and something pretty unique about humans is how
good we are at being able to add intention to signal
lie but all the subtle versions right which is most of the signal that is coming to me is just
bouncing off of stuff and reflecting and doesn't have that much disinformation in it and obviously
animals have camouflage and strategies like that but every time we're communicating we are usually
communicating towards some intention that we have and so I want you to think certain things where you
thinking those things I think will advantage me but then to the extent that you take what I'm saying
as adequately informing you like accurately informing you about reality I not be right like
there's a discrepancy between why I'm communicating to you and what would be maximum benefit to you
so and even if we're not doing spin and Russell conjugation disinformation even if it's just IP
and trade secrets and information withholding this lowers our coordination capacity to do
interesting things tremendously and then there's so much coordination cost that goes into the
competition so we say well let's imagine and we can I think we can say up to a tribal scale
people did could do I'm not saying they always did I don't want to be romantic people could do a better
job of accurate information sharing because there was less incentive to disinform each other inside
of the tribe because it would probably get found out and we actually depended on each other pretty
significantly but the Dunbar limit seems to be a pretty hard limit on that kind of information
so you mean this supposed Dunbar number that is the limit of our ancestral
mind or group to track the number of interactions we have so yeah maybe maybe I can keep track of 200
or 300 people yeah not much more yeah whether whether it's 150 or 50 or 200 or whatever it is
and you know I think we've attributed this to different things why tribes never got beyond
a certain scale within a certain kind of organization and if they would start to they would cleave
and then if they were going to get larger they had to have a different kind of organization
I think how one thing that we commonly think about is that kind of a limit of care and tracking
right up to that number up to 150 people or whatever I can actually know everybody pretty
well they can all know me and if I were to hurt anybody I'm hurting the people that I've known
for my whole life so something like universal interest of that group or almost like a commute
communalist idea makes sense if there's no anonymous people and there's no very far spaces
where I can externalize harm I basically can't externalize harm in the social commons when I
know everybody well I also probably can't lie and have that be advantageous I think there's
another thing which is there's a communication protocol that anyone who has information about
something within that setting can inform a choice where that information would be relevant that
the tribe would be making because they can actually communicate with everybody fairly easily
and if there's a really big choice to make everybody can sit around a tribal circle and
actually be able to say something about it and as you get larger you just can't do that
and I think there's a strong cleaving basis for not wanting to be part of a group that
would make decisions that I'll be subjected to that I don't get any say in unless it's really
important to do that like we're gonna have there's a situation where tribal warfare is
starting to occur more often and so having a larger group is really important or you know
some something like that in which case the bonding energy exceeds the cleaving energy
but let's say that we could actually have a situation where we had incentive to share
to not disinform and to share accurate information with each other and that could scale beyond a
Dunbar size I so now we have something where we don't have fractal disinformation inside of a company
we don't have people competing for cancer cures that aren't sharing information with each other
I think that system would outcompete all the systems that we've had in terms of innovation
and in terms of resource utilization resource per capita utilization so much that if we could
do such a thing it'd become the new attractive basin to which civilizations would want to flow
and I think the limit of Dunbar dynamics were communication protocols and I think we do have
technological capacity and I'm I mean both social technologies and physical technologies
to develop systems and and so like this is kind of at the heart of it to develop systems where
there was more incentive to share honest information and obviously this is a
example of anti-rival risk where I had my well-being and your well-being and the well-being
of the commons more tightly coupled to each other yeah that's the first part of it okay so
so try to figure out how to get very large scale human collectives to behave like small
scale human collectives well let's yeah if we think about two groups of people that sounds to
me like trip advisor where I travel to some country I'm I've never been to and I'm never
going back again and there's some sort of reputational cost that a hotel would have had
if it had gamed their guests so it becomes a bad idea to game your guests because you have a
fractional relationship with the world in some sense where somebody has left a review that says
but you know be careful they try to upsell you on the wi-fi and it's a scam and here's how to
look out for it and suddenly you have got a problem if you're a dishonest actor because
there is this sort of reputational game that is technologically enabled yeah so I think this is
why people like blockchain is the idea of an uncorruptible ledger is that disinformation
and information withholding or would be really benefit beneficial to the public and any kind of
bad acting does less well with good accounting systems I have to be able to kind of corrupt
the accounting in some way to be able to have it be advantageous and so can we make
can we make systems that make the accounting much better as part of it but it's not
the whole basis because then of course you still have incentive to figure out how to
game the game whatever it is as long as we still have separate interest and the separate interest
which is that any in-group can advantage itself at the expense of an out-group or any individual
can advantage itself at the expense of other individuals which is grounded all the way down to
like a private balance sheet I do think is an inexorable basis of rivalry and I do think that
rivalry in a world of exponential tech does self-terminate and given that I don't think we can stop
the progress of tech I do think we have to create fundamentally anti-rivalry systems and I don't
think you can do that with capitalism or that or private property ownership is the primary
basis to how we get access to things I don't think you can do it with communism or socialism or
any of the other systems we've had but I don't think that if we look at how the coordination
system of cells or organs inside of a body works I don't think it's capitalist or communist I think
there's a much more complex way of sharing information and provisioning resources within the
system you know this is how the famous anarchist Peter Prince Peter Kropotkin got in trouble
because I think he was like kind of an amateur naturalist and he would observe things like
ant colonies and say well look look how well the ants cooperate and of course he didn't know that
it was a haplodiploid system where sisters are more closely related to each other than to the
offspring and you had a you know a breeding queen and then effectively mimicking some kind of
body division into soma and germ where your somatic cells have no possibility of
leaving a permanent trace of themselves but for their ability to aid your germline cells that
can become a fertilized you know egg in an embryo I don't think there is an adequate
biomimicry example okay and I think there's an important reason why is I think that technology
creation is something that we don't see happen in nature anywhere else and of course animals will
use a tool but they don't evolve better tools or develop better tools the way that we develop
better tools and the distinction of technology creation or tool making as a process by which
new stuff comes to exist as opposed to evolution as a process by which new stuff comes to exist
is at the heart of a lot of the things that I think about here because I think it fundamentally
changes our thinking on like social Darwinism and why markets are kind of a viable or an
inexorable idea is if we think about evolution as a process by which new things come about
defined by mutation survival selection and then mate selection within an environmental
niche and then of course there's recursion on niche creation in in evolution we see rivalry
everywhere as you are mentioning in like biology there's a lot of really painful things to look at
and I think we've especially since Darwin modeled ourselves as apex predators
for a long time and but I think and I think that we actually even reified the theory of
markets with evolutionary biology to say that demand is like a niche and that the various
versions of a product or a service are like mutations and the company that survives because
it's able to supply the demand well those ideas and those technologies make it through and then
if there's a couple that are mutually good where merging would be good so you get a merger and
acquisition that's kind of like mate dynamics right like recombinant work dynamics and this is why
competition is good and drives innovation and same as happens in nature I think that's kind of the
way that a lot of people think about markets and relationship to evolution and I think the reason
we can't think about it that way and it also the reason why we don't see whether it's ants or
whether it sells in a body or anything why we don't see examples of the kinds of coordination
in nature that will apply to humans is I think that the development of technology both language
and social coordination technologies and physical technologies but our capacity for abstraction
and then things that increase our power via abstraction as opposed to their power increases
via some instantiated thing like a gene is a fundamentally different process because in nature
you will see rivalry you'll see obviously one if the lion catches the gazelle the gazelle dies if
the gazelle gets away the lion might die right and yet all lions and all gazelles are symbiotic
with each other meaning if there were no lions the gazelles might eat themselves to extinction if
there were no gazelles the lions might starve so there's this process by which micro rivalry
leads to macro symbiosis and both of them evolving supports each other to evolve as the
lions get a little bit faster they eat more of the slower gazelles the faster ones genes
recombine and you get faster gazelles yeah but how does I mean you know mathematically I think
the lot of ultera equations is this predator so very simple predator prey dynamics with like
let's say two species I understand how that can be stable right I don't understand that in the
presence of exponential tech I mean the okay so the first thing that I got trying to be concrete
here is that maybe something like the technology of reputation might allow us to leverage up small
group dynamics towards large group dynamics the idea that I don't have to know you to know
something about your reputation I see some hope there but then it's open to reputational warfare
I think reputation systems will be gamed I agree right with it look I I'm very obsessed
about game B yeah not because I don't understand our need for it is that I can't imagine the system
that gets us out of our nature and our nature you know rivalry abounds
within nature cooperation is found everywhere I don't see a way of getting everything towards
universal disclosure cooperation but I'm I hear you are one of the people who is
the farthest along thinking about how we might pull this off yeah and I know I told you earlier
I have to apologize for a strange night that had me not sleep so operating at low capacity so I think
I'm less clear than ideal but no I want to say a little bit more because just saying make large
groups work like small groups is like uh that doesn't help at all I want to actually say a
little bit more about how we would do that but specifically why the tool making thing is such
a big deal and why the biomimicry examples don't work because it specifically then plays into what
does have to work the mutation pressures that are happening in nature are relatively evenly
distributed across the system if we think about mutation survival selection and then
breeding selection and so you don't get a situation where one species gets a thousand x
advantage in a single quick jump independent of all the other ones right the mutation is only
going to be so big and the mutation forces that are happening on the lions are also happening on
the gazelles right so they're all experiencing gamma rays or oxidative stress or copying errors
or whatever similarly so that's one thing and then the other thing is that there's co-selective
pressures as as the lion gets a little bit faster then the gazelles end up getting faster because
the slower ones get eaten and the faster genes recombine and so because of the pair because of
the even distribution of mutation and because of the co-selective pressures there's a certain kind
of symmetry of power that happens right the gazelles get away as often or more often than the lions
get them and so you only get the situation where micro arrival leads to macro symbiosis when you
have and also the situation of metastability of an ecosystem when you have something like
a symmetry of power within the system a symmetry of power yeah if the lion's got a thousand times
more predatory in one generation they would end up eating all the gazelles and then going to their
own collapse the they get they get they increase their predate as they increase their predate of
capacity the environment increases its capacity to respond to the predate of capacity symmetrically
similarly I mean this works up to a point I mean part of the problem is is that gazelles are not
the only thing that dying on lions that lions dying on right and furthermore you know lions are not
the only even even if lions are atop some predator hierarchy one lion in 20 hyenas is not a reputation
for it's not a recipe for lion happiness so you have you have very complex dynamics with
with many species interacting and that's what I mean you have metastability of the
whole ecosystem not stability because some species will die off and other species will emerge but you
have okay an increase in orderly complexity but there is a parallelism between lion and lion
between lion and hyena between lion and gazelle right and if there wasn't you would have you
wouldn't end up having metastability you'd have something have a runaway dynamic that was unchecked
by the dynamics of the environment so basically the the forces the evolutionary forces that are
happening are happening across the whole solid the whole system and co-affecting each other
but with toolmaking toolmaking didn't occur for us with a mutation toolmaking was us consciously
understanding that this sharp rock that maybe a chimp would experientially use a sharp rock and then
use another sharp rock and realize this rock was exponentially sharper but it wouldn't understand
the abstract principle of sharpness to make sharper flint things our capacity for abstraction
leading to toolmaking like that made us increase our predatory capacity radically faster than the
environment could become resilient to our increased predative capacity and that was the beginning of
a curve that has you know started to verticalize exponentially recently but because of that tool
making we could put on clothes and go to the Arctic and become the apex predator there in a way
that the lion or the cheetah couldn't leave its environment we could we could go become the apex
predator in every environment and over hunt the environment and then when we would over hunt
environment rather than have our population come to steady state we could go move to and start over
hunting another environment and then figure out agriculture that's super different than every
other animal and so you don't have a situation anywhere in nature where like a single lion could
do that much damage to its environment but you do have a situation where a single person like a
Putin or a Trump or whatever could do massive damage because of technology to the total biosphere
you don't have a situation where a single cancer cell can propagate cancer genes instantly to the
whole system it's going to affect the cells around it which have a chance to then correct it
does a lot of corrective mechanism so the exponential tech increases our leverage so much
that if we that individuals and small groups have the capacity to influence the rest of
the human space but also the biospace in a way that nothing else has so there is no example
anywhere in biology of a system that can that has the kind of asymmetry relative to its whole
environment that we have so yeah if i understand correctly i mean the the slight adjustment i would
i would give is is that orcas get you part of the way there because they're a broadly distributed
apex predator they occur in southern northern seas they have all sorts of different strategies
the thing that that you're coupling it to which i think is very interesting
is that nobody has seen a 10 000 fold increase in orca efficiency as a predator so it may be a
we couldn't because as they start eating too many of the fish then they can't keep breeding
you know i understood that point so my my my point is that you said you were trying to
indicate that you could just keep changing your environment like your clothing becomes a micro
climate so that you're able to become the eight the polar bear is no longer the apex predator of
the arctic right and you could make the argument that the orca is not the apex predator of the
seas because we're in the seas and i think the example there is just think of an ocean trawler
with a mile long drift net and the number of fish it pulls up compared to an orca and you realize
that we can't model ourselves as apex predators that are competing with others to see who's
maximally dominant with that much power without destroying everything i think this is a very
interesting point and i think the idea that we are without precedent many of us accept
we don't know of any other species that has language ability to coordinate the way we do although
certain social species from african dogs to orcas to what have you you know are pretty
impressive in their ability to coordinate in one form or another so what i hear you is saying is
that tool use and the extended phenotype if you will to use richard darwin's concept like for
example these microphones are part of our extended phenotype because they are tools that allow us to
do something yeah okay that changes the picture and it also ends up introducing both a fundamental
thing about the problem and the solution i'd recommend tell me about the solution okay and
then tell me about the problem i want to have well which order would be better logically i just i
would love to get to the positive uplifting point of the story so
so we can say that what's particularly a primary thing that's particularly unique
adaptively about homo sapiens yeah is our capacity for tecne right our capacity for
tool and that's social tools like language and democracy and but also physical tools and they are
all abstract pattern replicators rather than instantiated pattern replicators right so memes
rather than genes so you could say that what humans selected for our genetics selected for memetics
our genetics selected for radical neuroplasticity and the capacity to have much more significant
software upgrades that could change our capacity without needing hardware upgrades
and so and i would argue that this is partly why we have such a long period of neoteny right
why we have such a long period of being totally helpless on the outside is because i'm going to
give up um on trying to get you to redefine the words that are going to cause people to have
to go to their dictionaries i think one of the one of the things that i've said about this
podcast is that um we may misspeak we may use language improperly but we should at least
play with it and invite people to look things up on their own hey i only was doing that because
i listened to the half hour thing that you said that said you're going to let people go look at
their dictionary yep so i'm breaking my own rule you're you're playing me against me i love it all
right so extended period of neoteny go on yeah so we're embryonic on the outside meaning we're
helpless for a super long time compared to anything and obviously there are some animals
like birds that are more helpless than other ones for longer periods but nothing like us but
we don't if we came hardwired how to be fit to our environment that would make any sense because
we change our environment so fast most creatures emerged evolved to fit an environmental niche
but as niche creators as significant as we are both because we moved places then you know like
this is not an evolved environment and it's not that adaptive for me to throw spears but
i do need to be good at texting so we had to come to be able to learn language whether i'm
learning english or mandarin whether i'm learning spear throwing or texting or whatever and so what
i would say is that essential to human nature is the depth of nurture capacity relative to other
species and so when i look at the thing we call human nature i look at how much i think the social
sciences don't factor that there is ubiquitous conditioning that we're doing the social science
within that is ubiquitous conditioning and there are outliers that are actually relevant that aren't
just genetic all right so if i understand you correctly and now we're going to just totally
geek out we are the most case selective of species that is that we put the largest investment into
our young we delay reproductive maturity for 12 or 13 times around the sun seems crazy
and therefore your point is we have got an unparalleled opportunity for teaching for adaptation
because we unlike the wildebeest who has to be more or less ready good to go almost from the
moment of birth minutes yeah right the idea is that we are in the luxurious position of having
a long period of development and knowledge transfer because we are more about the extended
phenotype i mean look at this anthill yeah it's pretty amazing yeah so what that tells me is i
look at some outliers on both sides of the bell curve of various dimensions of the human condition
and let's say we take buddhism for instance we have something like three millennia of 10 million
fluxing give or take people who mostly don't hurt bugs across different bioregions and across
different languages and that's really significant when we think about the inexorability of violence
in humans and then we look at say the jonja weed or some group of child soldiers where by the time
someone's a teenager they've all hacked people apart with machetes i think that the human condition
can do both of those human nature can be conditioned to do both of those but then i see that we have a
system where in general the as soon as a tribe figured out as soon as a couple tribes were
competing for resources it was generally easier to move than it was to war until we had moved
everywhere in which case it was it started making sense to war and then as soon as any tribe militarizes
every other tribe has to militarize or they lose by default and the game of power has begun in
in earnest in that way the human on human game and i think we've seen that the peaceful cultures
largely got killed by the warring cultures and the warring cultures learned from each other how
to be more successful at it and so the thing that we have now is something that has emerged
through iterations on power dynamics and it's conditioning everyone within it and then we
do all of our social studies within that and say this is human nature well so this is a very weird
place to get brought back to because i'm i'm on the escape branch of our decision tree and what
you're talking about is possible when you can do better by investing in peaceful and
kind alternatives i don't know what to what to call it exactly but nonviolent alternatives
and as soon as things become kind of steady state zero sum
you start eyeing other people as protein sources because that's the way to grow a slice
and i don't know how you get out of this in a finite world so maybe the idea is that you're
you have a concept of escape yeah that isn't physical escape i think malifas was right at the time
but wrong fundamentally where he said resources are reproducing geometrically or humans are
reproducing geometrically resources arithmetically so there's either not enough or there's not going
to be enough a certain point well he hadn't got to the point that some cultures went into
negative population amounts and lower birth rates without an imposition it's not just
china's you know one child in position that did that but we've seen birth rates low enough
in some of the nordic countries and in japan and he hadn't got to the point of seeing
the phenomena that bring that about or the ability to recycle effectively
and which means not a linear materials economy so i'm starting to i'm starting to guess where
you're going to go so if i if i understand you correctly the idea is that you're going to look
at all of the places we've been a little bit sloppy like recycling wasn't a place that we
put too much attention and increasingly as we understand that stuff is limited we
we have more of a reason to be careful about our land use rare rare resources i think i get that
part of it then you have another idea here about development is kind of unused and we could do
something far greater and then you just had another one that's slipping my brain
population oh that we would start to see a fertility below replacement rates so that you
would actually go into population decline as a means of taking pressure off of the system yeah
so i see the possibility for a steady state population that is within the carrying capacity
of a closed-loop materials economy but that is fueled by renewable energy so you basically have
a finite amount of atoms so you circle the atoms you don't have a finite amount of energy
because you're getting more energy every day but you have a finite amount per day and so you have
to be able to cycle the atoms within the energy bandwidth and you're cycling it from one bit
pattern into another bit pattern right like from one form into another form and the forms are stored
as bits so you have atoms energy and bits and you don't really have a limited number of the bits
that you can have and so we can have a economy where it's getting continuously better but not
by getting bigger but by getting better we continuously make more and more interesting
things with the same fundamental stuff look we've always had the possibility of decoupling
economic growth from let's say burning uh fossil fuels we just haven't gotten around
doing very well okay what i'm starting to hear is that you believe potentially that maybe we
should embrace declining populations as a means of either i don't want to put words in your mouth
but i'm just trying to guess ahead one possibility is is that we need to amplify the people who can
live peaceably and that maybe the idea is that people who can't live peaceably need to be incentivized
to maybe have fabulous somatic lives but without reproducing i don't know so that we can drive
certain traits towards zero um maybe the idea is we just need to take ambient pressure off
the system and so we need to go into a world where eight billion becomes six billion becomes one
billion and we start dropping down again um i think we see that obviously birth rate is higher
where there's poverty and we might lose some kids right and so as we just get out of abject poverty
birth rates go down and then as total economic quality of life and the choice possibilities for
women and education and other things go up we start getting to uh much lower birth rates and
no i'm not concerned that the birth rate will just collapse forever will come to some steady state
birth rates but that those are happening as a function of increased good things increased
quality of life so in other words if you make the opportunity cost for child bearing enormous
by making sure that let's say females have outrageously great career prospects and
it starts to become much more fulfilling and she doesn't want to spend her whole life pregnant
well look i mean there's different issues with um women not realizing that most of their children
will survive which is happening in the demographic transition uh so people miscalculated for a period
of time leading to fears about runaway population booms so that's that's one effect and then there's
another one about if you give people education um if you give if you educate women the opportunity
costs of staying home and raising children starts to impress itself and so people will have fewer
children yeah but i think where you're where you're headed is super interesting and part maybe it's
one of the reasons that people might find it rather disturbing making life awesome for females
might mean having far fewer children yeah all right so that's a a good thing in schmockton burgers
well yeah this is so both i mean the malthusian trap right the malthusian situation is both
the geometric production reproduction of humans and the arithmetic reproduction of resources
and i think neither of those are true inexorably true i think we can keep cycling the resources
and so basically we can have a steady state human population within a renewable materials economy
carrying capacity but where we're keep but we keep innovating on bit so we keep making more and
more positive and interesting things so we keep getting an increase in quality of life but not
by increasing the quality the quantity of the pie and the quantity of people consuming it
but the quality of it well in the world of adams i can't have bill gates home in washington state
but in the world of bits maybe i can live there uh in my virtual reality and even have much more
fantastic places and so i agree that bits have some ability to create wild abundance that goes
non rivalrous but i've brought up a very different concern which you may be familiar with which is
abundance can kill you if you have if you look out these windows and you see all of these people
engaged in activities without being told to do so by a central authority what is it that ties
that together for the most parts markets with some amount of state control of violence in the
form of policing okay so now you create abundance abundance has this weird effect that it turns
private goods and services into public goods and services where price and value are no longer equal
and suddenly you have people who are producing things that are very valuable and can't get paid
right and so how do we handle the takeover uh in in this hypothetical world where we get to
an economy of abundance that doesn't actually cause a collapse of civilization you can you
can die from abundance no a market can die from abundance but i'm not proposing a market society
i okay so i like that so the idea is that we welcome the destruction of the markets yeah
to be replaced by and it's important to say obviously if i have a situation where
where valuation is at least largely proportional to scarcity then i have a basis to continue to
manufacture artificial scarcity and if something becomes abundant enough it loses value then of
course abundance and markets don't go together i'm very excited about any credible thing that is
better than markets because markets well laden with problems have been pretty amazing in what
they've produced yeah i'm not going to criticize the evolutionary path here to say we can argue
straightforwardly why this path can't continue why the nature of it self-terminates i agree but
the big problem here has always been that we have so little experience with um self-terminating our
rival risk desires well so this is why i bring the buddhists up all right and i think the buddhist
got past one part of the dunbar number if we think about you think of a couple of buddhist
countries for our listeners at home that they can keep in mind while you're talking about buddhism
mostly they don't have countries anymore there are buddhists in a lot of southeast asian countries
so there are buddhists in india there are buddhists there's a lot of buddhists in napal
um obviously to bet was buddhist before to bet stopped existing in that form um
but and you know i could bring up janes or others but there are so few of them
that it's a little bit easier to throw it out as an outlier but basically cultures that were
widely peaceful but it is important to say the widely peaceful ones did largely get either killed
by warring cultures or somehow taken over by them or they became warring at a certain point
and this is why your escape hypothesis which your escape hypothesis only works if we can
make a much better civilization but it needs to not have proximity to the thing to external
sources of rivalry so that it can develop and i want to say you know that one of the reasons
i keep pushing you on these things is not because i'm trying to do a gotcha style interview the
concern let me just be open about it is that there are so few people who are thinking who are
attempting to think rigorously about what we actually are and what we must become if we are
to have a long-term future that i'm not i believe that you are somebody who is trying not to flinch
when it comes to a description of how we got to this place from the arms race that is red of
tooth and claw called called nature and yet your point is maybe we can hack ourselves into a situation
with a future where with exponential tech as you call it we don't have a future and here is the basis
for rigorous idealism and hope and so that's what i'm trying to tease out no great great yeah i don't
think that we are inexorably rivalrous
can we take this weirdly into the the realm in which it is hardest to imagine that we are not
rivalrous which is sex as the precursor to reproduction the floor is yours sir you okay
this is going to make the conversation weird no no um look i think that where you're heading
let me rephrase this every branch of the decision tree has gotten hyper weird and anybody who's
not looking at the fact that there is no non-weird branch of the decision tree is missing the story
of who we are and what time it is in human history so i think to not explore the weird to not dream
about what might be is the least responsible least adult thing we can do if we don't dream
and we don't explore the weird we're doomed yeah all right with that the floor is yours
okay i wanted to go somewhere with buddhism and why not an inexorably rivalrous and that then if
they were to actually get the other side of the dunbar number which is not just getting
care beyond the dunbar number which they could do through abstract empathy but also
the ability to calculate and coordinate which they couldn't because they didn't have the
tech to do it and i'm basically going to say we can get something like
abs oh well okay i'll do the sex thing and the buddhism thing together because they actually
go together i think we get something like a certain level of empathy up to the dunbar number just
through mirror on type effects through the fact that i know these people they know me we've lived
together if they're hurting i am gonna see it because they aren't somewhere far away got it
and similarly i'm less likely to pollute in an area i'm in than through an industrial supply chain
that pollutes somewhere that i'm not so just the proximity where the cause and effect has a feedback
loop as we start to get to much larger scales where i haven't a cause and there's an effect but i
don't get a feedback loop on it the broken open feedback loop is a problem so i think the buddhists
were able to train abstract empathy not just empathy for the people who i see hurting but
empathy for all sentient beings throughout time and space right feeling their connectedness with
them that's the nature of the vows of the bodhisattva and they're not the only one right this is
different religions have tried to do this but it's an example of a group succeeding at it
where they were able to have a sense of positive coupling of my well-being and the well-being of
another rather than inverse coupling they get ahead and it's decreasing my ability to get ahead
what they the other side of the dunbar number was not just who we care about but also our ability
to coordinate and i don't think they were able to figure out coordination mechanisms that are
adequately effective at scale okay i think if we do both of those things we can make a
fundamentally different kind of civilization and rivalry mostly comes down to today private
balance sheets which is i can get ahead economically and the money equals optionality for most of the
things that i want all right and i can get ahead economically independent of you getting ahead and
even at the expense of you getting ahead or the expense of the commons right and so my near term
incentive can oftentimes be a long-term disadvantage to others or the whole so now this basis of
where my well-being and the well-being of others or the commons the delta between those
is the basis for rivalry but then dealing with that rivalry keeps increasing coordination costs
keeps you know creating disinformation systems where we can't coordinate effectively
um so how we deal with the balance sheet part there's a few things
right now for me to have access to stuff i have to mostly with a few exceptions possess the stuff
right so possession and access are coupled and if i possess something i don't have to be using it
i'm just reserving the optionality to use it the drill that sits in my garage that i might not
have used in a couple years but at least it's convenient that when i wanted it's there right
but me possessing something means that i have access to it means you don't have access to it
and so with a finite amount of stuff the more stuff you possess the less stuff i have access to
rival risk basis but we all know library type examples or shopping carts where if i have enough
shopping carts at the grocery store for peak demand time i don't have to bring my own shopping cart
which would be a pain in the ass and would require 10 000 shopping carts per grocery store rather than
300 um everybody bringing them so what matters is you having access to the shopping cart doesn't
decrease my access and we start to see a potential for this if we think about something like an uber
and then we think about self-driving uber that then has a blockchain that disintermediates it
being a central company and being a commonwealth resource where those where you having access to
it doesn't decrease my access so we're not rival risk anymore but then we take the next step and say
if you having access to transportation then also allows you to go to the maker's studio that you
have access to to the science studio to the educational places to the art studios where you
then have more access to be creative but the things that you create you aren't creating for you to
get more money and get ahead because you already have access to all the things that you want and
you don't differentiate yourself by getting stuff you differentiate yourself by the things
that you offer because you already have access to stuff so there's a fundamentally different
motive structure then you having access to more resources creates a richer commons that I have
access to so now we go from rival risk not just to non-rival risk which is uncoupled
but anti-rival risk meaning you getting ahead necessarily equals me getting ahead
and so when we look at getting out of the Malthusian type dynamics part of it is
that we can actually get out of the population dynamics part of it is that we can actually
get a closed-loop materials economy with renewable energy that can continue to upcycle
and part of it is that we can utilize our resources much more effectively and much less
rivalrously where we start decoupling access from possession that'll start easily in some areas be
harder in other areas but we start in the areas that it happens and so we start getting more and
more of a situation where I want you to have access to more things because as you're more
creative then I get access to more things that are the results of your creativity
so where so this is an example of removing some of the basis of rivalry associated with
balance sheets okay I can go to sex underneath that now if you want me to you should go where
is most natural to take the conversation okay I will just try to follow
and the problem is if you go to sex directly from where you are you are describing the value let's
say of prostitution which is that people do not have to make a commitment to asexual partner
many people can have the same sexual partner you start to get into all of these very funny areas
where status for example is a very weird commodity do I want you to have more status
because somehow that will give me more status do I stop caring about status if there is exactly one
parcel of land which has a unequivocally the best view is that something that I want you to have
rather than me having it yeah so
let's talk about status for a moment
if I'm comparing you and me in terms of who has more dollars or who's taller or who can run faster
or some I can compare us on the same metric right now and if status is number of followers on Twitter
then whatever Kim Kardashian's most interesting human being that's ever lived and so I think we
know that reductionist metrics on status are also gamified and inappropriate but if we say like
MC Escher or Dolly like what was more brilliant art I think it's a meaningless question
because they both offered something completely novel to the world and something meaningful
and beautiful that the neither of the other ones offered or could offer and I can't compare them
because I can't metricize them and the reduction of that's the thing is I can't reduce totally
unique things to a fungible metric so one of the problems I think is actually fungibility and metric
reduction and so if you have status associated with unique things that you offer to the world
awesome I'm not competing with you writ large for more status I'm going to people are going to have
a relationship to me for the things that I offer and those are really the people that I want to
have a relationship with me and if you're offering things to the world that people have a relationship
to you for and I see that the world is getting better as a result of what you're offering and
I have access to more a better world as a result of it I'm totally stoked on that
this is where it starts to feel not real to me and no yeah okay but let's but let's go through
this so here's why it sounds not real all right I think so do we have a slowing and technological
progress yes and you know less so in some areas than in other areas but do we still have exponentially
growing technology in terms of both cumulative amount associated with number of people in
globalization and in terms of just technologies that are still continuing to grow yes of course
we do so is it 50 years or 100 years we don't know but I really like I have to think of this
in a kind of a mythopoetic frame that's how it occurs to me is that as we as technology is empowering
our choices and we are getting something like the power of gods you have to have something like the
love and the wisdom of gods to wield that are you self-destruct and so when I think about I think
about the rapture story or the Mayan calendar or any of those stories in a metaphoric sense
as just like let's say you and I were in the Bronze Age and we had just seen a larger war than
had ever happened because there were some new better weapons and they could shoot further
distance and there were deserts where there didn't used to be deserts because we had got
new better axes and saws and had been able to cut down more trees and we just thought about and we
said we're we're still developing better weapons and we're developing better economic extraction
tools we're using our power in ways that are constructive in a narrow sense and destructive
in a larger sense but everybody is doing that this doesn't get to happen forever so this phase
defined by increasing power on all sides used in destructive ways constructive narrowly but
destructive broadly that phase comes to an end and there's something like a hard fork where
if we keep doing anything similar to that it'll come to an end cumulatively whether existential
or catastrophic more likely catastrophic right not full everything in but a lot and to be able
to have that much power and not use it in ways that destroy the system requires being actually
good stewards of power so then the whole question for me becomes how do we make a social system like
what is the the bodhisattva engineering how do we make a social system that is conditioning not
just individual humans but also collectives to do good choice making omnipositive kind of choice
making well i have to have a sense making system that can factor things like externalities ahead
of time better and that doesn't have things like multipolar traps where if anybody is doing the
fucked up thing that everybody has to do it and so i can start to think about what architectures
such a system would have to have to be able to do sense making as to what externalities would be
and be able to internalize them and where then i can actually confer resources to those right
choice making and that we're developing humans so again we think about the the education associated
with some religions bringing about less violence the education associated with some cultures bringing
about higher average cognitive capacity and being able to bring those together as much as i know
this sounds like hippie and silly i don't actually see anything other than a radical increase in
our good stewardship of power that makes it i love the idea that you think that there might be
something here but let me come back it with my and again i'm not trying to be negative i had an
experience at some point your answer requires a warp drive so we we both recognize the inexorability
of this thing and then are saying okay so what is the fundamental thing no every look i'm not
making fun of you because what you're saying is insane what i'm saying is insane and the people
who are saying the most common supposedly adult things are the craziest of us all so i at least
accept the idea that we have to be here and i want you on that branch and i want other people on
other branches because we need to fan out and start exploring at least start to care but i guess
what i what this makes me think of it was a particular moment in my life where uh one of my
closest friends um brought his father to dinner and his father was a guy who was um legendary
in the film industry and one of the things he taught his son was never let the other guy get
the first punch in and i thought wow first strike you teaching your child to strike first
nobody had ever suggested anything remotely like that in all of my upbringing i never heard
anything like this and i instantly recognized it for what it was somebody was going to parasitize
whatever i had been taught and say wow great eric's been taught self-restraint eric's been taught
to turn the other cheek to make sure that you de-escalate a conflict and goody goody
more for me your multipolar trap right okay there's a way out of it tell me i'm dying to hear it
okay so do we retrofit the system no impossible foundational axioms are all the wrong axioms
can we can we make a situation in which we can raise children quite differently yes go to see
kids who grew up in in amazonian tribe or you know some very different conditioning environment
you'll see very different types of human behavior can we change already set adults much harder not
impossible but harder um so can we could we find adults that are that would be the most likely to
be fast adopters of a new system like this and capable so both kind of at the cutting edge of
um their capacity to have abstract wide empathy and bind that to their action
and you know deeply considerate about actual cause and effect dynamics factor complexity
and work with other people well can we find the ones that are closest there and then train them
up additionally in some systems that are developed for how to do a different process of collaboration
that doesn't lead to one one way of talking about it is that when we go to command and
control hierarchy systems to get beyond the dunbar number we get diminishing returns on
collective intelligence as a as a function of the number of people which creates an incentive to
defect against that system even internal defection and so then we get a problem if we could get
collective intelligence scaling linearly we get something radically different so we get
just the number of people that are needed to be able to do something like that
train to do that and we build a civilization a full stack ground up civilization because
obviously i'm talking about not private balance sheets and private property as the dominant system
i'm also going to talk about not democracy because the nature of voting is inherently
polarizing to populations because we make propositions where both voting for it and voting
against it suck for somebody for something because they're based on theory of trade-offs where we
didn't even try to figure out what a good proposition for everybody would be in the first place so
better systems of sense making and choice making which we could get to and so let's say you have a
full stack civilization of people who are capable and oriented to implement it and you have not only
much higher quality of life for the people who are there but innovative capacity to solve certain
problems the world can't currently solve well because of no disinformation in the system and
better coordination well then that system can export solutions that other places in the world
that would normally have an enmity relationship with it actually need that they can't solve for
themselves so it can create a dependence relationship rather than an enmity relationship
and then they're like well why the fuck are you figuring out these pieces of tech and we aren't
we're like well we figured out a better social system and if you want it you're welcome to use
it we were open sourcing the technology here's how here's how it works but given that the technology
as a social technology is a social technology of how people share information and share resources
and coordinate differently it can't be weaponized because it is kind of the
solvent to weaponization itself and so any other group using it is just now that kind of social
architecture starting to spore or to scale and so yeah I think you get out of the multi-polar
trap by you don't have to win at the game of power against some external force to avoid losing at the
game of power so far if people didn't focus on militarizing they lost to whoever militarized
um and if they didn't lose to whoever militarizes because they militarized which means their culture
became a culture that supports the ideas of militarization right but if I focus on being able
to have whoever would militarize against me be able to offer them things that are particularly
valuable that are novel to a collective intelligence that can do better innovation yeah
you get out of a multi-polar trap that way I want to try
aggregating all the little bits uh that I'm getting from you and seeing whether I'm coming
anywhere close okay all right so the way I'm seeing it Daniel is the following first of all
you're going to point out to me that there are all sorts of interesting things that have not
been really effectively scaled up so your point about Buddhism and Jains and what have you it
might be possible to use this enormous and luxurious developmental period for something
radically different and that something you haven't said but I'll throw into the mix and see whether
you reject it is that man's capacity for self that is somatic eradication through fanaticism
tells you how powerful the software can be that you can teach people to die for a cause let's say
and which is obviously against genetic imperatives no it's obviously against individual genetic
imperative but the genetics doesn't work at the level of the individual it's obviously against
the somatic the assumed somatic imperatives it could actually benefit inclusive fitness I think
there's a very good reason to imagine that you actually benefit your clan if your deed is known
so I don't I don't want to get into that but fanaticism exists and maybe fungible I think the
Tamils for example probably showed us uh that fanaticism can be used at a political level
as long as you get access to children in Sri Lanka yeah okay so access to children was a key thing
I think so yeah right so the idea is that you in effect and I don't mean to put words in your
mouth one of the lessons of human history is that the develop developmental process if not used
for the traditional Darwinian imperative is available for other uses and it is
of arbitrary power yeah now I'm going to get into the ethics of it but first I just want to get
into feasibility so first of all there's an enormous you know I'm going to keep going back
to square zero if I don't get this all right first thing is you're pointing out we're not on the
efficient frontier we're screwing up everywhere we could be doing a lot better appreciate that
next point is there are a ton of different things that we haven't really looked at pushing
and we could afford to push on all of these things principle among those things is we should be using
development for something radically different and studying cultures which have an intrinsically
sort of non-rival risk ethos to them to see what have we already been able to do and then we can
engineer on top of that atoms are different than bits atoms have a some somewhat finite field to
them bits feels effectively infinite so to the extent that we can move things from atoms to bits
and not be coupled to a market system where you have this problem of that abundance creates
public goods and services which causes markets to fail but then something else succeeds in
its stead that we can start to have abundance particularly where we decouple and learn more
about recycling so that finite resources are much better appreciated for what they are
that we can get to a point where we can start to take pleasure in each other's pleasure
particularly if somebody is producing something that is extremely positive for that society I
want to see Jackie Chan given more money to make Jackie Chan films so I'm not angry about that
so now we're scaling up all of these things the things that haven't been noticed hacks this that
the other thing I like it maybe it'll buy us some time here are the things that really disturb me
about it one you don't have to grimace I mean I want to I'm not grimacing I'm smiling okay
one is the the what is the minimal level of violence and coercion needed to bring about
some of these changes so this was something that I brought up in my discussion with Peter Teal
and his in my sort of somewhat mutual framework really I learned something from him but I
tried to put my own thing back into it is take take a beautiful dream ask what the minimal
level of violence and coercion needed to accomplish it add that in as part of the cost and ask
yourself is it still beautiful so that's one of the questions that I would ask you
and then I get to the issue of certain things like lakefront property in the atomic world anyway
are valuable and unique and it becomes problematic to imagine a world in which all of our previous
experience was about competing for these things to imagine 100 percent
adherence to this new way of thinking well let's go pro-topian not utopian let's go that
there are some say which mean by pro-topian moving in the right direction all right
let's say that there are some things that are harder to make adequately abundant than other
things but there's a lot of low-hanging fruit that we can start moving and as we do it we'll get
there's good reason to think that there is a basis to do that in more areas
so in a system where when something is more scarce it is worth more then if I'm on the supply
side of that I have an incentive to manufacture artificial scarcity and to definitely prevent
abundance that would debase the value of the thing that I have in a world where we remove
the association of value and scarcity then where there are actual scarcities the goal is to engineer
the scarcity out of the system and so if we're talking about limited amount of oceanfront
then this is where we say well can we do seasteading and create a lot of oceanfront that is really
awesome where there is actually more desires just like more people are shopping at the store
then we need more shopping carts and so part of the answer is how do we actually increase the
abundance but not an exponential abundance because we're talking about also steady state
population and using and a lot of shared resources and it's that coupled with
psychologically healthier more mature people that relate to these things differently both of those
are necessary neither would be sufficient on their own well I like that a lot and I I do quite
honestly take some hope in that I'm finding that what people are now rivalrous about has changed
a lot I think over the course of my life I think millennials are much more interested in what
what experiences have you had recently rather than what have you bought and purchased recently
uh in part because the economy kind of turned against them but travel got cheap
right and so that that's been interesting to see do you believe that we have a huge
nearly universal level up in maturity and wisdom available to us through development hacking
yeah and so it is both how we develop that socially which I don't think will happen uniformly
I think will happen in pockets that become strange attractors that other groups want to then implement
once seen because they're so clearly better at both quality of life and innovation
um and how long that takes to develop widely is a while like this is a multi-generation thing
okay um I think that that would not be sufficient on its own but it's necessary
better sense making systems where we can actually solve problems without causing worse
problems which we're not historically good at is also necessary and this is both some
evolution in our epistemics and our actual processes of collective sense making and
collective coordination um
so yes I see level ups in both of those possible now I'm going to ask a very difficult question
but we have to get to it yeah in essence I've got a riff which I don't think I've said publicly
which is that the the biggest problem with discussing sexuality is is that sex is sexy
and if you have something that's central to the world that is almost impossible to talk about
yeah um it's a very strange state of affairs assume that we solve all of these problems that
don't have to do with status sex and reproduction according to your most optimistic scenario
but we have trouble over here that there's one last little pesky problem yeah does this situation
work yes now I will speak to it because as you said it is central and am I wrong about that it is
central of course okay but my speaking to it is probably going to change the comment section
of this video but so be it you know what if they don't want to come along for the ride they
I I think that the most important thing is to just try to do this I don't mean to say this
to be horrible but let's try to take some of the stupid fun at discussing sexuality by talking
about it for what it is and a central system that um has to be discussed because it is the engine
of human behavior so your brother and I had this conversation um when we met and obviously with
his background in evolutionary biology and primate mating and whatever um I was very interested in
his perspective and it took a little while but for what it's worth and let me just jump in one
second Brett were he here yeah would break the theory of selection into two pieces that would be the
stuff that follows natural selection the way we expected from Darwin and then you would break
it into a second piece which is the stuff that goes completely counterintuitive due to sexual
selection right and that division is actually part of the standard evolutionary toolkit he
does it a little bit better and a little bit differently right but that that division into
natural and sexual selection is part of the the territory and it really matters for when we think
about resource scarcity because the resources that people need to deal with the first part the
survival part are not that much right actually but the resources that people need to deal with the
mating part is more than the other guy historically which is why the guy with the 150 foot yacht
might feel bad when the 200 foot yacht pulls up well this is and let's say this is as close
you're not an evolutionary theorist I'm not but we can do our best there is a version of evolutionary
theory which states that there needs to be crisis there needs to be a function for showing that
you are better in order to keep individuals max you know sort of on that razor's edge
of performance and that mating opportunities means that there's always a crisis there's never
enough abundance because somebody with 13 homes is more desirable than somebody with
nine homes if you're just trying to figure out if there were a crisis right who would do better
right so we have to overcome that because that drives a Malthusian situation of no amount of
resource ever brings sufficiency about right and drives a fundamental rivalry which is why you
said we have to address it um so what I'm my take on this as I explored it my process with myself
has been asking okay as soon as I saw that the dynamics of this world that seemed intuitive
and natural to most of us as we kind of grew up in and were conditioned by it were self-terminating
and I said any of the things that we think of as normal I'm willing to question deeply okay and so
how do I think could I imagine a high tech civilization that doesn't implode could I imagine
a kind of enlightened planet what would life be like there all the different things conflict
emotion resources and sexuality is obviously one of the big questions and I think I think the book
sex it wrong sex it on obviously gets plenty of things wrong it's trying to make a strong
antithesis to the standard evolutionary history of homo sapiens thesis but I think there are some
key parts to it when they look at the maswa people or the canela people or people that did not have
that had a stable society that was not primarily pair bonded but had multi male multi female
dynamics it's not to say that's how humans mostly were that doesn't matter it's to say that it's a
possibility if it's within the possibility set same with buddhism I'm not saying that's how
people mostly have been sort of it doesn't have to win just needs to establish proof of concept
and then we can try to scale it up for yeah it's a positive deviant analysis for proof of concept
to then say can we make that actual is that a viable model for a new center and is that a possible
thing to make and the fact that it didn't make it through evolution so far like evolution has
a blind quality to it right where it'll make an adaptation that makes sense in the moment to
determine by something like warfare that is actually not good long term or is even self
terminating long term so the argument if it would have been a good system it would have made it
well the thing that has made it is continuing to up ratchet rival risk capacity and that itself is
going to self terminate like metaclass hacking that somehow we've hacked ourselves do a position
that we can keep surviving yeah and so one one version says that we can never escape the evolutionary
imperatives the other says we will always we have always escaped whatever our last problem was and so
we should be expected that even if there's only this sliver of hope we should exploit it to the
fullest yeah and so generally this situation happens that we have a near term incentive to pursue
some advantage but where the disadvantage of that thing might happen over a much longer term
and that's like one of the fundamental problems right the externality might show up over hundreds
or thousands of years but the benefit occurs over this year so we have to do it so we have to get
over that actually if we're affecting the world in such fundamental ways over the long term we
have to actually be factoring that into our decision-making now that's one of the minimum
requirements of a game b if it's going to exist which also means of a viable civilization at all
so when it comes to status because i think status and sexuality go largely together it's not exactly
one for one but there there's a strong correlation i was listening to you on a few podcasts and you
were talking about e-prime and talking about spinners and your kind of geometric unity and i was
just fucking loving it and i was loving even the status of like you describing theoretical physics
and mathematics well which are topics that you know so much better than i do but that i'm fascinated
by and educating the public about it and there was no like status competition impulse in me that was
like oh but wait he is being seen as smart for these things i was like wow this fucking awesome
i hope that he gets more status doing that because it's obviously good for the world
jeez i have such different intuitions about this i mean you know to be blunt about it
i didn't really talk about this stuff for ages and there was a part of me that cared about status
but this was always a part in fact i really to the extent that i think that i have anything
interesting and new it is a very uncomfortable feeling i mean i could i could show you all
sorts of cool things on you know if i came up with a new lick on the guitar i would enjoy
showing it to you this is something i feel very i have felt very uncomfortable about and there are
ways in which well it's very a part for me from the status game i i've been fascinated looking at
some of the comments where people say you know so-and-so is in it for the grift and they just want
money and this is an ego trip and i have to say the least fun part the reason i didn't do a podcast
for a long time and the reason that i i didn't commercialize this and i've left a lot of money
on the table and i i'm intending to commercialize this is that i was very uncomfortable with all
of these issues i didn't like it and i think people imagine that their first few increments
of status are fun so that getting more and more status must be awesome and i actually
don't think that that's true i think it's a little bit like wow my first my first taste of heroine
was pretty sweet i should do this all the time it goes into some completely different place
yeah so that is counter to the narrative that we're all seeking maximum status and in competition
with each other for status well i think yeah i think that there is a that is a low resolution
narrative right i think that um you know it's like it's always make fun of the fact that
evolutionarily you're crazy for sugar and the fact that they give it away for free at starbucks
you know there's some part of you that's a three-year three-year-old kid just wants to
eat as many packets of sugar as you possibly can it's not going to be a good thing right yeah
keep going sorry about that well so this the thing i think i think it's actually true that
there's a lot of status that is not really that fun this is also my experience but i think it's
also true that we can feel good about rather than bad about where someone else is doing socially well
well if we yeah i mean if we if we have a kind of love and trust and we have an idea
like you know i'm friends with andrew yang and i disagree with a bunch of his policies
but i have a feeling that he is a guy who's just earnest you know i'm knowing knowing him
socially i have the sense that it is not an ego trip for him to want to steward the country it's a
you know you're taking on a position that puts you in a life and death situation with the number
of attempts on president's lives let's say it's a very solemn responsibility and i think that in
part we want people who we feel are grounded and by the way i'm not always grounded you know so i've
i've drunk my own status um you know to excess at times but it's a very tricky thing who do i want
to have status who do i not want to have status do i trust i have a friend who is the nicest person
in the world except when he's doing well and then he becomes very difficult to deal with you know so
that like the there's the person who's fine on one glass of alcohol and you don't want them to have
three yeah so i think status as a hyper normal stimuli where in a evolutionary environment we
couldn't necessarily have more than 150 people pay attention to us yeah and now we can have a huge
number of people pay attention to us and have it metricized with likes or whatever i think it is
like sugar a hyper normal stimulus that is very hard for it not to be bad for us and we actually
have to have a very mature relationship to it and addiction of any kind any hyper normal stimulus
that decreases normal stimulus is going to end up being that bad for us i think one of the metrics
for how healthy a society is is inverse relationship to addictive dynamics that's the healthy environment
conditions people that are not prone to addiction which means have actual more authenticity of choice
because addiction compulsion writ large is less authenticity of choice and what's interesting
is the hyper normal stimulus what porn is to sex what sugar and salt in fact concentrated in a
frappuccino or a mcdonald's is to food right devoid of the actual nutrition or devoid of the
actual intimacy concentrating the proximate that betray the ultimate the originally the proximate
stimulus was tied to the ultimate and that's the the brain keeps track of the proximate and then
you can disconnect some of these like birth control disconnected sexuality from procreation right
and in the same way if there was a healthy status relationship of in a tribal environment where i
can't really lie and people really are watching me and know me if i'm thought well of it's because
i'm actually doing well by everybody and i have authentic healthy relationships as opposed to i
can signal things that aren't true and not in a and even get more status through negative signaling
about other people and things like that and get a lot of hits from it it's that is the same kind
of thing as the fast food or the porn is and so i think we have a hypo normal environment
of the healthy stimulus that actually creates a baseline well-being so most people i find that
when they go camping with their friends and they're in nature and they're actually in real
authentic human relationships they're checking their phone for dopamine hits from email or
facebook less and they're also looking opening the the fridge just blindly looking less often
because they're actually having an authentic meaningful engaging interaction but in a world
where i have a lot of isolation nuclear family home structures etc and not connected to nature
and not necessarily connected to meaningfulness that much that hypo normal environment creates
increased susceptibility to hyper normal stimuli hyper normal stimuli happen to be good for markets
because on the supply side if i want to maximize lifetime value of a customer addiction is good
for lifetime value of a customer but it is very bad for society as a whole
this i really like so if i understand you correctly
people don't i mean this actually starts to solve a puzzle i think i heard that somebody
asked matt daemon whether he enjoyed being famous and he said it was if i have the story right and
maybe somebody else forgive me if i'm wrong he said it wasn't even fun for 15 minutes and this is
the hardest thing to convey is that if you've never had any kind of status at all right that
you know i i think i said to tim ferris that you only wanted to be famous to 3000 hand chosen people
what your calls returned you know you you want to be taken seriously when you have something to
say you do not want to be universally known and that was the hardest decision in starting this
podcast was i didn't think i had another option i mean part of the point of it is to get out ideas
that i worry are not institutional you know there's no institution that's embracing these ideas
and i couldn't figure out i tried for for months is there a way to do this without
becoming part of the story right and because i think that privacy and an individual life is
so much more important and i don't believe that every time you bring something up you know it means
you should have your life ripped open and and be dissected and discussed it's very unnatural i think
what you're trying to tell me is that people think that they want to be fabulously rich they think
they want to be famous they think they want unlimited sexual access and in fact it is the
first few tastes of these things that convince them that there must be no limit to how wonderful
the world can be if only that can be mine and in fact there is something i mean it's sort of you
know like rosebud at the end of citizen k yeah those are much more like addiction than fulfillment
and addiction will give me a spike and then a crash and then because of the crash i'm more
craving something that will spike me because i feel really shitty and but then i get an erosion of
baseline over time from the effects of that and so of course the chocolate cake is going to make
me feel good in the moment but as i have a mostly chocolate cake diet my life feels shittier as i
average right as i do the integral under the curve it gets worse whereas the salad doesn't really give
me that spike but as i get healthier my baseline of pleasure throughout not just when i'm eating but
all of the time goes up because i have the capacity to engage in more interesting meaningful things and
my body doesn't hurt as much and whatever so i think the interesting thing is that it is actually
just like a healthier relationship to or a more effective relationship to pleasure is anti-addictive
but i think most of these things that people think they want are hypernormal stimuli that is
the dopaminergic part separated from the substance i don't know how much i believe this
but i like it a lot so if i understand you correctly there is a world of
pleasure i don't even want to call it pleasure i don't even know what to call it maybe it's
much more on fulfillment that we would give up that no let me say it differently what you're
really saying is we are blind to the effect that somatic pleasure and status pleasure
is crowding out fulfillment in our lives and that were we to actually understand the cost
of pleasure of rivalry that there is an individual reason to abandon somatic pleasure as the
be all and end all of how we how we grade a life i mean this is
how many how many awesome trips to vegas did i did i have is that the thing that's going to
matter most to me on my deathbed yeah i don't think it ever has
and i don't think it's ever what people would be most hopeful that they're let's give it a name
because i don't think i've ever been down this particular route let's call it deathbed mindset
for the moment just to play with it see if it works and if it doesn't work we'll we'll trash it
so people on their deathbed become focused on did i do enough for my community
do my children think well of me well i think what happens is people realize that everything
they got dies with them like all in the end it's lineage only and the way i touched the
world continues and it's not just my biologic kid no no it's also the lineage of my thoughts yeah
like memes along with genes and so i think when when we really start to think about this clearly
we recognize that this direction is self-terminating the need to get stuff from the world
that when i die it ends with me that there is actually only a kind of self-transcendence and
permanence in the way that i touch the world which does ripple ongoingly but there's also this thing
where yeah again i feel almost a little bit shy talking about it even even more than the sex
topic in some ways because uh i'm proposing that there is something like spiritual growth
i think it's it is actually necessary for civilization to make it and so people
affirming that they are these kind to themselves needy things that need stuff from the world
yeah that need other people's validation and attention and etc and living life that way
where the more of it they get what they're still getting as a self the affirmation of that sense
of self as opposed to coming from a place of wholeness and the desire and actual love for the
beauty of life and the desire to have their life be meaningful to life that my life ends but life
of the capital l doesn't end and that life starts to be central to my awareness more than my life is
and my life becomes meaningful and it's coupling to life this answers the sex question it also it
answers all the other questions but i don't think there is a there to break through to yeah and the
problem that we're having conceiving of it in your mind now again i don't think this gets us out of
all the issues that i've raised but i think it's the first point at which i start to see
that there's something really different about your perspective so just as a slow learner
if we take the kind of jurority and idea of all desire is memetic and i'm oversimplifying it but
just meaning i want what other people have and then that inexorably causes conflict and then the
conflict will inexorably cause violence i think there is statistical truth to all three of those
steps but not inexorable truth to any of them i don't only want things that other people have
i you know or that i that i learned from other people there's there there are things that are
just intrinsically fascinating to me or there are wanting for other people it is not wanting
for myself anything in particular just actually caring about wanting for other people there are
innate creative impulses where i don't actually need to see any like i have a friend who is a
savant pianist brilliant pianist and he almost never will play for anybody because his experience
of playing is so beautiful that he doesn't want to cheapen it by having somebody else hear it and
move into a performative place and it just is his own communion with music itself so i think
there is desire that emerges from our connection to life not just the social layer and then even
if you're doing something that i'm inspired by and i want to do something like that too they
don't have to create conflict i can be okay with you having something and want to share it or share
in that type of phenomena yeah okay now i'm starting to you know i have a friend for example
who's a fantastic guitarist and i noticed that when we play together uh he doesn't play at his
peak ability because he wants the pleasure of playing together yeah to to be that the thing
that we share if i was a better guitarist it would be more fun to trade things back and forth
but the danger of going out of shared experience um is far greater and so you know and i yeah i i i
know the things that you are saying are true and perhaps what i've been saying back to you could
be retranslated as the transcendent beyond the proximate somatic pleasures that we have is so
rarely experienced at scale it's not experienced at scale well little bits in religions in religion
it happens i think that in in families there are things that people don't want to share outside of
the family because they bond the family yeah and but it's just it's hard to imagine a world in which
people stop coveting their own name and lights um you know people being impressed by by their car
their yacht their house this that and the other and i think that what you're talking about not hard
for me to imagine well this is the thing i mean you know the the odd thing that i have in being
the friend and the employee of a billionaire is that i sometimes get to borrow his life yeah
and you know he's made his home available to me um in hawaii for example and it's absolutely
astounding to be in control of an asset like that i have another friend who lent me his island
year after year um but i also found that i didn't want or need that and that both of these gentlemen
that i'm referring to were much more focused on ideas than they were on fabric eggs or displaying
a Picasso or anything like that because ultimately they found they they wanted to go their association
with me was let's talk about things that might move the needle in human history rather than
do you have any idea how much this bottle of wine cost and remember i was saying earlier that i think
dominant paradigms co-opt psychology to define healthy psychology as supportive of the paradigm
so what i'm about to say in terms of what i think healthy psychology is is not the
current definition of healthy psychology right it is one that would be fit to a
to an actually viable civilization i think psychologically healthy humans are emotionally
coupled to each other so hundred percent so when you're happy i'm happy i'm stoked for you if you're
hurting i feel that i feel compassion and empathy i think the worst psychology is the inversion
of sadism where i feel joy at your pain rather than joy at your joy and pain your pain i think
there's a french expression is not sufficient that one succeed in life one's friends must also fail
yeah so that is a perfect statement of what is most wrong with the world right that's that that
is the heart of the worst part of gay may but i think jealousy is one step away from sadism
because of sadism is i feel joy at your pain jealousy is i feel pain at your joy or your success
or envy right and i don't think that is a psychologically healthy place for people i think
it is a largely we condition this because we watch movies where we celebrate when the bad guy gets
it right and we condition the fuck out of we celebrate when the bad guy gets it we celebrate
when our team wins and the other team loses so we can collectively decouple our empathy from
other human beings arbitrarily so that we can then feel good in a war supporting you know when
that type of dynamic occurs and we get conditioned that second place is the first loser and all those
types of things but this is conditioning again and conditioning of a highly neuro plastic species so
i think our intuitions are all bad if we haven't spent time really questioning these things and
then also looking at cultural outliers because i don't think any of this is inexorable is it
is it ubiquitous yes is it an inexorable no but i think what is ubiquitous is psychopathology well
daniel i think what i've gotten from our conversation is is that you've got a lot of
examples that are at the proof of concept level of things that are underexploited you've got an
observation that we're far off the efficient frontier that there's one giant overlooked
opportunity which is that we are so radically case selected that our developmental period
from age zero to 13 could be used for something radically different which i think is the the
biggest hope in your whole complex of ideas together with the idea that there are realms
beyond somatic pleasure that most of us spend our entire lives not knowing what it's like
to break through the status and wealth and security games and effectively
we have no idea what the top of maslow's hierarchy when fully realized is and that it might be possible
to at least begin the game to buy us some time to try to figure out what we would do at scale
now i still don't see any world in which we can defeat all these multipolar traps but i think what
you're really saying to me again always correct me if i'm wrong is that we could potentially
change what winning feels like and that when we do that then this prisoner's dilemmas don't look
right any longer because i no longer want to be the one who defected while you cooperated so that
i get off scott free and you wind up with a 20 year jail term and we have to remove the context
of the prisoner's dilemma as our model for the world right like actually change the nature of the
context and because that is a fundamentally and exorably rivalrous dynamic right i just i don't
think you're gonna get rid of all rivalry i just i see opportunities for decreasing it i see
opportunities for changing the culture the the the weakest part of your argument to me at this
moment and again i'm just learning about it is the need for universality with respect to this
evolution and i think that's the one part of it that i find the hardest to imagine we can actually
get done so if i have a system like a corporation where my playing by the rules fully gets me
ahead less than me defecting on the system internally and doing corporate politics or a
back and deal or whatever it is then i have the incentive to defect on the system and it doesn't
have the collective intelligence to notice it right because there's a diminishing return on
the collective intelligence of the system as a function of more scale if i could make a system
and i i will claim that we can and that there are architectures that can achieve it if we could
make a system where the collective intelligence scaled with the number of people then i would
always have more incentive to participate with it than to defect and if i did defect because
i had a head injury the system would have the intelligence to be able to notice that and deal
with it now this is the place where i'm saying the dunbar number was both care and sense making
it was a limit on both you know our values generation and our sense making to inform
choice making so if we want better systems of governance i.e better systems of choice making
we need to get both collective values generation and collective sense making down the conditioning
gives us ways to start to work with things like very different value systems but i can't have
a very different value system while still incentivizing meaning a value equation economically
where the whale is worth a lot dead and nothing alive right and i and it doesn't have adequate
sense making to even inform what good choice making for everyone so we can participate with
the system is so that'll have to take more time well i look forward to continuing our discussions
and i want to thank you very much for coming and sharing your ideas with us here on the portal
and just briefly i want to say i think that i think that you're doing this is awesome
i appreciate that you know there there are people who say we need divergent ideas and heterodox
ideas but that don't have grounded clear thinking and you know critical thinking and i think for
you to bring heterodox thinkers and have but not just agree with them but have real dialectic
conversation that is earnestly seeking to bring about better understanding is beautiful i was
really excited about that i uh i wish that i could have communicated clearer having had
better sleep last night but uh hopefully it wasn't completely unintelligible well i i traveled
i came from san francisco to do this and so i think i was probably a little off my game
particularly at the beginning but we can do this again and i just want to say uh those are incredibly
generous and kind words i'll take them to heart i'm trying to get courage myself to do a little
bit more in this space and so far i got to tell you the audience for the show has been second to
none in terms of behaving really admirably and positively on the internet i can't tell you how
much great feedback we've gotten super constructive and i hope that they will they'll embrace what
you've said in the same spirit so thanks daniel thank you you've been watching the or listening to
the portal with daniel schmockenberger and uh i've been your host eric winesign thanks for
coming through and we'll see you next time
