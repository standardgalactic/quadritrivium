any of the other systems we've had but I don't think that if we look at how the coordination
system of cells or organs inside of a body works I don't think it's capitalist or communist I think
there's a much more complex way of sharing information and provisioning resources within the
system you know this is how the famous anarchist Peter Prince Peter Kropotkin got in trouble
because I think he was like kind of an amateur naturalist and he would observe things like
ant colonies and say well look look how well the ants cooperate and of course he didn't know that
it was a haplodiploid system where sisters are more closely related to each other than to the
offspring and you had a you know a breeding queen and then effectively mimicking some kind of
body division into soma and germ where your somatic cells have no possibility of
leaving a permanent trace of themselves but for their ability to aid your germline cells that
can become a fertilized you know egg in an embryo I don't think there is an adequate
biomimicry example okay and I think there's an important reason why is I think that technology
creation is something that we don't see happen in nature anywhere else and of course animals will
use a tool but they don't evolve better tools or develop better tools the way that we develop
better tools and the distinction of technology creation or tool making as a process by which
new stuff comes to exist as opposed to evolution as a process by which new stuff comes to exist
is at the heart of a lot of the things that I think about here because I think it fundamentally
changes our thinking on like social Darwinism and why markets are kind of a viable or an
inexorable idea is if we think about evolution as a process by which new things come about
defined by mutation survival selection and then mate selection within an environmental
niche and then of course there's recursion on niche creation in in evolution we see rivalry
everywhere as you are mentioning in like biology there's a lot of really painful things to look at
and I think we've especially since Darwin modeled ourselves as apex predators
for a long time and but I think and I think that we actually even reified the theory of
markets with evolutionary biology to say that demand is like a niche and that the various
versions of a product or a service are like mutations and the company that survives because
it's able to supply the demand well those ideas and those technologies make it through and then
if there's a couple that are mutually good where merging would be good so you get a merger and
acquisition that's kind of like mate dynamics right like recombinant work dynamics and this is why
competition is good and drives innovation and same as happens in nature I think that's kind of the
way that a lot of people think about markets and relationship to evolution and I think the reason
we can't think about it that way and it also the reason why we don't see whether it's ants or
whether it sells in a body or anything why we don't see examples of the kinds of coordination
in nature that will apply to humans is I think that the development of technology both language
and social coordination technologies and physical technologies but our capacity for abstraction
and then things that increase our power via abstraction as opposed to their power increases
via some instantiated thing like a gene is a fundamentally different process because in nature
you will see rivalry you'll see obviously one if the lion catches the gazelle the gazelle dies if
the gazelle gets away the lion might die right and yet all lions and all gazelles are symbiotic
with each other meaning if there were no lions the gazelles might eat themselves to extinction if
there were no gazelles the lions might starve so there's this process by which micro rivalry
leads to macro symbiosis and both of them evolving supports each other to evolve as the
lions get a little bit faster they eat more of the slower gazelles the faster ones genes
recombine and you get faster gazelles yeah but how does I mean you know mathematically I think
the lot of ultera equations is this predator so very simple predator prey dynamics with like
let's say two species I understand how that can be stable right I don't understand that in the
presence of exponential tech I mean the okay so the first thing that I got trying to be concrete
here is that maybe something like the technology of reputation might allow us to leverage up small
group dynamics towards large group dynamics the idea that I don't have to know you to know
something about your reputation I see some hope there but then it's open to reputational warfare
I think reputation systems will be gamed I agree right with it look I I'm very obsessed
about game B yeah not because I don't understand our need for it is that I can't imagine the system
that gets us out of our nature and our nature you know rivalry abounds
within nature cooperation is found everywhere I don't see a way of getting everything towards
universal disclosure cooperation but I'm I hear you are one of the people who is
the farthest along thinking about how we might pull this off yeah and I know I told you earlier
I have to apologize for a strange night that had me not sleep so operating at low capacity so I think
I'm less clear than ideal but no I want to say a little bit more because just saying make large
groups work like small groups is like uh that doesn't help at all I want to actually say a
little bit more about how we would do that but specifically why the tool making thing is such
a big deal and why the biomimicry examples don't work because it specifically then plays into what
does have to work the mutation pressures that are happening in nature are relatively evenly
distributed across the system if we think about mutation survival selection and then
breeding selection and so you don't get a situation where one species gets a thousand x
advantage in a single quick jump independent of all the other ones right the mutation is only
going to be so big and the mutation forces that are happening on the lions are also happening on
the gazelles right so they're all experiencing gamma rays or oxidative stress or copying errors
or whatever similarly so that's one thing and then the other thing is that there's co-selective
pressures as as the lion gets a little bit faster then the gazelles end up getting faster because
the slower ones get eaten and the faster genes recombine and so because of the pair because of
the even distribution of mutation and because of the co-selective pressures there's a certain kind
of symmetry of power that happens right the gazelles get away as often or more often than the lions
get them and so you only get the situation where micro arrival leads to macro symbiosis when you
have and also the situation of metastability of an ecosystem when you have something like
a symmetry of power within the system a symmetry of power yeah if the lion's got a thousand times
more predatory in one generation they would end up eating all the gazelles and then going to their
own collapse the they get they get they increase their predate as they increase their predate of
capacity the environment increases its capacity to respond to the predate of capacity symmetrically
similarly I mean this works up to a point I mean part of the problem is is that gazelles are not
the only thing that dying on lions that lions dying on right and furthermore you know lions are not
the only even even if lions are atop some predator hierarchy one lion in 20 hyenas is not a reputation
for it's not a recipe for lion happiness so you have you have very complex dynamics with
with many species interacting and that's what I mean you have metastability of the
whole ecosystem not stability because some species will die off and other species will emerge but you
have okay an increase in orderly complexity but there is a parallelism between lion and lion
between lion and hyena between lion and gazelle right and if there wasn't you would have you
wouldn't end up having metastability you'd have something have a runaway dynamic that was unchecked
by the dynamics of the environment so basically the the forces the evolutionary forces that are
happening are happening across the whole solid the whole system and co-affecting each other
but with toolmaking toolmaking didn't occur for us with a mutation toolmaking was us consciously
understanding that this sharp rock that maybe a chimp would experientially use a sharp rock and then
use another sharp rock and realize this rock was exponentially sharper but it wouldn't understand
the abstract principle of sharpness to make sharper flint things our capacity for abstraction
leading to toolmaking like that made us increase our predatory capacity radically faster than the
environment could become resilient to our increased predative capacity and that was the beginning of
a curve that has you know started to verticalize exponentially recently but because of that tool
making we could put on clothes and go to the Arctic and become the apex predator there in a way
that the lion or the cheetah couldn't leave its environment we could we could go become the apex
predator in every environment and over hunt the environment and then when we would over hunt
environment rather than have our population come to steady state we could go move to and start over
hunting another environment and then figure out agriculture that's super different than every
other animal and so you don't have a situation anywhere in nature where like a single lion could
do that much damage to its environment but you do have a situation where a single person like a
Putin or a Trump or whatever could do massive damage because of technology to the total biosphere
you don't have a situation where a single cancer cell can propagate cancer genes instantly to the
whole system it's going to affect the cells around it which have a chance to then correct it
does a lot of corrective mechanism so the exponential tech increases our leverage so much
that if we that individuals and small groups have the capacity to influence the rest of
the human space but also the biospace in a way that nothing else has so there is no example
anywhere in biology of a system that can that has the kind of asymmetry relative to its whole
environment that we have so yeah if i understand correctly i mean the the slight adjustment i would
i would give is is that orcas get you part of the way there because they're a broadly distributed
apex predator they occur in southern northern seas they have all sorts of different strategies
the thing that that you're coupling it to which i think is very interesting
is that nobody has seen a 10 000 fold increase in orca efficiency as a predator so it may be a
we couldn't because as they start eating too many of the fish then they can't keep breeding
you know i understood that point so my my my point is that you said you were trying to
indicate that you could just keep changing your environment like your clothing becomes a micro
climate so that you're able to become the eight the polar bear is no longer the apex predator of
the arctic right and you could make the argument that the orca is not the apex predator of the
seas because we're in the seas and i think the example there is just think of an ocean trawler
with a mile long drift net and the number of fish it pulls up compared to an orca and you realize
that we can't model ourselves as apex predators that are competing with others to see who's
maximally dominant with that much power without destroying everything i think this is a very
interesting point and i think the idea that we are without precedent many of us accept
we don't know of any other species that has language ability to coordinate the way we do although
certain social species from african dogs to orcas to what have you you know are pretty
impressive in their ability to coordinate in one form or another so what i hear you is saying is
that tool use and the extended phenotype if you will to use richard darwin's concept like for
example these microphones are part of our extended phenotype because they are tools that allow us to
do something yeah okay that changes the picture and it also ends up introducing both a fundamental
thing about the problem and the solution i'd recommend tell me about the solution okay and
then tell me about the problem i want to have well which order would be better logically i just i
would love to get to the positive uplifting point of the story so
so we can say that what's particularly a primary thing that's particularly unique
adaptively about homo sapiens yeah is our capacity for tecne right our capacity for
tool and that's social tools like language and democracy and but also physical tools and they are
all abstract pattern replicators rather than instantiated pattern replicators right so memes
rather than genes so you could say that what humans selected for our genetics selected for memetics
our genetics selected for radical neuroplasticity and the capacity to have much more significant
software upgrades that could change our capacity without needing hardware upgrades
and so and i would argue that this is partly why we have such a long period of neoteny right
why we have such a long period of being totally helpless on the outside is because i'm going to
give up um on trying to get you to redefine the words that are going to cause people to have
to go to their dictionaries i think one of the one of the things that i've said about this
podcast is that um we may misspeak we may use language improperly but we should at least
play with it and invite people to look things up on their own hey i only was doing that because
i listened to the half hour thing that you said that said you're going to let people go look at
their dictionary yep so i'm breaking my own rule you're you're playing me against me i love it all
right so extended period of neoteny go on yeah so we're embryonic on the outside meaning we're
helpless for a super long time compared to anything and obviously there are some animals
like birds that are more helpless than other ones for longer periods but nothing like us but
we don't if we came hardwired how to be fit to our environment that would make any sense because
we change our environment so fast most creatures emerged evolved to fit an environmental niche
but as niche creators as significant as we are both because we moved places then you know like
this is not an evolved environment and it's not that adaptive for me to throw spears but
i do need to be good at texting so we had to come to be able to learn language whether i'm
learning english or mandarin whether i'm learning spear throwing or texting or whatever and so what
i would say is that essential to human nature is the depth of nurture capacity relative to other
species and so when i look at the thing we call human nature i look at how much i think the social
sciences don't factor that there is ubiquitous conditioning that we're doing the social science
within that is ubiquitous conditioning and there are outliers that are actually relevant that aren't
just genetic all right so if i understand you correctly and now we're going to just totally
geek out we are the most case selective of species that is that we put the largest investment into
our young we delay reproductive maturity for 12 or 13 times around the sun seems crazy
and therefore your point is we have got an unparalleled opportunity for teaching for adaptation
because we unlike the wildebeest who has to be more or less ready good to go almost from the
moment of birth minutes yeah right the idea is that we are in the luxurious position of having
a long period of development and knowledge transfer because we are more about the extended
phenotype i mean look at this anthill yeah it's pretty amazing yeah so what that tells me is i
look at some outliers on both sides of the bell curve of various dimensions of the human condition
and let's say we take buddhism for instance we have something like three millennia of 10 million
fluxing give or take people who mostly don't hurt bugs across different bioregions and across
different languages and that's really significant when we think about the inexorability of violence
in humans and then we look at say the jonja weed or some group of child soldiers where by the time
someone's a teenager they've all hacked people apart with machetes i think that the human condition
can do both of those human nature can be conditioned to do both of those but then i see that we have a
system where in general the as soon as a tribe figured out as soon as a couple tribes were
competing for resources it was generally easier to move than it was to war until we had moved
everywhere in which case it was it started making sense to war and then as soon as any tribe militarizes
every other tribe has to militarize or they lose by default and the game of power has begun in
in earnest in that way the human on human game and i think we've seen that the peaceful cultures
largely got killed by the warring cultures and the warring cultures learned from each other how
to be more successful at it and so the thing that we have now is something that has emerged
through iterations on power dynamics and it's conditioning everyone within it and then we
do all of our social studies within that and say this is human nature well so this is a very weird
place to get brought back to because i'm i'm on the escape branch of our decision tree and what
you're talking about is possible when you can do better by investing in peaceful and
kind alternatives i don't know what to what to call it exactly but nonviolent alternatives
and as soon as things become kind of steady state zero sum
you start eyeing other people as protein sources because that's the way to grow a slice
and i don't know how you get out of this in a finite world so maybe the idea is that you're
you have a concept of escape yeah that isn't physical escape i think malifas was right at the time
but wrong fundamentally where he said resources are reproducing geometrically or humans are
reproducing geometrically resources arithmetically so there's either not enough or there's not going
to be enough a certain point well he hadn't got to the point that some cultures went into
negative population amounts and lower birth rates without an imposition it's not just
china's you know one child in position that did that but we've seen birth rates low enough
in some of the nordic countries and in japan and he hadn't got to the point of seeing
the phenomena that bring that about or the ability to recycle effectively
