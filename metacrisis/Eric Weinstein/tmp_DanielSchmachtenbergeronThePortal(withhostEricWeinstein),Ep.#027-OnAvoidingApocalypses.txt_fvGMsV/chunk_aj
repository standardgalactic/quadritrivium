and natural to most of us as we kind of grew up in and were conditioned by it were self-terminating
and I said any of the things that we think of as normal I'm willing to question deeply okay and so
how do I think could I imagine a high tech civilization that doesn't implode could I imagine
a kind of enlightened planet what would life be like there all the different things conflict
emotion resources and sexuality is obviously one of the big questions and I think I think the book
sex it wrong sex it on obviously gets plenty of things wrong it's trying to make a strong
antithesis to the standard evolutionary history of homo sapiens thesis but I think there are some
key parts to it when they look at the maswa people or the canela people or people that did not have
that had a stable society that was not primarily pair bonded but had multi male multi female
dynamics it's not to say that's how humans mostly were that doesn't matter it's to say that it's a
possibility if it's within the possibility set same with buddhism I'm not saying that's how
people mostly have been sort of it doesn't have to win just needs to establish proof of concept
and then we can try to scale it up for yeah it's a positive deviant analysis for proof of concept
to then say can we make that actual is that a viable model for a new center and is that a possible
thing to make and the fact that it didn't make it through evolution so far like evolution has
a blind quality to it right where it'll make an adaptation that makes sense in the moment to
determine by something like warfare that is actually not good long term or is even self
terminating long term so the argument if it would have been a good system it would have made it
well the thing that has made it is continuing to up ratchet rival risk capacity and that itself is
going to self terminate like metaclass hacking that somehow we've hacked ourselves do a position
that we can keep surviving yeah and so one one version says that we can never escape the evolutionary
imperatives the other says we will always we have always escaped whatever our last problem was and so
we should be expected that even if there's only this sliver of hope we should exploit it to the
fullest yeah and so generally this situation happens that we have a near term incentive to pursue
some advantage but where the disadvantage of that thing might happen over a much longer term
and that's like one of the fundamental problems right the externality might show up over hundreds
or thousands of years but the benefit occurs over this year so we have to do it so we have to get
over that actually if we're affecting the world in such fundamental ways over the long term we
have to actually be factoring that into our decision-making now that's one of the minimum
requirements of a game b if it's going to exist which also means of a viable civilization at all
so when it comes to status because i think status and sexuality go largely together it's not exactly
one for one but there there's a strong correlation i was listening to you on a few podcasts and you
were talking about e-prime and talking about spinners and your kind of geometric unity and i was
just fucking loving it and i was loving even the status of like you describing theoretical physics
and mathematics well which are topics that you know so much better than i do but that i'm fascinated
by and educating the public about it and there was no like status competition impulse in me that was
like oh but wait he is being seen as smart for these things i was like wow this fucking awesome
i hope that he gets more status doing that because it's obviously good for the world
jeez i have such different intuitions about this i mean you know to be blunt about it
i didn't really talk about this stuff for ages and there was a part of me that cared about status
but this was always a part in fact i really to the extent that i think that i have anything
interesting and new it is a very uncomfortable feeling i mean i could i could show you all
sorts of cool things on you know if i came up with a new lick on the guitar i would enjoy
showing it to you this is something i feel very i have felt very uncomfortable about and there are
ways in which well it's very a part for me from the status game i i've been fascinated looking at
some of the comments where people say you know so-and-so is in it for the grift and they just want
money and this is an ego trip and i have to say the least fun part the reason i didn't do a podcast
for a long time and the reason that i i didn't commercialize this and i've left a lot of money
on the table and i i'm intending to commercialize this is that i was very uncomfortable with all
of these issues i didn't like it and i think people imagine that their first few increments
of status are fun so that getting more and more status must be awesome and i actually
don't think that that's true i think it's a little bit like wow my first my first taste of heroine
was pretty sweet i should do this all the time it goes into some completely different place
yeah so that is counter to the narrative that we're all seeking maximum status and in competition
with each other for status well i think yeah i think that there is a that is a low resolution
narrative right i think that um you know it's like it's always make fun of the fact that
evolutionarily you're crazy for sugar and the fact that they give it away for free at starbucks
you know there's some part of you that's a three-year three-year-old kid just wants to
eat as many packets of sugar as you possibly can it's not going to be a good thing right yeah
keep going sorry about that well so this the thing i think i think it's actually true that
there's a lot of status that is not really that fun this is also my experience but i think it's
also true that we can feel good about rather than bad about where someone else is doing socially well
well if we yeah i mean if we if we have a kind of love and trust and we have an idea
like you know i'm friends with andrew yang and i disagree with a bunch of his policies
but i have a feeling that he is a guy who's just earnest you know i'm knowing knowing him
socially i have the sense that it is not an ego trip for him to want to steward the country it's a
you know you're taking on a position that puts you in a life and death situation with the number
of attempts on president's lives let's say it's a very solemn responsibility and i think that in
part we want people who we feel are grounded and by the way i'm not always grounded you know so i've
i've drunk my own status um you know to excess at times but it's a very tricky thing who do i want
to have status who do i not want to have status do i trust i have a friend who is the nicest person
in the world except when he's doing well and then he becomes very difficult to deal with you know so
that like the there's the person who's fine on one glass of alcohol and you don't want them to have
three yeah so i think status as a hyper normal stimuli where in a evolutionary environment we
couldn't necessarily have more than 150 people pay attention to us yeah and now we can have a huge
number of people pay attention to us and have it metricized with likes or whatever i think it is
like sugar a hyper normal stimulus that is very hard for it not to be bad for us and we actually
have to have a very mature relationship to it and addiction of any kind any hyper normal stimulus
that decreases normal stimulus is going to end up being that bad for us i think one of the metrics
for how healthy a society is is inverse relationship to addictive dynamics that's the healthy environment
conditions people that are not prone to addiction which means have actual more authenticity of choice
because addiction compulsion writ large is less authenticity of choice and what's interesting
is the hyper normal stimulus what porn is to sex what sugar and salt in fact concentrated in a
frappuccino or a mcdonald's is to food right devoid of the actual nutrition or devoid of the
actual intimacy concentrating the proximate that betray the ultimate the originally the proximate
stimulus was tied to the ultimate and that's the the brain keeps track of the proximate and then
you can disconnect some of these like birth control disconnected sexuality from procreation right
and in the same way if there was a healthy status relationship of in a tribal environment where i
can't really lie and people really are watching me and know me if i'm thought well of it's because
i'm actually doing well by everybody and i have authentic healthy relationships as opposed to i
can signal things that aren't true and not in a and even get more status through negative signaling
about other people and things like that and get a lot of hits from it it's that is the same kind
of thing as the fast food or the porn is and so i think we have a hypo normal environment
of the healthy stimulus that actually creates a baseline well-being so most people i find that
when they go camping with their friends and they're in nature and they're actually in real
authentic human relationships they're checking their phone for dopamine hits from email or
facebook less and they're also looking opening the the fridge just blindly looking less often
because they're actually having an authentic meaningful engaging interaction but in a world
where i have a lot of isolation nuclear family home structures etc and not connected to nature
and not necessarily connected to meaningfulness that much that hypo normal environment creates
increased susceptibility to hyper normal stimuli hyper normal stimuli happen to be good for markets
because on the supply side if i want to maximize lifetime value of a customer addiction is good
for lifetime value of a customer but it is very bad for society as a whole
this i really like so if i understand you correctly
people don't i mean this actually starts to solve a puzzle i think i heard that somebody
asked matt daemon whether he enjoyed being famous and he said it was if i have the story right and
maybe somebody else forgive me if i'm wrong he said it wasn't even fun for 15 minutes and this is
the hardest thing to convey is that if you've never had any kind of status at all right that
you know i i think i said to tim ferris that you only wanted to be famous to 3000 hand chosen people
what your calls returned you know you you want to be taken seriously when you have something to
say you do not want to be universally known and that was the hardest decision in starting this
podcast was i didn't think i had another option i mean part of the point of it is to get out ideas
that i worry are not institutional you know there's no institution that's embracing these ideas
and i couldn't figure out i tried for for months is there a way to do this without
becoming part of the story right and because i think that privacy and an individual life is
so much more important and i don't believe that every time you bring something up you know it means
you should have your life ripped open and and be dissected and discussed it's very unnatural i think
what you're trying to tell me is that people think that they want to be fabulously rich they think
they want to be famous they think they want unlimited sexual access and in fact it is the
first few tastes of these things that convince them that there must be no limit to how wonderful
the world can be if only that can be mine and in fact there is something i mean it's sort of you
know like rosebud at the end of citizen k yeah those are much more like addiction than fulfillment
and addiction will give me a spike and then a crash and then because of the crash i'm more
craving something that will spike me because i feel really shitty and but then i get an erosion of
baseline over time from the effects of that and so of course the chocolate cake is going to make
me feel good in the moment but as i have a mostly chocolate cake diet my life feels shittier as i
average right as i do the integral under the curve it gets worse whereas the salad doesn't really give
me that spike but as i get healthier my baseline of pleasure throughout not just when i'm eating but
all of the time goes up because i have the capacity to engage in more interesting meaningful things and
my body doesn't hurt as much and whatever so i think the interesting thing is that it is actually
just like a healthier relationship to or a more effective relationship to pleasure is anti-addictive
but i think most of these things that people think they want are hypernormal stimuli that is
the dopaminergic part separated from the substance i don't know how much i believe this
but i like it a lot so if i understand you correctly there is a world of
pleasure i don't even want to call it pleasure i don't even know what to call it maybe it's
much more on fulfillment that we would give up that no let me say it differently what you're
really saying is we are blind to the effect that somatic pleasure and status pleasure
is crowding out fulfillment in our lives and that were we to actually understand the cost
of pleasure of rivalry that there is an individual reason to abandon somatic pleasure as the
be all and end all of how we how we grade a life i mean this is
how many how many awesome trips to vegas did i did i have is that the thing that's going to
matter most to me on my deathbed yeah i don't think it ever has
and i don't think it's ever what people would be most hopeful that they're let's give it a name
because i don't think i've ever been down this particular route let's call it deathbed mindset
for the moment just to play with it see if it works and if it doesn't work we'll we'll trash it
so people on their deathbed become focused on did i do enough for my community
do my children think well of me well i think what happens is people realize that everything
they got dies with them like all in the end it's lineage only and the way i touched the
world continues and it's not just my biologic kid no no it's also the lineage of my thoughts yeah
like memes along with genes and so i think when when we really start to think about this clearly
we recognize that this direction is self-terminating the need to get stuff from the world
that when i die it ends with me that there is actually only a kind of self-transcendence and
permanence in the way that i touch the world which does ripple ongoingly but there's also this thing
where yeah again i feel almost a little bit shy talking about it even even more than the sex
topic in some ways because uh i'm proposing that there is something like spiritual growth
i think it's it is actually necessary for civilization to make it and so people
affirming that they are these kind to themselves needy things that need stuff from the world
yeah that need other people's validation and attention and etc and living life that way
where the more of it they get what they're still getting as a self the affirmation of that sense
of self as opposed to coming from a place of wholeness and the desire and actual love for the
beauty of life and the desire to have their life be meaningful to life that my life ends but life
of the capital l doesn't end and that life starts to be central to my awareness more than my life is
and my life becomes meaningful and it's coupling to life this answers the sex question it also it
answers all the other questions but i don't think there is a there to break through to yeah and the
problem that we're having conceiving of it in your mind now again i don't think this gets us out of
all the issues that i've raised but i think it's the first point at which i start to see
that there's something really different about your perspective so just as a slow learner
if we take the kind of jurority and idea of all desire is memetic and i'm oversimplifying it but
just meaning i want what other people have and then that inexorably causes conflict and then the
conflict will inexorably cause violence i think there is statistical truth to all three of those
steps but not inexorable truth to any of them i don't only want things that other people have
i you know or that i that i learned from other people there's there there are things that are
just intrinsically fascinating to me or there are wanting for other people it is not wanting
for myself anything in particular just actually caring about wanting for other people there are
innate creative impulses where i don't actually need to see any like i have a friend who is a
savant pianist brilliant pianist and he almost never will play for anybody because his experience
of playing is so beautiful that he doesn't want to cheapen it by having somebody else hear it and
move into a performative place and it just is his own communion with music itself so i think
there is desire that emerges from our connection to life not just the social layer and then even
if you're doing something that i'm inspired by and i want to do something like that too they
don't have to create conflict i can be okay with you having something and want to share it or share
in that type of phenomena yeah okay now i'm starting to you know i have a friend for example
who's a fantastic guitarist and i noticed that when we play together uh he doesn't play at his
peak ability because he wants the pleasure of playing together yeah to to be that the thing
that we share if i was a better guitarist it would be more fun to trade things back and forth
but the danger of going out of shared experience um is far greater and so you know and i yeah i i i
know the things that you are saying are true and perhaps what i've been saying back to you could
be retranslated as the transcendent beyond the proximate somatic pleasures that we have is so
rarely experienced at scale it's not experienced at scale well little bits in religions in religion
it happens i think that in in families there are things that people don't want to share outside of
the family because they bond the family yeah and but it's just it's hard to imagine a world in which
people stop coveting their own name and lights um you know people being impressed by by their car
their yacht their house this that and the other and i think that what you're talking about not hard
for me to imagine well this is the thing i mean you know the the odd thing that i have in being
the friend and the employee of a billionaire is that i sometimes get to borrow his life yeah
and you know he's made his home available to me um in hawaii for example and it's absolutely
astounding to be in control of an asset like that i have another friend who lent me his island
year after year um but i also found that i didn't want or need that and that both of these gentlemen
that i'm referring to were much more focused on ideas than they were on fabric eggs or displaying
a Picasso or anything like that because ultimately they found they they wanted to go their association
