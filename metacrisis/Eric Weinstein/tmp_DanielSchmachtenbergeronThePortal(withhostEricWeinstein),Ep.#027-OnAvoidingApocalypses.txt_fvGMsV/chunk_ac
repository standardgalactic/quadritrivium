if you read like if you read Ellsberg's doomsday machine it is kind of lucky that we haven't
blown ourselves up because there were a lot of just mistakes that should have blown us up right
but it's really hard to build nukes right it really takes nation state level capacity and
mostly only a few nation states so they could do it yeah and this is the point is that if you only
have a few actors that have nukes everybody can monitor each other and have something like mutually
assured destruction to force an equilibrium but this is the thing about exponential tech is we
don't just get exponentially more powerful tech we get exponentially more distribution on powerful
tech Daniel I want to keep going with this but I'm going to keep slowing you down when you use
a term that may not be familiar to a sufficient number of our listeners what do you mean by exponential
tech so tech that helps us make better tech so we get a return curve on the technology so
we see this kind of exponential very famously Moore's law in computing we see this kind of
exponential rate of growth of computing power because like nuclear bombs don't actually give us
better insight into how to make nuclear bombs directly but computers give us better insight
into how to make better computers and so there are different areas of exponential tech where the
technology itself increases our capacity to make more of the technology or some underlying dynamic
where we get some exponential increases in our capacity so we can see for varying reasons exponential
increases in compute power exponential increases in certain types of biotech like specifically
things associated with like CRISPR genetic engineering gene drives nanotech and those
things all you get exponentials also because there we're dealing with things that could self-replicate
right and so a nuclear bomb is a big deal but it doesn't self-replicate but a synthetic biology
device can self-replicate or a genetically engineered thing can and so we can have exponential
growth of the effect of something and so if we if we take a look at the growth in
biotechnology capacity and we specifically look at breakthroughs like CRISPR tech
and the capacity for things like gene drives to be able to modify foundational biology well
that makes it to where by a warfare capacity like very high level by a warfare capacity
becomes much much much simpler so things that nation states used to be able to do
non-nation states are gaining the capacity to be able to do even drone tech like we had the
the first everybody who's thought about it has been like when are we going to have a really big
problem with drones and a couple years ago it was the first time in the Ukraine where a commercial
drone with a homemade thermite bomb dropped it on a munitions factory and because it hit a munitions
factory and detonated the whole thing you get a billion dollars of damage from just I mean there
can be one person doing a very simple thing in their garage without any kind of really traceable
exotic materials but we can do we can we can do much worse things than that with exponentially
increasing technological power so the main thing when I say exponential tech is just
we are getting an exponential increase in how powerful the choices we make can be
and that's a good way to think about technology as a lever on our choice making right so no
technology at all I can make different choices if I want to be violent I can hit somebody
stone tool allows me to extend my hitting capacity and hit much harder right a gun
takes that much further and an intercontinental ballistic missile takes that much further which
it's a similar type of choice to make which is solve this problem through violence extended by
a much much bigger lever and what I would say is if you look at the kind of people we have ever
been like look at the Romans look at the Sumerians look at the mines look at any kind of people
we've been and look at the distribution of ways we've made choices take any of those people and
give them exponentially more power factoring how they've used their power and they self terminate
like they don't use they're not good stewards of power and well I agree that we're not good
stewards of power I think that there is a mystery here that if we don't make eye contact with it
it's going to dog the conversation we've got a lot of missing stinger missiles I believe from the
Afghan theater during the time that we were arming the Mujahideen I don't know how many but I think
I heard that it was in the hundreds yet we didn't see a ton of use maybe you know TWA flight 800
had something to do with it maybe not we don't know it's a mysterious situation there are plenty
of reservoirs to poison people always talk about that we haven't seen that behavior it seems to me
that these terrible shootings that we experience I'm always astounded that the numbers are as low
as they are and you could make an argument that said that in general people who are not in a position
to benefit who are engaged in some sort of self terminating activity people who are planning
to go out with a with a a bang if you will are not very successful usually in doing huge amounts
of damage now that may change so like we know that from the Murrah federal building that fertilizer
is a pretty potent bomb ingredient and yet we didn't see a huge string of copycats after that
is there something in us that it is sort of capable in an act of desperation and depression
of killing tens of people that struggles to kill thousands or millions
you understand what the question I there is a mystery yeah yeah I think there's some positive
things we have going for us which is there generally tends to be an inverse correlation between
people who are really good at tech and people who want to blow things up like typically those
that people who want to blow things up mostly
don't figure out how to make really good bio weapons right and the people who are really
engaged in how to make more powerful breakthroughs in science and tech are usually engaged in some
creative enterprise where they're not oriented to blow things up that's actually like really
important I think that's going well for us I think that depends upon certain social things
staying in place that we can't guarantee are going to stay in place
a relatively viable society for the people who have the technological capacities
this is something that fascinates me we seem to be very willing to destroy the lives of very
capable people these days yeah and I always wonder like are we going to be surprised when
somebody whose life we've ruined over nothing comes back at us and saying wow you really you
wrote me off and you destroyed my reputation my ability to earn a living I can't have a security
clearance I can't do what it is that I enjoy doing and now I'm on the outs I am terrified for example
then you know the famously the James DeMore situation where you start going after very
bright sort of spectromy people and you tell them that they're horrible and you ruin them publicly
that's a very bad recipe I think it is a bad recipe and and of course James DeMore is not a
particular risk but there are a lot of people who are very capable yeah who took one look at that
situation said oh so now no longer can I be can I count on getting things largely right maybe I get
some stuff wrong around the edges but no longer can I count on making interesting points and having
a job when I get up the next morning well like when you're mentioning shootings if I can just go buy
an AR-15 even if I don't know how to make one right then I can kill a lot more people than I
can with a knife right and so the that's an increase in technological capacity that can empower
someone who is psychologically damaged somehow to be able to do things they couldn't do without it
and I think as more powerful technology requires less scientific insight to be able to
modify then you're certainly going to see more of those types of dynamics increase
I think one of the other things is that when we think about the Cold War we really had two
nuclear superpowers that could be locked in mutually assured destruction because with just
two forces you kind of have an easy Nash equilibrium but as soon as you have a lot of forces and it's
more multipolar it's a much much harder thing this is the thing that terrifies me which is that
I would much rather have two very skilled hyper lethal powers
in some kind of weird community game-theoretic communication with each other than lots of
less skilled players with much less power but significant ability to do damage right
which we have now and we have increasingly so right so we went from one country with nukes at
the end of World War II to then two quickly in Cold War type dynamics to you know whatever nine
on record if you don't count where all the missing uranium from the USSR that is in whatever places
that it's in that and that we're not just talking about nukes we're talking about lots of other
things so I think I think the gist is that rivalrous type dynamics whether we're talking about
a rivalry that's a kinetic warfare like this right like a physical warfare right or an economic
warfare or an information warfare end up resulting in progressively more harm as we have more power
because the gist is if we're in some kind of warfare of whatever kind then I need to figure out some
asymmetric capacity to be able to beat you but the moment I deploy that asymmetric capacity it gets
reverse engineered by all sides and upratcheted so we get this exponential upratcheting of the
game of power itself yeah if it doesn't end the game right and and that's what we see is we see
an exponential increase in destructive capacity without a fundamental change in the basis of
how we use it so let's just look at information tech for a moment and I think this is really key
to the how we change civilization part if information about reality is a source of competitive
advantage like from I know where the water is and so but we don't think there's enough for everybody
so not only do we want to withhold that information from the other tribe we want to misinform them
as to where it is so they don't accidentally find it right you see in every competitive game
whether it's a poker bluff or a football game where you fake one way and go the other way
a incentive to disinform right and as we start having exponential information tech so we can
intentionally disinform specific audiences in ways that are much more believable to them so
you talk about russia conjugation russia conjugation is do you want to I don't know that we've talked
about it too much on this program you do a great job with it I since you're going to take it somewhere
when do you say a little bit of what it is I can disinform without even lying yeah right I can
formally lie but I can also just make someone more likely to interpret something in a particular
way by couching a question or couching an idea in a way that's likely to bring a reaction so you
gave I think a great example of if I talk about illegal aliens the problem of illegal aliens versus
um the need for amnesty for migrant workers undocumented undocumented workers then just the
nature of the wording choice on the exact same reality evokes very different kinds of sensibilities
and people so they'll vote differently they'll poll differently so it's pretty easy to influence
what people think and how they feel through of course lying but also through not just lying
but sharing partial data so the preponderance of data gives them a sense of things it is other than
it really is and through things like russia conjugation where we're really just kind of hijacking
their limbic system a very fun very funny one is the use of the democrat party where you emphasize
the word rat rather than saying the democratic party and so it's great fun for republicans to say
yes the democrat con you know it's like whoa that doesn't sound good um and yet it's a defensible
position what are you talking about it's just the way I say it right um okay so plausible
deniability on engaging in a kind of narrative warfare right and it's supposed to be that we're
both on team usa right working together to make the best country possible maybe in rivalry with
other countries but hopefully even in some kind of economic trade prosperous relationship right
but we're obviously not both on team usa we're actually engaged in really dreadful zero sum
dynamics with each other while intentionally confusing and misinforming the public and
increasing animosity even towards the point of civil conflict for some game theoretic win for our
team and we see that that's not just true with republican and democrat but even like multiple
intelligence agencies it should be sharing intelligence perfectly with each other but
they're actually competing for who gets a larger percentage of the black budget so they'll withhold
information and maybe even engage in internal espionage all the way it's just like corporate
politics where people aren't really making a choice in a big corporation of what's best for the
corporation as a whole they're making choices that are best for them and their boss their fealty
relationships in and then engaging in corporate politics it might actually be hurting the company
so long as they can have plausible deniability to get away with it so whenever we have perverse
incentives we're going to have some situation by which we're being incentivized by a system of
selective pressures to do certain things that may not be in the stated interests or the you know
whatever the directive is of our of our institution so the directive is to do the business of the
country but in fact you're loyal to the team that you're on because that's what brought you to this
place and it were you to lose your team inside of this internal game you couldn't really function
yeah and it's actually not even the fault of some bad people it's a fault of a system where it's like
i say okay well if i don't do that then i lose the game to the other guys that are doing that and i
actually think i'm more qualified to get that promotion than he is so this is the compromise i
have to make which is which is this is the thing we think of as politics right my brother is called
this i think he did a beautiful job describing this um he called this the personal responsibility
vortex where if you start behaving if you listen to people to say well you know even if you're
incentivized to do the wrong thing you should still do the right thing yeah brett's point was
if that becomes self-extinguishing then you'll simply be replaced by something less ethical than you
are right so it's actually incumbent upon you not to be so virtuous that you remove yourself from the
game leaving open a niche for some less scrupulous person to swoop in so this is how an unethical
system convinces ethical people to compromise their ethics to become a tool for the system
well he's so this is this this big division that's coming up which is that what we call
democracy and capitalism and the enlightenment and all of these things that we've been able
to do up until this point some people in our mutual world that might be vaguely affiliated with the
human potential movement that's the closest giant umbrella rubric that i can put over it
some percentage of those people refer to this world that we have now as game a and then there's
this hypothetical game b which might not be rivalrous and hopefully isn't self-extinguishing
and it might not be entirely market-based or maybe the markets take into better account
of things like uh resource questions and negative externalities uh are you
are you hopeful about game b is that a good way of phrasing it is there a better way of talking
about this yes and to be able to define what game b what criteria it must have
understanding the thing that is self-extinguishing in game a like let's take a couple of the examples
you just gave and go a little further because they're they were right along the lines
connected to where we were you talk about internalizing externalities right so if i
if i am figuring out how to externalize some cost of the thing that i'm doing to the commons and
so for example you're polluting as part of a furniture plant that employs lots of people
and makes something people need right so there's a real cost right it there's a cost to a whole
ecosystem into the people into the future generations it will be affected by the pollution
but i don't pay the cost and because i'm not paying the cost i get to have the profit margins
that i have if i had to pay the cost which mean i had to employ a technology that currently
exists to clean all that up and whatever that costs my business might be radically not profitable
right now so so then maybe we'll try and create a law to make it to where i can't do that pollution
but i'm not doing the pollution as a person i have some corporation that has some liability limiting
functions of any of the people within the corporation so the corporation
is breaking the law and you can't put a corporation in jail so there's a fine
but if the fine is less expensive than processing the waste would be then it's just a cost of doing
business and then the corporation will employ lobbyists to go change the law because
laws are going to be created by lobbyists that are paid for by somebody and they're going to
be created by politicians who have a campaign budget that is controlled by somebody so basically
economics has perverse incentives we try to create law to bind it but economics is deeper
in the stack of power than law is so you end up getting this legal system that is supposed to bind
the perverse economic incentive that mostly ends up legislating in in the benefit of it
so but this is a fundamental problem with the liberal democracy idea
well when things get really visual things can actually change if you start being able to point to
oh i don't know let's say uh children with malformed limbs that happened with phalidomide
the visual on that was enough to push that up the the attention stack to say hey we we got a
serious problem here and we've got to talk about this right now because the the externality of this
pharmaceutical is is horrific do you have anything better than waiting for absolutely horrendous
things with the with visuals that that hit oh yeah so you know it's funny right like
we see ads from the 50s where better living through chemistry and people are spraying
dbt on the kids to keep the mosquitoes off and then we recognize how lethal the dbt is so then
we sell it to mexico that doesn't have the law and then we buy the produce back from mexico
