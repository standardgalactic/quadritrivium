with me was let's talk about things that might move the needle in human history rather than
do you have any idea how much this bottle of wine cost and remember i was saying earlier that i think
dominant paradigms co-opt psychology to define healthy psychology as supportive of the paradigm
so what i'm about to say in terms of what i think healthy psychology is is not the
current definition of healthy psychology right it is one that would be fit to a
to an actually viable civilization i think psychologically healthy humans are emotionally
coupled to each other so hundred percent so when you're happy i'm happy i'm stoked for you if you're
hurting i feel that i feel compassion and empathy i think the worst psychology is the inversion
of sadism where i feel joy at your pain rather than joy at your joy and pain your pain i think
there's a french expression is not sufficient that one succeed in life one's friends must also fail
yeah so that is a perfect statement of what is most wrong with the world right that's that that
is the heart of the worst part of gay may but i think jealousy is one step away from sadism
because of sadism is i feel joy at your pain jealousy is i feel pain at your joy or your success
or envy right and i don't think that is a psychologically healthy place for people i think
it is a largely we condition this because we watch movies where we celebrate when the bad guy gets
it right and we condition the fuck out of we celebrate when the bad guy gets it we celebrate
when our team wins and the other team loses so we can collectively decouple our empathy from
other human beings arbitrarily so that we can then feel good in a war supporting you know when
that type of dynamic occurs and we get conditioned that second place is the first loser and all those
types of things but this is conditioning again and conditioning of a highly neuro plastic species so
i think our intuitions are all bad if we haven't spent time really questioning these things and
then also looking at cultural outliers because i don't think any of this is inexorable is it
is it ubiquitous yes is it an inexorable no but i think what is ubiquitous is psychopathology well
daniel i think what i've gotten from our conversation is is that you've got a lot of
examples that are at the proof of concept level of things that are underexploited you've got an
observation that we're far off the efficient frontier that there's one giant overlooked
opportunity which is that we are so radically case selected that our developmental period
from age zero to 13 could be used for something radically different which i think is the the
biggest hope in your whole complex of ideas together with the idea that there are realms
beyond somatic pleasure that most of us spend our entire lives not knowing what it's like
to break through the status and wealth and security games and effectively
we have no idea what the top of maslow's hierarchy when fully realized is and that it might be possible
to at least begin the game to buy us some time to try to figure out what we would do at scale
now i still don't see any world in which we can defeat all these multipolar traps but i think what
you're really saying to me again always correct me if i'm wrong is that we could potentially
change what winning feels like and that when we do that then this prisoner's dilemmas don't look
right any longer because i no longer want to be the one who defected while you cooperated so that
i get off scott free and you wind up with a 20 year jail term and we have to remove the context
of the prisoner's dilemma as our model for the world right like actually change the nature of the
context and because that is a fundamentally and exorably rivalrous dynamic right i just i don't
think you're gonna get rid of all rivalry i just i see opportunities for decreasing it i see
opportunities for changing the culture the the the weakest part of your argument to me at this
moment and again i'm just learning about it is the need for universality with respect to this
evolution and i think that's the one part of it that i find the hardest to imagine we can actually
get done so if i have a system like a corporation where my playing by the rules fully gets me
ahead less than me defecting on the system internally and doing corporate politics or a
back and deal or whatever it is then i have the incentive to defect on the system and it doesn't
have the collective intelligence to notice it right because there's a diminishing return on
the collective intelligence of the system as a function of more scale if i could make a system
and i i will claim that we can and that there are architectures that can achieve it if we could
make a system where the collective intelligence scaled with the number of people then i would
always have more incentive to participate with it than to defect and if i did defect because
i had a head injury the system would have the intelligence to be able to notice that and deal
with it now this is the place where i'm saying the dunbar number was both care and sense making
it was a limit on both you know our values generation and our sense making to inform
choice making so if we want better systems of governance i.e better systems of choice making
we need to get both collective values generation and collective sense making down the conditioning
gives us ways to start to work with things like very different value systems but i can't have
a very different value system while still incentivizing meaning a value equation economically
where the whale is worth a lot dead and nothing alive right and i and it doesn't have adequate
sense making to even inform what good choice making for everyone so we can participate with
the system is so that'll have to take more time well i look forward to continuing our discussions
and i want to thank you very much for coming and sharing your ideas with us here on the portal
and just briefly i want to say i think that i think that you're doing this is awesome
i appreciate that you know there there are people who say we need divergent ideas and heterodox
ideas but that don't have grounded clear thinking and you know critical thinking and i think for
you to bring heterodox thinkers and have but not just agree with them but have real dialectic
conversation that is earnestly seeking to bring about better understanding is beautiful i was
really excited about that i uh i wish that i could have communicated clearer having had
better sleep last night but uh hopefully it wasn't completely unintelligible well i i traveled
i came from san francisco to do this and so i think i was probably a little off my game
particularly at the beginning but we can do this again and i just want to say uh those are incredibly
generous and kind words i'll take them to heart i'm trying to get courage myself to do a little
bit more in this space and so far i got to tell you the audience for the show has been second to
none in terms of behaving really admirably and positively on the internet i can't tell you how
much great feedback we've gotten super constructive and i hope that they will they'll embrace what
you've said in the same spirit so thanks daniel thank you you've been watching the or listening to
the portal with daniel schmockenberger and uh i've been your host eric winesign thanks for
coming through and we'll see you next time
